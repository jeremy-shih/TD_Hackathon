Pizarro - Edison International","Thanks, Sam, and good afternoon, everyone. Edison International delivered excellent fourth quarter and full year results, but we faced significant challenges in December and into January of this year due to wildfires and the related legal and regulatory framework in California. Governor Brown recently referred to a new normal with respect to wildfires, and the fundamental risks this poses to our utility are top of mind at all levels of our company. I will discuss our strategy to address wildfire risk, but first let me make a brief comment on our full year results.","2017 core earnings were $4.50 per share, which were $0.18 above the midpoint of our earnings guidance range and also well above consensus EPS. These results were driven by SCE's strong operating performance and additional tax benefits during the year. The EIX holding company also had better-than-expected cost performance in the fourth quarter and this contributed to our positive overall results.","These results exclude the non-core impact of tax reform and the revised SONGS settlement. Today, the Board of Directors of Edison International declared its first quarter common stock dividend of $0.605 per share. Prior to declaring the dividend, the Board evaluated the information available, including information pertaining to the wildfires in December 2017 and the mudslides in Montecito in January 2018, and determined that the California law requirements for the declaration were met.","Wildfires pose a risk statewide, impacting the entire economy. Communities across California have been tragically affected as climate change has increased the severity and the frequency of wildfires in recent years. Long-term drought in California and forest management policies have resulted in the build-up of unmanaged vegetation. The state has nearly 130 million dead trees on approximately 9 million acres due to prolonged drought conditions and bark beetle infestation. The combination of these conditions, along with decades of more buildings being permitted and constructed in higher fire risk areas, have contributed to catastrophic wildfires, with 8 of the state's 20 most destructive wildfires having occurred in just the last three years.","This is a statewide crisis that needs a statewide solution. We are engaged with state leaders, including the Governor's office, legislative leaders and stakeholders across the economy on the solutions we believe are needed.","First and foremost is the prevention and mitigation of catastrophic wildfires with sufficient fire suppression resources, and effective policies around vegetation management, hazardous fuels reduction, and zoning regulations for residential and commercial development in high fire risk areas.","Second, our state's infrastructure must be hardened with stronger building codes in high fire risk areas. Utilities and other operators of critical infrastructure must also partner with state agencies on improved standards for climate resilient infrastructure. As we think about how we design and operate our system, we should consider that roughly a quarter of our service territory is in designated high fire risk areas.","We should evaluate the safety impacts, along with the reliability and cost tradeoffs, of steps like undergrounding more of the distribution network in selected areas, installing steel or composite poles instead of wood ones in specific locations and using further preventive public safety shutoffs of power under high-risk conditions, such as red flag warnings, which we have done selectively in the past. Third, when a catastrophic event occurs, in spite of all these efforts, we need thoughtful policies around how financial risks are allocated, including fire suppression costs and damages.","As a reminder, California's courts have held investor-owned utilities strictly liable, regardless of fault, for property damages and attorney's fees if utility equipment is found to be a substantial cause of a wildfire. This means that the utility can do everything right in the operation and maintenance of its equipment, but still be on the hook for these costs. The California courts have held utilities liable regardless of fault by applying the principle of inverse condemnation, a principle typically applicable to government, not to private entities. The assumption is that like a government entity that can pass along to its taxpayers costs and risks incurred for the public good, IOUs can socialize wildfire costs among their customers in rates. However, as many of you know, the CPUC recently denied San Diego Gas & Electric's application for cost recovery of about $380 million of costs above their insurance coverage.","We see legal, regulatory and legislative policy pathways to resolve these issues. Starting with the legal front. We recently filed a motion in our Round Fire case, a 2015 fire near Bishop, California, challenging the application of inverse condemnation.","Yesterday, we filed a motion for leave to file an amicus in the PG&E Butte Fire case also challenging the application of inverse. In the regulatory arena, we filed a joint application with PG&E for rehearing of the CPUC's decision in SDG&E's Wildfire Expense Memorandum Account, or WEMA, application. We also recently filed comments in PG&E's Butte Fire WEMA.","On legislative policy changes, in addition to the priorities I mentioned on fire prevention and suppression and improved standards for climate resiliency, we believe that the allocation of costs and financial risk must be addressed. That starts with exploring ways to reform the application of inverse condemnation with strict liability to utilities. It also includes addressing the high cost of fire suppression, which typically exceeds state budget levels each year. In addition, increasingly high premiums for wildfire insurance coverage should be a part of the discussion, as they affect parties far beyond the utility sector.","I would like to note that despite our best efforts and great sense of urgency here, all of this will take time and creates uncertainty. However, we also believe that the state will ultimately address the risks and issues surrounding wildfires and other climate change impacts, because California's ambitious environmental policies require strong, healthy utilities.","On that note, I would like to now touch on a few key trends that we continue to see, providing a strong growth engine at the utility for the foreseeable future. Last October, SCE released a white paper that outlines our blueprint for California to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution by its ambitious 2030 goal. The clean power and electrification pathway has received a great response and support from community organizations, customers, environmentalists and labor unions. As you have seen in the white paper, we estimate that, to meet the 2030 goals, California must have a robust, modern electric grid supplied by 80% carbon-free energy.","We believe California will need more than 7 million electric vehicles, and the electrification of one-third of space and water heaters in increasingly energy-efficient buildings. We continue to engage in significant outreach to key stakeholders and pursue initiatives to help the state meet California's 2030 goals.","A related initiative is the transportation electrification application that was filed in January 2017 that included $574 million of potential capital spending in two groupings; fast track projects and larger, longer-term projects, which will require more detailed consideration. Last month, the Commission approved five of the six fast track priority projects we proposed, totaling $10 million in capital spend. The Commission process continues with respect to the longer-term review projects, and we are still expecting a proposed decision in the second quarter.","Energy storage is a big component of the electric grid in our analysis. Legislation is beginning to reflect this as well. And Assembly Bill 2868, signed in 2016, added opportunities for programs and investments of an additional 500 megawatts of distribution-level energy storage systems, distributed equally among the IOUs. So, SCE's share is a 166 megawatts.","On March 1, we will file our Energy Storage Procurement and Investment Plan application, which will include AB 2868 proposals for energy storage programs and investments, in addition to the usual procurement of energy storage through other RFOs. With respect to the 2018 general rate case, we filed updated testimony on February 16 to reflect the impacts of tax reform. We have a hearing date set for March 19 to discuss this updated testimony and any comments provided by intervenors. Once that hearing is completed, we will see if the Administrative Law Judges require any other briefings before issuing a proposed decision. We cannot speculate on the timing for a proposed decision and subsequent Commission decision, but I'll say that given where we are today, we would expect the final decision before year-end.","Turning to SONGS, we announced a revised settlement that was the result of multiple mediation sessions in 2017 and January 2018 with a diverse set of parties. We weighed the reasonable range of potential outcomes and determined that this outcome is in the best interest of our customers and our shareholders. If approved by the CPUC, this settlement will eliminate further uncertainty and it will bring closure to what otherwise could have turned into very lengthy litigation after factoring in likely appeals in the absence of settlement. The revised settlement will resolve all issues under consideration in the OII and will also result in the dismissal of a federal lawsuit currently pending in the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, challenging the CPUC's authority to permit rate recovery of San Onofre costs.","Maria will provide additional information in her remarks, but in summary, our 2017 financial statements reflect the impacts of the revised settlement on our company. We will work with the other parties to complete the steps in this proceeding and we are hoping for a swift Commission decision given that all the parties involved in the mediation joined the settlement.","I would like to now touch on a few of the key non-financial metrics our Board uses in measuring our performance in delivering safe, reliable, clean and affordable electricity to our customers. While we had challenges in 2017 with some of our goals, we saw strong trends in the second half of the year and we'll work hard to meet or exceed the 2018 goals approved by our Board.","Operational and service excellence starts with safety for our workers and for our public. This has been a major priority across our company and is at the top of our core values. Our 2017 performance did not meet our expectations. For example, our rate of injuries leading to days away, on restricted duty, or transferred, known as the DART rate, remains worse than industry norms. We have dedicated additional senior leadership in this area and are focused not just on tools and processes, but much more importantly on growing the safety focus of our organization's culture.","We continued to improve in our customer service goals with residential customers, with SCE ranking in the upper second quartile among peer utilities in the most recent J.D. Power survey. We have narrowed the gap with our top-quartile peers, and first quartile appears achievable for SCE. On the business customer side, our peers continued to raise their performance, and so we have dipped into the upper third quartile. Kevin, his leadership team and our employees will continue to target top-quartile satisfaction for both our residential and business customers.","While SCE did not meet its 2017 reliability goals, the utility began implementing a three-year improvement roadmap in 2017, and the benefits realized in the second half of the year exceeded our expectations. We expect reliability to continue to improve in 2018 with a goal of achieving top-quartile performance over the next few years. SCE achieved improved cost performance in 2017. One way we measure SCE cost efficiency is controllable O&M per customer. We also track system average rates. SCE continues to reduce O&M costs and maintain the lowest system average rate among California IOUs and is on track to achieve top-quartile performance. We have plans that should help us achieve this objective over the next couple of years.","As we continue to pursue top-quartile performance across all of these operational metrics, we know that the bar will continue to be raised as we and our peer utilities take advantage of technological and analytical advances to improve outcomes. So while we have plans to achieve top-quartile performance based on current benchmarks, we know that we will need to work to push past those levels in order to keep pace.","As I look ahead to the changes that will take place in California, our utility's commitment to (15:35) to operate a safe, reliable grid, achieve environmental policy outcomes, and mitigate climate change impacts. Our customers, regulators, legislators, and shareholders can rely on our employees to deliver solutions to the many challenges facing our community, and to do that from a strong foundation of operational and service excellence.","With that, let me turn it over to Maria.","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","Thank you, Pedro, and good afternoon, everyone. My comments today will cover fourth quarter and full year results for 2017 compared to the same period a year ago, our updated capital expenditure and rate base forecasts, updates on SCE's FERC Formula Rate filing, and other financial updates for SCE and EIX.","Our fourth quarter and full year 2017 results include certain non-core charges related to the recent tax reform legislation as well as the revised SONGS settlement. I will walk through both of these in a minute, but let's begin with a look at our core earnings drivers. For the fourth quarter 2017, Edison International reported core earnings of $1.10 per share, an increase of $0.13 from the same period last year.","On the right side of slide 2, you will see that SCE had a positive $0.14 core variance for the quarter versus the prior year. This was mainly attributable to $0.11 per share of increased revenue related to the attrition mechanism in SCE's 2015 general rate case.","There were a number of changes on the expense side as well, although these were largely offsetting. SCE's operations and maintenance costs were slightly higher due to the timing of maintenance activities. Net financing costs increased a penny per share over last year and was mainly due to $0.04 of higher interest expense, partially offset by increased AFUDC earnings.","Income tax benefits were $0.05 per share higher than last year and related to increased cost of removal benefits. Finally, other costs related to property taxes and corporate expenses were $0.03 higher.","For the quarter, EIX Parent and Other had a negative $0.01 per share core earnings variance, arising from the lower tax benefits on stock-based compensation at the holding company, partially offset by improved results of $0.02 per share at our competitive businesses.","As I noted earlier, SCE and EIX results in the fourth quarter were impacted by two significant non-core items; the revised SONGS settlement and tax reform. SCE had $1.48 per share of non-core charges in the fourth quarter. This relates to a $448 million after-tax charge, or $1.38 per share, associated with the revised SONGS settlement and a $33 million charge, or $0.10 per share, related to tax reform.","EIX Parent and Other had $1.29 per share of non-core charges in the fourth quarter, largely related to tax reform. Specifically, the re-measurement of deferred taxes resulted in a $433 million expense, or $1.33 per share. We will continue to utilize our net operating losses and credits and, based on our current analysis, EIX expects to become a cash taxpayer in 2025.","Please turn to page 3. Overall, for the full year, Edison International core earnings increased $0.53 per share over prior year. This includes $0.44 per share of increased revenue related to the attrition mechanism in SCE's 2015 general rate case. Many of the earnings drivers for full year 2017 are similar to the fourth quarter, so I will only highlight two items.","At SCE, lower operation and maintenance costs contributed $0.07 per share to overall performance over prior year. Also, as we have communicated in previous quarters, EIX Parent and Other realized significant tax benefits in 2017 and the $0.17 per share increase in core earnings over the prior year is largely a result of these.","For the year ended 2017, we have not recorded a liability associated with the December wildfires. Given the preliminary stages of the investigations and the uncertainty as to the causes and potential damages associated with the fires, we cannot determine that a liability is probable or a reasonable range of possible losses that could be incurred. We will continue to update you as we have more information.","Overall, core earnings of $4.50 per share are $0.18 per share higher than the midpoint of guidance. SCE earnings are $0.15 per share higher due primarily to increased O&M savings and financing benefits and higher income tax benefits. Edison International Parent and Other losses of $0.08 per share are $0.03 per share better than guidance, largely from better operating cost performance at the holding company and our competitive businesses.","Please turn to page 4. While we continue to wait for a decision on SCE's 2018 general rate case, SCE has developed, and is executing against, a 2018 capital expenditure plan that will allow SCE to ramp up its capital spending program over the three-year GRC period, that is 2018 through 2020, to meet what is ultimately authorized in the decision, while minimizing the associated risk of unauthorized spending. As part of this, we will focus initial grid mod spending on capital that provides safety and reliability benefits, while deferring most spending that is primarily focused on integration of distributed energy resources. While we continue to present our 2019 and 2020 capital forecast at our current GRC request level, we adjusted CPUC capital expenditures in 2018 to $3.6 billion to reflect our latest planning for the year.","Additionally, we made updates throughout the forecast period for changes in FERC projects. Our total 2018 CPUC and FERC capital expenditure plan is $4.2 billion. While we wait for the outcome related to the 2018 GRC, over the long term, we continue to see SCE investing at least $4 billion per year and adding at least $2 billion per year of rate base for the foreseeable future as SCE focuses on investments in the grid and continues to be a key enabler of California's ambitious climate change policy.","Page 5 of the deck provides our rate base forecast. The CPUC rate base forecast is based on the weighted average rate base that we requested in the GRC for the forward-looking three-year period. That is, it reflects our 2018 through 2020 request-level capital expenditures. Once SCE receives a final decision in the 2018 GRC, our rate base forecast will be updated to reflect the authorized levels. At that time, we will also update our capital expenditures for 2019 and 2020. We have, however, updated our rate base forecast to reflect the impact of tax reform, changes in the latest FERC capital forecast, and additional incentive CWIP treatment for certain FERC projects.","Please turn to slide 6 where we provide our current rate base forecast, along with the impact of changes since our November update. As you can see, tax reform has little impact on our 2018 rate base, but by 2020, it increases our rate base by $400 million. This increase is mainly related to the elimination of bonus depreciation. During the fourth quarter of 2017, FERC approved incentive CWIP treatment for three additional transmission projects; Alberhill, Mesa and Eldorado-Lugo-Mohave. This incentive treatment means that we can add capital expenditures related to those projects to rate base in the year they are spent rather than waiting for the project to be placed in service. As a result, rate base is approximately $500 million higher by 2020. However, this increase is offset by reduced capital spending as a result of improved cost efficiency and revisions of project scope and schedule related to our FERC capital projects and programs.","Cost efficiencies and reduced scope account for approximately one-third of the change in capital spending. The remaining two-thirds represents a timing shift that will be added to rate base outside the forecast window. The majority of these changes are captured in the major transmission project update on slide 7.","On the subject of FERC, I would also like to provide a brief update on our current FERC Formula Rate proceeding. A key matter in that proceeding is the determination of our authorized ROE. In December 2017, the FERC ruled that the requested Formula Rate would go into effect January 1, 2018, subject to refund. This means that while we are collecting our requested ROE for FERC-related revenues during 2018, these dollars will be adjusted and refunded depending upon the final decision in our proceeding.","Our ROE request is comprised of a base return on equity of 10.3% plus the 50 basis point CAISO participation adder for a total ROE of 10.8% before individual project incentives. The weighted average of individual project incentives increases the requested ROE to the equivalent of about 11.5% based on our current capital expenditure plan.","In the December ruling, FERC also approved the 50 basis point CAISO participation adder, although I should note that the CPUC has intervened in our FERC Rate proceeding and has requested an application for rehearing on the approval of this adder.","The FERC also directed the parties to commence settlement discussions and the parties are scheduled to reconvene at FERC on May 15. Hearings will be held if the parties do not ultimately settle. We cannot speculate on the outcome of this proceeding or the timeline and will keep you updated as new information is presented.","Please turn to page 8. As I noted on our third quarter earnings call, we will not be providing 2018 earnings guidance until we receive a final decision on the general rate case. However, we have laid out a few key items on this page that you should consider as you model 2018 and beyond.","I've already discussed the majority of information on this page. However, please note under Other Items, we list some key considerations outside of the simplified rate base model. First, as Pedro touched on briefly in his comments, the market for wildfire insurance for California IOUs is becoming more strained. Availability is declining while simultaneously premiums are going up.","In late December, we notified the Commission that SCE secured $300 million of wildfire insurance for the 2018 calendar year and requested the Commission approve recovery of the associated premium of approximately $121 million. Although we believe we have a strong case for recovery, until the CPUC addresses our request, you should assume an additional $0.29 per share drag on earnings in 2018. There may also be additional insurance costs that are in excess of what we have requested in our GRC. We do not yet have information regarding the overall cost however.","Second, while we are not providing guidance for SCE, we do expect EIX Parent and Other to be an earnings drag of $0.25 to $0.30 per share for 2018. The increase in EIX Parent and Other is related to a lower tax shield as a result of the lower corporate tax rate and higher interest expense. Also included is the EPS of Edison Energy, which is expected to improve in 2018 over prior year results as we continue to work towards our goal of a run rate breakeven level of earnings by year-end 2019. Finally, we have not included any tax benefits related to share-based compensation, which was a significant factor in 2017 performance.","Please turn to page 9. On February 16, we filed updated testimony in our GRC proceeding to include the impacts of tax reform legislation on our CPUC jurisdictional revenue requirement. We are now requesting a 2018 revenue requirement of $5.534 billion, a $106 million decrease from the 2017 revenue requirement. Post-test year revenue requirements have also decreased from our prior request. Overall, we estimate this latest update will result in an approximately 3% CAGR in total rate between 2017 and 2020. We will remain focused on ways to mitigate customer rate impacts, while continuing to invest in our electric grid infrastructure.","EIX and SCE continue to maintain a strong balance sheet and significant financial flexibility. At EIX, we issued a $500 million one-year term loan in January to partially pay down our commercial paper program. At SCE, our average common equity component of total capitalization was 50% as of December 31, including the charge from the revised SONGS settlement. If approved by the CPUC, the revised settlement allows SCE to exclude the $448 million after-tax charge from its equity capitalization ratio.","As we have already discussed, tax reform results in a lower revenue requirement and lower customer rates, although rate base will increase as a result of the elimination of bonus depreciation. Considering these items and given the potential for a large capital program based on our GRC request as well as other potential investments in support of the state's clean energy objectives, we will likely see increased financing needs in the future as higher capital spending is followed by related growth in authorized rate base and earnings. We will continually assess the most cost-effective approach to financing and could consider optimizing the use of short- and long-term debt at either EIX or SCE.","We are pleased that we are able to benefit from the prudently conservative balance sheets we have maintained at both SCE and the holding company as we continue to invest in SCE.","That concludes my remarks. Ash, please open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, speakers. Our first question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith, Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey. Good afternoon. Congratulations.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Hey. Thanks, Julien.","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","Thanks, Julien.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I wanted to first follow-up on the change in the Parent drag. How are you thinking about mitigating this over time. I know you just are talking about kind of preliminary 2018 guidance here and we're already asking you how you think about it in the future. But obviously, it's a pretty meaningful move. Can you give us any thoughts on the breakdown of what exactly is in that approximately a quarter of drag and how that evolves?","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","Sure. So, I think in the past, we've said $0.015 per month. I think this looks more like $0.02 per month plus whatever Edison Energy is doing. Obviously, over time, the Edison Energy number is one that we are working towards a breakeven run rate by the end of 2019. So, that will be part of the approach to minimize that drag. And at the holding company, tax reform has had an impact on us, while we believe that from a deductibility perspective, we'll be able to allocate that expense, the fact that we just have less of a tax shield as a result of the lower tax rate is having an impact. We always look at operating cost efficiencies from the conversation we just had with them the remarks we just made that we actually benefit a little bit in the fourth quarter at the holding company from lower costs, but that will be our approach, the same one we've used at the balance of the company.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Excellent. And I wanted to follow-up on the dividend, just in terms of the comfort level that the Board obviously had in declaring the latest dividends, how do you think about that evolving as you learn more about the potential exposures here? Maybe said differently, with respect to the discrete tests that you had to evaluate the latest dividend, how do you think about potential risks of reevaluating that in subsequent quarters here?","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Julien, I'll take that. This is Pedro. I think like I said in my remarks that our Board looked at a broad range of potential negative outcomes here. I know that we're not putting out a specific estimates that we're going to have and the like, and I also recognize that a number of analysts have put out their own sets of ranges out there. But suffice it to say, we took a look at a good, broad range of potential outcomes here based on the information we have at hand. And the Board felt that \u2013 clearly very comfortable making this quarterly dividend decision. In the normal course, we always update you on dividend actions. We typically have talked about potential adjustments in annual dividend levels at the end of the year. But then we validate as a Board and do actual Board approval quarter-by-quarter. And that's, again, our normal course and that remains our normal course. So a quarter from now, we'll be having the next discussion on that quarterly dividend.","Again, we did look at a broad range of potential outcomes here. So, there would have to be some very new information that changes that range of outcomes to affect the thinking further. I think it's best way that I can frame it at this point, Julien. Does that help?","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah. Absolutely. So, you included the mudslides and the totality of the events that have occurred as best you understand it?","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","So, again, I want to stay purposefully vague here. But we did say that we looked at \u2013 we did look at the potential impacts from all these things that happened. We're not commenting on causation or the like, but the Board did take a look at that potentially of impacts from these various events. So, I think we've taken a very diligent approach as directors, in looking at a lot of ways in which under California regulations and law and that could impact the company, and felt very comfortable about the rigor behind that broad look we took.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thank you. I'll pass it on.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Thanks, Julien.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Stephen Byrd, Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Good afternoon.","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","Good afternoon.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Hi.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","I wanted to talk about fire insurance, and I think you talked a bit about this in your prepared remarks. But just, generally, as you think about the costs and availability of fire insurance, I guess, really both for you, but more broadly for your customers and for others in the region, we hear some concerns about areas becoming uninsurable or costs rising significantly. How do you see that evolving in California? And I guess, relatedly, do you see a political awareness in the legislative body in terms of the need to be thinking about this holistically?","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Yeah. This is Pedro. And I'll start this one and Maria or others may want to comment from the management team. First of all, you have the data from this insurance tranche that we purchased, as Maria described in her comments. I think it's safe to say that probably the most expensive premium we've paid for insurance ever. So, that alone is a data point on \u2013 there was availability, but at a much steeper cost than we've seen before. And as we continue to head into the market to secure different elements, different tranches of our towers, we are continuing to see a very tight market. To your point on awareness, that's frankly part of our job right now, to make sure that we are making policy makers aware and we're fully engaged on that.","I mentioned in my remarks that we are engaged with the entire community of policy makers out there from the Governor's Office through to key legislators. We're doing a lot of that jointly with our peer utilities or other groups that are, I think, aware of the issues here across the state. And again, it's part not just of a utility issue, it's part of a statewide issue here that we think that if the severity and the frequency of these fires continues to go the way it's gone over the last three years, it's just going to continue to put added pressure on the insurance market and other parts of the economy. So, we've taken it on ourselves to make sure that we are knocking on a whole lot of doors in Sacramento right now, making sure folks are aware and bringing some of ideas to the table of what reforms may be needed to solve the statewide issue. Maria or Adam Umanoff, our General Counsel, anything you'd add?","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","I would just say, Stephen, I think it's something that the regulators really need to pay attention to. When we filed our GRC, people were very appreciative of the $85 million in O&M costs that we had taken out of the system and this sort of insurance premium completely swamps that. And it does get recovered in our general rate cases, we apply for that. So, customers will ultimately bear very high costs unless and until we can make people aware of the issue.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you. Maybe just one follow-up on \u2013 physically, as we think about your utility systems, is there a lot of colocation, telecom equipment with your equipment or how do you broadly think about the degree to which there is that colocation of their telecom equipment with yours?","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","I don't know that we have a fact and figure handy right now. But I'd turn over to Kevin Payne. But short answer is, there is certainly some level of colocation across the system. Kevin, anything you would add or...?","Kevin M. Payne - Southern California Edison Co.","Yes. We've looked at the high fire areas, in particular, and usually about 70% of our facilities have colocation with other utilities.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Great.","Kevin M. Payne - Southern California Edison Co.","Is there something specific about that you're interested in or...","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","No, that's really \u2013 all I wanted to understand was the scope. I'll pass it on to others.","Kevin M. Payne - Southern California Edison Co.","Okay. Thank you.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Thanks, Stephen.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Shahr Pourreza from Guggenheim Partners. Your line is now open.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Hey, guys. My dividend question was answered. Thanks so much.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Thanks, Shahr.","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Christopher Turnure, JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good afternoon. I wanted to make sure I had a clear understanding of the role of various agencies in the Thomas Fire investigation. Is CAL FIRE definitely the lead agency there, are there any local fire departments involved? And is there any investigations pertaining directly to the mudslides that would be separate from that, that you're aware of?","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Let me pass it over to Adam Umanoff, our General Counsel, Christopher.","Adam S. Umanoff - Edison International","Hi, Christopher. You're correct, CAL FIRE is the lead fire investigation agency, as they typically are in fires where they're actively involved in suppression. Separate from CAL FIRE, we understand that the Ventura County Fire Department is conducting some level of investigation. In addition, the Safety and Enforcement Division of the California Public Utilities Commission will be conducting an investigation. Those are the investigations that we know are ongoing.","Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And how should we think about cooperation and timing with the Ventura Fire Department along with CAL FIRE for any kind of ultimate conclusion on cause here?","Adam S. Umanoff - Edison International","I wish we could give you some comfort on timing. We wish we had more comfort on timing. We don't. These investigations, historically, have taken anywhere between 12 and 18 months to complete. And I think we'd have to stick with that as a suggested timeframe. But there's really no certainty with regard to the time element of the investigations.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Adam, it's probably fair to say, it's a very much case by case based on the facts that investigators are pursuing.","Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then in terms of your legal strategy out of the gate here in the court system, is there anything that you can tell us in this early stage that might make your strategy differ from some of your peers or differ from that engaged by PG&E in the Butte Fire last year? I realize it's, obviously, still early there and you're probably limited in what you can say, but I'm curious to hear your thoughts.","Adam S. Umanoff - Edison International","Well, you're correct. It's very, very early. The investigation around cause has just commenced. So, I think it really is premature to speculate as to what the ultimate strategy will be. You will see, as we've seen in other large fires like this, an effort to coordinate before a single judge the numerous lawsuits that are brought. And in fact, there is a motion to coordinate the various lawsuits that have currently been brought in the Thomas fire. That's a procedural step to hopefully make the litigation more efficient. But that's really at the early stages as well. So, not much more we can tell at this point.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Adam, maybe I would add and I totally agree with how you framed it, and these things are really a case by case, depending on the facts of any given case. If you move up, though, to the 10,000-foot level, I think you're seeing indications that, from a policy perspective, not from an individual legal strategy for an individual case, but from policy perspective, there is a lot of good discussion and coordination with our other peer utilities in the state, and you've seen \u2013 I mentioned in my comments, we joined with PG&E in filing the application for rehearing in the San Diego WEMA case. We filed an amicus in the PG&E Butte case. So, there's a recognition that the broader themes around policy and moving beyond just inverse condemnation there, the support for a number of actions across the economy, across fire prevention and hardening infrastructure, and cost and risk allocation, those are ones where that 10,000-foot level's so important that we be aligned, and we are.","Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thank you very much, guys.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Praful Mehta Citigroup. Your line is now open.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks so much. Thanks, guys. Pedro, you made a point on the call to you mention that, all this fix around inverse condemnation is going to take some time. Just wanted to get a little bit more color on that, both from the legislative and legal side, what kind of timing are you thinking about in terms of solving inverse condemnation right now?","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","So, again, this is one, where I think we can give you a sense that it will take time, but it's very hard to pin down here's the calendar or here's pacing (44:33) items at this very early stage. But let's take it in pieces. There are legal strategies. And so, those play themselves out in individual cases. And I mentioned the Butte case for PG&E or the Round Fire case, where we made our filing, right? So, there's a track around each of those cases. They say, did you see a regulatory track, right, and I don't think that we have a clarity yet in terms of a timing for the PUC to consider the various applications for rehearing in the San Diego WEMA case or in the PG&E WEMA case activity there. So, typical \u2013 looking around they're considerate , but typical CPUC timelines certainly can be in the many months to couple of years sort of timeframe.","And then, finally, to the extent that legislative policy changes attract something that we're also looking at, that happens in cycles of legislative sessions. And so, we have a session that runs through later this year. It's a possibility of next year's session. So, I will tell you, we are certainly advocating about the sense of urgency on this and we would love to see a traction in this legislative session on some of these key pieces. But it's still early days and that's not guaranteed. As I mentioned in my comments that the deadline for bills has passed, but you can still get changes in those vehicles. So, there's certainly a possibility that as we continue to engage with legislators, we could see changes in vehicles that are available already and bills that have been filed. So, that could be a this year thing or it might take longer to help build the momentum and build the case. And that could extend into the next legislative session. So I'm sorry, I think I took a lot of airtime there to say it's too early to tell, but hopefully it gives you some color around some of the pathways.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Yeah. No, that's super helpful color. So appreciate that. And just quick follow-up on the legislative side. Is Senate Bill 819 still the right starting point? Is that what you're looking towards in terms of improving or changing or tweaking? Or is there a completely different bill? What's the approach on the legislative side, I guess?","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Ron, you want to...","Ronald Owen Nichols - Southern California Edison Co.","There are a number of bills out there. So, there really isn't any one specific bill that's been selected at this point that might be modified. There is vehicles there that can be addressed over time as the session goes on.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","And Ron, I think it's fair to say, I think, in general, the bills are addressing very specific issues and we've seen, for example, a number of bills around \u2013 dealing with residential insurance benefits and extending provisions for them and whatnot. What we are advocating for, as you can tell from our comments here, is a set of more comprehensive solutions to deal with this statewide problem across all the different elements. Now, that degree of difficulty then becomes harder because we're looking for more comprehensive pieces of action. So, that's why I'm saying it's so early days.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Understood. Again, thanks so much, guys.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Thanks, Praful.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jonathan Arnold, Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Hey, Jonathan.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi guys. Thank you for the comments on this Round Fire case on inverse condemnation, I was \u2013 as you read that earlier in the week, I was curious if you have any sense of where that is in its process. I know you filed the brief, but is there a date on which the court's set to hear it or anything like that?","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Sounds like a great question for a lawyer. Adam.","Adam S. Umanoff - Edison International","Jonathan, hi. It's Adam. The court has set a hearing date to hear our motion for April 2 and that date can slip. It's always subject to change.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And you could see either a ruling or more process after that date, just remain, wait to be seen around April 2, is that the right way to think about that?","Adam S. Umanoff - Edison International","I think that's right. A lot depends on what the trial court does. If the trial court denies the motion, there is always the opportunity for us to appeal. These issues may very well require appellate court review not be settled at the trial court level, and that would take some significant additional time.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Am I correct that in this particular case, the stage it's at, people have just asked for inverse condemnation to be applied to the utility, but the court has yet to rule on whether that should be allowed?","Adam S. Umanoff - Edison International","Yeah. That's a good way \u2013 Jonathan, that's a good way to describe it. In most of these cases, the plaintiffs allege that the standard of care that we have to comply with is strict liability arising from the application of inverse condemnation. They simply plead it, and we have to defend that or, in this case, we challenge it.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","So in the Butte fire case, the PG&E is trying to overturn a finding and, in your case, you're trying to sort of prevent one, effectively?","Adam S. Umanoff - Edison International","I can't speak to the procedural status of the Butte case. I don't believe that there has been a final determination. I know that they are challenging the application of inverse condemnation.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah. So, I guess, my question was in this case, has it also been applied or is it yet to be applied? That's \u2013 I just want to be sure on that.","Adam S. Umanoff - Edison International","It is not been yet been applied in the Round Fire case.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thank you on that. And then just, Maria, towards the end of your comments, you were talking about higher financing needs and you could look at some holdco debt or incremental debt at the utilities. You didn't specifically mention equity and, obviously, equity hasn't been part of the story at EIX, certainly, since I've been involved in covering the company. But it seems like you might have been at least floating that possibility, even though you didn't name it. Am I hearing that right or...?","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","Hi, Jonathan. I think, what I was really trying to say was that we have had a number of things that has impacted other companies as well in terms of tax reform and the like, and then we've also had some cash flow impacts from \u2013 assuming the SONGS settlement is approved, we have some cash flow impacts there as well. And we are waiting for our rate case to come and we have a number of other proceedings where we're also requesting capital. So, there is a lot out there and we're going to stay flexible in terms of how we finance that, either at EIX or at SCE, either with short-term debt or long-term debt. I think that's really all I was trying to say right now.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then just to bring it up there, in the SONGS settlement, you've asked for this last adjustment of the calculation of the equity ratio. Is settlement contingent on the Commission approving that aspect of it or what would happen if they decided there wasn't a case made for that particular element?","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","Well, certainly, the settlement \u2013 all of the parties have agreed to support all of the elements of the settlement. The CPUC is going through their process. At this point, I think, it's too early to really speculate on that.","Ronald Owen Nichols - Southern California Edison Co.","Yeah. This is Ron Nichols. I just would add to that if the settlement provides for any material modification to it has to be agreed to by the parties.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. So it might be hard for the Commission to modify that, yeah, or not, we'll have to see.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Well, thanks Jonathan.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ali Agha from SunTrust. Your line is now open.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you. Good afternoon.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Hi, Ali.","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","Hi, Ali.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hello. Maria, you had mentioned that the equity ratio at SCE was 50% at the end of the year. Can you remind us what that means in dollar terms in terms of the excess equity cushion you currently have there?","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","So, it's a 13-month average that we have to maintain at 48%. I am going to say, round numbers, it's about \u2013 was it...","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","More that $500 million.","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","It's more than $500 million. I think it's around $600 million. So I was just looking at some of the math here as we answer your question, Ali. It's around there. It's a little bit \u2013 you can't tie it down to any particular number like consistently, just because it's a 13-month average rolling calculation that we do. But it's in that ballpark.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","I see. Okay. And then, Pedro, as you mentioned that you have various forums and parts you're looking at trying to get some clarity, closure, if you will, on inverse condemnation, et cetera. Is your sense that, for full clarity to come, you need the CAL FIRE investigation to first be complete and their determination on causes? Is that sort of the critical path item? Or from the outside, how should we be looking at and keeping a track of to say, okay, this is a key element in some clarity on this process?","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Yeah. Ali, that's a good question. I think my answer is, not necessarily. I was thinking about this as separate tracks, right? So there's a track around the CAL FIRE investigation, into the Thomas Fire and causation, per se, and then what standards will be applied in terms of liability and all of that. There's this broader track around, the state has an issue, it's a big issue. Part of the issue is the concern about the application of inverse condemnation but the issue is broader than that as I mentioned earlier. And so, we're really looking for a broader statewide solution. And clearly, there's a connection between these, right? And so, if we had a very speedy resolution, and I think that would be wishing for a lot, because we would expect this will take time. Well, let's say that we had clarity upfront in terms of there's a bill that gets passed next month that resolves the application of inverse, well, then it clearly would have some impact on \u2013 once the CAL FIRE investigation concludes, that would have impact on the recourse that plaintiffs would have to get recoveries for damages.","But again, I don't think that there's a serial linkage, where we have to wait for that CAL FIRE investigation and the Thomas Fire to conclude in order to work the various other paths, regulatory, legislative paths, to try and resolve the broader statewide issue. I do see those as fairly decoupled. Does that make sense, Ali?","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","It does. And just on that, to clarify your opening remarks as well, you talked about the California state goals, et cetera. Are you getting any conversations back to suggest that there is some recognition coming that, hey, to meet our ambitious climate change and other goals, this issue is directly linked and impacting that?","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Yeah. Without getting into specific, who said whats, yes, I think that there is a recognition, and a lot of it is just driven by the goals and the math behind the goals, right? Let's just focus on the 40% greenhouse gas reduction by 2030, that goal alone \u2013 the state itself has looked at tools like electrification of transportation and building efficiency and renewables requiring a strong grid being a part of the solution \u2013 a major part of the solution. I'm glad that we had completed our analysis that lead to our clean energy white paper in the fall, because that, quite frankly, sharpened our thinking in terms of what it will take for the states to get there. And so, that says that if the state really wants to you get us 40% reduction and do it at the lowest possible cost to customers, there's just a whole lot of use of smart, modern, reliable grid that's needed to get 80% carbon-free resources, and get 7 million electric vehicles, and get a bunch of water heaters and space heaters that are electric and so on.","And so, I think folks recognize that, but it is helpful that we have voices like the Air Resources Board which has put out their plans. You had the Governor upping the state's objective to 5 million electric vehicles. We still stand by our math, which suggests that it's \u2013 a cheaper path for the state is actually more like 7 million electric vehicles. And I think, Ali, we'll see that continue to surface in various venues. One that I'll point to coming up here is the integrated resource planning process at the CPUC, which will use different scenarios and take a look at a long-term horizon for the resource mix in California. And that, I think, will once again provide more proof points for the importance of the healthy utilities.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you.

Today's call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Sam Ramraj, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Ramraj, you may begin your conference.","Sam Ramraj - Edison International","Thank you, Laurence, and welcome, everyone. Our speakers today are President and Chief Executive Officer, Pedro Pizarro; and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Maria Rigatti. Also here are other members of the management team.","Materials supporting today's call are available at www.edisoninvestor.com. These include our Form 10-Q, prepared remarks from Pedro and Maria, and the teleconference presentation. Tomorrow, we will distribute our regular business update presentation.","During this call, we will make forward-looking statements about the outlook for Edison International and its subsidiaries. Actual results could differ materially from current expectations. Important factors that could cause different results are set forth in our SEC filings. Please read these carefully. The presentation includes certain outlook assumptions, as well as a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the nearest GAAP measure. During the question-and-answer session, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up.","I will now turn the call over to Pedro.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Well, thanks, Sam, and good afternoon, everyone. Our first quarter core earnings were $0.80 per share, which was $0.31 below the first quarter last year. However, this comparison is not particularly meaningful because SCE has not received a decision in its 2018 General Rate Case. The main differences between this year and last year are the absence of tax benefits and stock option exercises that substantially boosted our first quarter results in 2017, and the incremental wildfire insurance premium expense. The implementation of the July 2017 cost of capital decision and the impact of tax reform on the parent company drag also affected earnings. Maria will cover this in more detail.","Before I move on, I want to express our continued sympathy for all those who lost loved ones and had their homes and lives impacted by the Southern California wildfires. SCE's primary focus has been on the safety and well-being of our customers, field crews, numerous first responders, and impacted communities by safely restoring power, setting up aid centers for affected communities, and contributing funds and employee volunteer hours to help with recovery.","With respect to the Southern California wildfires, a number of external agencies, including CAL FIRE, the Ventura County Fire Department, and the CPUC's Safety and Enforcement Division are investigating the potential origins and causes of the Thomas Fire. As we do in all wildfire matters, SCE is also conducting its own investigation. The investigations continue and we currently cannot predict when they will be completed.","We continue to make progress across the state on wildfire issues, including the application of inverse condemnation with strict liability. We are engaged with state leaders including the governor's office, legislative leaders, and stakeholders across the state on the solutions we believe are needed. First and foremost is the prevention and mitigation of catastrophic wildfires. Second, our state infrastructure must be hardened with stronger building codes for infrastructure and other assets such as homes in high fire risk areas. Third, when a catastrophic event occurs in spite of all of these efforts, we need thoughtful policies around how financial risks are allocated, including fire suppression costs and costs related to damages.","In order to help prevent and avoid the significant impacts of climate change and year-round wildfire seasons, the state must establish objective wildfire mitigation operating standards that meet or exceed industry best practices and are applicable to California's utilities and other critical infrastructure providers. If something goes wrong, regulators should use these clear standards when they determine if a utility properly ran its system. An updated standard of liability that considers degree of fault rather than the current standard of strict liability would ensure that there is a fair sharing of the increasing risk of climate change impacts across society.","We were heartened by the recent statement released by Governor Brown's office in conjunction with bipartisan legislative leaders. They are partnering on solutions that will make California more resilient against the impacts of natural disasters and climate change. The statement noted five key areas that they and the Joint Legislative Committee on Emergency Management will focus on to craft solutions, from updating liability rules and regulations for utilities, to enhancing prevention and mitigation efforts surrounding these events.","Since that statement, several hearings have occurred, and I am encouraged by the dialogue that we and other California IOUs are having with the legislature. As of the end of April, a number of wildfire bills passed legislative committees, including Senate Bills 819, 901, and 1088. At this stage in the legislative process, the individual bill numbers matter less than the substance. And we are fully engaged with the legislature on these issues, with a goal of achieving reforms that provide more transparency and additional efforts to mitigate catastrophic events.","While we are actively involved in the committee hearings underway, it's important to remember that implementation of solutions through a legislative process will take time and bill language can change during that process. The IOUs will continue to work with the legislature, the governor's office and key stakeholders on a comprehensive wildfire solution that addresses the issues of liability and cost recovery. This could be through existing bills or new legislative vehicles as they come up.","On the judicial pathway, we submitted a stipulation in the round fire case to extend the hearing on our motion for legal determination to June 15 in order to allow the parties to engage in confidential discussions regarding a potential resolution of the matter. Even if resolution is achieved in the round fire case, we do plan to challenge inverse condemnation and other appropriate cases including the Thomas Fire lawsuits.","On the regulatory pathway, SCE filed an application on April 3 requesting a Wildfire Expense Memorandum Account or WEMA to track certain incremental wildfire related costs. We are requesting establishment of a WEMA now because we are in the process of renewing wildfire insurance for 2018 to 2019, and anticipate that cost of this additional insurance may substantially exceed the amount currently authorized in rates or requested in our pending 2018 GRC.","In mid-April, ORA filed a protest to our motion in which we requested that the effective date of the WEMA be the date of the application. We also expect a protest from ORA by May 9, and by other parties as well, on the substantive aspects of the application. We have asked for an expedited timeline for this request and are awaiting a ruling. If our proposed schedule is accepted, a decision will be issued by August 2018.","I do want to note that we launched a webpage on edisoninvestor.com where you will be able to find certain documents and information related to the Southern California wildfires, which may be of interest to investors. We continue to believe that the state will ultimately address the risks and issues surrounding wildfires and other climate change impacts, because California's economy and ambitious environmental policies require strong healthy utilities.","Given this, I will highlight several regulatory proceedings that enable our investment to support California's 2030 goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution. In February, we discussed the final decision approving five of the six priority review projects that we proposed in our January 2017 transportation electrification filing.","On March 30, the CPUC issued a proposed decision on the standard review projects granting $208 million of our $554 million request for medium- and heavy-duty infrastructure program. The PD proposes installing make-ready infrastructure at a minimum of 700 sites to support at least 6,500 medium- or heavy-duty electric vehicles. SCE has filed comments opposing a proposed option for customer-owned charging infrastructure where the cost will be expensed by the utility provider, and advocating to remove minimum site requirements based on what we believe are incorrect cost estimates, which understate the infrastructure cost.","During the second quarter, we also plan to file a Charge Ready Phase II application. This will expand on our light-duty infrastructure pilot, which was launched in late May 2016. As of the end of March, agreements have been executed to deploy approximately 1,070 charging ports and we expect that approximately 1,250 chargers will be deployed by the time we complete the $22 million pilot.","Capital cost estimates for Charge Ready Phase II could be substantially more than our initial expectation of at least $200 million of rate base when we first envisioned the full program as SCE is currently reevaluating the scope and cost in light of the recent governor's order targeting 5 million electric vehicles by 2030, and our own estimates of 7 million vehicles needed to achieve the state's GHG goals. We will keep you updated on our progress.","On a related note, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency recently issued a determination stating that the light-duty vehicle model year 2022 to 2025 standards are not appropriate and may require revisions. This determination initiates a rulemaking process to evaluate new standards. We support strong greenhouse gas emission standards, as well as California's authority to set its own standards which have been adopted by many other states. In fact, just this morning, California announced that it is leading 16 other states and the District of Columbia in suing the U.S. EPA to preserve the nation's single vehicle emissions standard. We also believe that federal review should ultimately recognize the opportunities for infrastructure investment and job creation that are afforded by deploying electric vehicle technologies and the beneficial environmental impact of these standards.","Moving on toward 2018 General Rate Case. We are looking forward to a proposed decision from the Administrative Law Judges. We cannot speculate on the timing for a proposed decision and subsequent commission decision, but remain optimistic about getting a final decision before year-end.","With respect to SONGS, we announced a revised settlement in late January that was a result of multiple mediation sessions with a diverse set of parties. We continue to work with the other parties to complete the steps in this proceeding and are hoping for a swift commission decision approving the revised settlement, especially since all the parties actively involved in the mediation joined the settlement.","As is usual in our regulated business, we have a few key proceedings pending and we are also working for the broad set of wildfire-related issues. Throughout all this, we continue to make progress in important long-term growth areas at our utility, like our core grid investments and transportation electrification. We play a critical and necessary role that ensures safe and reliable service for our part of the world's sixth largest economy and supports California's ambitious 2030 goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution. Our company will remain focused on improving our safety culture and broader operational excellence and on delivering strong solutions to be a key enabler of our state's long-term policy vision.","With that, Maria will provide her financial report.","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","Thank you, Pedro, and good afternoon, everyone. My comments today will cover first quarter 2018 results compared to the same period a year ago and other financial updates for SCE and EIX. As a reminder, until we receive a decision on the 2018 General Rate Case, we will continue to recognize revenue from CPUC activities largely based on 2017 authorized base revenue requirements with reserves taken for known items including the cost of capital decision last year and tax reform. Also for this quarter and the rest of 2018, we plan to provide our SCE key drivers analysis at the prior combined statutory tax rate of approximately 41% for both 2018 and 2017 for comparability purposes with the incremental impact of the reduced rate reflected only in the income tax line item. Therefore, the effects of tax reform will largely be removed from the variance so that we can focus on the financial and operational drivers of the business.","Let's begin with a look at our core earnings drivers. Please turn to page 2. For the first quarter 2018, Edison International reported core earnings of $0.80 per share, a decrease of $0.31 per share from the same period last year. From the table on the right-hand side, you will see that SCE had a negative $0.19 EPS variance year-over-year. SCE revenue was not an earnings driver this quarter. CPUC revenues were down $0.02 as a result of the 2017 cost of capital decision, and this was offset by higher FERC revenues as a result of higher expenses.","On an equivalent tax rate basis, our core EPS in the first quarter was impacted by $0.15 of higher expenses year-over-year. This was due to increased costs that are above the 2017 authorized levels at which we are recognizing revenue. Additionally, the impact of the lower 2018 tax rate on the incremental expenses resulted in $0.04 of lower tax yield and this is reflected in the income tax line.","The largest driver of the higher expenses is a $0.10 negative impact from higher operation and maintenance costs. This includes a $0.06 quarterly drag from the previously disclosed $121 million wildfire insurance premium, recovery of which has yet to be approved by the CPUC. This variance reflects the 41% statutory tax rate as discussed previously.","On March 14, we filed a Z-Factor advice letter with the CPUC requesting recovery of these costs, less the FERC jurisdictional portion and the $10 million deductible required by the process. We will continue to recognize the expense related to the incremental wildfire insurance premium until we receive a decision from the CPUC regarding this filing. The additional $0.04 of higher O&M over prior year is due to higher line clearing and other maintenance expenses.","The key EPS drivers table for SCE on the right-hand side of the slide shows other smaller contributing items. For the quarter, EIX Parent and Other had a negative $0.12 per share core earnings variance, mainly arising from the absence of tax benefits related to stock-based compensation that we saw in the first quarter of 2017. As a reminder, on a consolidated basis, we had $0.13 of tax benefits in the first quarter of last year. As we discussed on the fourth quarter call, we are also seeing additional drag from the lower tax shield at the Parent. We also had $0.13 per share of noncore charges. This was largely the result of a $0.15 per share impairment charge related to the sale of SoCore Energy. The sale was completed in mid-April.","Please turn to page 3. Our SCE capital expenditures forecast has remained unchanged from last quarter. As a reminder, while 2019 and 2020 capital expenditures remains at GRC request level, SCE has developed and is executing against a 2018 capital expenditure plan that will allow SCE to ramp up its capital spending program over the three-year GRC period to meet what is ultimately authorized in the decision while minimizing the associated risk of unauthorized spending.","However, I would like to point out two developments since the last quarter that could impact our forecast in the future. First, as Pedro noted, we received a proposed decision on the transportation electrification standard review project. In total, the proposed decision granted $208 million of the $554 million request which includes both capital and O&M costs. Neither our original request nor the resulting PD have been included in our capital forecast. We expect to include the program in our forecast when the final decision is issued.","Also, we received a proposed decision on the Alberhill System Project, which denied the certificate of public convenience and necessity based on the CPUC's conclusion that the project is not needed. We continue to believe the project is needed to serve forecasted local area demand and to increase reliability and operating flexibility. Last week, SCE filed comments requesting that the CPUC deny the proposed decision as currently proposed and instead grant the certificate for the project. The Alberhill System Project is included in our capital forecast, including $175 million of spending through 2020. SCE has already incurred certain capital expenditures of which $29 million may not be recoverable if the project is cancelled. We expect to update our forecast when we get a final decision.","Page 4 of the deck provides our rate base forecast which is unchanged from last quarter. The CPUC rate based forecast is based on the weighted average rate base that we requested in the GRC for the forward looking three-year period. That is it reflects our 2018 through 2020 request level capital expenditures.","Once SCE receives a final decision in the 2018 GRC, our rate base forecast will be updated to reflect the authorized levels. At that time, we will also update our capital expenditures for 2019 and 2020.","Page 5 is a recap of various items relating to our GRC, including the impact of updates related to tax reform and is unchanged from last quarter. On page 6, you will see our financial assumptions for 2018. We have laid out a few key items on this page that you should consider as you model 2018 and beyond. As a reminder, the information we provide on this slide reflects our new combined statutory rate of approximately 28%. I would like to reiterate that we will not be providing 2018 earnings guidance until we receive a final decision on the General Rate Case.","I want to provide a few comments on other financial topics. On the subject of FERC, there has not been material updates to our Formula Rate filings since the fourth quarter. FERC has directed the parties to have settlement discussions and the parties are scheduled to reconvene at FERC on May 15. Hearings will be held if the parties do not ultimately settle. We cannot speculate on the outcome of this proceeding or the timeline and will keep you updated as new information is presented.","At SCE, our average common equity component of total capitalization was 49.7% as of March 31, including the charge from the revised SONGS settlement. If approved by the CPUC, the revised settlement allows SCE to exclude the $448 million after-tax charge from its equity capitalization ratio which would bring our ratio to 50%.","EIX and SCE have worked to maintain a strong balance sheet and create financial flexibility. We are pleased that we are able to benefit from these prudently conservative balance sheets at both the holding company and SCE as we continue to invest in utilities and work through the new pressures created by wildfire cost recovery concerns. While we await the 2018 GRC decision, comparing results with prior-year periods will be somewhat less meaningful. We expect to report a true-up in the quarter we receive a proposed decision.","That concludes my remarks. Laurence, please open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from Greg Gordon of Evercore. ISI. Your line is open.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Thanks. Good afternoon.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Hi, Greg.","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","Hi, Greg.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","So just to review \u2013 I understand \u2013 I think you were pretty clear, but I was distracted for a moment on the wildfire insurance premium costs that you've incurred for this year. You're basically amortizing that amount just on a ratable basis over four quarters, is that correct, until you know better?","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","That's correct, Greg. That's correct, Greg.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","All right. And then the second question was on the comment you just made relative to the equity ratio. Can you reiterate what you said with regard to the ability to not use the write-off against the equity ratio and what that might mean for the purposes of calculating your earnings power?","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","So 49.7% is the equity capitalization ratio with the charge included, so including the effects of the $448 million after-tax write-off. If the CPUC approves the settlement as it's written, then we would be able to, for purposes of the equity capitalization ratio, ignore that charge in that event which the equity capitalization ratio would be 50%.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Got you. Understood. And then, Pedro, can you talk me through maybe a little bit more what it is that you hope to specifically in an optimal outcome get from a legislative action here? Because we've been monitoring the process from afar, and so far the language that's been proposed in the bills doesn't really appear to be a demonstrable improvement to the current sort of uncertainty of the current framework?","And if you disagree with that, I'd love to hear your perspective on it. And if you agree with it, what do you think has to sort of improve or evolve to get to where we have a standard that prevents the PUC from using this 20\/20 hindsight prudent manager standard to effectively disallow what should be recoverable costs?","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Yeah. Greg, I think that's actually well said and I wouldn't disagree. It is very early in the game. And at this stage in the legislative process, as we look across the whole landscape of bills, the language that's being proposed, I think I even acknowledged in my remarks none of them deals squarely yet with the whole issue of reforming utility liability and the concept of inverse condemnation and strict liability.","It is early in the process. We were encouraged, as I mentioned in the remarks, by the fact that you've now had a few weeks back Governor Brown and the key legislative leaders, all come out and say that this is part of a broader issue that needs to be worked on for the state. And one of the five areas they mentioned was reforming the issue of how utilities are liable in these cases. So there isn't a vehicle today that actually has languages specific to this. There's, I think, a clear recognition in that governor and legislative leader statement that this is one of the elements that needs to be addressed. It's now May 1 and the reality is that there's a lot of time and process that takes place in Sacramento in any bill between now and the finish line.","I think that certainly the discussions that are being held in Sacramento lead me to believe and encourage me that there's good understanding and appreciation on the part of legislators of how important this piece is to the state and to utilities as enablers of a lot of what the state wants to do. But that has not yet translated into specific words on a page in a proposed bill that address the issue. I think this is something that is certainly working hard with the other utilities and other stakeholders to advocate strongly that this is something that will be really good to work on this year in this session. But I think as I said all along, it'll take time throughout the session and there might be some pieces that even spill over into the following session. At this point, though, it's just too early to comment on any one bill or what the vehicle would be that could end up getting amendments that could address the issue, and it's just something we're working and live radio every day in Sacramento.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Okay. Thank you both. Have a great day.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","You bet. Thanks, Greg. Appreciate it.","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question on the line comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey. Good afternoon.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Hi, Julien.","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","Hi, Julien.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey. So I wanted to follow up here on the conversations. I understand they may be confidential with respect to the Round Fire, but just a little bit more of the context behind why move forward on the path to settle at this point in time given some of the various avenues that this could take from an inverse condemnation perspective. Is there something that differs with respect to the Thomas Fire and others that perhaps might not be obvious at the same time?","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","No, Julien, it's a good question and I think you got it right, right at the ear. The first part of the question, there's probably not a whole lot we can offer in terms of comment. Really, what I can say and, Adam Umanoff, our General Counsel, can do clean up here, if there's anything else that he would add. But all of these are very case specific, in particular, what we believe that the concerns about the application of inverse condemnation with strict liability, that's something that's cost-cutting. And you'll see the same theme show up, I believe, in multiple cases across the various utilities, right? You're seeing it in PG&E cases. You'll see it in our cases.","The circumstances that might lead to discussions among the various parties in any given case, those are pretty case-specific. So suffice it to say that in the case of Round Fire, there's a number of parties involved. There has been interest in having discussions that could lead potentially to a mutually beneficial outcome, may or may not, is about all I can say about that one, but it made sense to ask the courts to delay the date as you saw in our comments here to see whether in this specific case, it makes sense to consider a resolution or not.","Regardless of that, again, you will see us press hard on the topic, not only legislation in Sacramento per Greg's question, but for your question, you'll see us push it hard in Court cases in any and all of these fire-related cases wherever courts are applying inverse with strict liability. That's common. But certainly, we believe that the facts in general are strong. The facts are very strong in the Round Fire case, and so it was an issue about \u2013 that's an issue about the key specifics in this particular one where it might make sense to continue some discussions with parties confidentially. And Adam's giving me the eye sign that nothing to add. Okay.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","All righty. Excellent. I'm sorry, were you going to add something?","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","No. Does that make sense?","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah. Indeed. I'll leave it there. And then secondly, if I can follow up on the WEMA side of things, can you elaborate a little bit on what is in the filing beyond insurance and how you think about that potentially over the next few years, and as well as kind of the inflation factor you're seeing on insurance as you look to gain recovery on that? And how to think about the magnitude and the potential to get recovery in future years?","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Let me kick start this one and Maria or Adam or others may want to add. We see a number of costs potentially coming down the pike, leading with new insurance costs. So that's how we thought it was prudent and timely to make the request on the WEMA case. And in that one, in our filing, we requested that the effective date be the date of filing, again because we expect that there may be decisions coming down the pike shortly around insurance that would merit having that avenue to start recording costs right away.","So that deal becomes a vehicle that provides an avenue for a broader set of potential recovery items. In terms of the insurance market, I think Maria put this up in her comments, but without commenting to any specifics, certainly the data point that you saw around the $121 million premium or the $300 million tranche that we entered in December was a strong sign that this is a market that continues to tighten, both in terms of the pricing, as you saw from that data point, as well as this general availability.","So we continue to see that headwind ahead in terms of insurance. And therefore, I have a pretty strong expectation that the costs that we see ahead of us will likely exceed anything that we put into our 2018 General Rate Case filing back before this round of wildfires. And therefore, it's prudent to have the WEMA vehicle open. Maria, Adam, anything to add?","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","So there are a few things that we included in our WEMA request, Julien, around not just the insurance claims, but \u2013 I'm sorry, the insurance premiums, rather, but also payments to satisfy claims. We also included legal expenses associated with all of that, also financing costs because as we are incurring additional costs, we might have additional financing expenses as well. So we had that as a sort of broad range of items that we included in the WEMA. As Pedro pointed out, obviously the reason we asked for the WEMA to be effective as of the date of application is because we do see insurance costs continuing to be robust and in excess of what we have requested in our pending GRC. So, we did think it was important for us to make that request of the timing as well.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Right. But what's the pace of inflation, sorry, to clarify, if you kind of look at it and layer in incremental tranches?","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","So, we're out in the market right now and that wouldn't be, I think, the best thing for us to be talking about. We still have some numbers we need to get back from carriers.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you all.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Thanks, Julien.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question on the line is from Jonathan Arnold of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good afternoon, guys.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Hi, Jonathan.","Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","So, one question I was going to ask, just a housekeeping item on the parent. Are you still expecting that kind of $0.25 to $0.30 ballpark for the year as the right zip code, and anything to say about profitability or kind of progress towards breakeven, et cetera at EEG?","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","So you'll see as you go through the slides that we provided that we have said again that $0.25 to $0.30 is parent company drag. We're still working EE towards a breakeven run rate by the end of 2019. That's pretty much included in that quarter as well, Jonathan.","Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","No change there? And then just sort of mechanically with the WEMA application as it pertains to the insurance, obviously, you started booking the additional expense. But if successful \u2013 if it's granted, would you then end up deferring the incremental additional or would that include the $300 million coverage piece that was \u2013 I guess, predated the application? Just help us understand the mechanics of, if they grant that or not.","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","Sure. So the $121 million premium that we incurred last year, towards the end of last year, that's really covered in our Z Factor filing. So that's the recovery mechanism for that. The WEMA would be the recovery mechanism for insurance premiums going forward that are incremental to what's in the GRC, as well as some of those other categories that we've requested that I mentioned in response to the earlier question.","Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Great. And then just on the question of the legislature, we've obviously seen I think probably more activity going on in the Senate. And then there was the initial statement from the Governor back, I guess, in the middle of March now, Pedro, as you referenced. Has the administration sort of continued to be engaged on this? Because when they laid it out originally, they talked about a particular committee sort of taking the lead which doesn't seem to have done much. And in the meantime, these other committees have all been kind of busily moving the bill, as you mentioned, along. I was just curious, like do you think things are going to emerge more in the Senate? Is the assembly going to come into this late in the game? And where does the administration stand in your current estimation?","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Yeah. Jonathan, I would say that all three of those bodies \u2013 the Governor's Office, the Senate, and the Assembly \u2013 are very engaged at this point. And obviously, there's roles that each play. Ultimately, any bill before becoming law needs to have Senate and Assembly versions, and it needs a signature from the Governor. And so I'll just say that I think all the relevant parties are involved. There's a sequency thing, and any one week you might see committee meetings on the Senate side and another week where you see committee meetings on the Assembly side, and discussions that take place in between but folks are engaged.","Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","So your comments about that sort of subsequent to the sort of mid-March statement, that's still the continuing dialogue?","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Yes, absolutely there is continuing dialogue. And not just with us, I mean, I think the Senate, the Assembly and the Governor's Office are talking, not just with utilities but they're talking with a lot of different parties. So remember, they're not just trying to solve the utility liability issue, they're seeking to solve the entire statewide issue, and we support that. I mean, you could \u2013 we're not just running a utility here, we're also residents of California. We want to see the state get this right. As a resident of the state, I need to see them also deal with prevention and deal with hardening of infrastructure and deal with all the things that the Governor and the legislative leaders outlined along with the utility liability piece. In the context of that, you're engaged with labor and you're engaged with environmental groups, you're engaged with their government agencies or expert in fires and forest management, and that's really critical and we see a lot of activity taking place. As with anything that involves the complexities of the legislature, and it is hard what these folks do, I can't guarantee any specific outcome but very encouraged that they are so engaged at this stage of the process.","Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And you did repeat your comments from last quarter that you could see some of this sort of still into next year, but I think I'm sensing you sound a little more upbeat than you did then perhaps, but that predated the Governor. So am I correct there?","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Jonathan, I think the best way I can answer that and probably this will be a little bit of a non-answer, but I continue to be \u2013 I think we continue to be encouraged by the level of engagement. And I think there's a lot of focus on addressing this in an urgent way. I think since our last call and seeing that statement from the Governor, they've talked about doing things urgently. At the same time, we've all been around the block and recognize this complex stuff and there's a lot of pieces to this. And from a \u2013 making sure that we're just giving our investors perspective that are right down the middle of the fairway. I'm not going to guarantee that the A, B, C and D are all going to get done in 2018 or that C might slip into 2019. It's just too early at this stage of the process to be making comments about this one feels more likely than that one. What I can tell you, and I think it's consistent with before, just this time supported by more data points three months since the last call, we continue to see data points every week of the right conversations happening and the right folks engaged.","Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Perfect. Thanks, Pedro. Appreciate it.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Yeah. Thanks, Jonathan.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question on the line is from Christopher Turnure of J.P. Morgan. Your line is now open.","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","Hello?","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Hello? Laurence, we may have lost him. You want to maybe try again?","Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Can you guys hear me?","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","Now, we can.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Now, we can.","Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","All right. Sorry about that. Maria, you had talked about the Z... [Technical Difficulty] (40:12)","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","We did lose you again in case you can hear us.","Operator","One moment. Let me get Mr. Turnure back on the line. Mr. Turnure, you may now state...","Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Sorry. Can you guys hear me?","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","Yes.","Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. So I'll try again here. The Z-Factor is the recovery method for the insurance premium from late last year and then future purchases would go through the WEMA account. Could you maybe step back, Maria, and give us a sense as to how historically insurance purchases had been recovered and what the plan is if you ultimately do not get approval for any of these premiums?","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","So historically, insurance premiums have routinely gone through our General Rate Case process. We have a program. I think you may have heard previously, typically June to June, it's part of the process. It's one of the costs that we include when we file our General Rate Case and we recover it that way. It has not been the case that \u2013 we have seen increasing wildfire insurance costs over the years, but they have been times in such a way that they fit into our General Rate Case process.","The Z-Factor filing is a process that is designed to accommodate costs that were effectively unforeseeable at the time that we filed our General Rate Case, so in this instance, a cost that was unforeseeable at the time that we filed our 2015 General Rate Case. We think it's very obvious that this cost is unforeseeable and that the impact of wildfires and climate change and increasing frequency and intensity of fires that's impacted the market and so we filed that. The process there is $10 million deductible, it's part of the FERC jurisdictional, and then the balance is requested from the CPUC. That balance was about $107 million.","The WEMA application is really about \u2013 it's effectively the Wildfire Expense Memorandum Account. That account \u2013 that process is \u2013 we've asked to establish the WEMA. We've asked it to be effective as of the date that we made the application. Doing it that way and getting approval of that timeframe would then allow us to incur additional or incremental wildfire premium costs above what's in our GRC and still be able to recover them without question around retroactive rate-making. That process \u2013 the different process in the Z-Factor, the Z-Factor is an advice letter, the WEMA application is an application.","We have been recording the premiums that we incurred last year because while we have some experience with the Z-Factor, we don't have anything that's exactly on point with this particular application. So no precedent in terms of using it, no precedent about wildfire insurance, and so you know that we have been recording the expense. It's been running through the P&L. We do think that we have very strong arguments in both the Z-Factor application and the WEMA application \u2013 the advise letter, rather, and the WEMA application that support approval of this. We'll have to go through the process to see whether or not the CPUC \u2013 when they act on it and what the answer is, of course.","Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, great. That's a very comprehensive answer. I appreciate the detail on that. My second question goes to the judge's decision in the Butte Fire case from, I think, a week or so ago. That decision kind of talked about a number of factors, but clearly the CPUC decision from late November was not enough to get a change of opinion there and it seemed to defer to, precedent from higher courts as really the thing to lean on and the judge did not want to kind of overstep his bounds there. I was wondering if you can give us any kind of legal thoughts around there and any kind of read-throughs to your processes.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Probably the short way to describe it is I think this was an expected result at the trial court level. I think it has been a view that cases like this ultimately, regardless of whether the trial court level judgment is for or against, these cases likely end up in the appellate courts. And so, in that sense, I don't think it was necessarily surprising. I think the judge in the Butte case, in the tentative ruling believe that some of the prior cases, Barham and Pac. Bell applied here. And, as you said, they didn't see the CPUC decision on the San Diego WEMA creating a distinct situation. But I think the judge is basically pointing to the appellate court system in terms of some of the fundamental arguments that PG&E laid out. And so this is, I think, just a waypoint along the road. Adam, is there anything you would add or correct in that?","Adam S. Umanoff - Edison International","I mean, one comment I'd make \u2013 it's Adam Umanoff, the General Counsel \u2013 is this judge said, listen, if it's a policy issue look to the legislature to solve the policy concern. On the constitutional claims, I'm not going to make a decision. I'm going to follow past precedent and leave it to, as Pedro said, the appellate courts to make a decision on those constitutional claims. Expected, and there's now an opportunity to appeal to an appellate court the decision of this trial judge.","Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And anything within the decision that would slow the process maybe versus your expectations going in of the appeal?","Adam S. Umanoff - Edison International","Well, there's \u2013 you typically take a writ to appeal a decision like this to an appellate court, and that writ can be granted or denied by the appellate court. One of the factors in this case is the judge asked the parties whether or not this legal question should be certified as appropriate for an appeal. We'll see what his final ruling is. But if he does that, it won't bind an appellate court to accept the appeal, but it sort of improves the likelihood that that will happen. So there's a prospect that we may at least get an appellate court to hear the issue. Uncertain. We don't know until we see this judge's order and we see what decision is taken by an appellate court to hear an appeal.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","And my layperson's understanding of that step by the judges is it's typically when you see cases being appealed, you get the party that did not prevail advancing that appeal. Here you have the judge in a sense making comments about the appropriateness or value of an appellate court considering the matter. So it's a little level of emphasis on it.","Adam S. Umanoff - Edison International","Agreed.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","That's the legal view from the guy who did not go to law school.","Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got you. And that sounds perhaps, at least directionally, better than an alternative to that.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Exactly.","Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Perfect. Okay. Thank you, guys, very much.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Shar Pourreza from Guggenheim Partners. The line is now open.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Hey. Good afternoon, guys.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Hey, Shar.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","You touched on actually most of the questions, but just real quick one on the investigation that you're sort of conducting. I understand that you obviously can't predict when it'll be completed. But sort of as you think about the process, what like phase in the process are you at? And sort of as you complete the investigation from a timing perspective, is it something you would release before CAL FIRE investigation results, or would you wait for CAL FIRE to come out prior to your conclusions?","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","There's probably not a lot we can comment on there, although on that last point, it's pretty safe to say that we would want to wait and see not only what CAL FIRE's view, but potentially the views of some of the other parties investigating the matter. But I think as a general statement, particularly in cases like this that has some complexity to them, they're all different, there isn't a cookie cutter as to the process necessarily or what the phase we're in, et cetera. Some level, still early days. We know, because we haven't seen a CAL FIRE report, that that investigation is continuing. We understand that the CPUC Safety and Enforcement Division is doing their investigation. We understand Ventura County Fire is doing theirs. We continue to look at information in terms of our investigation. So, a long-winded way of saying probably not a whole lot we can help with in terms of providing information or expectations on timing at this point, Shar, which I apologize for that, but it just is what it is.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","No, it's okay. And then I'm just going to ask one more and I'm sure you're going to not be able to answer this one. But I know the timing question around legislation has come up a little bit and...","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Yeah.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","...it's very difficult for you to sort of assess when and what legislation. But when you sort of think about the bid-ask on sort of what you guys want versus a worst-case outcome, the amendments around 1088 seems somewhat restrictive and not highly constructive. And I actually argue that some of your prepared remarks may have been a little bit more cautious than I've heard before in the past, outside of sort of mentioning the governor's bipartisan support, i.e. comments. I mean, is it \u2013 given where we are in the year, I mean, it seems very maybe unlikely that you'll see something from a legislative standpoint get enacted, and is it something that we're likely going to see into next year? I mean, this is \u2013 it's been on everyone's minds and I know it's...","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","No. I know. I know. Although, it's funny, Shar, it sounds like Jonathan was reading my comments as more optimistic and you're reading them as more conservative. So I'll get you two in a room. But no, look, the intent of the prepared remarks and, hopefully, all you hearing us answer in this live Q&A, is really down the middle of the road. It's May 1 in a session that extends to August, on a matter that's very complex and it involves not just the utility liability piece, but all the other pieces that I was mentioning earlier. I'm not trying to signal any specific read left or right here, trying to be pretty transparent about \u2013 very encouraged that folks are engaged, right?","Just to be blunt and honest about it, three months ago we probably didn't know what level of engagement we'd be seeing at this stage. So, we're seeing good engagement. We're seeing supportive comments from the governor and legislative leaders. We're seeing a lot of folks discussing this in Sacramento. That's very encouraging. It's certainly very feasible that we could have legislation in this session, that certainly could be the case.","At the same time, it's complex. It's only May. August is a long ways away. And so I also don't want to paint an overly rosy picture here because we just don't know. A lot that still needs to be worked out. There's legislators' work, not only with utilities, but all the other stakeholders that are engaged on this. So I'm sorry, I don't think I gave you any new information there other than trying to strip all the color out of it and give you a sense of just really trying to paint a picture that's down in the middle of the road.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Hey, it's worth a shot. And then just lastly on your past renewal of maintaining and supporting the dividend, can you at least confirm that maybe part of that decision could've been based on your own internal investigation or is that \u2013 it's not somewhere you want to head?","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","I think when we talked about this \u2013 the common dividend issuance in the last call, we said that our board looked at a broad range of potential negative outcomes, that we certainly had homework going on at that time. And that homework includes every scrap of information that we had at hand at that point, including that statements that folks made and our own view of investigation, our own view of, again, not just investigation in the sense of what's the expected case or what's the more likely outcome. We deliberately used the words broad range of potential negative outcomes to communicate that I think our board was not necessarily hinging on this is where the midpoint is or this is an expected outcome. They looked at a broad range that was colored by everything we knew at that point. So, that's probably about as well as I can answer that.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Thank you very much. That's helpful. Thanks, guys.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","You bet. Thanks, Shar. Take care.","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","Thank you.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Bye.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hey, guys. Thank you for taking my question.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Sure, Michael.","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","Hi, Michael.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Just curious about the balance sheet, both at the parent level and the SoCalEd level. How much incremental capital spend do you think the parent balance sheet and the SoCalEd balance sheet could take if some of these things come through, meaning the incremental hardening to protect for future wildfires and significant electrification spend, and let's say you get your rate case passed. I'm just trying to think about how much could you actually spend on the capital side and grow rate base without necessarily needing external financing up at the parent?","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","Michael, it's Maria. So I think back when we first filed the General Rate Case, the 2018 General Rate Case and we had the request out there, we did say that we were able to absorb that with the existing balance sheet. I think that as we move forward in time, we have identified a number of other opportunities and the size of which is yet to be determined, frankly, because we are still going through the process on the medium and heavy duty TE application. We only have a PD there at this point. We haven't filed our Phase II Charge Ready application yet. But as Pedro mentioned, we're looking at that and what the size of that should be in light of the Governor's order around the 5 million electric vehicles and our view of the need for 7 million electric vehicles on the light duty side going forward.","So there are a number of other opportunities out there that \u2013 and you mentioned a few as well, the hardening of the infrastructure and the response to increasing wildfire risk. We have things that we talked about in the past as well, storage opportunities and the like. All of which are in support of the climate policies in California. I think at this point in time, first we'd have to size that basket of opportunity and get PDs or final decisions on those before we could really comment on the sort of balance sheet impact that that would have, because you line them all up, there's a lot of opportunity out there. We have to see, one, where the quantum is, and then over what time period the investment would be made because that's also a pretty important factor.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Yeah. That last point, I'd just like to put an accent on that because it's, I think, easy to focus on big headline numbers in terms of potential opportunity. But a lot of these, particularly the programs that are incremental that are not included in our General Rate Case, have a rose to them, right? And it's all about helping us to get to that 20%, 30% mark on greenhouse gas reduction. So there's a longer timeline to those that can also be part of managing the equation.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","How do you think about how much in terms of \u2013 how do you think about how much potential wildfire-related costs if you start settling claims you could absorb knowing that there's likely going to be a little bit of regulatory lag before recovery would begin, before you would need incremental financing debt or equity up top at the HoldCo?","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","When we had our fourth quarter call, I think you may remember that we talked a lot about \u2013 or a little bit anyway, about sort of the balance sheet and the flexibility that we have. There is an impact, obviously, we see some reduced cash flow as a result of the SONGS settlement should be proved, and that impact as well as obviously the elimination of bonus depreciation, it has a casual impact. So there are a lot of moving pieces, Michael. I think that we would have to see what all of those pieces were and at what point in time each of them occurs back to the timing impacts. The timing differences or the timing of some of these outcomes or decisions actually does make a difference.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","It's \u2013 and I think, Maria, you said this towards the tail end of your comments of how we are seeing the benefits of having been able to approach these storms with a strong balance sheet, and so that just give us a level of flexibility as we think about those impacts that will be different if we had been \u2013 had not been a stronger balance sheet as we went into it.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. One last one. A totally different topic. There's a lot going on in California and a lot of it is related to things that would help reduce greenhouse gas emissions. And obviously, the renewable build continues unabated out there. Just curious, when do you see or when does the ISO see this potentially requiring a significant uptick again in transmission investment? It feels like the word transmission and investment are a little bit on the quiet side right now in California. But I know how the cycles work and eventually, that cycle will retake off somewhere down the road.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Yeah. That's something that the ISO, I think, will continue to study. Their last version of the transmission plan for the state, I think, acknowledged that it wasn't fully baking in the need for 50% renewables by 2030, for example. So that's homework yet to be done. So I think the short answer to that is stay tuned. At the same time, though, I think that the mix of resources we'll see across the state to serve that 2030 mark will be a very different mix from the mix we would've all guessed if we were doing this 10 years ago. It won't all just be all power, it won't all be just generation. You saw in the clean paper that SCE released end of last year that we see the state in order to meet the greenhouse gas reduction targets while at the lowest possible cost. We see it needing to rely on a pathway that's using 80% carbon-free resources, and in order to balance that which would mean a lot of renewables \u2013 not all of that 80% will be renewables but a lot of it will be. We see that needing a fair amount of storage to balance that out.","So I'll just say to point out that, whereas, if we were solving this 10 years ago, the answer would have probably been pretty quickly, it's just mix of renewables and gas-fired plants and those are all the options, and they all happen in the bulk power and you need transmission for all of them. I think in this new world we're headed into over the next decade, some of it may be that, but probably more of it will be distributed and a lot more of it will be storage than before, and that's going to alter how I think ultimately the ISO views the transmission need. So that's the long-winded version of saying, stay tuned.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. Thank you, Pedro. Thank you, Maria. Much appreciated.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Yeah. You bet, Michael.","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","Thanks, Michael.","Pedro J.

I would like to start by reflecting on the passing of SCE President Ron Nichols on June 6 after bravely battling gastric cancer. All of us lost a great leader and a great friend. Thanks to all of our investors and stakeholders who joined us and reached out in mourning his passing and celebrating Ron's life. So turning to the business at hand. Second quarter core earnings were $1.58 per share, which was $0.73 above the same period last year. The increase in core earnings was primarily due to the adoption of the 2018 GRC final decision in this quarter and timing of regulatory deferrals related to wildfire insurance and wildfire mitigation costs. Therefore, year-over-year comparisons are not particularly meaningful, but Maria will discuss our financial performance in more detail during her remarks. The final decision on our 2018 GRC authorizes a base revenue requirement of $5.1 billion for 2018 and $16.4 billion over the 2018 to 2020 period. During this period SCE's rate base growth has a compound average growth rate of 8.4%. This excludes wildfire mitigation spending and additional items pending regulatory approval like our Charge Ready 2 electric vehicle charging infrastructure program.","Turning to the California wildfire crisis. We remain focused on mitigating catastrophic wildfire risks and the impacts on our communities. I will address the recent legislative actions and then cover the operational practices that SCE has undertaken to reduce wildfire risk. Please turn to Page two of the slide deck we issued with our earnings. We appreciate the significant leadership that Governor Newsom and the Legislature have shown and their willingness to act with urgency to address this wildfire crisis through the passage of Assembly Bill 1054 and companion measures. The bills build on the initial steps of Senate Bill 901 to restore California's regulatory framework and provide the financial stability that utilities require to invest in system safety, reliability and resiliency while continuing to drive towards a clean energy future. As with any major legislation where multiple stakeholders have competing interest, this wildfire bill package reflects compromises. We supported the passage of AB 1054 and the related AB 111, and believe that careful implementation and potential future refinements will be critical to their success.","AB 1054 is a comprehensive wildfire bill that holds utilities accountable for mitigating wildfire risks and improves the regulatory compact by clarifying the determination of prudent wildfire operations. The bill contains several important provisions to address wildfire liability risk. First, it changes wildfire safety oversight by creating a Wildfire Safety Division, initially within the CPUC, that will hold utilities accountable for mitigating wildfire risks and operating safely through an annual safety certification. These responsibilities will transition to the new Office of Energy Infrastructure Safety in 2021. For the first safety certification, the CPUC's executive director must issue it within 30 days of an IOU's request if the IOU has an approved wildfire mitigation plan, is in good safety standing, has a safety committee of its Board of Directors composed of members with relevant safety experience and has established Board of Director level reporting to the CPUC on safety issues. Earlier today, the CPUC's Executive Director informed SCE, by letter, that we have met these requirements and have been granted our initial safety certification for the next 12 months. In subsequent years, the IOU must meet these requirements and additionally, have an executive incentive compensation structure to promote safety as a priority and to ensure public safety and utility financial stability. The wildfire safety division must approve the IOU safety certification within 90 days if all the requirements are met.","Second, the bill establishes a Wildfire Safety Advisory Board to advise the Wildfire Safety Division. The members of this Board will have relevant expertise, including experience in the safe operation, design and engineering of electrical infrastructure.","The third provision refines the process for IOUs to recover catastrophic wildfire costs, particularly considering factors outside the utility's control and changing the prudency standard. Fourth, the bill establishes a $10.5 billion wildfire liquidity fund to pay victim claims exceeding insurance for utility cost wildfires, funded by IOU customers through the extension of the Department of Water Resources bond charge until 2036. There is an option for the IOUs to elect to participate in a broader insurance fund, which conveys additional benefits. It is important to note that for an IOU to benefit from the revised cost recovery standard, it must opt to participate in the wildfire insurance fund. Creation of the insurance fund requires both SCE and SDG&E to participate. With all three IOUs electing to participate, they will contribute a total of $10.5 billion, consisting of an upfront shareholder commitment of $7.5 billion and an annual contribution of $300 million, which is intended to match customer's $10.5 billion contribution over 10 years. Once the fund is established, the revised cost recovery standard will apply and will continue to apply even if the fund is extinguished.","Based on the 31.5% wildfire allocation ration for SCE, our upfront contribution translates to approximately $2.4 billion, with the subsequent annual contributions totaling another approximately $950 million. SCE notified the commission today of its commitment to make its initial and annual contributions in order to establish the fund. SCE will make its initial contribution no later than September 10. Maria will discuss our thoughts on the financing options in her remarks, which for now I will summarize as a balanced approach to fund the near-term $2.4 billion increment likely with 50% holding company equity contributed to SCE and 50% operating company debt. The fifth provision requires the large IOUs to invest $5 billion in aggregate on wildfire risk mitigation capital expenditures with no equity return, and authorizes financing of those mitigation costs. SCE's share of these costs will be approximately $1.6 billion.","Finally, the bill sets a cap on IOU shareholder liability even where the IOU is found to have been imprudent that is available only with the broader insurance fund. The cap equals 20% of T&D equity rate base, which is around $2.5 billion for SCE today.","Turning to our operations. I would now like to address the actions we are taking to combat wildfires in our service territory. For quite some time, even before the devastating fires in Ventura and Santa Barbara counties in December 2017, we have had proactive programs that target wildfire risk. As circumstances continue to change, we have continued to evolve our practices for this new abnormal, as it's been called. Approximately, 27% of our territory is in high fire risk areas, or HFRA. We recently revised this down from an earlier estimate of approximately 35%. SCE's prior HFRA map was based on CAL FIRE's fire hazard severity map. When the CPUC developed a new fire threat map in early 2018, out of an abundance of caution, we included the combination of the two maps in our HFRA footprint until we could do that thorough evaluation that we completed recently.","A foundational part of the longer-term solution to reduce the risk of our equipment starting wildfires in these areas is to harden our infrastructure. Over the course of the past 12 months, we have replaced over 200 circuit miles of overhead line with covered conductor, installed fast-acting current-limiting fuses at more than 9,000 locations and updated protective settings on over 1,600 remote automatic reclosers and circuit breakers on our distribution circuits that traverse our HFRAs. While we are making significant headway in our system hardening efforts, it will take time to cover the remaining area. In the more immediate term, we remain focused on ensuring our greatest and the best state possible through rigorous inspections and aggressive vegetation management, and then use proactive deenergization, known as Public Safety Power Shutoff, or PSPS, only when conditions warrant it. Through our Enhanced Overhead Inspection program, we have inspected more than 400,000 electrical structures in high fire risk areas since December, fixing the highest risk findings immediately and remediating nonthreatening issues in a prioritized manner, generally within 6 to 12 months, depending on the condition and the location of the findings. In addition to our ground-based inspections, we are doing aerial inspections using helicopters and drones.","Our vegetation management practices have been expanded in high fire risk areas, including widening clearance distances and removing dead and dying trees. In addition, we have an in-house team of weather experts in our 24\/7 Situational Awareness Center to monitor local conditions as well as a fire scientist who has established a fuel-sampling program to better understand potential fire risks in our service territory. These risk-monitoring activities also support our PSPS program, which is a preventive measure to protect public safety. Trained incident management teams lead our efforts during elevated fire risk conditions using circuit-specific wind criteria and a fire potential index, or FPI, that measures and predicts local vegetation fuel, fuel moisture content, humidity and other factors. For circuits that are forecast to be above the wind and FPI thresholds, we pre-patrol the lines ready to find and fix any issues. Ultimately, the decision to shut power off is made based on real-time measures of wind and FPI and feedback from monitors in the field. Once the power is off, we wait until the wind and FPI conditions clear before patrolling the lines and restoring power when it is safe to do so. Over time, more system hardening should mean that we can lean on PSPS less frequently and only in more severe conditions.","I would now like to give you an update on key regulatory proceedings. The CPUC issued a scoping memo in July on our cost of capital filing. In light of the passage of AB 1054, we are evaluating next steps, including the potential reduction of our requested return on equity. A final decision on this proceeding is expected by the end of this year.","In May, the commission issued final decisions on our 2019 wildfire mitigation plan and deenergization guidelines. The currently approved WMP satisfies one of the requirements for the safety certification in AB 1054. As I mentioned earlier, our first approximately $1.6 billion of WMP spend will not earn an equity return.","Additionally, the CPUC issued a scoping memo in May for our proposed $582 million Grid Safety and Resiliency Program that we filed in September 2018. In early July of 2019, SCE and certain parties to the GSRP proceeding agreed in principle to a settlement of all contested issues, which led the CPUC to take the scheduled evidentiary hearings off the calendar. SCE and the settling parties anticipate finalizing, executing and submitting a settlement agreement to the CPUC by the end of this month. If the CPUC accepts the settlement agreement, SCE expects a formal decision approximately six months from the date of submission.","Let me conclude by saying that the safety of our customers, our communities and our employees continues to be our top priority and a core value of Edison. We are taking steps to reduce the risk of wildfires in our service territory through operational mitigation, and we are also encouraged by the regulatory and legislative policy changes to our risk profile. We will continue to make our communities safer and to manage the financial health of our utility to serve our customers and to help achieve California's public policy objectives and environmental goals.","With that, I'll turn it over to Maria for her financial report.","Maria Rigatti","Thanks, Pedro. Good afternoon, everyone. My comments today will cover second quarter results from 2019 compared to the same period a year ago, plus comments on our General Rate Case, our updated capital expenditure and rate-based forecasts and other financial updates for SCE and EIX. As we have said, year-over-year comparisons are difficult given the timing of the GRC.","Please turn to Page 3. For the second quarter 2019, Edison International reported core earnings of $1.58 per share, an increase of $0.73 from the same period last year. From the table on the right-hand side, you will see that SCE had a positive $0.75 core EPS variance year-over-year. There are a few items that account for a majority of this variance. Upon receipt of the 2018 GRC final decision in May, SCE recorded the retroactive 2018 impact, which increased core earnings, primarily due to the application of the 2018 GRC final decision to revenue, depreciation and income tax expenses. This GRC true-up contributed $0.20 of positive earnings. Additionally, higher 2019 revenues had a positive impact of $0.34, including $0.28 at the CPUC and $0.06 at FERC. FERC revenues were higher primarily due to a change in estimate on the FERC formula rate mechanism.","Lower O&M costs had a positive impact of $0.14, primarily due to the timing of regulatory deferrals related to wildfire insurance and wildfire mitigation costs. During the quarter, certain wildfire mitigation costs reached the total authorized in GRC and we began to defer incremental costs through approved memo accounts.","Finally, lower depreciation and amortization had a positive $0.07 variance, primarily due to the impact of disallowed historical capital expenditures and the change in depreciation rates from the adoption of the 2018 GRC final decision. For the quarter, EIX Parent and Other had a negative $0.02 core earnings variance, mainly due to higher interest expense.","Please turn to Page 4. For the first half of the year, Edison International core earnings per share increased $0.56 to $2.21 per share. This includes core earnings increases of $0.55 at SCE and $0.01 at EIX Parent and Other. I'm not going to review the year-to-date financial results in detail, but SCE's earnings analysis is largely consistent with second quarter results, except for higher O&M costs and higher net financing costs. O&M had a negative variance of $0.04 year-over-year, primarily due to higher wildfire mitigation costs, partially offset by timing of regulatory deferrals and cost recovery of wildfire insurance costs. Net financing costs had a negative $0.09 variance, primarily due to increased borrowings and higher interest on balancing accounts.","Please turn to Page 5. As Pedro mentioned earlier, the CPUC approved a final decision in SCE's 2018 GRC in May. The decision authorized a CPUC GRC revenue requirement of $5.12 billion for 2018 and identified changes to certain balancing accounts, including the expansion of the Tax Accounting Memo Account, or TAMA, to include the impacts of all differences between forecast and recorded tax expense. Based on the 2018 GRC, SCE's authorized revenue requirement is $5.45 billion in 2019 and $5.86 billion in 2020, representing an increase of $335 million in 2019 and $412 million in 2020.","Please turn to Page 6 for SCE's capital expenditures forecast. This forecast reflects planned CPUC jurisdictional spending as approved by the 2018 GRC. It also reflects significant other capital spending needs outside of the GRC, particularly wildfire mitigation-related capital expenditures under the Grid Safety and Resiliency Program, or GS&RP, and the wildfire mitigation plan, or WMP. As an update to our prior forecast, we now estimate approximately $390 million of wildfire-related spending in 2019. Additionally, we continue to expect wildfire mitigation capital expenditures in the range of $500 million to $700 million for 2020.","The CPUC has approved the 2019 WMP and authorized tracking of costs related to the GS&RP and the WMP through memorandum accounts. We have also proposed a balancing account for our GS&RP spending and are anticipating a decision from the CPUC this year. Under AB 1054, SCE will not earn an equity return on the first approximately $1.6 billion of wildfire mitigation plan expenditures. We will work with the CPUC to implement this provision in light of the ongoing GS&RP and WMP proceedings.","On Page 7, we have our rate-based forecast that incorporates the GRC final decision as well as increases in FERC spend since the last update. The GRC authorizes 2018 CPUC jurisdictional rate base of $22.3 billion. This corresponds to total 2018 rate base of $28.5 billion. SCE's rate base grows at a compound annual rate of 8.4% from 2018 to 2020. I would note that this current rate base forecast does not include any of our wildfire mitigation-related capital spending or additional needs for programs such as Charge Ready 2.","On Page 8, you will see our key financial assumptions and EIX core EPS guidance for 2019. Our revise EPS guidance range for 2019 is $4.61 to $4.81 per share with a midpoint of $4.71. This compares with guidance of $4.72 to $4.92 per share we provided after we obtained a final decision on the GRC in May. I would note that this revised guidance is related to changes to our financing plan as we project funding the $2.4 billion initial contribution to the wildfire fund, and there are no updates to the overall operational results of both SCE and EIX Parent.","On the left-hand side, we have shown to build up for core EPS guidance, starting with EPS for 2019 from the simplified rate base model. SCE variances are expected to have a positive impact of $0.41, including $0.32 related to financing and other operational items. The test year 2018 GRC true-up has a positive contribution to EPS of $0.20. We booked this contribution in the second quarter.","For EIX Parent and Other, we expect an earnings drag of $0.30 cents to $0.35 per share, which includes approximately $0.01 per share per month related to EIX operating expenses. We are forecasting a total of $0.18 of EPS dilution from the financing plan announced last quarter as well as the financing plan required to support the $2.4 billion contribution to the wildfire fund. I will discuss more about this in a minute.","At Edison Energy, we are working towards our target of achieving a breakeven run rate for earnings by the end of this year. Let me provide an update on our 2019 financing plan. As Pedro noted earlier, we have notified the commission of our commitment to provide the initial contribution and subsequent annual contributions to the wildfire fund. Following passage of AB 1054, the rating agencies have reported on the credit supportive attributes of the wildfire fund and the legislation more broadly, including changes to the cost recovery and prudency standards.","On our last earnings call, I discussed the components of a 2019 EIX financing plan, which included the issuance of $1 billion of holding company debt and $1.5 billion of common equity through an aftermarket, or ATM equity program, and the use of internal equity program. This plan was designed to fund SCE's requirements related to the requested increase in the authorized equity layer and additional growth investment of the utility. Based on our election to participate in the wildfire insurance fund created under AB 1054, SCE requires an additional $2.4 billion to fund the initial shareholder contribution. Funding for this contribution will be in addition to the previously announced plan and together, the combined financing need in 2019 is $4.9 billion.","Through the second quarter, EIX has issued $600 million of unsecured notes as part of the original $1 billion debt financing need identified in Q1. We have not yet issued any equity under our ATM program, but we intend to do so opportunistically.","As we've discussed in the past, our overall approach to financing the business is to fund capital requirements in a balanced manner. Our Q1 plan to fund the requested increase in the authorized equity layer and make capital investments at SCE is consistent with this philosophy. Likewise, this is how we will approach funding for the initial shareholder contribution to the wildfire fund. We are evaluating a range of potential EIX and SCE funding options to support the incremental $2.4 billion financing need and anticipate the permanent capital raise will likely utilize 50% holding company equity contributed to SCE and 50% operating company debt.","As we have outlined, we are focused on a balanced financing approach that maintains a healthy balance sheet and promotes investment-grade ratings at both SCE and EIX. We believe this is the most effective way to support operations and future capital investments. We will continue to share our financing needs as we progress another milestone beyond 2019, including the 2021 GRC, our Charge Ready 2 application, securitization activities related to AB 1054 and potential wildfire liabilities.","That concludes our remarks.","Sam Ramraj","Dustin, please open the call for questions. [Operator Instructions].","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. First question is from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Can you hear me?","Pedro Pizarro","Yes.","Maria Rigatti","Yes, we can.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Good. Excellent. A little soft for the operator there, so I wasn't sure. All right. Well, thank you again for all the details here. Maybe to just take it off. I just wanted to understand a little bit more on the timing for the combined financing of the $4.9 billion. How do you think about the ATM usage, especially against the timeline for the cost of capital case? Do we need to see an outcome on that front before you decide to move forward with the 1 5 [ph]? And then separately related here, just want to understand, as you think about the $2.4 billion wildfire fund, that as best I understand, it is excluded from the authorized capital structure. Can you talk about the decision to use the 50-50 funding for that versus just using more of the leverage capacity at the whole cut?","Maria Rigatti","Sure. So Julien, I think we really think about it as this is a total need for 2019. So that includes, both the Q1 items that you just remarked on, equity layer, investment utility as well as the contribution to the wildfire fund. We're going to use the ATM opportunistically. I think we talked about that earlier in the year. That continues to be the case. I think the comment you make around the ability to exclude the amounts from the authorized capital structure, we are obviously, contributing some equity down into SCE and they will issue some operating companies debt. So that does take advantage of that element of the legislation. But overall, the mix of equity and debt that we talked about really reflects our philosophy around financing the business and the balanced way, in which we are approaching at.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Got it. But just to be clear about this, the $4.9 billion that is the intention to issue the equity for the cost of capital equity injection by the end of the year as well?","Maria Rigatti","That's correct.","Operator","Our next question is from Praful Mehta from Citigroup.","Praful Mehta","Just to follow up a little bit on that. In terms of the capital structure, if you don't get to 52%, what happens in that case? Do you want to wait till you get to 52% authorization before you issue? Or is there a prefunding plan as well?","Maria Rigatti","So thanks, Praful. This is Maria's. So we talked about -- I think a little bit about this in Q1 obviously, with all the events that happened in Q2 it's probably a little bit more to digest. But the -- our plan was to watch the cost of capital proceeding as it goes through the process over the course of the year. Since Q1, there's been -- there have been some developments in terms of issuing a scoping memo, setting a schedule, et cetera. Obviously, Pedro mentioned earlier that we would also be thinking about the interplay between AB 1054 and our ROE request as well. So things are moving along, and we developed the plan to use the ATM to reflect the fact that we would watch that evolve over time. We continue to believe that we're going to use the ATM opportunistically to address that need as well as we're going to be looking at all the tools and the timing frankly and options to fund the initial contribution to the wildfire fund. So that's, generally speaking, the philosophy.","Praful Mehta","Got you. That's super helpful. And then just secondly, in terms of -- connected to that, if your capital structure does improve, and you get to the 52%, is that reflected in any of the numbers from a GRC perspective in terms of the revenue and all of that? Or do we need to update that in our models to reflect the higher capital equity layer?","Maria Rigatti","So I mean, I don't know what's in your model but the earnings would then reflect 52%, not 48%, which we have currently. So each year, we go in to the CPUC and we file the revenue requirements for the year. So it's the -- if 2020 and includes a 52% equity layer, we would update the revenue requirement for at that beginning of the year, same thing for '21, et cetera.","Praful Mehta","Got you. So that decision and that -- you will show that revenue requirement once you file it depending on the decision from the CPUC?","Maria Rigatti","That's correct.","Operator","Our next question is from Ali Agha from SunTrust.","Ali Agha","My first question. Just to clarify, when you're thinking about your current equity needs. So the $1.5 billion stays as is? And if we assume 50% of the $2.4 billion will also be equity, so we're early talking about $2.7 billion in total. one, I wanted to be clear. And then related to that, have you checked in with the rating agencies, are they comfortable with that mix and the amount of incremental debt that is implied in this math?","Maria Rigatti","So in response to your first question, Ali. The $1.5 billion relates to the equity layer request that we have into the CPUC. We've indicated sort of a 50-50 structure against the $2.4 billion contribution to wildfire fund, so that would be $1.2 billion. So yes, that's $2.7 billion. So it's confirming your math there.","In terms of the rating agencies. We have an ongoing dialogue with them throughout the course of the year obviously, lots of dialogue around AB 1054. I'm pretty sure they've talked to --I spoked on the phone as well. And they've remarked across the board, including in their published reports, about AB 1054. All the credit supported aspects that the wildfire insurance funds incorporates, the liquidity benefits, the cap, the standards for reasonable conducts. So I think that's been a very -- they've come out very strongly in favor of that. Now we've just elected to contribute to the wildfire fund. So that was one of the things that they've been looking for. They've also been looking for a safety certification. Obviously, and Pedro just mentioned, that we got our safety certification today. So we think that, that -- all of that is the very supportive. And we believe now that we have all these things in place, that the third leg of the school is the -- stool, rather, is the financing plan. And we believe that our financing plan aligns with the rating agency's published guidance around maintaining our financial risk profile.","Pedro Pizarro","And Ali, if I could just follow on with Maria here. As we developed that plan that Maria emphasized, the fact that it is a balanced plan, it's one that we think will preserve our financial health. And it's one that frankly we want to make sure that overtime continue to build the strength of the balance sheet and have a good shock absorber built into that. So as folks have been developing their models, we see reports, and maybe, some folks might have thought perhaps it is more or less that, et cetera. We wanted to take a balanced approach that allows us to build that strength and preserve some ability to always have some shock absorber in the system.","Ali Agha","Got you. And a quick follow up. Where do we stand on the '17 and '18 wildfires, which are obviously not covered in this? And eventually are you thinking for modeling purpose that there may be more equity needed as you have to pay for those liabilities sometimes in the future?","Pedro Pizarro","I don't think we have substantial update '17 and '18 from Q1. Recall that at the end of '18, we took the accounting reserve for what we viewed as the low end of the estimable range of potential liabilities there. And I think as we've signaled all along, this could be a long process as we work our way through the litigation efforts in the courts. There's always, of course, a possibility of parties wanting to enter settlement discussions. We've returned to talk about that. But just reflecting the fact that as you've seen cases historically, they often end up with some attempts at that. So nothing to update at this point other than to reinforce that, we think that the reserve we took at the end of last year still make sense in terms of refining low end of the estimable range. And that will take some time to work through a complex proceedings there. There's a number of legal milestones, et cetera, from week to week or month to month, but nothing that we felt was to level of materiality for these disclosures.","Operator","Our next question is from Steve Fleishman from Wolfe Research.","Steven Fleishman","So Pedro, a question for you just on your comment of careful implementation and potential future refinements being critical to the law of success. Could you maybe give a little more color on what you might be referring to with those comments?","Pedro Pizarro","Sure. And yes, I think a number of you have heard us talk about the parallels to the energy crisis two decades ago. That also included in it's solution new legislation that setup a new framework. And then there was a period of time where the CPUC and other agencies had to go implement the law. There's a lot of building blocks or Lego blocks, however you want to think about it, that have to come together in place here. Now we need to -- we've already been, I think, encouraged by seeing positive early steps. The fact that we filed for initial annual certification, safety certification, and already obtained that from the CPUC today. That's, I think, a good marker along the way. There will be many more markers. There will be the creation of the wildfire safety division, initially inside the CPUC, and then later on being moved out to a new agency under the Natural Resources Branch of state government. There will be the creation of Wildfire Safety Board. There will be the input from those entities into future wildfire mitigation plans. ","So probably keep on reciting the various terms of the legislation and things that where we will all, I think, once you see good implementation of those and good track record built. And will build, I think, the confidence that we, that investors, that customers, that communities have in how the laws being implemented. We didn't specify any specific potential future refinements, but the reality is that with any law that this is large and complex as this one -- and frankly, that was written and passed and signed by the governor with such a sense of urgency, which means that the one that moves quickly. There are often cleanups that need to be made, sometimes it can be small and sometimes it can be the less small , sometimes it's just a clarification of a construction of language, and then other times it might be -- maybe more significant things. We're not ready at this point to enumerate a list of this, but we acknowledge that it is certainly very feasible that given the complexity and time involved here, there will be some of this. I don't know if that helps you, Steve, to frame your answer to the question.","Steven Fleishman","Yes. No, that's helpful. I have one follow up just on timing of financing. And just the -- I know the wildfire contribution is not due till September and the equity ratio decision not till year-end. But just -- we do have record stock market, we have very low interest rates and the like and your stocks has bounce that leaves some with this legislation. So just why wouldn't you just get a lot of this financing off the table as soon as possible?","Maria Rigatti","Steve, it's Maria. We obviously are watching the market. We want efficient execution. We're evaluating all the timing issues that you just raised. But that's what we're doing right now. We're evaluating it.","Operator","Our next question is from Paul Fremont from Mizuho.","Paul Fremont","Congratulations on getting the AB 1054 and getting that all behind you. In terms of how to think about the company on a longer-term basis, is there a level of FFO-to-debt that we should be thinking that the company is going to be targeting as you move forward in time?","Maria Rigatti","No. Paul, this is Maria. I think it's about the more as -- we do think that having investment-grade -- that's a processes we've just gone through over the past year or two, obviously, we have a strong commitment to investment-grade ratings at both SCE and EIX. We're still working through a process with the rating agencies in terms of how they will think about and sort of reposition California from a strength of the regulatory construct, et cetera. So as we move through that, I think that -- keep in mind or you can understand it we'll be targeting those investment-grade ratings. I think the metrics themselves are important, but equally important is how California looks to the rating agencies on a go-forward basis. So that meets the metric itself, I think, will be less specific about that and we'll just be focused on keeping that investment-grade rating solid.","Paul Fremont","Okay. So you're not going to have like numerical target that you're going to provide to investors?","Maria Rigatti","Not at this time. No.","Paul Fremont","And then going back to Ali's question. In terms of when you do pay out claims to claimants from the '17 and '18 fires, should we think about a funding formula that is similar to the sort of the 50-50 that you're talking about for your initial contribution to the wildfire mitigation fund? Or how should we think about your approach towards funding those cash needs?","Maria Rigatti","Maybe think about it in a couple of three different ways, First, there isn't a lot of the variables that would need to be taken into consideration. So post-2019, you're referring to the wildfire liabilities. But we're going to be filing our 2021 GRC. There is the issue around the securitization for the wildfire mitigation-related spending. That's in the AB 1054. We have other applications pending in front of the commission that also require capital. So there's a lot of things to take into the mix or into consideration in addition to the liabilities. The first part of the liability is presumably get covered by insurance as a starting point in any event. So there is a lot of timing in there, there is a lot of different variables. Recall also that when we requested our capital waiver, we asked for some relief around, including the charges and the financing for those potential liabilities in our capital structure. So there's a lot of different things that we're going to have to weigh and consider before we make a final determination as to how we finance that part of the go-forward plan.","Pedro Pizarro","And I would just settle the score that just those -- the timing of the liabilities alone is a significant variable because it will depend on a court process for different cases that has only just begun.","Paul Fremont","I guess what I'm really trying to get, is there any expected potential equity need beyond the $2.7 billion? Or is -- should we just think of the $2.7 billion as the end of your equity need?","Maria Rigatti","The 2019 plan is only laid out. I think and as I just noted, there are a lot of variables as you move past this year. And we're going to have to consider all of those variables. We're going to have to consider the timing that Pedro just noted, not just on the potential liabilities but in all of the decisions that I just referred to. So I think that, that is sort of a go-forward planning element that we'll share with you with we have more information. We will continue to focus on our investment-grade rating. So that's the other piece of the mix in terms of the decision-making process.","Operator","Our next question is from Angie Storozynski from Macquarie.","Agnieszka Storozynski","So I know you mentioned that there's going to be plenty of refinements of this new law. But I'm -- my bigger concern is that it is $21 billion, which seems like a large amount. But we're going through the PG&E bankruptcy where they're mentioning $30 billion in liabilities related to one very large fire, but still in excess of that amount. And the bill doesn't really talk about how this sum gets replenished. So how should we think about it? Is it that going forward, the goal is still to have some sort of a inverse culmination change, which will be more supportive of investor on utilities in the state? Or is it that there is hope that this $21 billion basically is sufficient for all utilities and all future fires going forward?","Pedro Pizarro","Yes. So let me start trying to frame an answer here, and Maria or Adam Umanoff or others here may have thoughts to. I think for starters, the $21 billion fund is expected to cover potential liabilities that they could be much larger. At least $40 billion, $45 billion. And that's, I think, based on the history of -- and how these cases grow. You often see settlements achieve that have a discount built into them. In fact, the legislation itself, as you might recall, has essentially built in discount for segregation claims of 40%. It provides a possibility for settlements that are higher, but those who need to be essentially approved by the fund manager. So there's, I think, a clear expectation, Angie, that there's a significant discount there. ","And frankly, that's part of the compact here across a lot of stakeholders and a lot of competing interest. I think the governor probably said it pretty well when he gave his first -- he goes to a conference call that he gave when the strike force reports came out. And if I recall correctly, he made a comment about everybody in California having to bear some share here in terms of dealing with this issue. So clearly, there's a piece that shareholders are now having to contribute, there's a piece of customers who are contributing and there's a piece that through the 40% that's built in there, you're seeing a discount being applied to the recoveries that the insurers would get. So I think it's a piece here for everybody. So I think that's the starting point. And in fact, the government -- the governor's office team released some projections of the durability of the fund and those 10 years out exceeded the 90% level. So that's one piece of it.","I think the second piece is that the focus on durability over 10 years on an actuarial basis was rooted at least in part in the discussions that we heard on the idea of giving California and California Utilities time to continue to harden our assistance. And so the expectation is that the overall risk profile for the state, although it will never be zero, will never be zero, but that the risk profile should decrease, should improve significantly as all of us, the utilities side, continue to put in investments to harden in our infrastructure. And it's not just us. It's other measures of the state is developing and implementing around better funding for fire suppression, the focus on better standards for homes and businesses and buildings in high fire risk areas, the refinement of fire maps. Angie, all of these things are forest management, really important one, right? So this all goes to the decreasing the risk of the spark coming out, but if the spark comes out, then decreasing the risk of that spark turns into a massive wildfire of $30 billion-plus versus a maybe more contained wildfire. So I think that's the philosophy. You are right that there is not a specific replenishment mechanism in general for the fund. And I think there's a sense that there was a significant accomplishment by the governor and legislature in implementing this first phase that has feasibility that's out and hopefully, decade or so. And I'm sure the state will continue to check and adjust as it sees how that experience goes.","Operator","Our next question is from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.","Michael Lapides","Real quickly, is there a potential use of securitization to help cover the 2017 portion of the wildfire claims after insurance that you actually have to pay out?","Maria Rigatti","Yes. So the 2017 claims or wildfires are covered in SB 901. And there, in 2017, you can securitize the benefit of the customer if there are amounts that have been disallowed, but they are viewed as being -- would undermining the utilities financial stability. The commission has gone through a proceeding to define how that would work and what the -- how you would calculate the piece that would be basically too much for the utility to bear. That calculation, I would say, is one that's probably not an example of perfect clarity, but it's also something that I don't -- I think at the end of the day, we put it on to define particularly useful. You may recall that we said it before that we did not -- in really necessarily be in a position to take advantage of that 2017 provision. I don't really see securitization as a big opportunity for the '17 amount. The amount of wildfire mitigation-related spending that we have to basically implement without a return. So our portion of the $5 billion that's in AB 1054, that is something that is able to be securitized.","Michael Lapides","Got it. But you would effectively net neutral on that?","Maria Rigatti","That's right.","Michael Lapides","Right. Okay. Typical securitization built, just like storm recovery occurs in other jurisdictions, et cetera?","Maria Rigatti","Yes.","Michael Lapides","Okay. My second question is, what is not in rate base growth guidance that over the next 6 to 12, 6 to 18 months you think should get -- potentially get added to it? You talked a little bit it in the opening remarks. If you don't mind revisiting that, that would be great. I'm just trying to make sure kind of the puts and takes the items that are in it, the items that are not in it.","Maria Rigatti","Sure. So 6 of 12 months frankly, Michael, is a fairly short time frame. So we're not sure of it that just will be necessarily added even the next 6 to 12 months. So what's not in the rate base forecast right now is, we haven't included the wildfire mitigation-related to spending that we've been identified for '19 and '20. That's -- it's in our CapEx forecast, but not in our rate base forecast. That is going to be essentially subject to that AB 1054 provision we have to work with the commission to figure out how to implement that alongside our GS&RP and wildfire mitigation plan. But for clarification, it's not in our rate base numbers. We also have a Charge Ready 2 application pending in front of the commission. We're thinking we're going to get a decision on that later this year. It's about $560 million of capital or thereabout. But remember, that rolls out over a number of years, so of the impact on rate base, even if we're spending CapEx, the impact on rate base over the next couple of years probably pretty moderate. Longer term, we're looking at energy storage. At some point, CAISO will develop a plan to bring -- that meet the new -- the higher renewable portfolio standards and we have an opportunity potentially to participate in that mix. But those are not 6 to 12 months issues. Those are longer-term issues.","Michael Lapides","Got it. Okay. And on the cost of capital pocket, what's the time line and in process from here? I mean, the CPUC has a lot of things on its plate. I'm just trying to think about how they prosecute all of the items and kind of where this one fits in the prioritization ranking?","Maria Rigatti","Well, thus far, they have been very diligent about holding to their schedule. Comments are due from interveners and from the utilities on August 1. And then they have a schedule on scoping manual and schedule that has the decision coming out before year-end.","Operator","Our next question from Greg Gordon from Evercore.","Gregory Gordon","Just one follow-up question. When it comes to the wildfire mitigation spending where you're not going to receive an equity return. Before thinking about modeling, the spending and the recovery on that, should we presume that you'll recover at a cost of debt return on 100% of the investment and that you could finance it accordingly, such that there's no negative arbitrage to your -- on your financing costs relative to your ability to recover the capital? Or did I hear differently that essentially it would be sleeved and it would have no impact at all?","Maria Rigatti","Yes. So the way the legislation is drafted is that it would basically be a securitization, so dedicated rate components that would allow us to recover the return of our capital, but then the return on the debt, which would be presumably lower cost. So it's structured in a way to be minimize the cost to the customer. So yes, that would be neutral. We are -- we need to work with the commission to determine when those pieces would fall into place so they wouldn't -- essentially, we could be implementing program before the securitization actually took -- was issued -- that was actually issued. So we have to figure out with the commission how it will implement it. But in sort of a like big picture kind of response would be, it's basically designed to be neutral to us.","Gregory Gordon","Okay. So you'll get a recovery, essentially be a debt return, the debt that you issue will be recovered dollar-for-dollar and then you'll depreciate the assets and recover the capital you invested?","Maria Rigatti","That's right.","Gregory Gordon","Right. And then when it comes to the -- you're raising this equity at the parent level to put down into SCE and you're going to issue debt at the SCE level to pay for the wildfire insurance contribution, what's the accounting for this? Is going to be a charge that you have to take that will go against the GAAP equity but -- I think for my understanding of the legislation is from a -- in terms of accounting for your regulatory capital structure that this would -- these financing costs would not be counted against your regulatory capital structure pre-making purposes. I'm sitting here trying to model this stuff frankly, and I'm just -- we could use some guidance.","Maria Rigatti","Yes. So we're still evaluating the accounting for it, Greg, to be quite honest. It could be a charge but -- and certainly wouldn't be more than the amount of the a contribution. But we're actually frankly still working through that in determining how we would account for that. That's the first question. So that's a GAAP kind of response. Second part of your question is, yes, there could be a charge for GAAP purposes, but under the legislation, we would not have to take that hit in our regulatory accounting.","Gregory Gordon","Okay. So if I'm looking to do side-by-side a GAAP sort of capital structure against regulatory, and I do presume that there is a charge, I would reverse the charge for regulatory purposes in my equity calculation?","Maria Rigatti","That's correct. Correct.","Operator","Our next question is from Travis Miller from MorningStar.","Travis Miller","Just wondering how you think, real quick, about the dividends with respect to any kind of equity needs. Where does that fit in?","Maria Rigatti","I think we understand the importance of the dividends to our shareholders, no question. Obviously, from prior quarter when dividend question was captioned in slightly different way or from a different angle. We don't get ahead of our Board on those issues. But our policy has been to grow the dividend. We'll continue to manage over the longer term to that 45%, 55% payout ratio range. But we understand the importance to our investors.","Travis Miller","Okay. And then on the wildfire adder that you had requested in the cost of the capital, how do you think about that now? Or how do you think the commission will think about that now post the legislation that presumably would lower your cost of equity in the market?","Pedro Pizarro","Travis, I think we mentioned in your remarks, we're still evaluating that. We had said all along that if there was a new policy established through legislation, we will look at revisiting that for potential reduction or even the elimination depending on how the risk profile changed. To be honest with you, we're still observing that quickly and evaluating that. And I believe we have a deadline coming up of August 1 for filing our comments in the cost of capital proceeding with CPUC.","Operator","At this time, there are no further questions.

These include our Form 10-Q, prepared remarks from Pedro and Maria, and the teleconference presentation. Tomorrow, we will distribute our regular business update presentation.","During this call, we will make forward-looking statements about the outlook for Edison International and its subsidiaries. Actual results could differ materially from current expectations. Important factors that could cause different results are set forth in our SEC filings. Please read these carefully. Presentation includes certain outlook assumptions, as well as reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the nearest GAAP measure.","During the question-and-answer session, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up.","I will now turn the call over to Pedro.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Thank you, Sam, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I discuss our quarterly results, I would like to express my deep sorrow for the lives lost and the significant damage during the recent wildfires in Northern California. SCE has provided support to PG&E during this catastrophe, including sending 16 crews to assist with restoration efforts. We will continue with further assistance as necessary. Moments like this reaffirm the commitment that we have, and that I know we share with other utilities and with our regulators, to making the safety of our communities and our workers our number one priority. I will talk more about SCE's management of wildfire risks later in my remarks.","Now, on to the quarter. Edison International reported strong third quarter earnings of $1.44 per share, which were $0.15 per share above last year's third quarter earnings of $1.29 per share. Based on the continuing strong performance at SCE and tax benefits we have received throughout the year, we have increased our 2017 earnings per share guidance to a midpoint of $4.32 per share, and tightened the range to plus or minus $0.05 per share. Maria will cover this in more detail in her remarks.","Please turn to page 2 of our presentation. As I have discussed with you in the past, we believe we must be a key enabler of California's ambitious environmental policies. These are important not only to the state broadly, but specifically to our customers and stakeholders. Edison International will strengthen and grow our business, and lead the transformation of the industry by focusing on opportunities in clean energy, efficient electrification, a modernized and more reliable grid, and enabling customers' technology choices.","At SCE, this means focusing on four key priorities. One, cleaning the power system with continued leadership in procurement of renewable power; two, helping customers make cleaner energy choices including distributed renewable energy resources, electric transportation and energy efficiency programs; three, strengthening and modernizing the grid; and four, achieving operational and service excellence and above all, doing so safely.","At the holding company, we will continue to identify new competitive business opportunities for growth and innovation in areas where we see customer demand. Our strategy continues the long-term alignment of SCE with the state of California. Wherever possible, we have been working with others to find practical and cost-effective approaches to achieve the bold, low-carbon energy future supported by both California's government and its citizens.","Significant infrastructure development and market transformations are needed to radically accelerate customers' adoption of new technologies and to ensure that all communities benefit. Public policy can enable this plan through wise investments of cap-and-trade revenues; a comprehensive integrated resource planning process that includes decarbonizing end uses of energy; efficient electrification efforts in transportation, homes, and businesses; and by ensuring that clean electricity remains affordable.","Tomorrow, SCE will release a white paper that outlines our blueprint for California to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution by its ambitious 2030 goal. We build on existing state programs and policies to achieve these climate goals, while ensuring that an economy-wide transformation happens in an efficient and affordable way. Our white paper summarizes the results of detailed analysis, comparing different options for greenhouse gas reduction, and finds that an electric-led pathway will best allow California to meet its 2030 goals, and be better positioned for its 2050 goals, while minimizing cost to consumers and the economy.","As you will see on the white paper, the elements include further increases in carbon-free electricity supported by energy storage, higher levels of electric vehicles than what the state has imagined to-date, and further electrification of commercial and residential building space and water heating. All of these measures will require a robust modern electric grid reinforcing our view in the long-term need for and value of our capital investments at SCE. We look forward to speaking with you further on these subjects once we release a white paper tomorrow.","Let me now connect these long-term vision comments to our near-term activities. The four key strategic priorities at SCE are woven into CUPC proceedings that are ongoing, with one of the most significant being the SCE 2018 General Rate Case. The General Rate Case is continuing per the procedural schedule. We completed evidentiary hearings on August 2. The main topics litigated during the hearings were consistent with the key things of our case, including safety and reliability, grid modernization, continued infrastructure replacement and affordability.","Additionally, in September, SCE, ORA and all intervenors filed briefs and reply briefs, which generally summarized and clarified their respective positions. From a procedural perspective, we have some additional public participation hearings in mid-November. And then, in early December, we will provide an update filing that reflects item such as updated escalation rates and changes to laws and regulations that have occurred since we initiated our rate case.","After that, we will await a proposed decision by the ALJs and the Assigned Commissioner. At this point, we believe it is very unlikely that a commission decision on this application will be issued in 2017, given the remaining items on calendar and the timing of the issuance of proposed decisions in recent rate cases.","In addition to our General Rate Case, there are ongoing proceedings at the CPUC related to transportation electrification and energy storage, which could add up to an additional $1 billion in capital spending to our forecast, and which further underscore the alignment of our strategy with California's environmental goals. A first step will be decisions on the $20 million of priority review projects in the transportation electrification application, which we filed last January.","A proposed decision was expected from the CPUC in October, and we remain optimistic that we will receive guidance in 2017. SCE is undergoing evidentiary hearings for the standard longer term review project, also included in our January application totaling $550 million with a decision in that expected in May 2018. Also, as a reminder, SCE continues to procure energy storage under SCE's 580-megawatt share of the current 1,325-megawatt statewide target, set by the storage rulemaking issued by the CPUC in 2014; up to one half of this can be utility-owned.","SCE has entered close to 500 megawatts of commitments through both utility-owned projects and third-party contracts, of which approximately 418 megawatts (09:08) are eligible to count against our targets. The IOUs are also required to add another 500 megawatts combined of distributed energy storage systems into their March 2018 energy storage procurement and investment plans. The SCE portion of this will be 166 megawatts. These additional megawatts were mandated through Assembly Bill 2868, and again are above and beyond the 1,225 megawatt target.","The 2017 legislative session adjourned on September 15. The most significant bill that was passed this year and signed by the Governor was AB 398, which extends the cap-and-trade program, with some modifications, to 2030. Several bills that we had discussed previously were not passed by the legislature this year, but will likely remain active in some form in the 2018 session. These bills include SB 100, which would accelerate the Renewables Portfolio Standard to 50% by 2026; establish a target of 60% renewable resources by 2030; and require all electricity sold at retail to be from zero-carbon resources by 2045.","Other bills are AB 813 and AB 726, which would have authorized CAISO regionalization and required the CPUC to direct IOUs to procure additional tax-advantaged renewable resources over and above those resources necessary to meet the 2020 RPS requirements.","We continue to be supportive of California's leadership in addressing greenhouse gas emissions and other harmful pollutants through ambitious clean energy and environmental programs. And we will work constructively during next year's session with lawmakers to ensure that clean energy grows in a manner that is also safe, reliable, and importantly, affordable for all our customers.","I started this call on the topic of wildfires, so let me return to that now. Wildfires are all too common in California, and situations like this remind us to stay vigilant in our risk management, and to be safe in our day-to-day operations. While no major wildfires are currently impacting SCE's service territory, wildfires have been a recent topic of discussion at the CPUC, both in terms of the Northern California fires and also with respect to other ongoing proceedings around cost recovery. We are engaging with regulators on this topic and on the practices and orders that we have implemented to date. These include managing the electric system with a focus on public and worker safety, as well as on reliability of the system.","In addition to operating practices designed to reduce the risk of wildfires, SCE also invests significant amounts of capital to reduce wildfire risk. Examples include our pole replacement and vegetation management programs. These are all part of our mandate to provide safe, reliable, and ubiquitous electric service, even as we and our peer utilities have seen increased siting of new homes and businesses in areas with higher fire risk across the state over the past decades.","Moving on to the status of the SONGS regulatory proceeding, since our last earnings call, SCE and other parties filed status reports on August 15, following the conclusion of the meet-and-confer and mediation sessions. Unfortunately, SCE and other parties were unable to reach an agreement on possible changes to the settlement. In our status report, we urged the commission to reaffirm the existing settlement on the basis that it remains fair and reasonable and in the public interest.","Intervenors also filed status reports with a wide range of comments on possible adjustments to the settlement and on the process to be followed going forward. On October 10, the Assigned Commissioner and Assigned Administrative Law Judge issued a joint ruling. This ACR acknowledged that there is sufficient information in the record to assess whether the settlement continues to be in the public interest, but noted that, if the settlement were found not to be in the public interest, then additional information would be required to address the appropriate cost allocation between customers and shareholders.","Consistent with the direction provided in the ACR, today we are filing an issue statement which comments on the preliminary list of issues suggested in the ACR to be addressed in this continued proceeding as well as any other issues that should be added. The next step in the process is the November 7 status conference. While the ACR included a preliminary schedule where hearings would conclude in March 2018, the ACR did not state specifically when the process will come to a final conclusion.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Maria for her update on the quarter.","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","Thank you, Pedro, and good afternoon, everyone. My comments today will cover third quarter and year-to-date results, our updated capital expenditure and rate base forecasts, our updated earnings guidance and our updated cost of capital.","Let's begin by looking at the key SCE earnings drivers for the quarter shown to the right on slide 3. For the third quarter 2017, Edison reported earnings of $1.44 per share, an increase of $0.15 from the same period last year. Included in this, SCE had a positive $0.09 variance for the quarter. SCE's revenues increased $0.18 per share in the third quarter versus the prior year. This was mainly attributable to $0.11 per share of increased revenue related to the attrition mechanism in SCE's 2015 General Rate Case. The remaining $0.07 per share were related to various CPUC items outside of the General Rate Case, including balancing account activity which is non-earnings related.","SCE's operations and maintenance costs were not an earnings driver quarter-over-quarter, with $0.03 per share of savings from the ongoing implementation of various operational and service excellence initiatives offset by increased transmission and distribution line clearance and maintenance and higher software license costs.","Net financing costs increased $0.01 per share over last year and was mainly due to $0.03 of higher interest expense, partially offset by increased AFUDC earnings over the prior year. Lower income tax benefits versus last year accounted for a negative $0.06 per share. Of this variance, $0.03 resulted from a true-up of 2016 income tax expense. The remaining $0.03 variance relates largely to a lower property-related deductions in the quarter that are offset in revenue.","For the quarter, EIX parent and other had a positive $0.06 per share earnings variance, including $0.02 per share benefit at the holding company related to net operating loss carrybacks that resulted from the filing of our 2016 tax return and $0.01 from lower operating expenses. Edison Energy Group contributed an additional $0.03 per share to the positive variance. This was also related to net operating loss carrybacks as well as tax benefits related to stock option exercises.","Please turn to page 4. I won't go into the detail on the year-to-date results, since the earnings drivers are similar to the quarter. One item of note in the year-to-date results is the $0.08 per share of lower operation and maintenance costs over prior year attributable to our continued operational excellence program. While we had significant tax benefits during 2017, the underlying fundamentals of the business continue to produce strong results.","Please turn to page 5. As we wait for a proposed decision on SCE's 2018 General Rate Case, we continue to present our 2018 through 2020 capital forecast at our current request level, which has remained unchanged this quarter. However, for 2017, we adjusted capital expenditures to $3.7 billion to reflect our latest outlook for the year. The reduction was driven by small adjustments across a number of distribution programs and projects.","As Pedro mentioned earlier, it is unlikely that SCE will receive a 2018 General Rate Case decision in 2017. It is also uncertain whether SCE will receive firm guidance on grid modernization spending as part of the DRP proceeding during 2017. Therefore, we are currently developing an approach for 2018 capital spending, based on these contingencies, which will allow SCE to ramp up its capital spending program to meet the rate base ultimately authorized in the 2018 General Rate Case decision, while minimizing the associated risk of unauthorized spending. A component of this approach will be to focus initial 2018 grid modernization spending on capital that provides safety and reliability benefits, while deferring most spending that is primarily focused on integration of distributed energy resources.","While we wait for the outcomes related to these two proceedings, over the long term, we continue to see SCE investing at least $4 billion per year and adding at least $2 billion per year of rate base for the foreseeable future, as SCE continues to implement its wires-focused business strategy.","Please turn to page 6. Our CPUC rate base forecast is based on the weighted average rate base that is authorized in the General Rate Case for the forward-looking three-year period. Once SCE received a final decision in the 2018 General Rate Case, our rate base forecast will be trued up along with our capital expenditures. We have updated our FERC rate base forecast to reflect a change in deferred taxes related to accelerated tax benefits from our 2016 tax return filings. As you can see, the impact is very minimal, with the rate base moving to $26.1 billion from $26.2 billion in 2017 and small impacts thereafter.","Please turn to page 7. We increased our 2017 earnings per share guidance to $4.27 to $4.37 per share with a midpoint of $4.32 per share. This reflects both strong operational performance at SCE and the incremental $0.22 per share of tax benefits we have received during the year-to-date period. Our new range includes SCE O&M, financing and other benefits of $0.35 per share, $0.01 higher than previous guidance. In addition, the EIX parent and other earnings drag has decreased from a negative $0.19 per share to negative $0.11 per share. Both of these changes related primarily to additional tax benefits received in the third quarter. In general, we are on track to realize the operational and service excellence targets that we outlined at the beginning of the year with additional improvement attributable to tax benefits.","Please turn to page 8, and I will touch on a few key topics. As a part of the cost of capital decision, we filed an Advice Letter with updated costs for of debt and preferred equity for SCE's capital structure. This was approved last week, and starting January 1, 2018, our cost of debt will be reduced to 4.98%, while our cost of preferred equity will increase slightly to 5.82%. Together with the return on common equity reduction to 10.3%, we estimate a pre-tax 2018 revenue requirement reduction of $73 million.","On October 27, we filed our annual update to our FERC revenue requirement, and in","Addition, we proposed a new FERC Formula recovery mechanism for 2018. The update reflected a transmission revenue requirement of $1.175 billion, a decrease of approximately $13 million, or 1.1% of SCE's 2017 authorized revenue requirement of $1.189 billion. In the new FERC Formula recovery mechanism, we proposed a FERC ROE, not including project-specific adders, of 10.8%. This ROE is composed of a base ROE of 10.3% and an adder of 50 basis points to compensate SCE for its participation in the CAISO.","It is reasonable to expect that intervenors will file protests, in which case, FERC will likely accept the new rate subject to refund and provide time for settlement, and formal hearings if a settlement is not reached. We cannot speculate on the outcome of this proceeding or the timeline, but we'll keep you updated as new information is presented.","SCE continues to maintain a strong balance sheet and significant financial flexibility. Our weighted average common equity component of total capitalization remained at 50.2% as of September 30. We continue, to maintain what we believe, a prudently conservative balance sheet at both SCE and at the holding company.","Finally, our fourth quarter earnings call is tentatively scheduled for February 20. Our normal practice is to provide 2018 earnings guidance, when we report fourth quarter and full year financial results. However, this will be contingent on SCE receiving a final decision on the 2018 General Rate Case.","That concludes our remarks. Markie, please open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from Ali Agha of SunTrust. Your line is now open.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you. Good afternoon.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Hi, Ali.","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","Hi, Ali.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hi. First question, given the timeline that we do know for the schedule in both SONGS and GRC, just based on that and prior experience on how much time PDs, et cetera take, roughly when at the earliest could we...","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Ali, it looks like we may have lost you. For other folks on the call though, I think where Ali may have been headed was a question on timing of these base decisions. And we can't speculate on when those would be received. I think what we did say was that we don't expect the GRC PD to be issued within 2017.","Operator, next question. Operator?","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","Markie?","Operator","Our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Can you hear me?","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Yes. Hi, Julien. How are you?","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Excellent. Good. Thank you. Perhaps just a follow-up on some of the commentary you provided. How are you thinking about SONGS with respect to the timeline and specifically around, sort of, the reopening of the multiple phases, because we really nearly got to that in the prior \u2013 prior to your initial original settlement here? How are you thinking about the prospects here in terms of going back to each one of the separate phases? Or would it be correct to kind of read this as a going directly to the question of cost allocation?","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","I think the way we read the \u2013 where the process is, and again, we'll all be reading the various comments from parties filed today. But the ACR that the Assigned Commissioner and the ALJ issued jointly specified a list of topics to be addressed. As I said in my comments, if they determined that the settlement was \u2013 they're not continuing to be reasonable. They also commented on a proposed timeline for addressing all those questions, where they envision hearings completing in March of next year. Beyond that bill, I don't think they provided any guidance as to timing. So, we're not able to speculate on how long that would take.","And at this point, as I mentioned also, the next step is the November 7 proceeding I think to get parties talking further about their various filings. And from all of that, the PUC will issue a scoping memo determining final topics for consideration, as we go towards the hearings that they have tentatively scheduled for March. So, Julien, I think that's about all we can read from the ACR, and we'll have to stay tuned here.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And just a quick \u2013 a couple of housekeeping items more with respect to your commentary around capital spending contingency plans. By what date next year, broadly, would you need to get that in place in order to execute on the contingency to keep capital spending on track? Is it by midyear or by 1Q really that you think?","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","Hey, Julien. Hi, this is Maria. We're actually \u2013 our plans are being put in place even as we speak. And the plan revolves around ensuring that we have the proper resources and the right \u2013 whether it's crews or what have you to really spend at a level, mostly focused particularly on the grid mod space around safety and reliability types of projects, but spend at a level that will allow us to then ramp up over the course of the year in our \u2013 I'll say, more traditional programs, the sustained planning that we would do every year. And so, we really don't see any need at any time during the year to have any sort of bright line sort of test. We'll be planning as we always would for that.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","And, Julien, I think it's probably pretty obvious, but the sooner we have clarity, the better for everybody, but I think the team is working hard to continue to build and retain as much optionality as possible as they think about their plans for 2018.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Excellent. Thank you all very much.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Thanks, Julien.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Praful Mehta of Citigroup. Your line is now open.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks so much. Hi, guys.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Hey, Praful.","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","Hi.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi. So, I just wanted to clarify on the stock-based compensation and the tax benefits, it looks like the $0.09 incremental benefit. Just wanted to understand what drove that. And secondly, is that all showing up as cash flow or is this more GAAP related or not really cash flow?","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","So, as to your first question, the incremental piece of it, that's all related to three areas. We have stock-based compensation incremental since we updated guidance in July, we have some net operating loss carrybacks for periods that had higher tax rates, and so, we got some tax \u2013 some benefit there. And then, the third area is sort of around the audit settlement. So there's really three things that are driving that.","In terms of cash flow versus earnings, we do get obviously benefit from cash flow. We are not a taxpayer right now, and so we will see that over time.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got you. So, the cash flow benefit is not incremental, because you're already not a cash taxpayer effectively?","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","That's right.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got you. Okay. And secondly, on the grid mod, I get, the spend is more safety related at least till you have the decision. Could we understand what percentage of the grid mod spend is safety related, and at what point kind of do you run out of steam on the safety and you got to have to spend on, I guess, the other components of the spend?","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","So, I think, Praful, in terms of grid mod spend, I think you've probably heard us talk about this before. There's an aspect of it that it relates to true modernization, whether that's a new generation of sensors or communication network so what have you. Another part of it is related to reinforcing the grid and increasing business resiliency and the like, so around, say, our worst circuits, and our Worst Circuit Rehab program, as well as replacing 4 kV circuits with 12 kV or 16 kV circuits. We're still in the planning phases right now, so we have not buttoned down the numbers for next year, obviously. But we have a significant portion of the spend that we can aim at next year that's related to safety and reliability.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got you. Thanks so much, guys, and I look forward to catching up at EI.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Yeah, we look forward to it. Thanks, Praful.","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Jonathan Arnold of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Oh, good. Good afternoon, guys.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Hi, Jonathan.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Can I just ask if you could give me a \u2013 or ask a preview of what you're going to file on the SONGS issue statement today?","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Sure. I'll turn it over to Ron Nichols to answer that.","Ronald Owen Nichols - Southern California Edison Co.","Sure, Jonathan. This is Ron. We'll be planning a statement, pretty perfunctory actually that lays out just the fact that we continue to support the existing settlement. I think it's fair and equitable allocation of cost. There were about nine items, specific items topically that the Assigned Commissioner ruling came out asking for areas that could be addressed and asking for positions on them. Rather than going into a lot of detail on those, we actually referred to many different proceedings in which we've already commented on these. And we'll have a very brief summary table that will describe in summary fashion what our position is on each of those that really referring back to the final \u2013 the prior discussions which went into quite a bit of detail in the record.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","So, in summary, you're going to hold your position and not to sort of invite some offer on any of those topics?","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Yeah. As Ron said, we reaffirmed our view that the current settlement is reasonable and in customers' interest. And obviously, we've been through the set of confidential meet and confer and mediation sessions. As I mentioned earlier, that those were not successful interchange, I think this is consistent with what we said all along, I think the settlement is reasonable, Jonathan. We certainly approached the meet and confer mediation sessions with an open mind and engaged, I think, in full good faith. I can't comment beyond that because those were confidential. But at this point, I think we're back to more of a litigation approach, and we do stand firmly by our current position.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And do you believe the process this commission's laid out where everyone just opines on this case, questions the cost allocation. And then the commission will have sufficient record to make a decision at that point? Is that, procedurally, do you see that as correct?","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Yeah, let me \u2013 this is Pedro Pizarro, let me turn over to Adam Umanoff, our GC.","Adam S. Umanoff - Edison International","I think simply put, we can't speculate on where this is going to lead. The commission has laid out a process. We're going to fully participate in that process, and we'll see what results. As you know, the timing is still uncertain. Hearings are scheduled tentatively to end by the first quarter of next year, but that's really all we can say about the process for now.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Look, Jonathan, as you can hear from our comments, we're really staying away from speculating on the process, and quietly remain committed to doing our part and I think the commission, the ACR, laid out a process, laid out some initial timing and steps that's constructive, but I think we'll all stay tuned.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then \u2013 I think that's it. Thank you.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Thanks, Jonathan.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hey, guys. A couple of things. First of all, historically, was there much differentiation between during your annual PO filings, the authorized ROE get at the FERC level for FERC transmission assets versus what California had granted you?","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","So, Michael, the FERC has actually acknowledged that distribution investments carry with them a higher level of risk than transmission investment. So, in our filing that we made on Friday, we did reiterate that position that they have already expressed. I think, from what's in the record perspective, the FERC has said that they don't have to be guided by that, by whatever the state-level ROE is, but in fact that they do view distribution or have viewed distribution as a more risky investment than transmission.","In our filing, we actually did have a base ROE that was equivalent to the 10.3% that we have here in California, but then we added to that the 50 basis point adder for CAISO, and then depending on what level of spend is in there for different projects that have incentives, you'll see something over that.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. And I just want to make sure and I'm looking at the CapEx slides you put out today, and the repeat of stuff you had our earlier. The CapEx does not include much for the transportation, electrification, and how much of the storage is actually in there?","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","So, in terms of the transportation electrification, storage, et cetera, the only thing we really have in here is the pilot for Charge Ready, which is about $12 million or so. There is Phase II of Charge Ready, which is the light-duty vehicle charging infrastructure CapEx, that's not in here yet. We have to file a report by next May on the pilot program. And then, in 2018, we'll file the application for the balance of that program.","The transportation electrification investment that we filed in the application in January, so, the medium and heavy duty charging infrastructure, as well as in those small or priority projects, none of that is in here. And the storage that we have in here is really related to \u2013 we have some storage in our GRC, so that's in the request. And so you'll see that in here, it's buried in there. And then the Aliso Canyon \u2013 the 40 megawatts of Aliso Canyon storage is in our numbers now. It's not \u2013 and it's flowing through rate base. It doesn't make a material difference, because it's relatively modest number so.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. And last things, which significant transmission projects still require major permits before they can go ahead with construction?","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","So, we have a number of projects that, as you know, we've disclosed in the 10-Q, West of Devers, Mesa, Alberhill, Riverside and Eldorado-Lugo-Mohave Upgrade. They're in various stages. West of Devers, as you know, we had some of the issues with the CPUC getting our Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity, that's all behind us. We've certainly still have some local permits that we need to obtain, but it's more of that nature. The Mesa Substation also we had some, I'd say, pushback on the CPUC end, but we've now obtained that. We're out for competitive bids on that. It's going to be done in two phases. So, one of them still yet to be done.","The Alberhill System is still going through a CPUC decision process. The final environmental impact report was issued, and it did reject various alternatives, but we're still going through that approval process, expecting that, obtain that in 2018. The Riverside Transmission Reliability Project, which is the fourth of the five disclosed projects, is really a joint project, and that is still going through its own process. We've agreed with some revisions that have been recommended for the project, but the CPUC is continuing to collect information on it.","And then, finally, the Eldorado-Lugo-Mohave Upgrade Project, we proposed an expedited schedule for that and the regulatory permitting agencies are still considering that. So, I would say we are in varying stages of approvals. Certainly West of Devers and Mesa, we've gotten through our CPUC process with those.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","And quite frankly, Michael, that's why we wanted to provide this increased level of disclosure over the last several cycles here, just because there are some big items in terms of \u2013 certainly those five projects. So we thought that it'd be good for investors to have a little bit more click-down visibility on that.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. Thank you, guys. Much appreciated.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","You bet.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Travis Miller of Morningstar. Your line is now open.","Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Good afternoon. Thank you.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Hi, Travis.","Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","I was wondering if there was anything within the EIX vision, all the different programs and thoughts (39:44) transportation electrification, and storage, where if you did not get CPUC approval through rate base, through the DRC that you could perhaps do those projects, invest that capital through, say, Edison Energy or some other unregulated, less regulated entity?","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Thanks for the question. I think when we talk about the California piece of the story and certainly the elements within Southern California, and we look at those elements like electric transportation or, as you will see in our white paper tomorrow, the emphasis on building electrification, water heaters, the use of \u2013 regular use of clean energy resources. At the core, I think most of that activity keeps coming back to the essential role for the grid being at the center of helping all that happen for the state of California.","But I think the focus, certainly, as we've been talking about some of these key elements with you all, the focus keeps going back to all of that being supportive of the long-term capital investment story at SCE, and being able to support the program at the $4-plus-billion a year level over \u2013 likely multiple rate case cycles.","There's always a possibility that any given other piece of work could be done outside the utility. I think again most of the \u2013 what we see that most of the impact of the company, it's less about, for example, you look at the charging infrastructure programs, we, to-date, have not really gotten into the actual ownership of the charter, right? Our focus has been on ensuring that the grid is sufficiently robust and modern to be able to accommodate the chargers that are going to be coming online. And then we provided support for customers doing that by, in the Charge Ready program, rate basing some of the customer side infrastructure up to, but not including the charger itself.","So, again, I think that the bulk of the capital story for us around these programs is the support for grid investment at SCE. Now, as we look outside of SCE and frankly outside of California, technology is opening up efficient electrification opportunities across a number of sectors. I do think that's a place where there's Edison Energy is advising large commercial-industrial customers that \u2013 I think folks understand what we're doing there, based on our August Edison Insights discussion, but I think that's a focus outside of the California story per se.","Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Okay. Great. I appreciate the color.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","That makes sense?","Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Yeah.","Operator","Thank you. The next question, we have Ali Agha back in queue of SunTrust, your line is now open.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Ali, you had us worried there. And you're back.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","I am back, Pedro. Thank you for letting me come back. I just wanted to clarify a point you'd made, when you talked about the SONGS proceedings going forward, most likely now, will be litigated and will come to a decision, does that mean that a potential for \u2013 or a re-potential for settlement, that is essentially now no longer a viable option, now it is litigation, that's the way we should be thinking about this?","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Ali, I think that would require us to speculate on whatever twists and turns continue to happen as we go towards a final decision. I would just make a general blanket statement frankly about any regulatory proceeding that's litigated that has at least two sides to the equation. We are always, as a matter of fact, open to hearing ideas that folks may have around different potential solutions short of a litigated outcome.","With SONGS in particular, we went through the meet-and-confer process, we went through the mediation, we were unable to get there. We can't comment on what happened inside the room, as I said before, because of the confidentiality issues. And so, that's not what we're focused right now. We're focused on our filing today and the conference coming up November 7 and the next steps after that. Like with anything in life, you never say never, if folks have different ideas as we walk down the pathway here. But we're surely very focused now on how we do high-quality filings in the rest of the process that the PUC is prescribing.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","I see. Understood. And, Maria, just one clarification from you. The tax benefit that you've been recording and getting over the course of this year. At the end, is it better to continue as we look forward, or do you think all the audits, et cetera, are done, or this could still be a swing factor going forward as well?","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","We haven't given guidance for our future years, Ali, but we've said before in terms of the different buckets of tax benefits, share-based compensation, people make their own decisions about when they're going to exercise their options, and so we can't really anticipate when and then if there'll be some benefits associated with that. In terms of the audits and the return to provision kinds of elements, we do every year have to true up our tax returns and, sometimes, it's up and sometimes it's down, but it varies. If you look at prior years, we've had some things that have gone in the opposite direction.","And then as far as audit settlements, we disclose what's still open in terms of audits. At the federal level, we're up through 12. We've completed all our audits. At the state, we still have a number of years that are open either in being audited or some subject still to examination that's because the state lags until the federal stuff has been resolved. We will continue provide disclosure around that as we get closer to when those things are completed.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Understood. Thank you.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Shahriar Pourreza of Guggenheim Partners. Your line is now open.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Hey, everyone.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Hi, Shar.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","So, most of my questions were answered, and I apologize I hopped in a little bit late here. But a lot of the timing of, sort of, the procedural items you discussed today is kind of unknown, but you're hoping to get closure with most of it by sometime in early 2018. You do have somewhat of a resource-constrained CPUC. Is there sort of any indirect impact to your procedural plans with sort of the Sonoma fires likely maybe inundating a lot of their time and resources? So, net-net, I guess, I'm asking, had the fires \u2013 I mean, could the fires push out any of your plans somewhat?","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Let me take it, Shar. And couple things on that; one, obviously, I think that the PUC and PG&E and a lot of state entities are all still grappling with the aftermath of the fires. So, that is a new piece of work, if you will, that hadn't been foreseen a month ago. And so, that certainly will require some work by some of the staff at the PUC. That said, I think the PUC always does a nice job at segmenting work across a various staff areas. So, I wouldn't expect that necessarily this would mean that all 700 staffers at the PUC are now turning their attention on this one topic. So, maybe long way of saying don't know, but I would speculate that while, let's say, wild fires may create a new amount of workload for the PUC, it doesn't necessarily mean that everything else stops or gets delayed.","The other thing I'd clarify though is, just to make sure that we're telegraphing precisely what we mean to all of you. As we pointed to two key proceedings here, the GRC and the SONGS proceeding, \u2013 in your question, you mentioned \u2013 it sounded like you had carried away in expectation that we'd be seeing decisions early in 2018. So I want to clarify, we did not say that. We did say that, in the GRC, we think it's very unlikely that we would see a PD coming out within 2017. So, that implies that we'd see a PD some time in 2018. Once that PD is issued \u2013 first of all, PDs can take a while to be issued. And secondly, once a PD is issued, then there's the process, until it actually gets adopted, is a final decision.","So, that's why we're not speculating at what point in 2018 or even in what year, we'd get a rate case decision. We would hope it would be in 2018, but we can't say with certainty. In the SONGS case, likewise, we pointed to an early 2018 date as the date in the SONGS ACR, the March date, March 2018 date by which the PUC expects to have completed hearings.","But again, after that, then you have the process of ultimately preparing a PD, and then, I mean, that become a final decision voted on by the PUC, and we're not speculating on what dates that might entail. But just with both of those, I would think it's probably further unlikely \u2013 certainly unlikely, we would have a SONGS decision in early 2018, since hearings wouldn't be completed until March. With the GRC, given that PDs usually take similar amount of time to get completed and we still have public participation hearings coming up here soon, I'd think it's probably also unlikely we'd have a final decision in the rate case in early 2018.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Understood. Thanks so much for the clarification. Thanks, guys.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Yeah. You bet.","Operator","Thank you. Speakers, that was the last question. I will turn the call back to Mr. Sam Ramraj.","Sam Ramraj - Edison International","Thank you very much for joining us today, and please call us, if you have any follow-up questions.

[Operator instructions.] ","I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Scott Cunningham, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Cunningham, you may begin your conference.","Scott Cunningham","Thanks, operator, and good afternoon everyone. Our principal speakers will be Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Ted Craver and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Jim Scilacci. Also here are the members of the management team.","The presentation that accompanies Jim's comments, the earnings press release, and our Form 10-K are available on our website at www.edisoninvestor.com. After the call, we will be posting Ted's and Jim's prepared remarks. Tomorrow afternoon, we will distribute our regular business update presentation for use in upcoming investor meetings. ","During this call, we will make forward-looking statements about the future outlook for Edison International and its subsidiaries. Actual results could differ materially from current expectations. ","Important factors that could cause different results are set forth in our SEC filings. Please read these carefully. The presentation includes certain outlook assumptions, as well as reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the nearest GAAP measure. ","During Q&A, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. I'll now turn the call over to Ted Craver.","Ted Craver","Thank you, Scott, and good afternoon everyone. We closed a good 2014 on a strong note. We delivered excellent financial performance. We resolved two major uncertainties, Edison Mission Energy and San Onofre. We meaningfully increased the dividend. We continued to fulfill the long term growth opportunity at Southern California Edison through our wires-focused investment strategy that supports California\u2019s environmental and growth objectives, and we continued to selectively pursue growth opportunities that allow us to serve additional customers outside of SCE\u2019s service territory.","Most gratifying to me is that we delivered on what we told investors we would do. I\u2019m proud of this leadership team and the outstanding work of our employees. That said, we fully recognize that 2014 is over, and we are in a new year. We need to build on the performance of 2014 and continue to build value.","With the strong fourth quarter, full year 2014 core earnings were $4.59 per share, an increase of 21% over the previous year. This result was well above our updated guidance from last fall. Jim Scilacci will cover the details in his comments. ","The settlements reached on the EME bankruptcy and SONGS order instituting investigation position us to move forward decisively in a time of tremendous change in our industry. The unanimous approval by the California Public Utilities Commission of the SONGS settlement agreement last November demonstrated that it is possible to resolve complex and important regulatory matters through settlement. ","The settlement was the product of tough negotiations among the initial settling parties: the Utility Reform Network, or TURN; the Office of Rate Payer Advocate; and the two utilities, and later, other interveners signed on to the settlement. The settlement has been widely supported as fair and balanced. SCE is now proceeding with implementation of the approved agreement. We are also deeply engaged in the planning and early stages of decommissioning the plant. ","SCE will continue to work aggressively to maximize potential financial recoveries from insurers and from Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. I\u2019m hopeful SCE will be able to resolve the insurance claims this year. ","Under the provisions of the settlement agreement, virtually all insurance proceeds, if any, will go to customers. The arbitration process with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries must follow International Chamber of Commerce rules, which means it will be a slower process. I don\u2019t expect any decision until 2016.","The MHI arbitration proceeding is confidential, so we won\u2019t be able to say much. However, we continue to assert the claims we first presented to the International Chamber of Commerce in 2013. ","Our nearly 18% dividend increase in early December underscores our optimism about the future and our commitment to bringing our dividend payout closer to that of the industry. We expect to extend our record of 11 years of annual dividend increases while stepping up the pace of dividend growth to exceed that of earnings. This will allow us to return to our target payout ratio of 45% to 55% of earnings in steps over time. ","Let me now provide some longer-term thoughts. On January 5, in his State of the State speech, Governor Brown outlined his broad goals for the next stage in addressing climate change. By 2030, he wants to derive 50% of the state\u2019s electricity from renewable sources, reduce petroleum and cars and trucks by 50%, and double the efficiency of existing buildings.","In his speech, he said, \u201cAll of this is a very tall order. It means that we continue to transform our grid, our transportation system, and even our communities.\u201d He continued, saying, \u201cI envision a wide range of initiatives: more distributed power, expanded rooftop solar, micro grids, an energy imbalance market, batter storage, the full integration of information technology and electrical distribution, and millions of electric and low carbon vehicles.\u201d","But the state\u2019s ambition and overall direction is clear. In broad strokes, we at Edison have been painting a similar picture of the future of the power system. Importantly, our growth strategy is aligned accordingly. Of course, the devil\u2019s in the details. Some of the regulatory framework to implement this vision will require legislative action, and that process has already started in Sacramento. ","We will be actively engaged on the legislative front. One of our larger priorities will be achieving policy goals at the lowest cost to customers. We see the need to expand California\u2019s renewable portfolio standard beyond the current regime of only recognizing large scale wholesale contracted projects to recognize the benefits of distributed generation, energy efficiency, and electric vehicle charging. ","The three-year general rate case cycle provides a broad framework to incorporate other initiatives such as the distribution resource plan required to be filed this summer. The CPUC recently issued its final guidance on the distribution plan elements. We anticipate that our plan will create something of a roadmap for the distribution system investments at Southern California Edison needed to realize the governor\u2019s vision.","Some elements of the plan are already in process, including initiatives on energy storage, residential rate design, and electric vehicle charging. California\u2019s commitment to creating a low carbon economy does not necessarily conflict with SCE\u2019s core mission of delivering safe, reliable, and affordable electricity.","SCE\u2019s current general rate case will establish the revenue requirement and scope of work to achieve both. The record for the rate case was completed in late January. The GRC is now in the hands of the administrative law judges to develop a proposed decision. We expect a decision sometime in 2015.","So with that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Jim Scilacci.","Jim Scilacci","Thanks, Ted. Good afternoon everyone. My comments will cover fourth quarter and full year 2014 earnings, our updated capital spending and rate base forecast, and cost of capital. As we have previously stated, we will not provide 2015 earnings guidance until SCE receives its 2015 general rate case decision. ","In this presentation, I will, however, discuss assumptions relevant to our 2015 earnings. Please turn to page two. ","In the fourth quarter of 2014, SCE earned $1.09 per share or $0.30 ahead of last year. This increase was driven by many of the same factors we have been seeing during 2014, including higher revenue of $0.28 partially offset by depreciation of $0.08, net tax benefits and other items of $0.04, and O&M savings of $0.05. ","There are also two items of note that are included in the $0.28 of higher revenue, and both of them were not included in our updated earnings guidance that we provided last October. First, we recorded $0.05 of additional revenue from resolution of an open item from our 2012 GRC decision. ","During 2014, SCE obtained an IRS private letter ruling regarding appropriate treatment of net operating loss carryforwards. The net effect of the ruling was to increase CPUC rate base and revenues. In November, we obtained a CPUC approval authorizing the additional revenues. ","Second, you may recall that during the third quarter call, we thought that the energy efficiency awards might be delayed until 2015. As things turned out, we received our award in December, and it amounted to $0.04 per share.","In the fourth quarter, the net SONGS impact on core earnings was a positive $0.02 per share compared to last year. Our fourth quarter results include recognition of revenue for the rate of return on the SONGS regulatory asset. We also had a $0.05 benefit from lower O&M costs. The largest item was lower severance expense.","Taxes and other items were a net benefit of $0.04 per share, led by $0.07 in higher income tax benefits. Most of this relates to repair deductions that we talked about previously. ","At the Edison International parent company level, results were a loss of $0.01 per share, compared to income of $0.02 per share last year, which is mainly due to the income from Edison Capital and tax benefits.","The loss of $0.01 this quarter includes higher income from Edison Capital and lower tax benefits. As we have indicated, Edison Capital\u2019s remaining low income housing portfolio continues to wind down as units are sold.","Turning to noncore items, SCE recorded a net $0.08 per share benefit during the fourth quarter from a revised estimate of the impact of the SONGS settlement. There are a number of items that make up the $0.08, including the return on SONGS regulatory asset from April 1 through September 30 of this year and an accrual of a contribution to the University of California for greenhouse gas research. ","At the parent, we also recorded $0.12 per share benefit in discontinued operations related to resolution of uncertain tax positions from settlement of our 2003 to 2006 federal income tax years and other tax impacts related to EME.","As a reminder, EIX has net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards from EME that will be monetized in future years as part of our settlement with EME creditors. These tax benefits were approximately $1.1 billion at year end.","We also recorded $0.01 per share net benefit at the holding company related to allocation of income tax attributes to tax equity investors and projects developed by SoCore Energy on what is called the Hypothetical Liquidation at Book Value, or HLBV, accounting method. Because HLBV accounting procedures produces income not related to project portfolio performance, we classify this income as noncore.","Please turn to page three. For the full year, core earnings were $4.59 per share, versus $3.80 in 2013. For SCE, this improvement is mainly due to rate base growth. Year-end 2014 rate base was $23.3 billion, a $2.2 billion increase over the prior year. In addition, SCE recorded higher net tax benefits totaling $0.16 per share, principally from repair deductions and resolution of uncertain tax positions. A number of other smaller items complete the picture.","At the holding company, core losses were comparable to last year at $0.09 per share. This remains lower than expected, primarily due to higher income from Edison Capital. I know many of you are interested in tracking our earnings relative to our guidance, so I\u2019ll cover that next. ","Please turn to page four. This slide shows a reconciliation of core earnings to guidance over the full year period. I will focus on the final three months of the year, that took us from $4.30 midpoint guidance in October to actual core earnings of $4.59. As you can see, the increase is $0.29.","First, it\u2019s $0.10 per share of income tax benefits from additional repair and cost of removal deductions recorded in the fourth quarter. Next are the two items I mentioned earlier, the $0.05 per share benefit from the revised determination of rate base and $0.04 of energy efficiency awards. The balance relates to cost savings and a number of small items at $0.05 per share. Holding company core results were $0.04 per share better than expected, primarily due to Edison Capital\u2019s affordable housing project revenues. ","Please turn to page five. SCE\u2019s capital spending forecast changed slightly from our prior forecast, due to timing of transmission capital expenditures. Actual 2014 capital spending totaled $4 billion, $100 million below our forecast. Our outlook for 2015 spending is down $100 million and up $200 million in 2016. Please note we continue to use the 12% variability between the range and request capital expenditure forecast. ","Please turn to page six. Our rate base forecast remains consistent with the 7% to 9% compound annual growth rates. Based on a number of changes, we\u2019ve revised downward our rate base forecast by a net $300 million by 2017. As the slide shows, this reflects an average reduction of $400 million from bonus depreciation, an average reduction of $100 million for timing of transmission spending, and a positive $200 million adjustment upward to update deferred taxes related to our SmartConnect project. ","Please note that the capital spending and rate base forecasts do not include electric vehicle charging, energy storage, or distribution resource planned expenditures. The lion\u2019s share of this future spending will likely occur beyond the current forecast period.","Please turn to page seven. This page updates the interest rate trends for the CPUC cost of capital trigger mechanism. Recently, CPUC approved a one-year extension of our cost of capital mechanism. We must now file our 2017 cost of capital application in April 2016. The trigger mechanism will remain in effect for 2016. However, based on the movement of the Moody\u2019s BAA bond index thus far, it seems unlikely that the current return on common equity of 10.45% would change for 2016. ","Our FERC filed rate settlement remains in place through the end of 2017. Under the settlement, the return on common equity can be reopened after June 30 of this year. ","Next, I\u2019d like to touch on some financial considerations related to 2015 earnings, given the absence of guidance. Please turn to page eight. On this page, we have included some important factors to consider in refining your earnings estimates until we can provide formal guidance. The capital spending and rate base forecasts are taken from pages four and five of this presentation. ","Both CPUC and FERC return on common equity remain unchanged at 10.45%. We have some carryover items on energy efficiency awards from prior years. The potential earnings opportunity for 2015 is up to $0.05 rather than the more typical $0.03 per single year. Please keep in mind that some of the carryover items will likely be contested by other parties, and there is no assurance that energy efficiency earnings will be approved. ","Another positive item is the completion in January of the SONGS regulatory assets financing. The approved settlement let SCE finance this asset with 100% debt. The settlement also requires that we share with our customers the cost savings of this financing if the rate is below the 2.62% return on the regulatory asset. ","SCE completed this financing with a weighted average cost of debt of 2.2%. The blended average rate increases over time due to debt amortization. After the cost sharing with customers, there is a very modest earnings benefit. However, the financing has the added benefit of ultimately freeing up approximately $400 million of common equity. As we recover the regulatory asset, this amount will decline over time. ","At year-end 2014, SCE\u2019s 13-month weighted average equity ratio for regulatory purposes was 48.4%. The SONGS regulatory asset totaled $1.288 billion at year-end 2014. Of this amount, $919 million earns the 2.62% return, $345 million earns a commercial paper rate, and the balance earns no return.","For 2015 and beyond, we believe that the return on SONGS regulatory assets will roughly match the financing costs. I will also remind you that our quarter earnings results will not reflect the revenues requested in the 2015 GRC, and accordingly won\u2019t have the typical profile during the year. Until we receive a final GRC decision, we plan to record revenues based on the 2014 authorized revenue requirement. ","Please turn to page nine. The next slide highlights the details of our dividend policy that Ted has already touched on. I\u2019d like to reinforce our view that EIX has one of the better opportunities among large cap utilities for rate base, earnings, and dividend growth. ","Please turn to page ten. This last slide captures our strategic framework. Ted has touched on many of the major points already. To summarize, we are very focused on delivering on our organic growth opportunity. We have good growth visibility from our wire spending and the prospect for continued growth from a number of new initiatives. Moreover, as we have previously said, we will continue to work to optimize our cost structure and improve our operational efficiency.","Thanks. I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions.] The first question comes from Michael Weinstein with UBS. ","Michael Weinstein","I wanted to ask kind of a bigger picture question here, as we\u2019re thinking about this roadmap that you all are getting ready to file. And I hear you in the broader elements here. You\u2019ve got storage, you\u2019ve got efficiency, you\u2019ve got renewables in the background. What\u2019s going to be different versus the individual dockets here that we have filed? How does this bring it together? How does this, from your perspective, change the capital spending plan? And perhaps it\u2019s the different time period, but just could you elaborate a little bit?","Jim Scilacci","I\u2019ll start out, then I\u2019ll turn it over to Pedro for some additional comments. So the filing is coming up in the second quarter, or the first part of the third quarter, and we have a series of questions that PUC has asked us to address. A lot of them are really what\u2019s happening in the system and how we plan to address it to encourage and incorporate more distributed energy resources in a distribution system.","At least the initial filing is not an investment filing. It\u2019s really a description of what needs to be done, and from our view. Others will have, I\u2019m sure, different views. We will subsequently follow that up with probably some type of application or alternatively, we\u2019ll include in our 2018 general rate case request the actual expenditures associated with this new plan.","And from an overall perspective, stepping back and thinking about our capital expenditures, we\u2019ve said that capital expenditures on average have been running about $4 billion a year. And we don\u2019t want to suggest that these new programs either will take it up or drop it down. We think that generally going forward capital expenditures will stay in that same zone, even with these new initiatives. ","So I\u2019ll pause there and turn it over to Pedro for additional elaboration, if you\u2019d like to add anything. ","Pedro Pizarro ","No, Jim, I think you covered it very well. And the July 1 filing has a fairly [unintelligible] set of questions that the PUC has posed, and they really go to the nuts and bolts of how will the grid need to evolve in order to accommodate deployment of distributed energy resources and look at the grid\u2019s capacity to integrate them, look at things like the [locational] value at various points across our grid. And so a piece of this is mechanical, but there\u2019s a broader piece around how does the grid continue to evolve and [unintelligible] raise questions and provide some insights on what are some of the technologies and what\u2019s the evolution of that grid over time. ","And then as Jim said, we haven\u2019t determined this yet, but we\u2019ll have the option of either including investment opportunities that we see in our future rate case cycles. Potentially, there might be an opportunity to do a separate filing if we saw a very pressing near term need, but that\u2019s work that we have underway right now in determining what those next steps are and developing the filing for July 1. ","Michael Weinstein ","Excellent. And perhaps a follow up, and once again, congratulations on the overall results for the year, but given how successful the cost savings were, particularly relative to the October 28 guidance, what exactly is that saying year over year for the run rate through most of this year in terms of the cost savings. In the [unintelligible] sense\/other, is there any way to read that into 2015 without providing guidance here?","Jim Scilacci ","We can\u2019t. We have the general rate case. We really have to answer that first question, how the PUC establishes the authorized level of revenue requirements, then we\u2019ll have an opportunity after that to come back out and give you our views on what it could be. But I just want to emphasize, we will continue, as I said in my script, to look for opportunities to reduce our costs.","Operator","Your next question comes from Steven Fleishman with Wolfe Research.","Steven Fleishman","Jim, maybe just on the slide eight, of the factors. So, just simplistically, would you suggest a simple kind of rate base, times equity, times ROE, plus the energy efficiency, and no AFDC earnings, we should assume, and nothing meaningfully from the SONGS items? And that\u2019s as simple as that?","Jim Scilacci ","Yeah, I think that\u2019s what we\u2019re strongly suggesting you go towards, because you have visibility on rate base and rate base growth, and then return on common equity, obviously, is not changing. We\u2019re not changing the share count. The energy efficiency is going to be somewhere in that 3% to 5% range, and we won\u2019t know until later on in the year if there\u2019s an opportunity for anything beyond that, or the hurdle that we\u2019re going to have to climb over. So I think that\u2019s the best and safest way to do it for now. ","Steven Fleishman ","And I guess the one other missing piece is just the parent drag, which came in a little bit better with this Edison Capital income. Is that something that we should continue to see get a little better, or should we go back to the $0.10 to $0.15 that\u2019s typically been a drag?","Jim Scilacci ","I think we\u2019ve indicated that the parent spending is a little over a penny a month, and we see that\u2019s probably the appropriate level. And what\u2019s been happening either tax benefits or sale of property through Edison Capital has come through. And we don\u2019t forecast the Edison Capital side. It\u2019s more serendipity if anything else. So I think it\u2019s better to look at the actual run rate of costs, absent these other things. ","Operator","Your next question comes from Ashar Khan with Visium. ","Ashar Khan","Jim, what you\u2019re suggesting is that the SONGS will reap zero earnings per share to the bottom line?","Jim Scilacci ","Yeah, I should have mentioned that. Steve asked that question. Thanks for picking it up. And what I said in my prepared remarks was we believe that the return on the regulatory asset, that portion that\u2019s earning 2.62%, and the financing that we put in place, they tend to offset one another. So therefore, there won\u2019t be any earnings going to the bottom line for San Onofre going forward.","The other piece we talked about, there\u2019s a significant amount of nuclear fuel, which we were already financing with 100% debt at a commercial paper rate. So that seems to be match funded. So net-net, I don\u2019t see any change from that going forward that we should expect any earnings from San Onofre besides the cost.","Scott, want to add anything?","Scott Cunningham","Just the other thing, just to remind everyone, we had already taken SONGS out of the rate base at the time of our announcement. So it has been out for some period of time, so the rate base comparisons are apples and apples.","Ashar Khan","And then secondly, Jim, the equity ratio that you gave us, the 13-month average, did that take out SONGS through this new financing mechanism that you mentioned? So SONGS is out of it, and you\u2019re at 48.4? Did I hear that correct?","Jim Scilacci ","So, SONGS doesn\u2019t come out of the regulatory capital structure until after we did the financing. So it\u2019s included in the 48.4 that I mentioned, and now it comes out when we do the financing. And the financing wasn\u2019t completed until January, so when we release first quarter earnings, you\u2019ll be able to see the actual equity ratio based, say, on SONGS.","Ashar Khan ","So that would, then, theoretically increase the equity ratio, right, once that thing goes out? Am I correct?","Jim Scilacci ","Yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from Stephen Byrd from Morgan Stanley.","Stephen Byrd","Wondered if you could just talk at a high level about the latest data play in terms of the dialog on net metering policy. I know there\u2019s a proceeding and review underway, but I\u2019m just curious, as you see the debate continue to unfold, any comments you might have on that debate.","Jim Scilacci ","We\u2019re in the midst of a multiple phase at the commission, and it\u2019s teed up. The next slate of decisions we\u2019ll be getting from the commission has to do with the [fixed] charges and the tiers, and then after that, we have the net energy metering, the new tariff associated with that. And I\u2019ll pause here and look over at Pedro. Is there anything else? Maybe the timeframe, of when we\u2019re expecting it?","Pedro Pizarro ","I think you covered it right. I think on the tiers and [unintelligible] charges, we\u2019re expecting a determination from the commission in the second quarter, if things stay on good timing. And then the NEM would be later in the year. ","Stephen Byrd ","Okay, so we\u2019ll just watch that. I guess just separately, away from the utility, as you think about your renewables strategy broadly, again outside of the utility, as you see the business continuing to evolve, any high level thoughts we should be thinking about? I know you\u2019ve talked a lot in the past about looking at how the business is going to change, and obviously there\u2019s a lot of changes on the utility side, but just curious, outside of that, anything lately in terms of strategic thinking on renewables beyond the utility?","Ted Craver","I\u2019ll take a crack at this. Very broadly speaking, as I kind of indicated in my opening comments, we see the potential in the competitive businesses to serve customers outside of the 50,000 square mile territory of Southern California Edison. Most of the work that we\u2019ve done up to this point has been focused more on commercial and industrial customers outside of the territory. ","Second to that, I would say, are various potential electrification initiatives. So these would be projects that would further electrification. We think that actually fits into a lot of the effort across the country, but particularly here in California, to move towards a low carbon economy, moving towards higher levels of electrification in, say, the transportation sector, goods movement, water, some of the other areas. All of that helps move the economy towards a lower carbon footprint. So those are kind of the second bucket of areas that we\u2019re continuing to look at. ","Final point I\u2019ll make is we\u2019ve tried to be fairly high level about the things that we\u2019re looking at on that side. I think you know us well enough by now, we don\u2019t like to come out with a lot of fanfare up front. We\u2019d rather see what we can deliver and then talk about that. So at this point, most of the effort is on the distributed generation activities around SoCore and how that fits into our kind of broader strategy on the commercial and industrial customer side.","Operator","Your next question comes from Hugh Wynne with Sanford Bernstein.","Hugh Wynne","You all have mentioned on a couple of occasions the governor\u2019s vision for the upgrading of the grid, and also the need to continue to replace aging components and improve the reliability of your existing grid. Looking forward to your capex program in a longer timeframe, would you be surprised to see the more or less $4.5 billion rate of capex that you\u2019re forecasting for 2015, 2016, 2017 to continue into the next GRC or would you be expecting factors to come into play that would move that $4.5 billion materially up or materially down?","Jim Scilacci ","I think what we\u2019re attempting to say, and I struggled with it in an earlier question, my response was I think the $4 billion is probably in the right zone, and we\u2019ll just have to see how things unfold. If you go through the piece parts, distribution has been stepping up in the total level of expenditures over the last several GRCs, and we\u2019re still working to get our replacement rates to levels that we think we need to be at to maintain the reliability of the electric system. So you could see distribution step up somewhat more from where we are today. ","Transmission is related to some of these large projects that we have flowing through, and we had very modest transmission spending in years past, and that stepped up as a result of all the renewable interconnections that we were doing. Generation has typically been a very small part of our overall equation. It was really just replacement capital expenditures, mainly at our nuclear plants, and it\u2019s dropped down to maybe about $100 million a year. ","Going forward, we\u2019ll have to see, as we lay out the distribution resources plan, how significant and how fast the commission would want to move to make some of these improvements. We\u2019ve put out numbers on the electric vehicle charging. It\u2019s approximately $350 million over a multiyear period of time. There\u2019s some storage expenditures. So I think it\u2019s best and safest to assume that that $4 billion is probably the appropriate level until we can get more information in the public domain.","Ted Craver ","Let me just throw in one other piece. I think a big consideration here is how fast you want to move towards modernizing the grid, converting it from largely an electromechanical system to a more digitized system capable of two-way flows of electricity, so on and so forth, all the stuff you\u2019ve heard us talk about before.","If you envision doing that over a three to five year period, then I think you\u2019ll probably be looking at higher numbers. If you envision doing that over a five to seven year period, it tamps it down a little bit. If you envision doing it over a ten year period, more modest yet. So I think a big component of trying to sort this through is the pace with which these investments get made, not just the absolute number. ","Operator","Your next question comes from Ali Agha with SunTrust.","Ali Agha ","My question, Ted, perhaps for you, wanted to dial a little more into your thinking on the dividend. And when you talk about getting to your targeted payout ratio over time, there\u2019s a range there to get, you know, to the middle of that range. But the reason I bring it up is when we run the math on the rate base math, as Jim alluded to, for the core earnings power of the utility, it\u2019s going to be significantly lower than what you\u2019ve reported in 2014 with all the tax benefits and cost savings, etc., that we had to [unintelligible] in the GRC. So arguably, one could argue you\u2019re pretty much close to the low end of that range, if you run the math, along those lines. So I\u2019m just curious, when you talk about still stepping up, what is it that you\u2019re envisioning for this dividend? ","Ted Craver ","You\u2019ve put your finger on a really good point. I think we\u2019ve tended to think of it more in terms of what I would call the sustainable or durable earnings. It\u2019s always hard to predict, certainly 2014 was a good case of it, just how much you\u2019re going to have in the way of some of these other earnings points. ","And of course I guess it\u2019s possible you could have years where you end up having some of the more unusual items that work against you, but fundamentally, we kind of look at it as the core earnings power of the utility and the dividend is tied to SCE\u2019s earnings. It really is the rate base model. ","So that\u2019s the way we tend to look at it. All of that said, you\u2019ll see continued significant growth in rate base and therefore we see good growth in earnings. And in order to move the payout ratio up, we expect the growth rate in dividend increases to be higher than the growth rate in earnings. Otherwise, we won\u2019t make any progress on moving the payout ratio up. ","Ali Agha ","Understood. But just to clarify, the goal is not to necessarily just get to the lower end and say hey, we\u2019re there. The goal is to be somewhere in the middle of that range that you\u2019ve given us?","Ted Craver ","Well, of course I won\u2019t take the bait to pinpoint where it will be inside the 45% to 55% payout ratio, but that\u2019s the target that we\u2019ve had, and I think we look at all of the factors, including what do we see the forward run rate in rate base growth, because that\u2019s really what will drive earnings. And as I\u2019ve said, we see good solid growth in rate base, therefore earnings, therefore dividends.","Ali Agha ","And second question, if I could, unrelated to that, Jim, when you talked about that penny a month sort of run rate drag for the parent, just remind me, does that include any contribution from your non-utility activity, sort of in there? And assuming your vision plays out as you expect for the non-utility business, when do you think you\u2019d be in a position to break that out as a separate segment? ","Jim Scilacci ","It\u2019s a good question, on breaking out the separate segment. It\u2019s too small now to justify doing that. We tried to provide, when you look at the K, some additional information in terms of the investment levels. But a little bit more than $0.01 a month was just in totality on a normal run rate basis, and it excluded activities at Edison Capital, which are very hard to forecast or predict. So without Edison Capital, and any other tax benefits, we think in the normal course, we\u2019d be hitting about a little over a penny a month. So you can do the math there, and it\u2019s consistent with what we\u2019ve said in the past. ","Operator","The next question comes from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.","Michael Lapides","Jim, just kind of a quick update. You\u2019ve got a significant under-recovered fuel balance, kind of the ERA that\u2019s outstanding. Can you talk about whether that ERA will grow some more, meaning the under-recovered balance will become a larger balance, or when that will convert to cash for SoCal Ed?","Jim Scilacci ","Good question. There\u2019s many parts associated with that, and I think when you have a chance to take a look at our K, there\u2019s a full description in our disclosures that breaks down the piece parts. But we\u2019re hoping, if the commission renders a final decision in the 2015 ERA proceeding, which is before them now, that we should be fully collected in our under-collection by year-end. ","And the piece parts coming to help that are the rate increase and the SONGS settlement allows us to transfer some of the over-collections to that under-collection. And another critical piece is our decommissioning decision, because we had dollars that were spent for decommissioning, but once we get approval to get access to the decommissioning trust, we\u2019ll transfer those dollars over to the ERA under-collection. And hopefully by year-end, we\u2019ll be in good shape. ","And obviously, the thing that\u2019s going to change that up or down is what happens with gas prices. And based on the forecasts we used for 2015, I know for a fact that we\u2019re probably under-running the actual expenditures, because we used a higher forecast than gas prices are right now. ","Michael Lapides ","So, to simplify, that $1.2 billion or so should convert to cash over the next 12 months, cash that improves the balance sheet of SoCal Ed. How do you think about utilizing that cash?","Jim Scilacci ","Well, some of it\u2019s just moving from one side of the pocket to the other, because we had the dollars sitting, and then we just transferred over as part of the SONGS settlement. And some of it we have commercial paper borrowings to support the under-collections. And those will go to [unintelligible] those short term borrowings. Net-net-net, we probably won\u2019t have much in the way of excess cash. We\u2019ll have excess equity, as we talked about, from the SONGS regulatory asset financing. But most of the cash is going to be used to pay off other things that are maybe outstanding or help to fund capital expenditures going on in the utility.","Michael Lapides ","Last thing, when you look at the holding company level debt, both short term and long term, it looks like it\u2019s up a bit year over year, kind of in the 2013 into 2014. Can you talk about what your goal is in terms of how much both short term and long term debt you want to carry at the holdco level?","Jim Scilacci ","Yeah, that\u2019s a good question. We have outstanding a $400 million note that comes due I think in 2017, if I\u2019m not mistaken. And we\u2019re considering what to do with that now. We added additional commercial paper borrowings and obviously note payables to the EME creditors. The total obligation was $600 million. We paid $200 million. We\u2019ve got two more payments of $200 million in September this year and September of next year for $400 million. ","And the whole source of repayment for the majority of the borrowings we have outstanding today really will be from the monetization of the EME tax benefits. I said in my script, we\u2019ve got $1.1 billion of NOLs and tax credit carryforwards, and if we don\u2019t get an extension of bonus depreciation in 2015, likely SCE will be fully taxable as it runs off its NOLs, and it will be then paying taxes to the federal government. Bonus doesn\u2019t apply to state government, State of California, so we\u2019re obviously paying taxes for the state. And then we\u2019ll start rapidly amortizing EME benefits. ","One of the wildcards here we\u2019ll have to consider, and Ted mentioned in his comments, if we do get resolution of the SONGS litigation with MHI, we would look to take an abandonment loss in the year that\u2019s resolved. We have to file a private letter ruling and we\u2019ll take a writeoff. And so that could affect the full timing of the monetization of the tax benefits, but I think it\u2019s going to take it out to 2017, possibly in early 2018, and fully amortize off the $1.1 billion of EME tax benefits. ","Operator","Your next question comes from Travis Miller with Morningstar. ","Travis Miller","I was wondering about the operating costs savings here. How much of that is in the 2015 to 2017 GRC? To the extent that you guys got more operating cost savings than perhaps were in the GRC request, is there any potential to go back and adjust that? Could regulators come back and say, no, we need to adjust your operating cost forecasts? Or are we signed, sealed, and delivered here and just waiting for the commission?","Jim Scilacci ","So, the full case is before the commission. The hearings occurred in January, and so it\u2019s off to the ALJs to draft a proposed decision. Included in the case were some O&M savings that we identified as we were preparing the case, and we\u2019re proposing that we would share 50% of those potential savings. ","And beyond that, I can\u2019t comment. I don\u2019t know what the commission\u2019s going to do, or what the ALJs may propose, and we\u2019ll just have to see how it ultimately unfolds. But one point I just want to emphasize, we will continue to look for cost savings to try to improve our efficiencies.","Travis Miller ","So there is a chance the regulators could come back and talk about the request, but not necessarily likely.","Jim Scilacci ","We\u2019ll just have to see what they come back with. We won\u2019t know until we get a proposed decision. ","Operator","The next question comes from Steven Fleishman with Wolfe Research.","Steven Fleishman ","Just a separate follow up question. Ted, maybe you could just give us a little bit of color of, you know, we see all the headlines on PG&E and ex parte issues, and then you made one potential ex parte filing. Just how much is this impacting the ability to function on the normal things that you have to get done at the commission, including getting the GRC done? And also, just how should we think about the risk of you potentially having additional ex parte filings?","Ted Craver ","In terms of affecting the business, I would say it doesn\u2019t really have a significant effect on the business. This is a fairly arcane area, but I would just say generally speaking, the ex parte rules, particularly on matters like the San Onofre matter, the OII, that\u2019s really designed to provide equal access to all parties to the proceeding with equal time. ","So I think one of the misconceptions in something like SONGS OII is that you\u2019re precluded from having conversations. You\u2019re not. It\u2019s just the rules are designed to make sure that if we have conversations with decision makers, that those are noticed, that we include in there how much time we spent with which decision maker, so that all the other parties have the equal access, equal amount of time. That\u2019s the whole concept behind it. ","So I don\u2019t see any of this as hurting the ability to do business. It\u2019s complicated and cumbersome, and sometimes kind of difficult on the interpretation of some of the specific provisions, but fundamentally, when we have proceedings before the commission, we follow the rules, we go about doing the business the way it\u2019s really set up to do it. There\u2019s plenty of opportunity in all of those proceedings for all parties to be heard. That\u2019s kind of the point of having these things before the commission. ","So I don\u2019t see any big element there. And I got so warmed up on that part of the question, I forgot the second part of your question. ","Steven Fleishman ","I guess just the impact on getting your GRC done. More just because the commission is so in the spotlight and dealing with this.","Ted Craver ","I don\u2019t see it. I mean, I\u2019ll choose my words a little carefully here. We are pretty soon going to be in the third month of 2015, the GRC was supposed to be completed at the end of last year. Just like three years ago, we\u2019re already now well into the next year. That makes it a little more complicated to run the business, but I don\u2019t see that as being the result of ex parte stuff or any of that. That\u2019s just the process of getting through a very complicated proceeding, like a GRC. So I would say generally, I don\u2019t see it having any big impact. ","Operator","The next question comes from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.","Michael Lapides ","Real quick, there\u2019s both a lawsuit proceeding as well as a re-hearing request to unwind the SONGS OII settlement. Can you just talk about the process for both of those, and kind of what the complainants are seeking, or what their grounds are?","Jim Scilacci ","Let me introduce Adam Umanoff. He is our EIX general counsel. He joined us in January. We\u2019re happy to have him. So, Adam, could you pick up that question?","Adam Umanoff","Sure, Jim. Happy to do so. Good afternoon. You asked about the application for re-hearing and a federal lawsuit. I\u2019ll take them one at a time. An application for re-hearing was filed by the Coalition to Decommission San Onofre, and that was filed in the end of last year, mid-December 2014. ","They\u2019re basically asking for the California Public Utility Commission to reconsider their decision approving the SONGS settlement. And the basis for their request is a bunch of alleged procedural irregularities in the proceeding undertaken by the CPUC. ","It\u2019s our view that there really is no legitimate basis for the CPUC to overturn the settlement based upon the theories advanced by the Coalition to Decommission San Onofre, but of course that\u2019s for the CPUC to decide.","All the parties to the SONGS settlement have filed a joint response in early January, rejecting the request for a re-hearing. The CPUC does not operate under a firm deadline to respond, but they normally respond within three to five months, so we should expect to hear from the CPUC by the middle of March to the middle of May.","Separately, another plaintiff, Citizen\u2019s Oversight, who happens to be represented by the same lawyer who represents the Coalition to Decommission San Onofre, filed a federal court action down in San Diego and basically raised some constitutional theories that the SONGS settlement was an impermissible taking of rate payer property.","That suit was filed in November of 2014. Both we and the CPUC filed motions to dismiss at the end of January. There will be some further paperwork back and forth as the plaintiff replies and we again reply in February and March. And if all goes well, we expect a decision from the federal court in April of 2015. So in a couple of months.","Operator","That was the last question. I will now turn the call back to Mr. Cunningham.

Presentation includes certain outlook assumptions as well as reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to the nearest GAAP measure. During Q&A, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up.","I'll now turn the call over to Pedro.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Thank you, Scott, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm excited and also humbled to be here on this first earnings call with Maria in our new roles. I want to thank Ted Craver and Jim Scilacci for all of their help in our transition over the summer. I also thank many of you who Ted and I had an opportunity to visit in September.","While the main purpose of our visits was to share our key messages on continuity of leadership and continuity of strategy, I believe I benefited the most from the visit as the dialog helped me a great deal. I look forward to our continued discussion and our team will strive hard to maintain our commitment to transparency and full engagement with our investors.","In today's call, Maria will cover the financial results, so I will focus on the recent strategic developments at SCE and in California that will help shape Edison International's long-term growth. I'll start with the SCE's 2018 General Rate Case filed September 1. This filing demonstrates SCE's commitment to three key strategy elements.","First: maintain a safe and reliable wires network. Second: be a key enabler of California's commitment to addressing climate change through significant greenhouse gas reduction led by our proposed grid modernization efforts to support widespread adoption of solar, storage, electric vehicle charging and other technologies. And finally, continue our operational excellence journey to achieve top quartile performance in safety, reliability, customer satisfaction and cost. We believe we have made a strong case for our strategy and for the requested funding levels in our rate case filing.","Recently, CPUC President Picker and two administrative law judges were assigned to the case. President Picker is also leading the broader proceeding, looking at distribution resource plans, which is addressing many of the policy and technical details of solar and other distributed energy resources. Having the same Commissioner overseeing these two highly interrelated proceedings should prove very constructive.","We're also hopeful that the comments President Picker made at the CPUC's June 23 meeting regarding the need for timelier general rate case decisions will set the tone for SCE's rate case. We will look to do our part. Based on past practice, we should receive a proposed schedule shortly. Last week, SCE held the first of several GRC workshops, which was well attended including by both of the assigned ALJs.","We had lots of good questions and comments by various parties regarding both the traditional GRC elements as well as SCE's grid modernization proposals. The grid modernization efforts included in the GRC request will support California's implementation of Senate Bill 32 signed by Governor Brown on September 8.","This legislation requires the states to cut greenhouse gas emissions 40% below 1990 levels by 2030 in order to help address global climate change. California has led the way over the past decades with progressive policies across renewables, energy efficiency, vehicle fuel standards and cap and trade.","According to the California Air Resources Board's most recent report using 2014 data, these actions have all helped California achieve greenhouse gas emissions that are only 3% higher than 1990 levels over a time period when California's population grew 30%.","Keeping greenhouse gas emissions roughly constant over 24 years of population and economic growth was a remarkable achievement thanks to very hard work. Yet our state is now legally committed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 42% from current levels by 2030. That is only 14 years from now.","Grid modernization, which, by the CPUC's estimate, will be an ongoing effort into the middle part of the next decade, is a very significant part of the needed solution. We believe that California will have to move much more aggressively and sooner rather than later to meet these new legislative mandates within a short 14 years. Many of California's policies to-date have focused on electric power, but generation, both in-state and from imports, represents only an estimated 20% of current statewide greenhouse gas emissions.","The largest source of greenhouse gas emissions is the transportation sector with an estimated 36% of current emissions. Industrial sources represent another 21%. We believe the significant new efforts across all sectors of the economy will be needed and many of these efforts will require significant electrification of sectors that today rely on fossil fuels.","We see ourselves as a key partner with California in this effort. Edison International is committed to be one of the most constructive agents of change in helping California meet its greenhouse gas objectives. I plan on talking in more data on how we look to do this in my November 8 remarks at the Edison Electric Institute Financial Conference.","Let me next anticipate your questions on two topics we're asked about regularly, mainly the status of the SONGS settlement and the MHI arbitration. SCE continues to implement the settlement. We have reduced rates and refunded or will refund nearly $1.6 billion under the terms of the settlement. With respect to the pending appeals of the settlement decision, we can't predict when the CPUC will act. We continue to believe the settlement is lawful, fair and in the best interest of our customers.","With respect to MHI, we remain hopeful that we will receive a decision later this year or early next year. Once we receive a decision from the International Chamber of Commerce panel, we will promptly disclose its key findings. In the spirit of transparency, SCE plans to make the actual decision public as soon as possible, though this will require agreement with MHI on what proprietary information must be kept confidential.","Should the arbitration outcome be favorable to the SONGS owners, SCE will refund to customers, under the SONGS settlement, 50% of any proceeds that exceed legal expenses. SCE expects to use its share of any recoveries to pay down or reduce the use of short-term debt needed to help finance SCE's capital spending program.","I also want to comment on the CPUC proceeding examining the SCE customer outages in Long Beach in July 2015. You may recall that we had multiple underground vault fires and underground cable failures, which affected much of the downturn area and adjoining neighborhoods. The problems centered in a unique portion of SCE's distribution system that is arranged in network configuration, similar to those used in dense urban areas like Manhattan. Most of our system has a radial design instead.","SCE has made a number of changes in our systems and management processes as a result of these outages. The CPUC proceeding will determine if fines are warranted and propose penalty amounts, which could be significant but we are not able to estimate these at this early stage of the proceeding. Hearings are scheduled for February of next year.","Turning briefly to our new business activities, we continue to develop energy advisory services and solutions for large commercial and industrial customers, which Edison Energy launched in March. Customer feedback has been quite encouraging and our customers include a number of Fortune 1000 companies and a dozen of the Fortune 50. That said we still have much work to do to flesh out a compelling value proposition that will grow this into a profitable business with meaningful scale.","We expect to complete evolving our initial business case into a detailed business plan with importantly near-term milestones that our board, management and our investors can use to measure our progress. I expect this to be able to provide you this detail no later than the next 12 months.","We're continuing to refine the scope and strategy for all our competitive business initiatives. We will concentrate on those that will give us the best opportunities to capture additional value and scale from the technology changes that are transforming the nature of our industry. Our focus is on a capital-light business model that maximizes the opportunity for value creation and complements our core SCE utility business. At the same time, the costs to develop these businesses continue.","While we have reaffirmed our 2016 earnings guidance, we expect to bound the costs for new business development for Edison Energy and provide additional detail in our guidance for 2017. I'm committed to implementing our Edison Energy Group strategies at a pace that creates opportunities for meaningful growth, yet is disciplined and does not detract from Edison International's opportunity to deliver above industry average earnings and dividend growth and resulting value for investors.","I'll finish up with one last example of management continuity; a continued dividend growth opportunity in steps and over time to continue a well-known phrase from prior earnings calls. Today, we are only at the low-end of our target payout range of 45% to 55% of SCE earnings based on the midpoint of our earnings guidance. We want to continue to move well into the range, which means a dividend growth opportunity higher than our earnings growth. With the engagement and support of our employees, I expect we'll do great things together for our customers and our shareholders.","With that, let me turn things over to Maria.","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","Thanks, Pedro. It is a privilege and honor to be here and I look forward to working with everyone in my new role. Now, let's review the number. I plan on following a format similar to what we've been using in prior earnings calls, commenting on the financial results, our updated guidance, our capital plans, and a few other financial topics. I will try not to repeat the numbers you can see in the presentation, but rather focus on the underlying trends and explanations. Please turn to page two of the presentation.","As discussed in our prior investor calls this year, quarterly earnings comparisons are awkward due to the timing of last year's rate case decision. SCE reflected the proposed decision in the third quarter of last year. At the time, SCE recorded most but not all of the expected impacts of that proposed decision. Some of last year's third quarter impacts related to the first half of 2015, so the third quarter comparisons are not perfectly aligned.","Comparisons to the prior year are clearer in the year-to-date information. Also, SCE now operates under the tax accounting memorandum account or TAMA approved in the 2015 rate case decision. This has reduced the variability around taxes. As we indicated on the last earnings call, SCE is doing better than our original earnings guidance. This is reflected in the updated guidance I will discuss shortly.","Also as expected, holding company costs are higher than our original guidance as we suggested last quarter. We continue to fine-tune the level of cost needed to successfully develop our new competitive businesses without undue drag on consolidated results. With that background, let's look specifically at third quarter results.","For SCE, the largest positive impact on revenue is the $0.13 per share benefit related to the timing of the GRC decision. Think of this as the amount that ideally would have been recorded in the first and second quarters of last year if the GRC decision had been in effect all of 2015.","The other positive drivers are revenue escalation for growth provided for in the 2015 rate case decision as well as the return on pole loading rate base. You will recall that the pole loading program is handled through a separate balancing account in the current rate case and receives rate base treatment.","On the cost side, we are seeing expected favorable earnings contribution from the operational improvement SCE has focused on for some time. Higher depreciation and financing costs reflect normal trends supporting SCE's capital spending program. Income tax expense is higher on higher pre-tax income and lower income tax benefits on property-related items. Overall, SCE earnings increased $0.15 per share or 13% to $1.34 per share.","Let's turn to the Edison International holding company, which includes the costs for Edison Energy Group. Comparisons continued to reflect the absence of earnings from the affordable housing portfolio sold at the end of last year. We also see the higher levels of support for developing our new businesses along with the higher interest expense from terming out some of the holding company debt earlier this year.","Core losses were $0.05 per share and $0.02 per share higher than last year. The increase in losses are driven equally by the absence of Edison Mission Group earnings and higher Edison Energy Group costs. Underlying holding company costs are generally comparable to last year's third quarter.","GAAP comparisons are also impacted by income of $0.13 per share from discontinued operations in the third quarter last year with no impact on core earnings. This was related to updated estimates of tax benefits and insurance proceeds. So net-net, core earnings came in at $1.29 per share, 11% above last year.","Please turn to page three. Year-to-date results are a clearer picture of underlying SCE performance as well as the holding company cost trends, which are relevant to our reaffirmed core earnings guidance. The underlying drivers for SCE are similar to those for the quarter other than the release of reserve for uncertain tax positions in the second quarter of 2015 of $0.31 per share.","On a year-to-date basis, the timing of the 2015 GRC decision is no longer a significant factor. And the earnings drivers do not include the $0.13 per share timing issue I mentioned earlier. The embedded escalation in revenues in the 2015 GRC decision and the return on pole loading rate base are the two key drivers. FERC revenue increases, mostly to fund higher O&M and capital, continue on a year-to-date basis.","The principal cost drivers are generally consistent through the year. As noted earlier, depreciation and financing costs reflect the higher capital associated with SCE's capital spending program as well as the recovery of Coolwater Lugo transmission project cost. Taxes were impacted by last year's change in uncertain tax benefits and the general trend of passing more tax benefits to customers through the tax memorandum account continues.","Turning to the EIX holding company, we have increased cost of $0.14 per share excluding non-core items. $0.09 of this variance related to two discrete items. The first component is $0.05 per share related to the absence of the Edison Mission Group portfolio earnings this year. The second component is the second quarter buyout of an earn-out arrangement with former shareholders of a company acquired at the end of last year. This was $0.04 per share.","Excluding these discrete items, there was $0.05 per share of higher cost, which breaks down to $0.01 per share at the holding company and $0.04 per share for Edison Energy Group. In absolute terms, total year-to-date core costs are $0.23 per share, which reflects $0.11 per share each at the holding company and Edison Energy Group. There was also $0.01 of cost related to the residual Edison Mission Group assets. I will come back to this topic later when I talk about our updated guidance.","Please turn to page four. Today, we have reaffirmed our core earnings guidance at $3.91 per share. Last quarter, we indicated full year results should be in the top half of the guidance range, and we still see an opportunity to do that. We have narrowed the guidance range to plus or minus $0.05 per share consistent with our recent practice.","At the midpoint of our guidance, the outlook for SCE is $0.09 per share higher than our original 2016 guidance and the EIX holding company is $0.09 per share less favorable. For SCE, we see the improvement relating largely to higher operational cost savings and financing benefits, which have been more favorable than what we included in our initial guidance last February. The footnote recaps how guidance elements have changed.","Also, please note that our guidance for SCE energy efficiency earnings is now $0.04 per share. This is based on updated estimates of benefits included in our September CPUC filing related to energy efficiency.","Our updated holding company guidance follows the accounting categories in the 10-Q with a focus on core results. The first category is normal holding company costs plus residual impacts from what remains of Edison Mission Group. Corporate expenses and other costs are still trending at a little more than $0.01 a month per share based on our year-to-date results. This is consistent with what we have suggested for some time. Our full year guidance for holding company cost is $0.15 per share compared to $0.12 recorded year-to-date.","The second category reflects Edison Energy Group with full year guidance at a $0.12 per share loss. This is aligned with the $0.02 to $0.03 per share we are seeing in each quarter or $0.07 per share so far this year, excluding the buyout of the earn-out provision. While we develop these businesses, we do expect continued losses early on.","Looking at overall holding company costs, including Edison Energy Group, we will be managing our near-term activities such that 2017 costs do not exceed 2016 guidance levels of $0.27 per share, consistent with Pedro's earlier point. When we provide 2017 earnings guidance, we plan to provide refined cost estimates for these businesses that reflect the balance between the value creation opportunity we see in the long term and the earnings impact in the near term.","Our guidance continues to exclude any recoveries related to the MHI arbitration. If we do receive any meaningful award, we will account for the recovery of legal and other costs incurred to obtain the award as core earnings. This is consistent with our core treatment of these costs over the last three years. While a portion of an award, depending upon the amount, will be treated as non-core, we did want to provide a view as to the core and non-core split in the event an award is made. Net cost incurred and not recovered from MHI totaled $48 million or $0.09 per share.","Please turn to page five. I will touch on a few other key topics. The capital spending and rate base forecasts that we provided in our September 1 GRC presentation are included in the appendix of today's presentation. SCE continually assesses how best to optimize between new capital spending opportunities that may be identified and any changes in the schedules for existing projects or an overall capital spending.","SCE continues to seek approval of the memorandum account to cover roughly $200 million of early-stage grid modernization capital spending forecast in 2016 and 2017. If approval is not granted by later this year or early next year, it could push out the timeline for ramping up grid modernization spending under the 2018 GRC.","Transmission permitting and regulatory review remains challenging here and for utilities in other parts of the country. The $1.1 billion West of Devers Project was approved by the CPUC in August. But that decision was appealed in September on environmental grounds. The approval decision stands pending appeal.","Also, alternative designs have been proposed in the CPUC review of the $600 million Mesa Substation project that would require significant reengineering. SCE and the California ISO continue to recommend the project. These permitting and approval challenges are increasingly typical of transmission planning and part of the process, although, the need for these projects is not affected by the regulatory delays that impact initial timing.","Despite these challenges, we continue to see at least $4 billion in annual SCE capital spending and roughly $2 billion of annual rate base growth in 2017 and for the foreseeable future. With almost all of that investment in the wire side of the business, we believe it has lower investment opportunity risk as compared to utilities with a high percentage of growth tied to generation investment.","On other financial matters, SCE has a full settlement in place at the current capital structure and cost of capital, including an ROE of 10.45% for 2017. SCE's cost of capital trigger mechanism ended its last measurement period at 4.91%, just below the 5% midpoint. Under our settlement, the operation of the mechanism is suspended at this time.","However, utility interest rate trends remain relevant looking ahead to the next cost of capital proceedings in April of next year. The moving average restarted October 1 at the spot rate of 4.26% against what is a likely floor for long-term interest rates in the current rate environment. SCE remains open to another settlement for a further extension.","SCE's equity ratio for regulatory purposes remains strong at 50.4% as of September 30. SCE remains comfortable with its 48% equity capital structure and has no plans to recommend any changes in equity ratio to the CPUC. While conservative, it helps provide the flexibility we need to support our dividend growth objectives.","I want to touch briefly on financing strategy if only to reaffirm our past statements. For SCE, we plan on funding our capital program with no new equity, relying on long-term debt and preferred stock financing as well as operating cash flow and, perhaps, short-term debt as needed.","At the holding company, the principal financing need this quarter was for the last EME bondholder settlement payment of $214 million. EIX retains plenty of financial flexibility and overall financing needs remain modest at this time.","Finally, we plan on continuing our normal practice of providing 2017 earnings guidance when we report fourth quarter and full year financial results, tentatively scheduled for February 21 of next year.","That concludes our prepared remarks. Christie, please open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And our first question is from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith of UBS. Your line is open now.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Hi, good afternoon.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Hi, Julien.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Hey. So, quick question, listen, I understand you can't say too much here. Cost of capital settlement discussions, is that something that, obviously, you'd be open to and, perhaps, can you comment on the debt recovery piece in that? Where do you stand relative to with authorized rates if you can comment on that at all?","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","Sure, Julien. This is Maria. Clearly, we're open to settlement discussions with our stakeholders. That's probably all I'm going to say about that. And relative to any components of what that might look like, again, don't want to negotiate with anybody on the phone, but we'd certainly be to consider things in terms of a total package.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. Excellent. And then a little bit of a follow-up here on storage. Obviously, there were some developments in the state on a legislative front in the quarter. Can you comment on what that means for you guys?","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","Sure. Certainly, the 500 \u2013 you're talking about the 500 megawatts of additional energy storage. It's still early days. We have to see were that lands for us in terms of how that would be split amongst the three IOUs, et cetera. So, early days to know exactly what it will mean for us.","We are proceeding with our other energy storage activities. We have about 40 megawatts or so in the GRC that we recently filed. We're moving forward with the Aliso Canyon Energy Storage. We think it's all part and parcel, but that 500 megawatt's still under review.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","And sorry, to clarify that, to what extent is it or what aspects of it for you guys...","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","Oh, no. I mean how it's all going to play out in terms of our spending. Sorry.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. But there is some ability to do it. It's just a matter of like to what extent you will do it and at what point in time?","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Yeah. The state will need a process for actually implementing the legislation and allocating out the 500 megawatt sale. The immediate first step here is just going through the regulatory implementation steps.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. All right. Thank you.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Thanks, Julien.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Michael Weinstein of Credit Suisse. Your line is open now.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi, guys.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Hi.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hey, I realize that I think you're planning on bounding \u2013 I think you talked about bounding the Edison Energy Group losses at some point probably in the February timeframe when you're going to give 2017 guidance. But I'm wondering if you can give some color around where that bounding might occur and how you're thinking about the business going forward.","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","Hey, Michael. So, certainly, in terms of the discussion about bounding, we do intend to do that. We've already kind of said during our prepared remarks that we were going to bound that at no more than the 2016 guidance levels for EIX parent and other. As we move through the rest of the year and we're kind of compiling all of our budget information, we'll be able to provide more detail as to exactly how that shakes out at Edison Energy Group.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Greg Gordon, Evercore ISI. Your line is open now.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Thanks. Good afternoon.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Hi, Greg.","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","Hey, Greg.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","When we think about how you're trying to work on the glide path for dividend policy, you've been pretty clear and consistent. So when I look out past 2017 and I think about the GRC, the fact that productivity and financing benefits will probably all get wrapped into the next rate case decision, is it right to think about the rate base math for minus the parent overheads and where we think you'll sort of try to target Edison Energy Group drag to come up with sort of a 2019-2020 theoretical earnings growth, earnings numbers in order to set the kind of dividend growth policy that you'll have through that transition?","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","Hey, Greg. It's kind of early days right now to actually know what's going to happen in the GRC itself. Obviously, our dividends are all keyed off of SCE earnings. As that continues to grow with the rate base growth, you'll see a continuing ability to bring our dividend up in steps over time, as Pedro said earlier. So, I think that's really how we're thinking about it.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Okay. So we should think about it in terms of a payout off of the rate base earnings power of SCE?","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","Absolutely.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Okay. That's clear. Thank you.","Operator","Okay. Thank you. And our next question is from Jonathan Arnold of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good afternoon, guys.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Hey, Jonathan.","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","Hey.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. Could I just \u2013 just want to be extra sure I understand the sounding of the holding company drag. Are you saying that Edison Energy Group and the parent combined in 2017 will not exceed the kind of combined number for 2016 or is it that the EEG piece won't exceed the combined number from 2016?","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","No, the former. So the combined number for 2017 not to exceed the combined number for 2016.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And so, obviously, there will be something for the parent. So what you're going to give us with the guidance is kind of how you get to this number, which is going to be either the same or lower than 2016?","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","Yes.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay.","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","Actually, you're echoing a little bit. I think you said that we'll give you more information around the parent then, yes, absolutely.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah. But you're effectively saying the combined number is going to be the same or lower and...","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","That's right.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","...the composition of it you'll give us with the guidance.","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","That's right.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, great. Thank you. And then one other \u2013 we noticed recently that the ALJ on the SONGS case was reassigned. Are you guys able to share any intelligence as to what might be going on there? What it might mean for the schedule?","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Yeah. So, don't have any insights on the schedule. I think we saw one press report that said the ALJ was leaving or retiring. So, what we've seen is the appointment of \u2013 assignment of a new ALJ. And so, we have an ex parte ban, so we don't get into this sort of detail with the Commission. So, we believe that the settlement terms continue to be fair and \u2013 but as I mentioned in my comments, we don't have a way to handicap at this point when the Commission will act.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then just finally, on the SCE equity ratio, I think you said it's north of 50% as of September. Is that seasonal? Do you see it tracking down as you move through this rate case period or should we imagine it holds around that level? What does the model show?","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","Look, 50.4% was where we're at September 30. And that number is north of the 48% that's our authorized equity ratio. We will, over time, I'm sure see that bleed down, although, that really does give us the flexibility to manage our capital program, our dividend program, and all of that. So, we actually think that's a good spot to be in.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And if I could just some one \u2013 sort of related topic, you mentioned, I think, West of Devers being appealed and then the Mesa Substation design being called into question. If you see \u2013 which year were those projects expected to benefit most and so if they slip to the right, is it a 2017 issue? Is it more a 2018 issue? Can you just give a little more color and then maybe how one might backfill it?","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","So those projects \u2013 both of those projects are being reviewed by the CPUC. I will say the review is not about whether or not those projects are needed. The review is about exactly how those projects should be built out. And we are still assessing what the impact would be on the schedule and the cost. Certainly, reengineering a project could potentially cause it to be delayed, but there are some suggestions as to different types of projects that could actually increase the cost of those projects.","So, we're currently in the process of looking at what the different proposals are and whether or not we need to start engineering around some of those different proposals. Mesa is a very good example that, in that case, other alternatives have been proposed, but in fact the California ISO has said that each one of the alternatives that have been proposed either don't meet the needs or don't meet the time requirement.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Just one global comment on this just to summarize it. This is not a question of if it's just a question of when.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","So, in the current plan, were these 2017 projects primarily or further out?","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","No, they actually spread over a pretty long period. I think the in-service dates of the NEE dates, there's a chart in our presentation, but the NEE (35:55) dates are like 2020, 2021 for most of these projects. So you see cost spread over the entire period.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. All right, I'll take a look at that. Thank you very much, guys.","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","Just to note though, Jonathan, we have not changed any of our forecast at this point, while we wait for those decisions.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Well, is that because you're assuming that you'll find other things to bring forward or some other reason, or just waiting to get the outcome before you make a change? I'm not sure what you're implying?","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","Two things. Certainly, we do look for ways to redeploy our capital when something is delayed, but secondly also that we will be in the process as we get more information to update our numbers.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thank you very much.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Thanks, Jonathan.","Operator","Okay. Thank you. And our next question is from Praful Mehta of Citigroup. Your line is open.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi, guys.","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","Hey.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Hey.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Going back to Edison Energy again and wanted to more understand, from a cash cost perspective, given there is a bunch of investment happening there, I'm not sure if the earnings impact that you're talking about reflects what? Is it an O&M expense? Is it depreciation on investment? Just if you can give some color on what the cash cost you expect there and how does that profile kind of look between earnings and cash?","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","You know at the end of the last year, we did deploy some capital, some cash to purchase the three companies at Edison Energy. On a go-forward basis, we have a service model. We're focused on providing energy as a service, so the capital needs of those companies from an investment perspective is not gigantic. There are some operating expenses. So, of course, that's why you're seeing the drag at the holding company \u2013 in the holding company cost. The numbers themselves are pretty immaterial relative to the overall Edison International structure. So, I think that kind of bounds it for you, I don't know, Pedro... (38:05)","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","No, I think that's captures it. And given the questions that I think we've all gotten from a number of you as we chatted through September, we wanted to make sure we provided some near-term clarity as to what the overall earnings impact was at the total consolidated EIX level. That's why we focused on that today and then we'll have more detail we can provide first in February when we issue 2017 guidance.","But I think before \u2013 you're also getting to what's the nature of the business itself and what's more of a business model question. And that goes to providing a detailed business plan to our investors, which I mentioned in my comments, we expect to do no later than 12 months from now. So, I think that will clarify our best thinking at that point. And influenced by feedback, we've been getting from customers over the last few months, just thinking in terms of what is that model and what do we see as some of the key milestones and outlays over the years ahead.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Got you. And the bounding is definitely helpful, so definitely appreciate that.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Good. Thanks.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","And on slide five, you mentioned here the $4 billion of capital spend with $2 billion annual rate base increase right into the next decade. Now, as you're growing rate base, clearly, as a percentage of rate base, that growth is dropping off. So, is this a signal to indicate a drop-off in the percentage growth or is it more to say that this is the base case and there is more incremental to that to kind of maintain a 7-percentage growth as well?","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Actually, I think that's a message you've heard consistently in several other earnings calls in the past. I think what we said is, we see a continued case supporting for at least $4 billion a year in CapEx. I think we've acknowledged in the past that assuming that that continues, which we see that opportunity, that provides a floor for growth. And to the extent that we're investing at that, call it $4 billion, $4-ish billion level, as the denominator grows the percent increase in the denominator starts tailoring down.","That said, you saw in our general rate case application that the request that we provided if we got the total request, which we don't expect we get 100% of that, but we think we provided a very strong case, that rate case for requests would take us over to $5 billion, which would then be a step-up in that rate.","So, I guess the final point I'll make here is, again, think about this as a floor, but as we look at the California opportunity, that's a really interesting opportunity over certainly the decade ahead, and as I mentioned in my comments, we're still \u2013 not just we as SCE, but we the state are still trying to get our arms around what SB 32 will really mean, All right?","What is the nature of that opportunity when you have to reduce greenhouse gases by more than 40% from where we are today? That's going to require a fair amount of infrastructure. Early to say how much that might be new infrastructure that translates into rate base, how much of that would be infrastructure that's done on the customer side or by other entities. It will certainly imply a good opportunity in terms of the usage of the grid.","But I think, net-net, when you look at SB 32, when you look at some of the other upsides around items like the storage item that Julien asked about earlier, we do see continued support for investing at, at least that floor $4 billion and to the extent that we're only investing at that floor then, yes, you'd see the ratio ease off over time. Does that make sense?","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Yes, it does. I really appreciate it. Thank you.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","You bet. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Hey, Michael.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, guys. A couple of questions; I'll start on the non-utility or non-regulated side of the business. Have you communicated, or is this what's coming a year from now, what your anticipated goal is in terms of when you expect this investment to generate earnings power for the company or when you expect this investment to generate positive not negative free cash for the company?","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","I think that will be part of the detail that we aim to provide in a business plan, Michael.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","So, the item no later than 12 months from now.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And have you discussed or disclosed the amount of capital you deployed in this business? I would assume it's available in the 10-Q, which hit 30 or 40 minutes ago, but just kind of what's your plan for capital spending. Is it large enough to have shown up in your CapEx tables yet?","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","So, you can see that disclosed the parent section of the cash flows. But, really, the bulk of what we spent is that $100 million last year to buy the three companies that are basically Edison Energy.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. And then coming back to SCE, there is the potential at some point in the coming months or so that you'll give results in the Mitsubishi arbitration, and half of those proceeds would come to the utility and the other half would go to customers. How do you think about how you would utilize those proceeds, the proceeds that come back to the utility?","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","And I think, actually, Pedro might have mentioned this in his comments...","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Right.","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","...is that we would really retain out of the utility an offset to the extent that we were using short-term debt to really fund the capital program that we see, which is, as you know from the GRC, pretty substantial.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Right. But you've already got a pretty healthy equity layer at the utility and you've got some runway in I assume the Mitsubishi cash. If there is any cash, isn't going to just come overnight. It may take a little while for it to come in, so in that timeframe, the equity layer continues to grow.","I'm just curious about are you commenting on the short-term debt side that you're worried your short-term balance is getting a little too healthy or too thick, or is there just less balance sheet capacity than maybe I'm thinking about?","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","I don't think our short-term debt is getting too thick. You can see from our financial statements, we're in a pretty comfortable spot. But, over time, I think it's just a nice place to be to have that capacity. If we were to get an award, we don't know that we're going to get an award, but if we were to get an award and of any substantial size, I think we'll provide another layer of certainty or cushion as we build out our capital program.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. And then last thing just related to that, if you get an award, is that taxable?","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","Yes.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","So, whatever the number is that comes back to SCE, what you're really getting is 60%, 65% of that level?","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","Yeah, whatever the...","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Tax rate is.","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","...final tax rate would be. Yes.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay, got it. Thank you, guys. Much appreciate it.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Thanks, Michael.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Ali Agha of SunTrust. Your line is open.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Hey, Ali.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hey, Pedro. First question, Pedro, you've been obviously implementing the SONGS settlement as per the terms of the settlement for a while now. And so, from a practical point of view, if the Commission decided to reopen it, can we sort of put that genie back in the bottle, given how far down the road we've already come? How does that work conceptually if this thing were reviewed?","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","So, you're talking about the genie in the bottle. We've talked about it'd be tough to unscramble the egg or put the toothpaste back in the tube. So, I think that would be one of the challenges were the Commission to decide to reopen the settlement. And of course, if they did that, we believe strongly in the litigation positions that we had and we would reassert those.","But, no, you're pointing out one of the implementation challenges, if the Commission were to reopen it, would be very tough to do. And as I mentioned in my comment, we've refunded or are on the way to refunding a total $1.6 billion, so a big amount at stake here benefiting customers.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Yeah. Second question. When you're benchmarking your cost versus your relevant peer group where do you see yourself standing? Which quartile right now? And really the thrust being that for the last couple of rate case cycles, in particular, you've been able to benefit from the non-rate case years by coming in with better cost and keeping that upside. How much more is left in that process when you benchmark yourselves and see where you stand today?","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","So I want stay pretty high level on this one. I'd say we're probably in the middle of the pack. Some areas a little better, some areas a little worse. We've pointed investors to our rate case filing and the pieces that we had some level of confidence on, when we were filing our rate case, of course, we put in the rate case as an obligation for customers.","We said that we'll continue to work at this. We have not quantified for investors what that additional opportunity is or the timing for it, probably because we're continuously doing that work, Ali, and that's a work in progress.","The other comment I make there is, beyond just looking at what it means for SCE today to benchmark itself against the folks who are in the quartile already or even best-in-class that versus where I think the whole industry and, frankly, the whole economy is set at, certainly, over the decade ahead for us here, technology is going to be opening up some pretty powerful opportunities to reshape how a lot of American work is done.","And I think even the folks who are best-in-class in our industry or in other industries are going to see continued opportunities for improvement, whether it's back office technologies or artificial intelligence or the impact of other hardware and software in various parts of our business, I just see that as a continuing opportunity for all of us in the industry and across the economy. And so, I don't think we're at the point yet where we stop. So, expect there could be a continuing theme for us, but we haven't quantified what that could mean yet.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Understood. Pedro, One last question, I'm sorry, if I could. You may have different valuation benchmarks on how you're looking at the Edison Energy businesses, obviously, different businesses. But, as you know, your stock trades on a PE multiple, so earnings matter. So, in that context, how sensitive is it for you to at least get those businesses to break-even on earnings, so you're not getting penalized as I believe you are by those losses flowing through your earnings statements?","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Thanks for the question, Ali, and I'll kick it off and Maria might have other thoughts. You're right. I think that EIX does trade largely on SCE earnings. That is the core of the business. And today, the Edison Energy Group activities are non-material relative to the broad EIX story.","We are excited about the opportunity. As I mentioned earlier, we are sensitive. Recognize that investors look at earnings in PE and as we develop that business plan that we'll share over the next 12 months, our goal is to make that as transparent as possible because we recognize that we have a responsibility here to explain that business case to investors and make it one that you all can get your arms around.","In the specific case of Edison Energy, this is getting a little ahead of our skis this year. But just to provide a little bit of color, we view that as an energy as a service kind of business. The business that we have today, basically, have a number of customers, contracts that can span from one to several years.","We'd expect that to be a book of business that we could describe to our investors and provide metrics around the texture of that portfolio \u2013 the tenure of it \u2013 what contract volumes or what years, measures of backlog, et cetera. But at the end of the day, we would hope and would expect would provide some good level of confidence around continuing cash flow strength, continuing earnings strength.","So, I just described something at pretty high level here. Expect us to put more pen to paper as we develop the business plan and share it with you. But we're thinking about that in that way and, frankly, in large part because of the good feedback we've gotten from a number of you about how to reconcile new businesses with the core story and how the core story is valued at EIX and at SCE. Maria, anything to add, or?","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","No, I don't think so. I think you captured it.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Thanks, Ali.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Anthony Crowdell of Jefferies. Your line is open.","Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC","Good afternoon. First, Pedro and Maria, huge improvement over the last couple of calls. Just...","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","We're not going to touch that.","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","We can hear Scilacci's voice breaking in.","Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC","If I could just touch on, I think, one of the earlier questions from Jonathan about the equity ratio, I understand you like the flexibility. You talk about dividend growth and everything else. But when you go from a 48% to 50% equity ratio on the rate base that you guys have, it's a significant driver of earnings. And if the Commission is able to give you that flexibility, why not look to setting it at 50% and still enjoy that flexibility? Because right now, it looks like you're losing $0.18 to $0.20 of earnings.","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","So, thanks for the question. And we are comfortable at the place we are right now, 48% authorized. Yes, we're a little higher than that at the current moment. But that will work down over time as we continue to expand our capital program. I think that flexibility is really important.","We're trying to balance a lot of things in the context of, we want to be able to deploy the capital that we need to get the grid modernized, to focus on safety and reliability, all the things that our customers need, and then also balance that against customer rates as well. So, we're doing a lot of things. The 48% level authorized equity rate actually does fit in with the overall objectives that we're trying to achieve. And we think that it provides us with the right amount of flexibility over time.","Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC","Could you use the parent company to also provide flexibility or you're just really looking at flexibility at the utility? I'm thinking maybe the parent could provide some additional equity to the utility if you had a huge capital program?","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","Certainly, EIX has some balance sheet flexibility. I think we'd have to think about that over time in terms of where would be the most appropriate place to provide that sort of backing.","Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC","Great. Thanks for taking my question.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Travis Miller of Morningstar. Your line is open.","Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Good afternoon. Thank you.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Hi, there.","Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","I was wondering, obviously, all these initiatives going on in California, smart grid and all the other stuff, storage, transmission, even those delays there, how much is the timing of the GRC decision dependent on any of those things happening along their various timelines?","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Do you mean from a process and staff workload perspective or...?","Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","In terms of your investment proposal and the Commission's various needs to approve various types of initiatives?","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","I think that the answer is, for the most part, we look at these as fairly separate tracks. We might have a \u2013 there's just a number of \u2013 or a portion of our revenue requirement and our programs, a large portion that flows through the general rate case. There are individual special purpose programs like Charge Ready, which is going through a separate track. And so, those are fairly independent.","Perhaps, the one point of more interaction that's still being defined is around the whole topic of grid modernization. I think it's fair to say that in the beginning when the Commission first set up the distribution resource plan proceeding or DRP, that was intended to provide policy-level guidance that would then feed into the requests of each utility in their general rate cases.","We do have a unique situation with SCE's rate case in that, just the timing of our rate case is such that we have to file a request before we have a final decision in the DRP proceeding. The Commission has recognized that and so some interaction there, but in the meantime, we are very focused on providing the testimony and high quality testimony in the GRC proceeding. And again, we're encouraged by the comments that President Picker made about wanting to stay on the overall timelines.","Looking at Kevin Payne and Ron Nichols in case you have anything to add there or if I covered that?","Ronald Owen Nichols - Southern California Edison Co.","I would add that \u2013 this is Ron Nichols. I would add that the Commission in their DRP proceeding just gave guidance here recently that in Q2 of 2017 that they expect to provide some more guidance on grid modernization investment levels. So, we're expecting that will give us a better clue, we hope reinforcement with regard to where we're headed. But that at least identifies the fact we've asked for memorandum account for this and they're now finally coming out with some timeline for some guidance.","Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Okay, very helpful. Thank you.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Lason Jong of Avila Research Consulting (57:47). Your line is open.","Unknown Speaker","Thank you. Good afternoon.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Hi, Lason (57:54).","Unknown Speaker","Hi. I was just running through your numbers on the greenhouse gas emissions. And I've come to a very interesting conclusion, which is that the opportunity for investments in the electric grid infrastructure around electric vehicles is stunningly high. Meaning 40% greenhouse gas emissions from power plants have to get cut in half by law, so that 10% of the 40%, let's assume industrials contribute another 10% out of the 40% and commercial customers contribute 5%, maybe 10% max.","That means 15% of that 40% has to come from the transportation area. And rough numbers suggest that 10 million cars being taken off the road, which means several things. One; a massive increase in power generation, most likely on the renewable side. And two; massive transmission and distribution line expansion and massive infrastructure investment in electrical vehicle charging stations. Am I in the ballpark?","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","So, I think you just defined one potential scenario, but I think there are many. And the reality is that the state is just starting to get its arms around how this all really will shake out. And I'll tell you, some of the interesting questions here are, how much of this will be done by the state going through the kind of analysis that you just went through there. And in allocating that out on a sector by sector basis, how much of it will be done by relying on more market forces and seeing how the markets bring out the best opportunities.","So, I'll probably stop short of commenting on your specific scenario there. But, really, come back to the basic message, which is no matter which way we cut it \u2013 and we're doing our own homework on this right now with our various state agencies. But no matter which way we cut it, we see electrification of a lot of the economy being absolutely needed.","Now, whether it's you're quick math there in terms of the impact on transportation, some of the factors or whether it's different math, different proportions coming from different sectors. Even within transportation, how much comes from passenger light duty vehicles, how much comes from heavier duty. I think there's lots of questions that the state needs to grapple with. But, again, any which you cut it, it will require a fair amount of electrification. And therefore, really cement the absolute necessity of having a strong and modern grid at the center of it all to move that power around. So that's the focus and I think we will all be learning a lot over the course of the next few years here as we march our way to the state being able to meet the expectation of the law 14 years from now.","Unknown Speaker","When do you think the state is going to have some sort of an implementation plan to be able to get to the numbers by 2030?","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Hope its sooner rather than later, but I don't think that we've seen any specific dates come out of some of the key agencies here. Ron Nichols, anything you'd add there?","Ronald Owen Nichols - Southern California Edison Co.","I think there is one thing I would point to at least that the Public Utilities Commission has come up with a request back middle of September, came out with a ruling to have all three of the investors on utilities make a filing January 20 of 2017 on our ideas with regard to what could be done both in programs and investments to accelerate transportation electrification. That's only one piece admittedly.","But there is \u2013 at least there is, from that end, a push towards doing that. And they've asked us to be pretty out of the box thinking with regard to this and that will create opportunities potentially for investment. And whether we make the investment or other parties make that investment, greater increase in use of our grid and benefit of spreading those costs over a higher amount of kilowatt hour sales. As to the larger scale, the California Resources Board is still working on a longer-term plan that includes all the other sectors, but they don't have a hard timing on that yet.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Lot of work to be done in the state.","Operator","Okay. That was the last question. I will now turn the call back to Mr. Scott Cunningham.","Scott S. Cunningham - Edison International","Thanks, Christie. And thanks, everyone, for participating and don't hesitate to give us a call if you have any questions and we'll look forward to seeing many of you at the EI Financial Conference next week. Good evening.","Operator","And that concludes today's conference. Thank you all for participating.

My name is Natalie, and I will be your operator today. Today's call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Sam Ramraj, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Ramraj, you may begin your conference.","Sam Ramraj - Edison International","Thank you and welcome, everyone. Our speakers today are President and Chief Executive Officer, Pedro Pizarro; and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Maria Rigatti. Also here are other members of the management team. Materials supporting today's call are available at www.edisoninvestor.com. These include our Form 10-Q, prepared remarks from Pedro and Maria, and the teleconference presentation. Tomorrow, we will distribute our regular business update presentation.","During the call, we will make forward-looking statements about the outlook for Edison International and its subsidiaries. Actual results could differ materially from current expectations. Important factors that could cause different results are set forth in our SEC filings. Please read these carefully.","The presentation includes certain outlook assumptions, as well as a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the nearest GAAP measure.","During the question-and-answer session, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up.","I will now turn the call over to Pedro.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Thank you, Sam, and good afternoon, everyone.","Before we start the review of the quarter, I would like to welcome Sam again as our new Vice President of Investor Relations. Sam joined our team in June, and some of you have already had the chance to speak with him on the phone during this past month.","Sam has significant Investor Relations experience, with 15 years on the corporate side and prior experience as a sell-side analyst. And I will admit, I have also enjoyed kidding Sam a bit about how his move from the oil industry to the electric sector is very well-aligned with California's transportation electrification policy objectives. So Sam, welcome again.","Now on to the quarter. Edison International reported second quarter earnings of $0.85 per share, which were slightly below last year's second quarter earnings of $0.86 per share. Typically, we make decisions about adjustments to guidance after we have third quarter results, but we are making an exception in this instance. We have previously indicated that there is a bias towards the upper half of the range. We have now adjusted guidance to a midpoint of $4.23 per share, primarily to incorporate the tax benefits related to share-based compensation which we discussed earlier this year, and Maria will cover this in more detail in her remarks.","My comments today will focus on SCE's key regulatory proceedings and long-term growth opportunities. I will also provide an update on our recently announced restructuring at Edison Energy. Let me start with the SCE 2018 General Rate Case.","As requested by the administrative law judges, SCE entered into initial settlement discussions on the rate case in the May to June timeframe. As is always the case, there are a number of interveners involved. While we remain open to a settlement, at this time we are continuing with the litigation process and participating in evidentiary hearings which started July 13 and are scheduled through early August.","Now just before our last earnings call, the Office of Ratepayer Advocates or ORA, have submitted their testimony. Then in early May, all other interveners, including The Utility Reform Network or TURN, submitted their testimony. Each of ORA and TURN addressed a range of issues in the General Rate Case, and you will recall that ORA's recommendation yielded 6.6% annual rate base growth through 2020. Now this was based on acceptance of about 90% of our traditional capital spending recommendations and zero capital spending for grid modernization.","In comparison, TURN's overall capital spending recommendations would yield annual rate base growth of 6.0% through 2020. This includes TURN's support for about 85% of our traditional capital spending and approximately 22% of our grid modernization capital spending recommendations. Embedded in TURN's testimony are proposed rate base adjustments of approximately $700 million of historical capital expenditures related to certain distribution infrastructure replacement programs.","On June 16, SCE filed its rebuttal testimony which reiterated key points of our original applications, including a continued focus on infrastructure reliability investment and the first elements of the long-term grid modernization initiative. We did lower our capital request by approximately $420 million, of which $300 million was related to grid modernization programs, and the remainder related to operational support in other small programs.","Over the course of the past 18 to 24 months since the initial testimony was prepared, SCE refined its analysis based on additional engineering studies, pilot projects and more detailed financial evaluations and therefore, modified the timing and approaches to upgrading certain elements of the distribution system. We continue to believe that these programs will benefit customers, and SCE expects to include these and other capital expenditures in future GRCs. Overall, these changes have modified our rate base growth to 8.3% from the original recourse 8.6%. Again, Maria will go into more detail related to our capital spending forecast.","Now we continue to believe that California's 2030 greenhouse gas emission goals will require proactive steps to integrate renewable energy and distributed energy resources into the grid. Because it will take many years to modernize the grid to meet these requirements, we must start now by identifying early, no-regrets investments that will improve reliability and safety for customers. And it will also keep us on the path of being a key enabler of California's climate change policies.","In addition to our General Rate Case, SCE is pursuing additional programs around transportation electrification and energy storage in support of California's 2030 greenhouse gas emission goals, totaling $1 billion of additional capital spending opportunities outside of our current forecast. With respect to the transportation and electrification application filed in January, SCE is still expecting a decision on $20 million of priority review projects by this October, and then looking to April 2018 for a final decision on the requested $550 million project related to charging infrastructure for medium and heavy-duty vehicles.","Also, as a reminder, the IOUs received a final commission decision in April, implementing Assembly Bill 2868 which requires the IOUs to propose programs and investments for up to 500 megawatts of distributed energy storage systems. This amount is above and beyond the existing 1,325 megawatt target. SCE's portion is approximately 166 megawatts. Now not all of this increment will create rate base earning opportunities, but more detail will come as SCE evaluates different approaches and submits its proposal.","Next, let me discuss the cost of capital proceeding. We are pleased that the CPUC recently approved the original cost of capital settlement submitted by the four investor-owned energy utilities, ORA and TURN. The implementation of California's energy policies requires a significant commitment by SCE and others in the state to drive power procurement, capital spending and energy efficiency. We continue to play an important role in long-term contracting for renewables and, increasingly, energy storage to meet our customers and our state's needs. Safety and reliability are always at the forefront of our capital spending plans and we must now implement those plans in the context of also building a modern grid to integrate distributed energy resources that our customers are choosing and that our regulators are supporting.","Achieving California's climate change policies means we must attract the capital needed for infrastructure reliability and enabling a low-carbon grid. All of these activities require SCE and the other utilities to forge new and truly innovative approaches that support a premium return on equity relative to utilities in other states. Our new cost of capital will go into effect on January 1, 2018, and we will go back to the commission in April of 2019 with our next cost of capital application where we will continue the discussion on these key topics.","Going further on the broader theme of California's climate change polices, many of you have heard me talk about SCE being a key enabler of California's goals. In early June, we joined the State of California and other states, cities and companies when we signed an open letter to the international community supporting the Paris Accord on climate change, which underscores our continued work on greenhouse gas reduction efforts. This also reflects California's national and international leadership in addressing greenhouse gas emissions through ambitious clean energy and environmental programs.","California took its next major step on Tuesday when Governor Brown signed Assembly Bill 398 to extend the greenhouse gas cap-and-trade program. SCE supported AB 398, and I attended the signing ceremony which took place in the same location where Governor Schwarzenegger signed the original AB 32 cap-and-trade legislation 10 years ago. AB 398, which passed the legislature with a two-thirds super majority vote, keeps the cap-and-trade program largely intact and extends it to 2030 but with some modifications to the program's administration.","The legislature is continuing the theme with the proposed Senate Bill 100 which would accelerate the renewables' control use standard to 50% by 2026, establish a target of 60% renewable resources by 2030 and require all electricity sold at retail to be from zero carbon resources by 2045. We support the broad objective of the legislation, but SCE is currently working with the bill's sponsors to seek changes that will ensure that reliability and customer rate impacts are appropriately considered. Additionally, we would like the bill to include language to provide flexibility to study and revisit its targets if necessary in the future.","Moving on to the status of the SONGS regulatory proceeding. Since our last earnings call, the commission approved our request to extend the deadline to report on the status of the meet-and-confer process to August 15. In addition, SCE filed a redacted version of the MHI arbitration decision on June 7 for awareness by the commission and the public.","We are taking the meet-and-confer process seriously. However, we are also prepared to return to litigation if the meet-and-confer process is ultimately not successful and the CPUC takes that step. Now the meet-and-confer process is confidential so we are, therefore, just not in a position to provide any further details during today's question-and-answer session.","Let's now turn to our competitive businesses at Edison Energy Group where there have been some developments that I would like to discuss. As part of our ongoing strategic review of our competitive businesses, we streamlined the organizational structure of Edison Energy Group to focus on near-term needs rather than the longer-term potential scale. In addition to this organizational realignment, we are also evaluating various options for SoCore, our solar business. This could result in a sale of the business as there may be other parties who are better able to maximize the value of the SoCore platform, given its scale and our current tax position. We have retained an advisor to assist in the effort and will provide more detail as we move forward.","I want to make it clear that we remain committed to establishing successful competitive businesses that complement our regulated business at SCE. We have heard from our commercial and industrial customers that they value the independent insight we bring regarding their energy needs. Therefore, we will continue our commitment to growing our existing Edison Energy service lines and to establishing a new portfolio advisory service line along with the supporting data analytics platform for large energy users nationally. While we have not yet selected a specific date, we plan to come back to investors in September on an Edison Insights call with more details about our plans for the competitive businesses coming out of our strategic review of Edison Energy Group.","Now I want to close by thanking Ron Litzinger who has announced that he will retire by year end. Ron has been the first leader of Edison Energy Group and has been an important part of SCE and Edison Mission Energy at key times in their history. I really appreciate that Ron will be able to work with us in the months ahead to assure a smooth transition as we recruit a new head of Edison Energy who will report to Drew Murphy. We will have more opportunities to fully celebrate Ron's great career as we approach the end of the year.","I will now turn the call over to Maria for an update on the quarter.","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","Thank you, Pedro. And good afternoon, everyone. Before we discuss results, I'd also like to welcome Sam. We're all looking forward to working with him.","Turning to other topics, my comments today will cover second quarter and year-to-date results, updated earnings guidance and our updated capital expenditure and rate base forecast. Let's begin by looking at the key SCE earnings drivers for the quarter shown on the right of the slide. So please turn to page two of the presentation.","Overall, SCE revenue was not an earnings driver this quarter. Higher revenue from the normal attrition mechanism and SCE's current General Rate Case generated a positive $0.11 per share variance compared to last year's second quarter. But other CPUC and FERC revenue offset this amount.","As part of our rebuttal testimony filed in the General Rate Case on June 16, we included an update to account for a prior assignment of certain compensation costs to customers instead of shareholders. SCE expects to refund $17 million or $0.03 per share to customers. This refund reduced other CPUC revenue in the second quarter.","FERC revenue was lower due to $0.04 per share of items that were offset by lower operating costs and thus had no earnings impact. This was largely related to amortization in 2016 with the Coolwater-Lugo transmission project which was offset by higher depreciation. SCE continues to see lower operations and maintenance expenses quarter-over-quarter due to the ongoing implementation of various operational and service excellence initiatives. These initiatives contributed $0.03 per share to earnings in the quarter.","Higher depreciation is to be expected due to SCE's major capital spending program but was partially offset by the Coolwater-Lugo project recovery in 2016 mentioned previously. Net financing costs were also higher by $0.01 per share mainly due to increased borrowings to finance our capital program.","Higher income tax versus last year contributed a negative $0.05 per share which is mainly attributable to the 2016 timing of recognition for the recovery of flow-through taxes. In total, this results in an overall SCE earnings decrease of $0.04 per share.","For the quarter, EIX parent and other had a positive $0.03 per share earnings variance, mainly driven by a $0.02 per share benefit at the holding company from an IRS settlement of prior-year periods. Edison Energy Group contributed $0.01 per share to the positive variance, mainly due to the absence of a $0.04 per share charge related to the 2016 buyout of an earn-out provision, offset by a $0.03 per share goodwill impairment on SoCore Energy related to the decision to evaluate strategic options for the business including a sale, which Pedro already discussed.","As a reminder, as a result of our 2016 adoption of the new FASB accounting rules on share based payments, comparisons with the second quarter of 2016 are on an adjusted basis. Previously, we had reported $0.85 per share of core earnings in the second quarter of 2016. This is now $0.86 per share as adjusted. The adjusted quarterly earnings schedule is again included in the presentation appendix.","Please turn to page three. I won't go into detail on the year-to-date results since many of the quarterly earnings drivers are also relevant in the year-to-date period. One element that was not a driver in the second quarter but has contributed to earnings variances in the year-to-date period is the tax benefits related to share-based compensation that we realized largely in the first quarter.","Please turn to page four. As Pedro mentioned earlier, we are updating guidance to incorporate the tax benefits related to share-based compensation that we recorded in the first half of 2017 and the $0.03 per share SoCore impairment recorded in the second quarter. Our new range is $4.13 to $4.33 per share with a midpoint of $4.23 per share.","We continue to experience success around our operational and service excellence initiatives and cost control and effectiveness more generally. However, we have not made any adjustments to guidance at this point related to these items, as we continue to evaluate the various efforts and other work that may be required. We will update guidance in the third quarter as it has been our practice to reflect any additional changes following the summer season.","Please turn to page five. In June, after we submitted our rebuttal testimony, we provided an updated capital spending forecast in our business update. A reduction of $420 million reflected the General Rate Case capital adjustments between 2018 and 2020. As Pedro noted, $300 million was related to grid modernization and the remainder to operations support and other small programs. Today we are providing an additional update for our 2017 capital expenditure forecast, which reflects trends that we've seen in the first six months for both CPUC and FERC capital spending.","As we noted during the first quarter earnings call, SCE capital expenditures for 2017 have been trending lower than the $4.2 billion in our original forecast. We currently see 2017 capital expenditures to be $3.8 billion, generally reflecting the lack of approval of a grid modernization memorandum account, lower than expected new customer meters, and delays in transmission spending.","As we continue to refine our grid modernization spending estimates and review the work embedded in the plan, we have identified and focused on projects that have significant reliability benefits in addition to supporting our ability to integrate distributed energy resources. We have therefore included these projects in our traditional distribution capital spending. There are no significant changes to the 2018 through 2020 GRC period subsequent to our rebuttal testimony.","Please turn to page six. I won't spend a lot of time on page six as there were no changes from our prior June forecast. The main driver of our forecast is the General Rate Case rebuttal testimony. Our rate base forecast is based on the authorized weighted average rate base that is set in each General Rate Case for the forward-looking three-year period. Once SCE receives a final decision in the 2018 General Rate Case, our rate base forecast will be trued up along with our capital expenditures.","From a FERC perspective, our rate base also remained largely the same as the majority of the capital spending decrease is tied to projects that are expected to close outside of the forecast period. Despite these short-term discrepancies, over the long term, we continue to see SCE investing at $4 billion per year and adding at least $2 billion per year of rate base for the foreseeable future as SCE continues to implement its wires focused business strategy.","Please turn to page seven. As Pedro discussed in his comments, we received a final decision on the cost of capital proceeding for 2018 and 2019. SCE's return on equity will be adjusted to 10.3% from 10.45% and we will true up the cost of debt and preferred equity. We expect to file an advice letter in September with our forecasted cost of debt and preferred equity for 2018 and 2019. This true up will include our actual cost of debt and preferred equity as of August, as well as a forecast of debt and preferred equity costs to the end of 2018.","The cost of capital adjustment mechanism or trigger mechanism will be effective for 2019. That is the cost of capital will remain fixed in 2018 with a possibility of the adjustment mechanism functioning in 2019. We will implement the new cost of capital starting on January 1, 2018.","SCE continues to maintain a strong balance sheet and significant financial flexibility. Our weighted average common equity component of total capitalization is 50.2% as of June 30. We continue to maintain what we believe is a prudently conservative balance sheet at both SCE and at the holding company.","That concludes my remarks. Natalie, please open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from Ali Agha of SunTrust. Your line is now open.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you. Good afternoon.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Hi, Ali.","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","Hi.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","How are you? My first question, with regards to the new 2017 guidance, if we take the midpoint of the guidance, the new midpoint, that's implying that second half 2017 earnings will be essentially flat in second half 2016. Could you explain why that directly would be the case?","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","Ali, this is Maria. Hi. So we provided the guidance \u2013 we wanted to update guidance to incorporate the discrete items around the share-based compensation tax benefits as well as the SoCore impairment. We've included a new guidance from the get-go earlier in the year, the $0.31 of operational benefits and financing benefits. As we continued through the year, we're going to keep an eye on all of those things. And as we get through the summer period, we will revisit that and see if we need to make any adjustments. But for now, I think that's where we are on guidance.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. Well, Maria, there's nothing that would be driving flat comparisons, right, just fundamentally speaking?","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","We are, you know, doing the work that we've been doing every year. I think that we are looking at continuing to find ways to keep the O&M costs, et cetera, in line. And I think as we get through this period, we're going to take another look at guidance and we'll be back to you with that.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. And my second question, with regards to the GRC and the rate base outlook, are you expecting \u2013 first of all, I wanted to just clarify that, I mean from Pedro's remarks, that given where we are and the hearings going on, the settlement probably is not a high probability item. But then as you're going through this process, is there a possibility of further refinement to the CapEx and the rate base numbers before we reach the finish line from your perspective?","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Ali, let me take the first part of that and then turn to Maria and Ron Nichols for a second. On the possibility of settlement, we're not really handicapping the possibility. We acknowledge that there's been discussions. We don't have a comprehensive settlement at this point and we're focused on the hearings. We'll always remain open-minded but not really providing any sort of handicapping or probability of assessment.","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","Yeah. I think where we are right now, Ali, is in the middle of \u2013 or we're probably closer to the end of evidentiary hearings. We did file our rebuttal testimony which had some updates in it. At this point, we would be anticipating that we would make updates when we would get a proposed decision or final decision.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","I see. Thank you.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Thanks, Ali.","Operator","Our next question comes from Praful Mehta of Citigroup. Your line is now open.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks so much. I wanted to just touch on Edison Energy and the sale of the solar business. If you could just give some context around \u2013 you said you've already hired, I guess, bankers to run the process. Where we are in that process in terms of timing, and just size and scale of the business? And also user proceeds, is it just capital that will help fund the utility growth, or are you looking at something else?","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Let me kick it off and then Maria can fill in some of the details here. And hi, Praful. Nice to hear you. So as I said in my remarks, we have engaged an advisor this early in the process here, and the point is to explore all options. And I think as I mentioned in my comments, we really want to make sure we have an open mind. We think it's an interesting business, and frankly, solar will be a big part of the electric energy economy in the decades ahead. But given where we are at this point in time and particularly where we are in tax appetite, et cetera, we just wanted to explore whether there are other options, including the potential for a sale. Maybe Maria can fill us in, in terms of the scale?","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","Sure. And Praful, so you know the scale of businesses currently is not material relative to the rest of the company in terms of use of proceeds. We would see what happens at the time we completed a transaction if we do. But I would say, you can think about it more like general corporate purposes as opposed to anything else.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Gotcha. Fair enough. That gives the context, which is helpful. And then broadly, we are all looking forward to the broader Edison Energy discussion as well in September. But just to understand from that context, everything is on the table in terms of like more strategic decisions around do we want to stay in this business? Or is it more what are the milestones that we want to achieve in terms of how we wanted to kind of grow or build this business going forward?","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Yeah, I'd say it's more the latter. I think that we are, and as I \u2013 I think I mentioned in my comments, we think this is an interesting business and one that we want to prove out. I'm honestly a little worried that by the time we get to the September meeting, some of this might be anticlimactic because maybe (27:38) rocket science. But we're hoping to give you some just interesting way points in terms of more of the proof points that we see for the business and the time scale for getting it to earnings neutral, which is sooner rather than later, but we want to give you some more context around it and also some more views, some \u2013 what the long range potential scale can be for the business.","And so we want to make sure we set expectations right here. We're excited about it. We've got a lot of work to do. And we have a business to prove out and so the discussion will focus in filling in some of the blanks that we haven't been able to fill in to-date, and provide some of the metrics and milestones we'll be using, so \u2013 because we had an interesting discussion, but I also don't want folks to think there's a big cliff hanger or something like that. So it's not quite (28:31) here yet.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Gotcha. Fair enough. And just finally quickly on this grid modernization topic, it looks like at least from the current process, given its initial phases of the full grid modernization CapEx spend, it's more challenging and more difficult to get a bunch of that approved, or at least in terms of the support that you need from the customer advocates. Is that something you see as more of an education process almost in terms of how this kind of goes over time, and over time as people understand what grid model is and why it's needed, you get more support going forward?","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","I think it's important to start by saying \u2013 and again, Maria or Kevin Payne around it because I don't want to say more here, but I want to start by saying that, at least my interpretation of the discussion right now, I don't think that anybody is doubting that this state is committed to having a very different energy system and going towards 2030, cleaning the energy resources and cleaning a lot of the economy and using electrification to do that and having a lot more use of distributed resources as part of the supply stack and as part of customer uses.","The question some of the interveners are raising is one more of pace. And we believe that our proposal has responded to the data point the commission has put out to-date on the sense of urgency around this. And mind you, again, given that we view grid modernization as being essential towards driving the dramatic changes that will be needed across the California economy to get that 40% greenhouse gas reduction by 2030 12.5 years from now, we believe that the pace that we proposed in the GRC is merited.","But again, I think that the debate mainly is more about when, not if, and I think we're all waiting to see how the commission comes out in terms of their guidance. We had hoped we would've had guidance through the DRP (30:28) proceeding by this point that I think has not happened yet, and we might expect a decision more like in the third quarter. We certainly will look for guidance in terms of how the commission handles our proposals in the rate case, but it's not about that. Ron, you'd like to add, or Kevin?","Kevin M. Payne - Southern California Edison Co.","I would just add that there has been a bit of an education process, and we'll see how that plays out in the process, but it's making sure that the parties are aware that grid modernization also has very significant reliability and safety benefits in addition to what it does for distributed resources.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Absolutely.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great. Thanks so much, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, guys. I have a simple one, and you guys might laugh at me when I ask this one, but if I look at slide five, your capital spending forecast, the 2017 amount is down about $300 million, $400 million. But when I then look at the next slide, the rate base slide, nothing actually changes. Can you walk me through that again, am I missing something here? Is it because this is the first couple hundred million dollars of a five- or seven-year project and therefore, it wouldn't have actually booked a rate base until after 2020, or is there some other moving part that I'm just not following here?","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","So there's two pieces to the answer, Michael. This is Maria. The first piece is just what you said, the FERC spend doesn't actually close until after the forecast period, so you wouldn't see it in rate base until after that. So that's one piece of it. The other piece of it around the CPUC spend is that this is \u2013 2017 is authorized, 2018 through 2020 is part of our rate case. As we get a final decision in the rate case, we will be rolling through any changes to capital and to \u2013 et cetera.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Okay. But the FERC spending in 2017, you still would've earned AFUDC on that $300 million to $400 million, you just simply won't \u2013 you won't get that noncash earnings power over the next couple of years until you actually ramp that project up?","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","So correct, the whole $400 million is not FERC, by the way, but yes, we'll get AFUDC but that's the noncash aspect of it. Yes.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Okay. And then second question, when you get out to \u2013 let's say your 2018 through 2020 CapEx at almost $5 billion a year happens at that level and not at a lower level like interveners suggest. Will SCE need cash from the parent? Meaning, will the parent need to inject more cash than it has been historically into SCE to fund SCE's rate base growth?","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","I think from a planning perspective, it's a little early days to identify that sort of need. SCE has a fair amount of flexibility built in at the operating company level, so it has that extra layer of equity. But it also importantly has a very robust \u2013 or ability to have a very robust short-term debt program, so (33:44) program, which it can utilize to fill in the blanks as well. So we'll have to really see what the cash needs are at the utility, and since they have so much flexibility I think it'd be premature to estimate that.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Thanks.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","And maybe one thing to add, I know you've heard us emphasize before, as Maria said, there's a number of tools that we could use to address that as we get out there, and as we see what actually gets approved in the rate case. But even in the bookend case, well, we got everything that we asked for, we still don't foresee any need to issue equity at EIX level to support the SCE capital program. So that \u2013 I think you've heard us say that before, but it's an important part of the message.","And by the way, Michael, nobody's laughing at you inside the room. This stuff is complicated.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Thanks, guys. Much appreciated.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","You bet.","Operator","Our next question comes from Shahriar Pourreza of Guggenheim Partners. Your line is now open.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Hey, guys. Sorry if this was \u2013 obviously, this has been addressed a lot, but on sort of the modernization in spend, it's such a big piece of the growth and sort of this rate case here. I know it's a factor of timing, but is it a factor of \u2013 are you dealing with interveners that want to layer it in on the next rate case, or are they thinking more sort of back-end loaded? And I'm kind of curious, the revision you've done on sort of the capital side of this, did that impact some of the settlement discussions and why you're \u2013 we don't see something before you file \u2013 I mean, before the hearings start, I guess?","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","I'll kick it off by saying that it's probably hard to speculate where any one intervener is coming from, and I think we're focused on what happens in this case. The other thing I'd throw in here is that as we move forward into future rate cases, I'm not even sure we would have a separate grid modernization request. Grid modernization \u2013 but the grid will be becoming more modern, and so the kind of design principles we've embedded in this particular request, I think at some point, whether it's a next rate case or maybe the one after that, will get more and more baked into our overall request. Because that'll \u2013 we will be doing all the grid modern as opposed to having a separate grid mod request.","In terms of what drove the change in our update, and I'll turn it over to Kevin Payne here in a minute to give you a little bit more color, but it really was about the fact that with the benefit of an extra year and a half, couple years, and the fact that this stuff is all, frankly, fairly new in terms of design and we have some pilots, et cetera, we knew a lot more than we wanted to bake into the updates. So it was something we did on its own standalone basis as opposed to connected any sort of discussions. So, Kevin, more detail (36:35).","Kevin M. Payne - Southern California Edison Co.","Yes, sure. That's right. I mean, we -- I think there are two elements to this that we talked about before. There is a lot of education going on to get the interveners and the Commission itself to understand what it is that needs to be done, and then secondarily, in what timeframe? And as we've looked at our proposal more deeply and done more analysis over the last year and a half, as Pedro said, we've identified a few areas where we thought we could actually push some of the modifications out.","One that comes to mind is our sub-transmission relay replacements. So we know that that will need to be done eventually, and we know what it is that will drive it, and largely, the penetration of distributed energy resources and other things. But we have identified a different timeframe that we could do it in. So I think it's really about educating people about exactly what it is that needs to be done because some of the design features that we're proposing are new. But as Pedro said, in the next case, they will be our new design and we'll be continuing to implement that across the system.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Could the modernization spend \u2013 and that's helpful. Can the modernization spend kind of be carved out and something to be accounted for in a separate proceeding in between the rate case?","Ronald Owen Nichols - Southern California Edison Co.","The guidance we have from the commission is that that is not the way they've designed it. Even in the distribution resources proceeding where the concepts about what would need to happen to modernize the grid were introduced. It was explicit that the money would not be authorized in that proceeding, but that proposals would be made in a General Rate Case.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Okay. Got it. That's very helpful. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jonathan Arnold of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. Good afternoon, guys.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Hey, Jonathan.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. Just a couple of questions on the EEG. When I look at it in the Q, it looks like it lost $17 million in the second quarter, which is that same as second quarter last year, and compared to $5 million or $6 million in the first quarter of both years. Is that a seasonality or is it a different feel, given how you were evolving the business so far in Q2 this year?","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","So some of the things that are going on in Q2 this year actually relate to the SoCore impairment. So you'll see that we took a $10 million after-tax charge, about $17 million pre tax. And so that's embedded in the Q2 results for EEG, which is probably throwing you off in terms of making the quarter-over-quarter comparison. So far, year-to-date, I think you will see EEG as performing \u2013 absent the $0.03 impairment, EEG is performing consistently with the guidance that we provided.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","So does that mean that absent the impairment, you might have broken even this quarter?","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","No, I don't think we would've done that. Because the guidance for the year is an $0.08 loss.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Right. Okay. And then just separately, the Q also says that you're not accounting for SoCore as an asset held for sale because you're not sure you'll necessarily sell it within the next 12 months. Can you \u2013 I want to just be clear, are you \u2013 what is the scenario where you don't sell it? How will that business look as far as this portfolio and what is the message?","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","So I think that when it comes down to that comment about whether or not the asset is held for sale, you know that it's a relatively straightforward assessment of whether or not you think it's probable within the next year that you'll sell the asset. If it is, you give it that categorization. In this instance, since we're just starting the process with SoCore, we've just retained someone to help us on that process, we don't have enough market information to know if that's going to be the decision. But clearly, we are evaluating that option in a very serious way. So I think it's really sort of how the accounting works, and our actions are really, going forward, I think, indicative of the fact that we're taking seriously the process.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then similar note, Pedro, your remark was that you streamlined the focus on near-term needs rather than long term potential scale, does that change the \u2013 that suggests focus on getting to breakeven rather than growing, I think. Is it changing the timeframe? Without telling me what the timeframe is, but is it a sign that the timeframe is shifting?","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","No, it's not. It's not meant to be a signal that the timeframe is shifting. I think as we \u2013 the team took some initial steps. You always have the tradeoffs you go through in terms of what capabilities do you get in place now today, versus which ones do you get in place next week, versus next year or the year after. And in some cases we may have gotten some capabilities a little ahead of their time. And of course you're playing in a startup business, you're paying the freight for that. And so we wanted to make the adjustment and turn down the volume knob on some areas that will be valuable. We'll probably need to build those capabilities in the future, but we can still manage the business to do what we need to do and not have that cash flowing for these activities just yet. So frankly, just read financial discipline into the alignment that we made. Does that make sense, Jonathan?","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah, it does. Could you just remind me, have you made an actual commitment to sort of by when you intend to be earnings neutral?","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","We have not, but we will be sharing that with you in September.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Thanks, Jonathan.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gregg Orrill of Barclays. Your line is now open.","Gregg Orrill - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yeah. Thank you. Are you able to provide any guidance on what you think the holding company expenses will be going forward? I know they came down from $0.17 to $0.08 in the guidance. I guess that was due to tax timing.","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","So it was. The change was related to the benefits that we received from the share based compensation. I would say we're still in the same place we've been historically, that $0.01, $0.015 per month for the holding company is the right zone to be in.","Gregg Orrill - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Travis Miller of Morningstar. Your line is now open.","Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Good afternoon. Thank you.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Hi.","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","Hi.","Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Just one real quick follow up on the SoCore stuff. What would other options be besides a sale?","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Continuing to operate the business. I think with our strategic review, we're looking at a sale option, but we're also looking at the areas of emphasis that we have today, and do we want to turn the knob up on some of those or turn the knob down on some of those. Today, as you might recall, the business has really largely started by developing projects for commercial and industrial customers. The business has also added on community solar projects, looking at potential for other places that it could play in solar. So it's a strategic review just looking at where it can play and whether that should change and then having that view of how we would optimize the business and how we would maximize the values with EIX as the owner versus if somebody else who might be able to optimize that and signal through their response in an exploration of a sale.","Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Okay. So there is some probability that you would keep the business and invest in it or is that a zero probability?","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","I think we've just started the process of exploring a sale so I think it's probably premature to assign probability to non-zero probabilities to outcomes.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Yeah. And this is why it's not a full asset held for sale.","Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Sure. Okay. And then real quick on the grid modernization, how much of those numbers in 2018 to 2020 would you have to invest in anyway, kind of put it into distribution just like what you did in 2016, 2017 with some grid mod spending? How much could you just say okay, we didn't get approval for a grid mod, we're not going to do anything versus there's still some $100 million or so that we would have to do in there? Can you give a sense for that because you guys did the grid mod, right, for 2016, 2017?","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Let me kick off the answer this way. What we've done \u2013 you obviously saw what we asked for in 2016 and 2017 in terms of a memo account. We have not had action from the PUC on that. As we look more deeply at a lot of that spend, as Ron Nichols mentioned earlier, while some of that spend was design or conceived thinking about elements of grid modernization and the support for distributor resources, et cetera, there's a very gray line between the modern and the grid part to some extent, and so some of the work that supports grid modernization also supports safety and reliability in the system. And so we prioritized some of that work and proceeded with it in 2017.","When we get a rate case decision, we will see what the PUC decides, what guidance they have for us, how specific that guidance is, and then we'll manage the business prudently inside that. And as we \u2013 rate cases are every three years. Clearly, the day after we get the rate case decision, the guidance is pretty fresh. Three years into the three-year cycle, things change. And I think part of the job of a prudent utility manager is to reallocate capital within reason to serve customers. So it may be that there's some reallocation that might make sense in the future.","Kevin, a different view on that or anything you'd like to add?","Kevin M. Payne - Southern California Edison Co.","I agree. And maybe I could just add a little to that. The technologies that we're using in grid modernization are not unfamiliar ones. We have a certain level of activity there today: substation automation, distribution automation, things like that. Some of the larger grid management computer type systems are new but will ultimately have to be built out anyway. So part of grid modernization is implementing familiar technologies and emerging technologies and doing it at a pace that we think will support the state of California's goals.","If the Commission doesn't see the full extent of our proposal, it doesn't favor the full extent of our proposal in grid modernization, we will still consider and use aspects of those technologies to accomplish our safety and reliability goals such as focusing automation on our worst-performing circuits to improve reliability and those kinds of things. So we'll work within the authorization that we have, and we'll continue to advance the technologies that we implement on the grid.","Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Okay. Great. I appreciate it.","Operator","Our last question is from Anthony Crowdell of Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC","Good afternoon. You may have just addressed it. I was just curious, two quick questions. One is, is there an ability if you maybe delayed some of the other CapEx in your proposal and worked with grid mod to just show how effective and how important it would be for California meeting their goals, and once maybe the commission sees how effective it is, some of the projects that you delayed you could add into the next case and also grid mod? Is that possible or it's just too late in the process?","Ronald Owen Nichols - Southern California Edison Co.","Well, I think some of the -- we're doing some of that already in the pilots that have been requested by the commission, and with that exact desire in mind to be able to show how this works and do that at initially relatively modest level. As to how quickly those reviewed and move forward, it depends on the end results of that. It also depends on the continuing guidance that we get during the pendency of the GRC the guidance that may come out of the separate distribution resource plan proceeding. So there could be some initial guidance that comes out of that in that timeframe that could influence ultimate decisions on that. But even absent that, we would expect that we'll have some results during this next ERC on the pilot programs that could enable some additional activities go forward. It's hard to put a number on that at this point.","Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC","Okay. And just lastly on Edison Energy, I don't know if the company has already done it but maybe in September, is there the ability to show what maybe different business segments are causing more of the loss and maybe evaluate those, doing an evaluation of whether you sell that and keep some of the others? Or the company's not going to give that kind of detail?","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","Anthony, it's Maria. I think you're kind of talking about like underneath Edison Energy, the various service lines that we have, if one or the other is driving some of this. I think we think of some of those service lines really as a whole. They are sort of the first step in providing the types of advice and advisory services to the commercial and industrial customers that we have. And then layered over that is another service line, portfolio advisory services. So I think we think of them that way. We've already gone through an assessment of other aspects of the Edison Energy group businesses. So we talked earlier this year about water, about transmission, we talked a lot today about SoCore. So yes, those pieces have been evaluated, Edison Energy and its service lines we will view as more holistically.","Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC","And just lastly, I'd hate to go a whole call without talking about SONGS. Is there any ability to maybe settle or is there other settlement discussions scheduled?","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","As I mentioned in my remarks, the whole process for the mediation is confidential so I just can't comment, unfortunately, on the prospects for the meetings or the like. Let me just reiterate what I said before that we've approached this proceeding fully and taking it very seriously. And at the end of the day, if we and the other parties involved end up agreeing on a revision to the settlement that we think is in the interest of our customers and our shareholders, then we are certainly intellectually open to that and we'd be looking at that in the context of the various other alternatives outside of a mediation process including the potential scenario of returning to litigation. So we take it pretty seriously, and unfortunately that's about all we can say at this point.","Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC","Great. Thanks for taking my questions.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","No. Absolutely. Thanks a lot.","Operator","There's one question queued up, and this our last and final question and it's from Ashar Khan of Verican (52:47).

My name is Angie, and I'll be your operator today. [Operator instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Scott Cunningham, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Cunningham, you may begin.","Scott Cunningham","Thanks, Angie, and good afternoon, everyone. Our principal speakers today will be Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Ted Craver; and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Jim Scilacci. Also here are other members of the management team.","The presentation that accompanies Jim's comments, the earnings press release, and our Form 10-Q are available on our website at www.edisoninvestor.com. Also, starting this quarter, we have posted Ted's and Jim's prepared remarks on the website and filed it in 8-K, so that you can follow their comments. Later this week, we will distribute our regular business update presentation for use in upcoming investor meeting.","During this call, we will make forward-looking statements about the future outlook for Edison International and its subsidiaries. Actual results could differ materially from current expectations. Important factors that could cause different results are set forth in our SEC filings. Please read these carefully. The presentation includes certain outlook assumptions, as well as reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the nearest GAAP measure.","During Q&A, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. I'll now turn the call over to Ted.","Theodore Craver","Thank you, Scott, and good afternoon, everyone. Our first quarter core earnings were $0.90 per share, unchanged from the first quarter of the previous year. Because SCE has not received a decision in its 2015 General Rate Case, comparisons of results are not particularly meaningful. Jim Scilacci will cover the specifics.","I'm certain that what is on your minds now more than anything else is the filing we will make tomorrow with the California Public Utilities Commission, regarding communications with CPUC decision-makers during the SONGS settlement process. Although, we are still finalizing our response, I want to make some comments about what we expect to file. Since our work on the filing is still on going, there is some small risk that I will have to supplement what I say today, but it is outweighed by our desire to be transparent.","First, we do not expect to file any additional late ex parte notices. We conducted a thorough process to identify and review communications and internal documents concerning the settlement of the SONGS OII between CPUC decision-makers and personnel at SCE and EIX, who could reasonably be expected to have engaged in such communications.","As specified in the ALJs' order, we looked at documents from the period between March 1, 2013 a few weeks before the Warsaw meeting, and November 30, 2014, a short while after the settlement was approved by the PUC. This is a mammoth undertaking, involving an initial broad pool of slightly more than 2 million emails and documents, and then winnowing that group down in successive levels of review to isolate documents relating to the SONGS OII and the settlement process.","I've come to learn how these types of document searches and reviews are done. It is very complicated. It requires real care in setting up the parameters for searching and sifting, given the huge number of documents that could potentially be relevant.","It also involves some judgments about search parameters. We used multiple levels of review and a lot of checking and rechecking of work. We used an outside law firm to conduct this work. All of this was done in a sincere attempt to do a thorough, complete and proper job. We believe we have done so.","Our filing tomorrow will provide details on the search criteria and the multi-layered review and checking process used. This work will result in us providing a couple dozen emails in our response to the CPUC.","As I said, we do not expect to make any additional late ex parte notices. That said, we are providing in our response quite a bit of additional information in an effort to be transparent and forthcoming on contacts between CPUC decision-makers and SCE and EIX executives on SONGS related matters.","I want to highlight some of the additional information we intend to provide. We are providing a chronology of key events relating to the SONGS settlement, covering the period from the initiation of the OII to the commission approval of the settlement.","We are also providing a summary and the relevant documents, where we had communications with CPUC decision-makers, even though those communications fell outside of the criteria for filing ex parte notices.","These cover things like: a courtesy call to a commissioner, to give him or her a heads-up we are about to issue a press release on a SONGS related matter; or a commissioner initiated contact, which was a one-way conversation from them to one of our executives with no substantive response by our executive, that is our executive was essentially in listen-only mode; or communications between a CPUC decision-maker and SCE or EIX personnel on procedural matters; or updates provided to CPUC commissioners on the status of SONGS restart and system reliability efforts.","This effort has also highlighted for me the need to have Rule 8.4, which covers ex parte notices, reviewed and clarified. Any rule can't possibly cover every conceivable communication circumstance, which creates a need to interpret that rule.","Over time, the parties who regularly practice before the CPUC, commissioners, utilities and interveners alike, and resulting commission decisions, develop a body of accepted practice concerning that rule. We make every effort to comply with Rule 8.4 on ex parte notices.","In my opinion, Rule 8.4 could certainly stand to be clarified and updated. We are the ones who bear the reputational and financial risk of interpretations of, and after the fact judgments regarding, an ambiguous rule. We understand President Picker intends to review Rule 8.4. We very much welcome such an effort.","Our response also contains, as required by the ALJs' order, a privilege log of the documents withheld based on legal privilege. Finally, our response will contain declarations from Steve Pickett and Ron Litzinger. These documents primarily provide additional information surrounding the meeting former President Peevey requested in Warsaw. Again, we are going this extra step in an attempt to provide all parties and the public with transparency about this contact.","I want to make one final point on this matter. Some have contended that the settlement was influenced by the Peevey\/Pickett Warsaw meeting. While I can certainly understand the motivation for some to make this statement, it just doesn't stand up to basic logic.","To start with, the Warsaw contact was made a good two-and-a-half months, before we had even made the decision to permanently shutdown SONGS. Negotiations with TURN and ORA commenced after shutdown and proceeded with both sides writing on a clean slate, so to speak. The settlement negotiations lasted over 10 months, with 14 face-to-face meetings among the negotiating parties and numerous phone calls.","SCE did not negotiate any settlement with Peevey, nor did ORA or TURN. Peevey may have had his own ideas about what a settlement should contain, but he wasn't involved in the negotiations. Any settlement was going to have to address the same four basic cost items at issue, whether articulated by Peevey or anyone else.","Those four were: the cost of the replacement steam generators, how the non-RSG assets were going to be recovered, replacement power and O&M expenses. There was also the matter of how any third-party recoveries from insurance and MHI would be treated.","Identifying the areas to negotiate was easy, the hard part was coming to agreement on how they were to be handled, and everybody had different ideas about that. ORA and TURN were active, fully-engaged parties to the settlement negotiations. They reached their own conclusions, as to the gives and takes in the negotiations, and ultimately as to the settlement as a whole and the value it would provide to customers.","Importantly, the result of the negotiations was materially different from the general framework laid out by President Peevey in Warsaw. TURN and ORA in their April 17 press releases provided their views of the material differences between the settlement and the Peevey construct, and maintained ratepayers fared considerably better under the settlement.","Just yesterday, the Alliance for Nuclear Responsibility provided a different analysis that came to the opposite point of view, but still concludes that the settlement was materially different from the Peevey construct. All of this proves the point, comparing the final settlement to Peevey's generalized framework from Warsaw is bound to produce this type of debate, given the lack of detail in that suggested framework. This vagueness lends itself to differing interpretations, really guesses, as to what he may have had in mind.","What is most important here is that Peevey's contact with us and any subsequent contacts did not have any influence on the parties who are actually involved in the settlement negotiations.","As I said, our current plan is to file our response to the ALJs' order tomorrow. Hopefully, my comments provide some helpful context for that filing. I am sure you will understand that we will probably decline to say anything more about this matter in the Q&A session on this call and until after we've made our filing.","I now want to turn to some of our other business priorities. Of course, a major item for us this year is reaching a reasonable outcome on SCE's General Rate Case. We don't really have anything material to report on that effort today.","Beyond the GRC, our priorities for the business remain safety, operational excellence and investing and modernizing the electric system to enhance reliability, better serve our customers and support public policy. I'll touch on these briefly.","Safety leads the list of operational excellence priorities for us. When we say safety, we mean both public safety and worker safety. In both cases it requires us to constantly find new ways to keep the public and ourselves aware and focused on potential safety hazards, and to invest in ways to eliminate or mitigate safety risks.","Actually, some of this circles back to provisions in our GRC request too. Although we have continued to improve our safety performance in recent years, we can do more based on the best-in-class utilities and performance in other industries. A robust safety culture is a top priority.","Our other operational excellence priorities are reliability, customer service and affordability. Sustained productivity improvement must be part of our DNA. We have made substantial progress on this over the last several years, but we want to continue to improve.","One important measure is customer rates. We have mentioned to you before that our goal, the last few years, has been to keep the increase in our system average rate to 3% to 5% per annum. We seek to do this even in the face of cost pressures from expensive mandates that require substantial incremental investment.","Over the last five years, we have managed to stay at the bottom-end of that targeted range, which actually compares favorably with our peers in California and several others around the country. We would like to continue to push that down to the level of inflation or lower.","Today's electric system provides customers with reliable and affordable electric energy, but the system needs to be upgraded to meet changing customer needs. Residential and business customer needs are evolving, while policymakers want us to provide an electric system that facilitates a low-carbon economy.","To meet these needs, we need to be able to integrate more distributed energy resources, such as rooftop solar, energy storage and electric transportation charging. The Distribution Resource Plan and related filings we will make this summer to the CPUC will serve as the road map for modernizing the electric distribution system.","The long-term need to invest in a reliable and technologically advanced grid puts a premium on mitigating the potential rate impact of those necessary investments by doing all we can to manage our costs, while operating more effectively in meeting customer needs. This is critical for our long-term competitiveness.","Beyond our utility business, we continue to pursue growth opportunities in competitive businesses across the electric power industry. Doing so allows us to serve customers outside of SCE's territory. We are focused on providing energy services to commercial and industrial customers through Edison Energy as well as competitive transmission outside SCE's service area through Edison Transmission.","Frankly, I have never felt better about how our company is positioned for the future, both in terms of our strategy and the people we have in place to execute it. Our customers' needs and our industry will continue to evolve. I believe Edison is particularly well-positioned to be at the forefront of these changes.","With that, I will now turn it over to Jim Scilacci for the financial update.","William Scilacci","Thanks, Ted. Good afternoon, everyone. I'll cover the following topic in my remarks. First quarter result, our updated capital spending and rate base forecast and our financing plans.","I'll lead off my comments with a general statement about attempting to compare 2015 to 2014 earnings, because SCE is yet to receive a General Rate Case decision. The utility is recording revenues largely based on 2014 authorized levels. In the quarter SCE receives a final GRC decision, we will record a cumulative adjustment retroactive to January 1, 2015.","As Ted mentioned, earnings comparisons will not be useful until we report full year 2015 earnings. In the meantime, we believe the simplified rate base model is the best starting point to model full year earnings.","Please turn to Page 2 of the presentation. As Ted said, core earnings are unchanged year-over-year at $0.90 per share. GAAP or basic earnings per share are $0.38 per share higher. This is primarily due to non-core items last year related to the SONGS OII settlement of $0.29 per share and $0.07 per share related to EME. This quarter, we also had $0.02 per share of income under the HLBV accounting treatment for solar tax equity financings.","As explained in our last call, Edison Energy has tax equity investors. We are required to allocate income under the hypothetical liquidation at book value accounting method. Since this income does not relate to project performance, we classified it as non-core. Edison Energy is included in EIX parent and other results.","Edison International parent company costs are flat at $0.03 per share with slightly higher corporate expenses are offset by earnings from Edison Mission Group, as we continue to monetize Edison Capital's affordable housing portfolio.","With respect to our quarterly results, let me clarify the presentation of two items in our results. First, as I previously mentioned, we are recording CPUC revenues at 2014 authorized level, pending a General Rate Case decision. We used this approach except for one modification. We deferred $36 million of authorized revenues or $0.07 per share allocated to the first quarter related to incremental repair deductions pending the outcome of the GRC.","There is an offsetting $0.07 per share of income tax benefits shown separately on the slide. Since we don't know how the general rate case will treat repair deductions, we decided it was prudent not to recognize these benefits. The $0.07 is above repair deductions that are included in the 2015 GRC filing.","Second, let me clarify the presentation of SONGS, which is addressed in footnote 4 to this slide. During the first quarter of 2015, we began to amortize the SONGS regulatory asset and recorded property taxes, which are recovered through revenues.","During the first quarter of last year, we had O&M costs and property taxes that were recovered through GRC revenues. Neither of these affected net income, so we have excluded them from earnings drivers. A fuller description of these items is included in our 10-Q. Let me also note that beginning January 1, 2015, SONGS costs are classified as decommissioning expense, and recorded as a reduction in our asset retirement obligations.","Turning back to our slide. We did benefit from $0.07 per share of higher FERC revenues, primarily related to rate base growth and recovery of higher operating costs. Looking at costs, O&M is $0.01 per share higher. Depreciation and amortization costs are $0.04 per share higher from an increase in transmission and distribution investments.","Net financing cost benefited by $0.02 per share largely from higher AFUDC equity income. This reflects a higher AFUDC rate and a slightly higher construction work in progress balance.","After adjusting for the incremental repair deductions, SCE had lower tax benefits of $0.04 per share. The lower tax benefits relate principally to higher flow-through tax benefits related to higher repair deductions last year.","Although our results are better than most analyst estimates, I suspect this is largely due to difficulty in estimating quarterly profile of revenues and earnings from our 2014 authorized revenue requirement. Other than perhaps a favorable AFUDC equity earnings trend, which could remain a factor for the rest of the year, first quarter results are largely consistent, with this simplified rate base model, we encourage investors to use as a starting point.","Please turn to Page 3. We have revised our three-year forecast reflecting the removal of the Coolwater-Lugo transmission project. This 220 kV project, planned in San Bernardino County, was intended to support additional utility-scale renewable projects and overall grid reliability.","In mid-March, the California Independent System Operator determined that this project is not necessary to provide full capacity deliverability, but would conduct additional studies to assess potential need for all or portions of the project for future system requirements.","In the interim, the CAISO requested that the CPUC suspend its approval to proceed with the project. SCE supports the suspension, given the changing circumstances. Last week, the CPUC issued a proposed decision that recommends dismissing the Coolwater-Lugo application on the basis that sufficient deliverability now exists.","The Coolwater-Lugo project was forecasted to cost $740 million, of which the most recent forecast had $584 million of expenditures falling within the 2015 through 2017 forecast period. Partially offsetting this are costs and timing updates for a number of other smaller FERC projects.","The net result is a decrease of approximately $300 million in FERC CapEx in our capital spending forecast. For your information, we have provided the prior forecast at the bottom of the slide.","Lastly, SCE has FERC pre-approval for prudently incurred abandoned plant costs. We will continue to finance SCE's growth consistent with our authorized capital structure. Periodically, SCE will issue long-term debt and preferred stock to support its growing rate base. Of course, retained earnings will provide common equity needs.","SCE's 13-month weighted average common equity component was 48.4%. With the cash flow benefits from bonus depreciation expected to commence later this year, SCE may have only modest additional financing requirements this year.","Please turn to Page 4. Our rate base growth forecast remains 7% to 9% compounded annually during the forecast period. The FERC capital spending changes have a minor impact on the average rate base forecasts for each year. And SCE continues to have a number of growth programs, such as storage, electric vehicle charging, and the grid of the future projects that will remain important sources of growth well into the next decade.","Please turn to Page 5. We have included in this slide some of the important 2015 earnings considerations that we introduced on our last call. The only change is a minor revision to the 2015 rate base forecast that I have discussed earlier. To reiterate our prior statements, we don't plan on issuing 2015 guidance until after SCE receives a General Rate Case decision.","I'll finish with a couple of reminders on Edison International's investment thesis. Please turn to Page 6. First, we continue to emphasize a lower-risk SCE investment program focused on the wires business, both for reliability spending and for adapting the grid to the new technologies and needs that we've spoken about for some time.","To meet these investment requirements while keeping rate increases moderate, we'll require sustained SCE productivity improvements. Our base financing case remains no common equity issuance to support SCE's investment program.","Finally, we continue to see the opportunity for above-average dividend growth potential to complement SCE's earnings growth. Of course, our plan is to increase the dividend back to our target payout ratio in steps over time. Thanks.","Operator, let's get started with Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Daniel Eggers from Credit Suisse.","Daniel Eggers","I'll pass on the SONGS questions, as there's a lot of folks asked those questions. But I wanted to first ask with the July filing on kind of the distribution network of the future, what else should we expect in that filing? And prospectively, how quickly could that start to flow through your CapEx program and into rate, as you guys devise that plan right now?","William Scilacci","We're still working through that. The plan is to have a rather comprehensive filing on May 1, and we're hoping to include some potential investment parameters in terms of scale potentially. And we're trying to figure out how ultimately to work that into our capital plans. Now, as you remember, we have a general rate case coming up in 2018.","And as the way it works, we have to file for that '18 rate case next year in late '16, and we're still working through it. So we haven't made a final decision. It will certainly be included, we would think now, in '18 general rate case that we'll see at the end of next year. So I'll pause here, and look to Pedro or Maria, to see if they want to add anything more.","Pedro Pizarro","No. I think you covered it well, Jim. Dan, the PUC has specified a number of areas they want to see in the filings, so actually working through all of that. But your question is more about what are the impact in terms of capital spend, and we'll address that there, but largely the rate case is in the future.","Theodore Craver","We should clarify. The filing is not May 1.","William Scilacci","It's dated July 1.","Daniel Eggers","And then, I guess, just one another question, just specific to the quarter. There is a lot of O&M savings year-on-year, this year versus last. I know you guys are trying to hold up earnings until the GRC gets resolved. But how does that rebalance this year? Will you guys have a big catch up in O&M toward the backend of this year or is this going to be banged for this year and you kind of get on a normal cycle or more normal cycle next year?","William Scilacci","I think the safest thing to say, until you can get a general rate case decision, after that we'll be able to figure out what's normal. Until then, we're just speculating.","Operator","Greg Gordon from Evercore ISI.","Greg Gordon","Can you just tell us after you make your filing tomorrow, what the expected procedural schedule is going to look like at the commission? And do you expect that you'll still be able to get a final decision by May 30? It can be current open proceeding or it's already been delayed once, so is there a chance, given just the amount of the documents that you're giving to them and the limited amount of time between now and May 30 that we'll see another delay in that final decision date?","William Scilacci","So, Greg, this is Jim. We'll have, Adam Umanoff, answer that question for you. Adam is our General Counsel.","Adam Umanoff","It's difficult to really answer that question. We really can't speculate how quickly the CPUC will move to consider what we file and reach a final decision. They certainly extended the deadline to the end of May to give them additional time to consider just this filing. We're hopeful that it will be wrapped in that timeframe, but we can't be sure.","Greg Gordon","After you file, is there a comment period, where we will see responses from different parties to the case or do you file the documents and then next step will be some sort of pronouncement by the commission?","Adam Umanoff","Again, I'm speculating, but I would suspect to see folks file additional comments based upon what we've produced.","Greg Gordon","Question on a completely different subject. On the Coolwater-Lugo CapEx coming out, and you guys have indicated for some time, and I think this is sort of wrapped up into this filing coming on the grid of the future that you see a very long runway of necessary capital expenditures at or around or even potentially above the current sort of $4 billion plus-or-minus a year that you're spending, because the deferral or potential cancellation of the Coolwater-Lugo line just sort of opened up an opportunity for you to move other spending that's necessary forward. And if so, at what point would you reassess that or when will we get an update or should we just assume over the next three-year period that that CapEx is out, and we should do the rate base math based on the current guidance?","William Scilacci","I think my general impression was, we already saw a little bit of a shifting that was going on with the adjustment, because there was almost $600 million that came out of the forecast period and the net was $300 million. That's the normal course that will occur. And we've got some other things in the works, as obviously the electric vehicle charging application in is processing its way through the PUC. There is some storage opportunities. And the grid of the future likely could be outside this period, the '15 through '17 period, but we're still working through that.","So I think we will stay consistent with what we previously said before, that the capital expenditures are going to be in that $4 billion-ish range for the foreseeable future. And it will be probably later next year, before we can give you some additional visibility, because that's when ultimately the GRC filing will go in and that will cover '18, '19 and '20.","Operator","Michael Lapides from Goldman Sachs.","Michael Lapides","Just real quick question, thinking about bonus depreciation, Jim, you made a comment about it. Just curious, can you refresh us, what's in your expectation for bonus DNA in 2015? And is that already flowing through rate basis part of the ongoing rate case?","William Scilacci","It is. We've revised our general rate case, showing earlier in the year in the update proceeding, so that incorporate in our current numbers. And the reason why we referred to it that we see that impact later in the year is that we file our tax return in the September timeframe, and the cash flow benefit starts flowing through from that.","Michael Lapides","One other, just a little bit of a follow-up. If we see kind of any further downward changes in terms of capital spending, does this have a corresponding impact potentially on the pace of change you and the Board might make in terms of dividend growth?","William Scilacci","I think I alluded to in my last statement from Greg's question, that I don't really see a change in the level of capital expenditures going forward. And so that would be consistent with our current plans to step up our dividend, in steps over time, get back to our targeted payout ratio. So I don't really see a change, Michael.","Operator","Julien Dumoulin from UBS.","Julien Dumoulin","So I wanted to ask you a quick question here on rate base trajectory, right. So I appreciate that it's still early days. You've talked about the filing prospectively. You talk about sort of backfilling the CapEx. How do you feel about the current range below the low and high-end of the 7% and 9%, beyond the current forecast period? I mean, would it be appropriate to say that you're setting up to be in that range, while not formally committing yourself to that?","William Scilacci","Well, just the math of it, if we're staying in that $4 billion trajectory, the compound annual growth rate mathematically would slightly adjust over time downward. It's just the math. But I can't tell you how much and how we're going to fill it in, it really will depend upon how the capital expenditures workout and will be filed with the commission later next year.","Julien Dumoulin","And then a clarification to a prior question. So in terms of cost savings in the current quarter, I know it's challenging, and so maybe if you look last year, there was about $0.23 give or take. Is there any good way to kind of frame the current period vis-\u00e0-vis the cost savings and magnitude that we could see sort of maintained?","William Scilacci","That's a tough one. And not that I wanted to duck the question, until we get a general rate case decision, it's really hard to say. And we had embedded in our general rate case some assumptions regarding cost savings that we voluntary passed along to the customers. And we will continue to look for additional cost savings, but we'll have to wait for general rate case decision before we really know.","Julien Dumoulin","And ducking that one perhaps, if I may. In terms of M&A and strategically position of the company, how do think about sort of opportunities in California? And specifically thinking about the company outside of California, you mentioned competitive transmission, but in terms of getting a bigger footprint down the line or is that in the thought process at all?","Theodore Craver","I'm going to give you a wholly unsatisfying answer, because my lawyers will kick me hard if I say anything other than we don't comment on M&A matters.","Operator","Steve Fleishman from Wolfe Research.","Steve Fleishman","Jim, you mentioned the higher AFUDC rate going on this year. Could you just talk more about what's causing the higher AFUDC rate? Is that something that will continue on beyond 2015?","William Scilacci","Well, it's hard to speculate beyond. But remember, we did the regulatory asset financing earlier in the year bringing cash in, and which has the effect of reducing the amount of short-term borrowings we might carry, which tend to reduce the AFUDC rate. And I also mentioned that the flip balance was slightly higher, so it's a combination of a higher rate and a slightly higher balance that led to the overall slightly higher AFUDC equity earnings.","If it's going to continue, I just can't speculate on that now. It's going to be so variable in terms of what happens to the general rate case, what level of capital expenditures is ultimately authorized by the commission, and so forth. So I just can't speculate it at this point in time.","Steve Fleishman","And then just on the GRC. Is there any way to get a sense of timing on when we might get ALJ on that?","Theodore Craver","I'd love to tell you, but we just don't know, sorry.","Operator","Ali Agha from the SunTrust.","Ali Agha","Jim, wanted to clarify, as you had mentioned the best way to think about 2015 is earnings driver, is really looking at the rate base model. And also on a full year basis, whenever you think about that, given all the extra tax benefits and another incremental savings beyond authorized ROEs that you were getting in '14, the sense is you're starting off from a lower earnings base or will have a lower earnings base in '15 versus '14 and grow from there. So with that as a backdrop, can you explain to me, maybe I've missed this, why we're ending out with the flat earnings comparison in the first quarter, if we are sticking to general rate base model?","Theodore Craver","There is a lot of pushes and takes are going here and it really has to do with how they authorize '14. And until you really have a general rate case decision, I think what I was trying to imply earlier on my comments it's just very, very hard to compare '14 to '15 given the situation we've got now. So I will just like to say that let's just wait until we get a general rate case decision. And we'll sort through it and give you a better indication of what's the potential power, once the commission gives us a final decision.","Ali Agha","And then secondly, just to clarify the point on the process as far as SONGS is concerned, is it fair to say that the rehearing forum is really the forum where ultimately this whatever final decision comes out, it comes out from there. The reason I ask that is one of the parties, I don't know which, TURN or ORAs asking for some additional fines to be incurred. Is that all part of this rehearing proceeding or are there multiple or other proceedings we need to be aware of as well.","Adam Umanoff","The proceeding that is active is the request for rehearing that's before the California Public Utility Commission. There were, as I think you know a Federal Court lawsuit brought by one of the opponents that was in District Court. It was recently dismissed by the District Court, so the action right now is before the California Public Utility Commission. Once the decision is rendered by the California Public Utility Commission, of course an opponent who might be dissatisfied with the decision can appeal to the courts. But none of that activity is currently pending.","Ali Agha","Just to clarify that, I am sorry, so any party that's asking for additional fines based on the email disclosures, et cetera, that is all part of this rehearing proceeding?","Adam Umanoff","It's a part of the rehearing proceeding and related filings. For example, two example two days ago, the Alliance for Nuclear Responsibility filed an additional petition for modification in this docket, in the SONGS OII docket, but that along with the current request for rehearing, we would expect those all to be disposed off roughly at the same time by the California Public Utility Commission.","Operator","Travis Miller from Morningstar.","Travis Miller","Just wondering, when we're thinking about California specifically how do you think about the investments through Edison Energy and SCE when we're thinking about these new technologies, new age grid technologies. How you think about allocating capital to opportunities through SCE or through Edison Energy in California?","William Scilacci","I think primarily within the utility we see that's where the principle opportunity to invest in the distribution system resides. And that's where we see quite a bit of modernization and expansion of the distribution system taking place. So I would expect the bulk of the investment would primarily take place at SCE.","At Edison Energy or on the competitive side, so whether that's Edison Transmission or some of the CNI Energy Services or some of the other areas that we're looking at, that's really opportunistic and its based on the standard parameters that we've used over the years for investment on the competitive side.","If we see something that gives us a positive rate of return after considering cost of capital and risk, then we would seek to invest in those things, so long as it stays in the basic electric footprint that we have. So I think you should expect most of the capital would be dedicated to the SCE activities.","Public policy makers in California are certainly keen to see the utilities facilitate. The policy objectives are moving to a low carbon economy. That requires modernizing the system and allowing it to facilitate a number of the new technologies and that's where the bulk of the effort will probably be over the next few years.","Travis Miller","And do you think if you got approval to invest those money at SCE and you take away the filing here this summer. Could you carry lessons learned, so to speak, from SCE investments there, storage EV, et cetera, to Edison Energy investments outside of California? Is that a potential business model thinking that you could take lessons learned or would think about Edison Energy as completely separate type of investments?","Theodore Craver","This will be a fairly complicated answer. I would say, broadly, strategically, most definitely Edison International is in the electricity business and we look for opportunities not just in SCE's territory, but throughout. I think a lot of the changes that we see taking see place in the electric industry are in fact often occurring here in California. So there is definitely, I'll say, a general strategic leaning opportunity that comes from that. We have to be careful on some of the specifics there though.","Remember, a lot of the investments that are being made in SCE are being funded by customer rates, customer payments and we always have to be extremely careful about any bleed over a specific information or assets or value from the utility to the unregulated side. All of that is captured underneath our affiliate rules, but so long as we're really careful and cognizant on that, I'd say, your broader point, if you will, the strategic learning point is a valid one and one that we are actively trying to look for other opportunities outside of California.","Operator","Ashar Khan from Visium.","Ashar Khan","My questions have been asked. The only one I have, Jim, is this $0.07 that you said that you deferred. Is that $0.07 something, which is on an annualized basis or a quarterly basis? I was just trying to get a little bit better understanding of that $0.07?","William Scilacci","That was $0.07 in the quarter, Ashar.","Ashar Khan","So can we analyze that number?","William Scilacci","I don't know, because really ultimately it depends on what the GRC decision ultimately turns out.

Also here are other members of the management team.","Materials supporting today's call are available at www.edisoninvestor.com.

Tomorrow afternoon, we will distribute our regular business update presentation.","During this call, we will make forward-looking statements about the future outlook for Edison International and its subsidiaries. Actual results could differ materially from current expectation. Important factors that could cause different results are set forth in our SEC filings. Please read these carefully. The presentation includes certain outlook assumptions, as well as reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the nearest GAAP measure. During Q&A, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up.","I'll now turn the call over to Ted.","Theodore F. Craver, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Scott, and good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks today, I will touch briefly on our 2015 performance and then focus on Southern California Edison's and Edison Energy Group's, long-term growth opportunity. Closing out one year and starting a new one is a natural time to reflect on some of the longer-term themes.","Full year 2015 core earnings were $4.10 per share, $0.23 above the high end of our core earnings guidance range. We also introduced today our 2016 core earnings guidance range of $3.81 to $4.01 per share which reflects SCE's strong rate base growth, a continuing focus on improvements in operational efficiency and ongoing energy efficiency incentives.","We believe that SCE's rate base is the best proxy for long-term earnings growth potential. As Jim will soon describe in more detail, we have updated our forecast of SCE's rate base through 2017. Rate base for 2015 increased $300 million and our forecast for 2016 rate base also increased by $300 million. The rate base for 2017 increased by $100 million. It seems some investors have been expecting a substantial decline in rate base due to bonus depreciation, but the effect of bonus depreciation is less, and there are other offsets.","Bonus depreciation did not have any significant impact on 2015. Impacts pick up somewhat in 2016 and 2017. Bonus depreciation impacts are more than offset by a higher rate base from our distribution pole loading program on which we earn a rate of return, as prescribed in SCE's 2015 general rate case. Jim will provide a more fulsome explanation, but the bottom line is that we expect rate base to be slightly higher in 2017 than our previous forecast after taking into account the final general rate case decision and the full effect of bonus depreciation.","Customers will see the benefits of SCE's continuing efforts to reduce cost. Through these efforts, together with lower fuel and purchase power cost, the NEIL insurance settlement of our San Onofre claims and the 2015 GRC, customers will receive on average a reduction in 2016 rates of 8%. This is a significant benefit for our customers and something we are very pleased to deliver to them.","SCE's share of the $400 million NEIL settlement was $313 million. After legal expenses, 95% went to customers. This is another example of the benefits of the San Onofre settlement unanimously approved by the CPUC in 2014.","The last major step in implementing the settlement will be resolution of our pending and arbitration case with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. Hearings before the three-judge panel are expected this spring. We still expect a decision late this year. As we've said previously, we are under confidentiality provisions during the litigation process, so we don't expect to have further updates unless there is some material development.","The CPUC's December decision on ex-parte communications completed its consideration of the matters of the SONGS OII. The challenges to the Commission's approval of the settlement remain pending. We have no estimates on the timeframe to decide those challenges.","In the meantime, we are focused on the safety commissioning of San Onofre. Based on our current decommissioning cost estimates, our decommissioning trust funds are adequately funded and not expected to require any further customer contributions.","Our December dividend increase of $0.25, the second in as many years, equates to a 47% payout based on the midpoint of our 2016 SCE earnings guidance. We continue to see an excellent dividend growth opportunity as we grow SCE earnings and move up through our current targeted payout ratio of 45% to 55% of SCE's earnings.","I won't attempt a prediction of future dividend increases, but I will describe our thinking. Our earnings growth is largely driven by long-term rate base growth. After depreciation, capital spending of approximately $4 billion a year will translate into rate base growing by roughly $2 billion a year. This would yield a 7% annual rate base growth potential for some years to come, and if we have higher annual CapEx, we will have a higher rate base growth rate. Additionally, moving the dividend payout ratio further up in our targeted 45% to 55% range only adds to the potential annual dividend growth rate.","We believe that we are well-positioned for sustained growth in rate base and earnings at SCE. We have positioned SCE as a wires-focused business, consistent with our views on industry transformation and in alignment with California's public policy objectives to move the state to a low carbon economy.","We see more opportunities for growth than we do threats in the changes occurring in our industry. Recently, we have taken steps to further position Edison Energy Group to develop those opportunities.","We are focused on finding those areas where customers' needs are unmet, that match well with our competitive advantages, and that hold promise for scaling-up sufficiently. Edison Energy Group continues to expand into businesses that meet this profile, including distributed solar generation, energy services for commercial and industrial companies, providing new sources of water, and competitive transmission.","Our SoCore Energy subsidiary added more commercial rooftop solar customers in 2015, and now has nearly 250 projects operating in 16 states. It has expanded beyond rooftop installations to ground-mounted projects serving both community solar and rural electric cooperatives. SoCore also piloted an innovative project for Cinemark Theaters that combined its rooftop solar panels with energy storage from Tesla Energy.","We continue to build out an integrated energy services platform, which we call Edison Energy, to address the needs of commercial and industrial companies. Our market research has led us to conclude that the largest commercial and industrial companies with multi-state operations are underserved nationally in their energy needs and struggle to deal locally with many different utilities, tariffs and new technologies.","We believe we possess several competitive advantages to succeed with customers in this new and quickly evolving power environment. Our roots are as developers, operators and investors in complex infrastructure. We have deep technical, commercial and regulatory experience and knowledge of the power system. Our brand and substantial size gives customers confidence in our ability to deliver and contrasts with the dizzying array of untested start-ups.","Our platform was expanded through some recent smaller acquisitions in the area of energy engineering and in consulting, that was Eneractive Solutions; energy procurement advisory services, which was Delta Energy; and sourcing off-site renewable energy, which was Altenex. Edison Energy now counts one quarter of the Fortune 50 companies as clients, including General Motors, Microsoft, and Procter & Gamble. Next month, Edison Energy will launch marketing efforts to larger C&I companies, emphasizing its abilities as a comprehensive, integrated energy service solution provider.","Today, these new businesses are small, even though we think the opportunities could be significant. Currently, the vast majority of our capital is dedicated to our core business, modernizing the electric grid at SCE and to moving up our dividend ratio, payout ratio closer to the industry norm. Our approach to these new businesses will be disciplined, focused on small initial investments to understand strategic fit, profit drivers, and scalability. We have allocated some capital to testing and building our new businesses, but it is currently only around 1% to 2% of the total capital deployed at Edison International.","We are gaining confidence that there is indeed a market need for these new businesses and that they can be profitable. The major question is whether these businesses can be scaled up sufficiently to be significant to a company our size. If performance warrants and the opportunities continue to look sizeable, we are in a position to increase our commitment. We are encouraged but, ultimately, we will be driven by results.","So, to summarize, our strategy has three themes. Theme one, operate with excellence, meaning, we operate our existing business with a focus on controlling costs and customer rates and improving service to our utility customers. Theme two, build the 21st century power network. This means we invest in our existing business and manage the unprecedented changes in policy and technology. And theme three is to expand our growth potential. We systematically explore new growth opportunities by making disciplined investments where industry changes are producing unmet customer need, where we believe Edison has competitive advantages and where scalable opportunities exist.","Concentrating on these three strategic themes will allow us to remain relevant to our existing customers, produce higher than industry average growth in earnings and dividends, and provide the flexibility to adapt and grow in a climate of rapid change.","So, that's it for the big themes. Let me now turn the call over to Jim.","Jim Scilacci - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Ted. Good afternoon, everyone. My remarks will cover fourth quarter and full year results, our updated capital spending and rate base forecasts, and our 2016 earnings guidance.","I'll start with SCE's fourth quarter operating results. Please turn to page 2 of the presentation. SCE's fourth quarter 2015 earnings are $0.89 per share, down $0.20 per share from last year, but well ahead of the $0.66 per share implied by the midpoint of our 2015 earnings guidance.","Looking at the year-over-year comparison, two items from last year stand out. First is the $0.15 per share income tax variance, as shown in the right table. As part of the 2015 general rate case decision, differences in tax repair benefits for 2015 through 2017 flow through the tax accounting memorandum account or TAMA and do not affect earnings. Second is last year's $0.05 per share benefit from resolution of an income tax item from the 2012 GRC. This was recorded in revenues last year and is part of the $0.15 per share revenue variance.","A key item, and something that was not included in our 2015 earnings guidance, is an $0.08 per share benefit from a new balancing account for SCE's distribution pole inspection and replacement program. Let me provide some additional background. The 2015 GRC established a new balancing account to track costs to inspect distribution poles and to repair or replace them as needed. This is called the Pole Loading and Deteriorated Pole Balancing Account, or simply the pole loading balancing account.","Balancing account allows SCE to true up from actual O&M and capital expenditures. For 2015, actual capital expenditures substantially exceeded amounts included in the GRC decision. Because of the lateness of the GRC decision, the Commission did not limit expenditures for 2015, but did limit expenditures for 2016 and 2017.","Switching now from pole capital expenditures to rate base, the 2015 GRC decision included a pole loading rate base forecast of $296 million. Based on actual expenditures since the inception of the program, the 2015 rate base for poles increased to $625 million. As a result of the higher rate base, SCE recorded additional revenues through the pole loading balancing account to earn its authorized rate of return on the incremental rate base of $329 million.","The additional $0.08 per share of earnings is based on both equity and debt returns at the blended authorized rate of 7.9%. The balancing account impact was finalized as part of our year-end reporting cycle and was not previously included in our earnings guidance. The balance of the revenue variance largely reflects the implementation of the 2015 GRC, which lowered authorized revenues, as expected.","For the fourth quarter, O&M is a net positive $0.07 per share. O&M includes both the ex-parte penalty of $0.05 per share and $0.03 for additional severance costs as part of SCE's ongoing operational excellence efforts. The balance of O&M benefits are from lower transmission, distribution and legal costs. Lower net financing costs are a benefit of $0.03 per share. The incremental tax benefits from 2014 that I mentioned drive the unfavorable tax comparison.","One important item that was not a key earnings driver in the quarter is bonus depreciation from the 2015 tax law change. Bonus depreciation did reduce average rate base, but only by a nominal amount, or a net $31 million. The nominal impact is much less than our general statement that a 50% bonus extension could reduce rate base by $400 million each year.","I've come to the conclusion that it's very difficult to effectively estimate the impact of bonus extension until you do the detailed analysis. The fact is, there are second and third order effects that can occur making our general statement accurate only with a controlled set of assumptions.","With this preamble, there are three primary factors that reduced the impact of bonus deprecation on 2015 versus our prior forecast. First, under normalization rules, bonus depreciation is pro-rated in the first year in which capital additions are estimated to be put into service. Second, certain 2015 capital additions relate to work that began in 2014 and are eligible under 2014 bonus depreciation and thus were included in our prior rate case forecast. Third, the shift in tax payments caused 2015 working cash to increase. For rate making purposes, working cash is a component of rate base.","Later in my presentation, I will provide a complete reconciliation of rate base changes for 2015 through 2017.","As part of the key earnings drivers, revenues and income taxes are lower due to the higher tax repair deductions recorded through the pole loading and TAMA accounts. The higher tax repair deductions in 2015 do not affect earnings and are not shown on the right side of the slide as they are netted out. The total impact for the quarter is $0.45 per share in lower revenues and income taxes. For the holding company, costs are unchanged at $0.01 per share.","For SCE non-core items in the quarter include the previously announced $1.18 per share charge related to the write-down of the regulatory assets for incremental tax repair deductions for the 2012 through 2014 period. It also includes a $0.04 per share benefit from the NEIL insurance settlement and legal cost recoveries related to SONGS.","Holding company non-core items include a $0.03 per share gain on the sale of Edison Capital's affordable housing portfolio at year-end and a $0.01 per share related to accounting for income tax attributes related to SoCore's tax equity financing. Discontinued operations include a $0.02 per share EME-related cost for changes in net liabilities for retirement plans and additional insurance recoveries. Page 15 has a detailed summary of all non-core items.","Please turn to page 3. Full-year 2015 core earnings are $4.10 per share, down $0.49 from a year ago. SCE's 2015 earnings largely reflect the impacts of the 2015 GRC decision, especially the treatment of excess tax repair deductions, together with the other fourth quarter key drivers I mentioned earlier. Excluding the tax repair deductions now tracked in the pole loading and TAMA accounts, CPUC jurisdictional revenue is down $0.39 per share while FERC revenue is up $0.14 per share.","Among the key cost components, the favorable O&M trend relates largely to the positive fourth quarter factors discussed previously. The favorable net financing costs are mainly from higher AFUDC earnings that we have been reporting all year. The major driver of lower earnings this year is the loss of tax repair benefits.","In 2014, we recognized $0.41 of tax repair benefits. In 2015, these benefits either flow through the pole loading or TAMA accounts without impacting earnings. Full-year holding company costs are $0.01 per share above last year due to higher income taxes and expenses.","Please turn to page 4. This slide walks through the key differences between our 2015 core earnings of $4.10 per share versus the midpoint of our guidance of $3.82. First, you'll see the $0.08 per share related to the $329 million increase in pole loading rate base I discussed earlier. The additional equity return is $0.05 and the debt and preferred return is $0.03 per share.","O&M is favorable $0.08 per share due mainly to the factors I mentioned earlier. The other financing benefit is AFUDC at $0.01 per share. Taxes are the other driver due to the implementation of the TAMA account and clarification of treatment of tax items that would otherwise negatively impact earnings but now flow through this account. Holding company costs are at $0.05 per share positive variance due to higher income from Edison Capital and income tax benefits.","Please turn to page 5. SCE's capital spending forecast increased slightly, adding $300 million in 2016 and $100 million in 2017, as Ted has already mentioned. The 2016 change principally relates to an updated estimate for pole loading expenditures up to the cap provided in the 2015 GRC decision and for cumulative spending in 2016 and 2017.","This incremental spend will flow into rate base as you will see in a minute. The 2017 increase relates to modest changes in the scope and timing of FERC transmission investments. SCE's current forecast does not include any incremental spending on distribution resources plan activities. The forecast also excludes any energy storage investments or Phase 2 of the Charge Ready program.","Please turn to page 6. A third major transmission project, the Mesa Substation, has been included in our capital spending forecasts for some time, but has advanced sufficiently through the regulatory approval process that we felt it appropriate to describe more fully. This is the replacement of a 220 kV substation with a 500 kV substation. It will provide additional transmission import capability, allowing greater flexibility in the siting of new generation and reducing the amount of new generation required to meet local reliability needs in the Western Los Angeles Basin. This is a Cal ISO approved project.","Please turn to page seven. This page shows the increase in SCE's rate base forecast that Ted mentioned. I will explain the changes in a moment. The two-year compound annual growth rate for both the Outlook and Range cases is 7%. With the complexity associated with the extension of bonus deprecation and the normal changes to our capital expenditures flowing into rate base, we felt it would be helpful to provide a more fulsome reconciliation of rate base changes.","Please turn to page eight. For 2015, we ended the year with $329 million of additional rate base from pole loading capital expenditures. As I mentioned earlier, the extension of bonus for 2015 is lost in the rounding. We estimate the impact of bonus depreciation to be about $300 million in 2016 and $700 million in 2017 relative to our prior forecast.","The incremental additions to rate base from a pole loading account activity is about $600 million in 2016 and about $700 million in 2017. In effect, the impact of bonus is offset by the change in the pole loading rate base. Net, net, net, relative to our prior forecast, rate base increases $300 million in 2016 and $100 million in 2017. Lastly, we plan to update our capital spending and rate base forecasts through 2020 when we file our next general rate case in early September.","Please turn to page nine. Today, we introduced 2016 earnings guidance with a midpoint of $3.91 per share with a range of plus or minus $0.10 per share. For SCE, we start with the rate base forecast of $25.1 billion shown on page 7. The rate base math yields earnings of $3.81 per share. While a number of positive variance in 2015 may not recur in 2016, we do expect additional earnings contribution from the energy efficiency of $0.05 per share. We also anticipate incremental productivity and financing benefits of $0.17 per share. This implies earnings of $4.09 per share at SCE.","Lastly, we deduct $0.18 per share for holding company costs with no range. In the past, I've talked about holding company costs of roughly $0.15 per year and, on our last call, we pointed out that the sale of Edison Capital would eliminate the earnings contribution this business provided. The $0.10 per share loss for 2015 included $0.06 of income from Edison Capital. The increase over 2015 relates primarily to higher financing costs.","Please turn to page 10. The last slide reinforces our view that EIX has one of the better opportunities among large cap utilities for rate base, earnings, and dividend growth.","Thanks, and I'll now turn the call over to the operator to moderate the Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question coming from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith of UBS. Your line open.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Hi, good afternoon, and congratulations.","Theodore F. Craver, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Julien.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Great. So first, Ted, let's start with your opening comments on the call at the services side of the business. I'd be curious, as you see that scaling, you've done some acquisitions here, what kind of earnings power could we'd be looking at over the years? What kind of contributions and when do you see that happening?","Theodore F. Craver, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","It's a great question and words were chosen pretty carefully to indicate. At this point, we want to try to do more in the testing side, make sure that we actually think that we've got a business here that really makes sense and that is scalable. It's that last part that I think we're spending most of our time on now.","Assuming it's scalable and assuming we can make those kinds of investments that would really allow us to fully capture the opportunity, to be relevant to a company our size, we've generally thought that the suite of businesses on the Edison Energy side, so not just energy services stuff I spent a lot of my comments on, but really the whole group of companies there, this probably got to be, just as a general rule of thumb, I'd say it's got to be somewhere in the 10% to be significant or meaningful to a company our size.","So I think, we want to see steady progress in that direction. We want to see that these things are capable of actually scaling to that size. But assuming that things continue on in the path at least we see in these very early days, that's the type of magnitude that we would be looking for.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. Excellent. And turning to the numbers a little bit, just as a follow-up quickly, can you elaborate a little bit more, Jim, on the rate base offset here on 2015, just as you think about the number being supposedly less than you had initially supposed or at least thrown out there? What's the exact accounting there?","Jim Scilacci - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So, there's a couple of things going on. Bonus depreciation did not have impact in 2015 because of the items that I ticked through. There's a number of things that really offset it, the biggest piece being the proration bonus depreciation in the first year and the overlap of those that float from 2014 into 2015 that we had already accounted for. And the biggest thing here is the pole loading program.","We picked up a little over $300 million of rate base from pole loading that was not included in our prior forecast that we included now based on our year-end review and that's the biggest offset for 2015. And you can see bonus growing in 2016 and 2017 as you expect. It would be at 50% and it reaches up to $700 million impact by 2017. But really what's happening in the pole loading program in a sense is offsetting the bonus depreciation and it gets up to \u2013 pole loading gets up to $700 million.","And so, the only changes really going on are the small changes in and around what's happening with FERC and a little bit of the CPUC. So, we do have an increase in rate base, ultimately through 2016 and 2017, but the bonus depreciation is offset by the pole loading program. So, page 8, if you don't have it there, really kind of describes the full details of how rate base changed over this three-year period and I think it's probably the most helpful tool.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Indeed. Thank you.","Jim Scilacci - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","All right, Julien.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question coming from the Jonathan Arnold of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah. Good afternoon, guys.","Jim Scilacci - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hey, Jonathan.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Just a quick one, follow-up on the pole loading. And I think you mentioned the year-end review, Jim. Can you just talk us through a little bit how that processed and it seems like you would have known about this when we can kind of met you at EEI, for example. So, I was just curious kind of how it sort of changed so much.","Jim Scilacci - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","It's a darn good question. In going through the general rate case decision, there was some confusion over how it actually operate and it came after further review in discussion that we were picking up \u2013 there was no limit to capital expenditures from the inception of the program through 2015. And the actual final decision included, really for all intention purposes, an estimate of pole loading based on some preliminary work. And because we were able to true up for actual capital expenditures, that delta fell out when we went through and reviewed it in more detail.","So, as you recall, as we were going through the guidance as we got into the third quarter, I think for all intention purposes, we are so focused on repair deductions in getting all that accounting right and understanding it, that we didn't fully appreciate what was happening with pole loading, and so we picked it up as far as our fourth quarter accounting enclosure.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thanks for that. And then just on the $0.18 drag, the parent and other for 2016, would you \u2013 in terms of getting a sense of how much these other businesses are a drag on numbers today, obviously, hopefully, there'll potentially be an opportunity at some point, how much of that $0.18 is associated with investments you're making in early stage businesses? If you weren't making them would be there...","Jim Scilacci - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. No, it's a good question. And what's happened in the last couple of year, Edison Capital, the sell down on that portfolio has been masking some of the ongoing costs that are occurring at the holding company. And for all intents and purposes, the change, I mentioned in my comments that we've guided people that the holding company cost on an annual basis taking out Edison Capital had been running at about $0.15 and that we bumped that up to $0.18. And the delta is primarily financing cost, not Edison Energy.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And do you see the Edison Energy costs kind of ticking higher before the net kind of comes \u2013 moves in the other direction, I guess?","Jim Scilacci - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","We're going to grow the businesses, but we also expect earnings from the businesses, too. So that, we'll have to see how it plays out going forward, and you can see we didn't have growth year-over-year from Edison Energy and we acquired three businesses. They have ongoing earnings. So our goal ultimately would be a source of earnings not use. So we'll have to see how things develop as we move down the road here.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Great. And one other topic, we read recently that there is kind of a new resource planning regime coming at the PUC out of SB 350 requiring integrated resource plans. Could you talk a little bit about that and how you see it changing how you've operated, if at all?","Theodore F. Craver, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I'd like to turn that question over to Pedro.","Pedro J. Pizarro - President & Director, Southern California Edison Co.","Hey, Jonathan. It's Pedro Pizarro. How are you?","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good. Thank you.","Pedro J. Pizarro - President & Director, Southern California Edison Co.","So, SB 350, the bill that implemented the 50% renewables by 2030 for the state along with some actions on electric transportation calls for an integrated resource planning process. It's early days for that, Jonathan. It will work its way through the CPUC. Our view of that and view of the legislative intent in it is that it will help provide the PUC and state agencies a macro view, a planning perspective of how all the pieces fit together. We don't see necessarily they're significantly changing the nuts and bolts of the procurement process that we have because it's a pretty well prescribed process for that.","I think as we understand the intent, it's more of a macro view on how the pieces will fit together across different kinds of renewable resources, transmission, et cetera, but in reality, the details will be worked out through the PUC process.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Any sense of when you would have to file (38:43) such a plan?","Pedro J. Pizarro - President & Director, Southern California Edison Co.","I don't know, Jonathan. I know that that's just beginning to work its way through the PUC. I believe there's been some scoping work there. So, probably within a year or so will be the likely timeline.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great, all right. Thanks a lot.","Pedro J. Pizarro - President & Director, Southern California Edison Co.","It's not a next month kind of item.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Perfect. Got it. Thank you.","Pedro J. Pizarro - President & Director, Southern California Edison Co.","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, guys. Congrats to a good year and start to 2016. One question for Jim, one for Ted. Jim, just curious the $0.17 at SoCal had in guidance for 2016 for what sounds like a combination of O&M management as well as some financing benefit, how should people think about the that longer-term, meaning after 2016, whether you'll be able to keep that in 2017 or 2018, whether we should assume some of that continues in the 2017, but eventually that all kind of flows back to customers?","Jim Scilacci - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","You're correct. In 2017, it's the third year of the rate case cycle, the three-year rate case cycle, so you would expect us to hopefully retain some portion of that going forward. And 2018 is the general rate case, the test year. So the benefits we've derived over the prior rate case cycle flows to the customers.","But again our goal would be to seek additional operational savings. There's more work to be done and we'll continue to focus on that, so we would hope to achieve some level of savings. I'm not going to predict what those might be.","And the other piece here, the embedded cost of debt, we wouldn't file a general \u2013 our cost of capital proceeding would be effective and we'd litigated in 2017 for 1\/1\/2018 effectiveness assuming we don't extend it again. And so we would expect in 2018 that we would true up the embedded cost of debt at that time, unless we extend it again. So there is a...","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it....","Jim Scilacci - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","...a number of the things that will be going up and down and we will just have to depend \u2013 our purpose here is to try to find additional savings, but a lot of it will toss back in 2018 as we reset our rates.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. And Ted, when you are kind of looking at it and at the distribution resource plan for the future, the different utilities have taken different tacks about how much they want to put out in the public domain or how much they want to put in front of the regulator, about what the spending levels could be. You've been much more robust in terms of kind of spending through 2017 and then spending from 2018 to 2020. How do you expect the regulatory process to play out and when do you expect to get some certainty and actually put some capital to work on this?","Theodore F. Craver, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think probably the short answer is, based on what reaction we've gotten so far on the distribution resources plan, it looks like it's going to be probably more of a discussion in the 2018 to 2020 rate case. It's possible some other things will move in there. I mean, we've had some things such as the Charge Ready program and a few of these, but I think the bulk of the discussion around what those expenditures for modernizing the grid would look like. And...","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","So in other words, that spend in the 2015 to 2017 timeframe, is that spend you don't actually expect to get approval to do the just a couple of hundred million dollar level?","Theodore F. Craver, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I've not seen a ready vehicle for being able to make any significant investments in the near term. So absent that, I think most of the discussion would be in the 2018 to 2020 period with the upcoming rate case.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Thank you, guys. Much appreciated.","Theodore F. Craver, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","You're welcome.","Jim Scilacci - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Michael.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question coming from Steve Fleishman of Wolfe Research. Your line is open.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Yeah. Hi, good afternoon, guys. Just, Ted, on the dividend commentary, just wanted to clarify, obviously it's the same payout range of 45% to 55%. I think, the language you used was through the payout range and kind of I think you at some point even said targeting more over time toward the industry averages. Are you kind of implying that you're now targeting at least the high end of this range and may be looking to raise the range over time?","Theodore F. Craver, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. In probably, as Jim likes to say, my usual way trying to be clear, but vague. I guess I would \u2013 what I'm trying to point out are a couple of things. One, just the rate base mechanism that converts into earnings suggests to us this kind of 7-ish, 7% kind of a growth opportunity that would translate through to dividends, but we're at the bottom end of the range based on the midpoint of the 2016 earnings guidance range that we just gave. Depending on where earnings actually come out depending on how we would look at moving our way through the 45% to 55%, we would kind of view that 7% as more of a floor than anything else. So that was the principal point that I was trying to insinuate in there.","In terms of whether we're trying to get to a specific point in the 45% to 55%, I clearly was not trying to give a specific point that we were targeting there. 45% to 55%, we feel, has been the appropriate range, given that we have a higher than industry average rate base growth and higher than industry average earnings growth rate. These things kind of ultimately balance together, but for the foreseeable future, we think we'll have a \u2013 we'll continue to have a higher than industry average rate base in earnings growth and so the 45% to 55% seems to still be about the right range.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Great. And then one other question on the productivity and financing savings. Should I assume this is the just ongoing efforts that you guys keep having to reduce costs in the business, if not kind of like one-time in nature in 2016? And thus, all else equal that should continue at least until we get to the next rate case?","Jim Scilacci - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Jim Scilacci - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question coming from the line of Praful Mehta of Citigroup. Your line is open.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thank you. Hi, guys.","Jim Scilacci - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good afternoon.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Good afternoon. So a quick question on growth rates and it's good to see the 7% through 2017, I guess the importance of DRP is what I'm trying to get to from the 2018 timeframe. What I'm trying to figure out, what proportion, I guess, of your CapEx spend will be DRP related and is there any concern that that DRP component can get pushed out or delayed in terms of CapEx spend for the next cycle?","Jim Scilacci - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","It's a darn good question. We've said repeatedly that we think the capital expenditures are going to be in that $4 billion plus or $4-ish billion range for the foreseeable future and all I can give you until we file our 2018 GRC is a sense that part of the component that could push the spending higher is DRP, but this year will be important \u2013 the balance of this year gathering from the PUC, what they're thinking about the DRP we will include in our GRC an appropriate level. And there are some other things that are pluses and minuses. Ted mentioned it. I had it in my script.","We've got the Charge Ready program. It's flowing through. That's on a separate track and we need to get through the Phase 1 before we can add the additional \u2013 potentially up to $300 million of capital expenditures for that program. I also said, we didn't have any storage-related expenditures in there. So, there's a number of things that are in the mix, and when you get into a GRC, you take a look at all the factors, you want to make sure that your rates are appropriate that you're not putting up \u2013 pushing out the other edge for what you can afford from an affordability perspective.","So, we'll take all those things into consideration, and, of course, we're going to pass back the benefits that we've realized in the current GRC cycle, and so we will have to see how all things work out. So it's hard to predict beyond that 4-plus-ish range going forward until we actually file the GRC in September.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Got you. Thanks, Jim. And just quickly a much more detailed question, but one of the offsets, I guess, you mentioned the bonus depreciation with this working cash. Can you just give us some context of what it is, and how do you see that like in future years? Is that a component in like 2016, 2017 as well, and what's the kind of size or order of magnitude of working cash?","Jim Scilacci - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, that's a long answer. But if I could simplify, as a company, we invest cash and it has to do with when you make ultimately payments and we have this part of the GRC, if you'd like to read all about it, there's a section in the GRC filing that's called the lead-lag study. And as a result of changes, as a result of bonus, it affected the lead-lag study and provided essentially more rate base for us. And I'm going to stop there, unless you want the gory details, which I'm going to lose my ability pretty quickly. But if you want more details, we'll be happy to take you through it after the call and we'll give you some more information.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Got you. That'll be helpful. Thanks, Jim. I appreciate it.","Jim Scilacci - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question coming from the line of Ali Agha of SunTrust. Your line is open.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you. Good afternoon.","Jim Scilacci - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good afternoon, Ali.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hey, Jim or Ted, when you talk about this potential run-rate of CapEx $4 billion plus annually going forward. If you kind of reverse that with the cash flow benefits, I guess, from bonus depreciation, how do you look at your capacity to wrap up that CapEx before you run into, say, issuing new equity or before rate impacts get too big in your mindful customers? What kind of, I guess, cushion do you have, if you had the opportunity to go above $4 billion and still not have to issue equity and still keep the rate impact? What do you think is fairly reasonable?","Jim Scilacci - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well. It's a tough question. That's really a financially modeling one. And you have to take in other factors, too. You have to look at debt capacity at the utility, how much short-term debt you could use. You can look at debt capacity at the holding company and there are just factors that you're balancing accounts, how it changes your cash. As you know, now we're fairly over collected in our balancing accounts.","So you have to look at all these things and then crank that through the model in terms of what you're trying to do in terms of capital expenditures and then how you're targeting rate base and then rate growth. So it's a very complicated set of factors that the important thing the management team here will do between now and September is try to get all these dials just right and as we prepare for and file our 2018 GRC. So it's not a satisfactory answer, but there is just so many components to go into it.","Theodore F. Craver, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Ali, this is Ted. I think one piece that we have said at various points with investors is that the high-level and without getting lost too much in any specifics for one year versus another, things are in equilibrium, assuming around this 50% equity debt capital structure and around a 45% to 55% dividend payout. You're about in equilibrium when you have long-term growth in the 6% to 8% range. You start getting much higher than that, it starts getting \u2013 you need other things to help out.","And in the past, when we had an extremely high growth rate, when we were in that 10% to 12% we did have a number of unusual things. That's where the global tax settlement deal really helped us out, bonus depreciation, and those types of things. Absent those, we would have really run too hot and we would have to issue equity.","The other part that you mentioned, which I think is really worth of emphasizing again here, increasingly, I think the focus is to try to really hold the line on customer rates. If we look at the long-term trajectory, the history here, last 20 years, we've actually managed to keep customer rates at or below the rate of inflation, and we definitely want to at least continue that. If anything, we'd like to be able to have rates stay flat. But fundamentally, our goal is to try to keep it more around the rate of inflation or lower.","If you get too hot a growth rate in here, especially given the relatively modest growth in energy consumption, you're going to really put pressure on rates. So that becomes, as much as anything else, kind of the governor on what we want to have in the way of growth. So, customer rates, equity, long-term growth rate all of that kind of boils down to you want to focus to stay somewhere in this kind of 6% to 8% range. Get much hotter than that, you're going to have issue equity or have pressure on rates.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay, very helpful. Second question, with regards to where we stand on SONGS, just to understand the process, now it appears we're really waiting for the ALJ decision and that sets the clock with regards to the Commission or Board, et cetera. Is that it or are anything else pending or anything else you can point to for us to try to monitor this from our vantage point?","Adam S. Umanoff - Executive Vice President & General Counsel","This is Adam Umanoff, the General Counsel at EIX. There really isn't anything else we can point you to. There is a request for rehearing and their petitions for modification that are pending. Until the ALJ rules on the petitions for modification, and that goes up to the Commission, and until the Commission rules on the request for rehearing, there is really no other action to consider.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Understood. Thank you.","Jim Scilacci - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Okay, Ali.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question coming from the line of Ashar Khan of Visium. Your line is open.","Ashar Khan - Visium Asset Management LP","Good afternoon and congrats. Jim, as I guess one thing which we are trying to fathom is everything is now trading on 2018, and if I'm correct, you mentioned you will provide the 2018 rate base in September when you file the rate case, but I just wanted to get a couple of things right. So, you said, if you spend about $4 billion, that adds to approximately like $2 billion of rate base and that should allow you to keep your 7% EPS CAGR or rate base CAGR going from 2017 to 2018. Is that correct, that's what I heard?","Jim Scilacci - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So, just a clarification, the 7% CAGR was from 2015 through 2017.","Ashar Khan - Visium Asset Management LP","Okay.","Jim Scilacci - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Since we don't have any other numbers out there, we're just giving you the indication of $4 billion-ish is the appropriate level of capital expenditures going beyond 2017.","Ashar Khan - Visium Asset Management LP","But $4 billion is equal to $2 billion in rate base, right? That's the correct math?","Jim Scilacci - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","It is a rough rule of thumb, yes.","Ashar Khan - Visium Asset Management LP","Okay. And secondly, you also alluded to, I just want to mention, if I got it right is that, you do expect the efficiency savings, the savings that you have like $0.17 right now, productivity and financing benefits, you don't expect them to go to zero in 2018. You expect there to be some level, you don't know what, probably not as high as $0.17, but there should be some level of those savings still there in the next rate cycle, is that fair?","Jim Scilacci - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","That would be our hope.","Ashar Khan - Visium Asset Management LP","Okay.

Our principal speakers today will be Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Ted Craver; and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Jim Scilacci. Also with us are other members of the management team.","The presentation that accompanies Jim's comments, the earnings press release and our Form 10-Q are available on our website at www.edisoninvestor.com. We will be using the presentation in a more complete business update that will be posted tomorrow on our website.","During this call, we will make forward-looking statements about the financial outlook for Edison International and its subsidiaries and about other future events. Actual results could differ substantially from current expectations. Important factors that could cause different results are set forth in our SEC filings. We encourage you to read these carefully. The presentation includes certain outlook assumptions, as well as reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the nearest GAAP measure. [Operator Instructions]","With that, I'll turn the call over to Ted Craver.","Theodore F. Craver","Thanks, Scott, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, Edison International reported solid third quarter core earnings of $1.42 per share, up from $1 per share last year. Keep in mind that year-over-year quarterly comparisons are somewhat skewed, principally because of the delay in receiving the General Rate Case decision from the CPUC, which dampened earnings last year. That said, third quarter core earnings for this year reflect the benefits of our continued cost management efforts and favorable tax benefits not anticipated in our original earnings guidance.","Importantly, we are raising Edison International's 2013 core earnings guidance to $3.60 to $3.70 per share. This replaces our previous guidance of $3.25 to $3.45 per share. Jim will comment more fully on the quarter-over-quarter differences and guidance changes.","As I have said in previous earnings calls, creating long-term value at Edison International involves 3 major efforts: Resolving uncertainties relating to our San Onofre nuclear plant and Edison Mission energy; growing our earnings and dividends; and preparing for transformative change in our industry. I will comment on each of these in the remainder of my remarks.","In September, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, or NRC, finalized its inspection report, which evaluated SCE's response to the NRC's Confirmatory Action Letter and address the remaining open items from the NRC Augmented Inspection Team report for the SONGS outage. In its report, the NRC pointed to flaws in the computer code and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries proprietary engineering models used to design the failed steam generators at SONGS. As a result, the NRC issued a Notice of Nonconformance with NRC regulations to Mitsubishi Heavy Industries as the contractor. And a preliminary white finding and apparent violation to SCE as the operator of SONGS. It is not unusual for the NRC to cite the licensed operator even when problems are created by a vendor or contractor. There were no penalties imposed on SCE by the NRC, and SCE has submitted written comments to the NRC on the preliminary white finding.","We fully intend to hold Mitsubishi accountable for its failure to provide properly functioning steam generators and for the damage it has inflicted on our customers and our company. On October 16, SCE submitted a request for arbitration to the International Chamber of Commerce for at least $4 billion in claims against Mitsubishi for damages that the SONGS owners have suffered. These claims are consistent with those outlined in the July Notice of Dispute, and include the new steam generators, replacement power to serve our customers, lost revenue and inspection, repair and other related costs.","In the meantime, the Order Instituting Investigation related to SONGS is continuing at the Public Utilities Commission. On November 22, we will submit opening briefs for Phase 2, which addresses adjustments to rate base and interim-rate making. The estimated timeline for a Phase 2 decision is the first quarter of 2014. The schedule for Phase 3, which addresses prudency, has not been set. We are hopeful that the SONGS OII can be resolved next year.","Let me now turn to EME and the recently announced NRG transaction. The NRG transaction is part of a plan sponsor agreement to which EIX is not a party. The plan sponsor agreement contains term sheets for an EME plan of reorganization, the details of which have not been provided to us or to the bankruptcy court. As we have stated in the 10-Q we filed today, we are reserving our right to support the plan, oppose it and\/or seek modifications to it. Under the skeletal plan filed with the bankruptcy court, if the sale to NRG is completed, then a reorganized EME would be wound down but would retain the right to pursue claims against Edison International. Likewise, EIX will retain the right to assert its claims against EME. In other words, matters between EIX on the one hand and EME and the creditors on the other are reserved out of the NRG transaction and left to the plan of reorganization to be submitted and argued in accordance with applicable judicial processes. If the litigation is pursued, then presumably, reorganized EME will need to reserve out of the NRG sale proceeds for our claims, as well as the cost of litigation. Edison International does not know if a complaint against it will ever be filed containing the allegations we saw claimed by the creditors' committee motion in August. It would obviously be beneficial for all concerned if everything were wrapped up at once. But if the complaint containing such allegations or other allegations is served, we will defend ourselves vigorously. We will not be intimidated by claims we don't think have merit.","Remember that as a result of the bankruptcy process, the investment in EME was written off last year and EME is no longer included in our operating results. EME was and remains structurally separate from Edison International. We have presented more detail on these developments in our 10-Q filing. Given that this involves matters that are pending in court and that many of the details related to us have not surfaced, we don't intend to comment further at this time.","This brings me to how EIX management continues to focus on earnings and dividend growth as the primary means for enhancing the shareholder value for our investors. Our forecast of capital expenditures produces a 7% to 9% compound annual growth rate in SCE's rate base through 2017. This forecast is based on the 2015 General Rate Case Notice of Intent that was submitted in July, along with updates to transmission investments.","In mid-November, SCE plans to file the formal application for our 2015 General Rate Case. We do not expect material changes from the Notice of Intent, which demonstrated the need for long-term reliability investments. I would like to emphasize our hope for timely review of the application and a decision to allow for implementation of new rates in January 2015.","We are working hard to resolve the key uncertainties facing our business while providing strong growth prospects through continued utility investment. The additional cash flow generated from the past several years of increased investment and rate base is sufficient to support both future growth and dividend increases in steps over time back to our target payout ratio. We believe this is the best formula for achieving shareholder value.","I've made the statement several times to investors that shifts in public policy, coupled with advances in technology, are combining to create transformative change in our industry. Along these lines, there have been some interesting developments recently, particularly on the public policy front that I want to highlight.","Assembly Bill 327 was signed by the governor last month, which addresses residential rate design, renewable energy standards and net metering for distributed generation in California. The bill starts to address some of the inequities in the current rate design by collapsing the number of residential rate tiers from 4 down to, possibly, 2, and allowing for up to $10 per month fixed charge. The bill also sets the current 33% renewable requirement as a floor rather than as a cap.","Another provision directs the CPUC to develop a rate structure for net energy metering customers that considers the costs and benefits to all customers, not just those with rooftop solar systems. These provisions of AB 327 now moved to implementation before the CPUC in a formal rate-setting process. SCE supported these needed changes to customer rates and worked with numerous stakeholders to get this bill passed. SCE will be proposing its phase rate structure recommendations to the CPUC later this year. We are hopeful that the first phase can be implemented next summer.","Another policy update is on energy storage. In October, the CPUC established a target for California's investor-owned utilities to install 1,325 megawatts of energy storage by 2020. This policy decision is one of the first in the United States and was created to optimize the grid, better integrate renewable resources and help reduce greenhouse gas emissions. SCE's share is 580 megawatts and the policy allows for up to 50% to be utility owned. The first solicitation under this new requirement will be in December 2014. We expect this will be implemented as a mix of utility-owned and third party investment.","In October, the CPUC hosted a meeting to explore future business models of the California investor-owned utilities. I find it encouraging that the Commission is thinking about longer term strategies and regulatory models in our industry. Ron Litzinger presented our perspective, focusing on the need for infrastructure investment to transform the distribution grid from a radio system accommodating one-way flows of electricity to a more advanced and flexible system capable of two-way electrical flows. Such a system is needed to better enable distributed energy resources such as rooftop solar, electric transportation and energy storage.","As the utility of the future continues to unfold, we intend to be at the forefront of that change, providing the enabling capital and engineering know-how while working with stakeholders to manage the ratepayer impact of state and federal energy policies. I see all of this as an exciting opportunity to create value for our customers and our shareholders through long-term growth and change.","I'll now turn the call over to Jim Scilacci.","William James Scilacci","Thanks, Ted, and good afternoon. My comments will focus on the following topics: Third quarter earnings, updated capital expenditures and rate base forecast and our increased earnings guidance.","Turning to Page 2 of the presentation. As Ted has already said, third quarter 2013 core earnings are $1.42 per share, up $0.42 from last year. SCE contributed $0.35 of the earnings growth. The key drivers are shown at the right side of the slide. As with the first 2 quarters, the largest earnings driver is the delay in the 2012 General Rate Case decision. This timing item creates a quarter-over-quarter revenue difference of $0.29 per share. You will recall that during 2012, before our final GRC decision was received, we recorded revenues at 2011 authorized levels. In addition, as we have indicated in prior quarters, SCE's earnings related to rate base growth are largely offset by the lower CPUC return on common equity.","To these comparisons, this quarter, the impact from SONGS is grouped into 1 category with a $0.02 net positive impact. There are 2 main drivers here. First, a favorable reduction in O&M as compared to the third quarter of last year, when we incurred inspection and repair costs as part of our efforts to return the station to service. With our June decision to permanently retire SONGS, we obviously did not incur these costs during this quarter.","Second pending the outcome of the SONGS investigation at the CPUC, we are no longer recording return on SONGS rate base as we indicated in the June -- in June with the updated guidance. As we transition SONGS to decommissioning, revenues and expenses recorded will be affected and will make period-over-period comparisons more difficult. We have estimated the impacts of the main financial statement line items in this slide footnote. The important point is that we continue to only record revenues for actual costs, which are lower than GRC authorized revenues. Actual costs do not include depreciation, taxes or return.","O&M savings, excluding SONGS, contributed $0.02 per share to earnings. These savings include planned cost reductions from the implementation of the Edison SmartConnect digital meter program. We also continue to benefit from O&M savings related to organizational realignments that have taken place over the last several quarters.","Depreciation, excluding SONGS, increased $0.07 per share, reflecting the impact of new investments. This quarter, net financing costs are $0.05 higher than last year, primarily from financings that support rate-based growth in accordance with SCE's authorized capital structure. AFUDC earnings are also included in this category. These earnings are lower quarter-over-quarter due to lower AFUDC rate and construction work in process balances.","The last item is the $0.13 per share benefit from income taxes. A majority of this relates to continued benefits from the prepared deductions that were highlighted in our guidance. The other tax item is a $0.06 per share benefit of repair deductions from generation assets based on a new IRS guidance received during the third quarter.","Year-to-date, we have recognized $0.16 of incremental repair deductions, which is higher than the $0.15 for the year that we included in our original February guidance. This is largely due to an increase in the amount of plant closings that qualifies repair deductions than we originally estimated. I'll come back to this in the discussions of guidance.","Edison International parent and other costs produced a positive variance of $0.07 per share. This relates primarily to an increase in consolidated state income taxes last year, as we had to adjust our state apportionment factors based on declining EME revenues. There were no non-core items from continuing operations in the quarter. EME is reported as discontinued operation and is no longer consolidated as part of our results. During the third quarter of 2013, we did record an $0.08 per share charge reflecting changes in our estimate of income taxes related to EME. Together, the core earnings and discontinued operations tie to the basic and diluted earnings, up $1.34 per share for the quarter.","Page 3 summarizes the year-to-date results and core earnings drivers. I will not go into the full reconciliation for year-to-date results because the explanation is similar to the quarter.","Turning to Page 4, we've updated our capital expenditure forecast. 2013 capital is expected to be near the bottom end of the original range due to lower costs on 2 transmission projects, Devers-Colorado River and Eldorado-Ivanpah, that are largely completed this year and a slower ramp-up of CPUC infrastructure replacement spending. The revised range for 2013 to 2017 is $18.2 billion to $20.6 billion, which is $300 million to $400 million higher than the August forecast. The increases in the last 2 years is largely due to an updated cost estimates for the Coolwater-Lugo and West of Devers transmission projects. These transmission projects, which are shown on Page 5, have been in our forecast since 2011 when we received CPUC incentive approval for equipment rate base and abandoned plant recovery. In conjunction with the recent CPUC, Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity applications for both projects, we've updated our capital estimates.","Also, on Page 5, note that these costs do not yet reflect projects' scope increases related to FAA requirements related to the Tehachapi Renewable Transmission Project. We will update these costs once a final decision is received from the CPUC.","Turning to Page 6. Our rate base forecast remains the same, except for the $200 million increase in 2017 for the previously mentioned transmission projects. Rate base growth continues to be 7% to 9% compounded annually through 2017. As a reminder, this slide removes SONGS from all of 2013 and future years pending resolution of the OII process.","Now let's move to SONGS and the process recovery for the different cost components, please turn to Slide 7. As Ted mentioned, SONGS investigation is well underway and we are currently in Phase 2. Over the summer, testimony was submitted on the treatment of rate base and materials and supplies, as shown on Slide 8. SCE's decision is that the used and useful portion of rate base, or $425 million, should receive a full return on the investment at our currently authorized 7.9% cost of capital. The remainder, or $733 million, shall receive a reduced return of 5.54% for the weighted authorized cost of debt and preferred stock. A final decision on this phase is expected in the first quarter of 2014. Although the schedule has not yet been set for Phase 3, we continue to believe the SONGS OII can be completed by the end of 2014.","Additional slides covering the various cost categories and sources of recovery of costs are included in the appendix.","Please turn it to Slide 9. We received the CPUC proposed decision on the 2013 forecast Energy Resource Recovery Account or ERRA. This is the balancing account for fuel and purchase power. I wanted to give an update on this because even though it does not impact earnings, it does affect liquidity. The utility is under collecting this year as we have not yet received decision on our 2013 ERRA application. Currently, we are $719 million under collected in this account and project to be about $1 billion under collected by year end. The reason for the under collection is that current rates are set at 2012 levels and do not include increased market purchases to cover SONGS and higher power, natural gas and greenhouse gas costs. The proposed decision, if approved, would increase rates about $200 million. It would also move $321 million originally estimated for SONGS replacement power to the SONGS balancing account for consideration without making a determination on rates movements. In the 2014 filing, we have recommended a 2-year amortization of the 2013 under collection to moderate the impact on customer rates. A decision on the 2014 ERRA filing is expected by the first quarter of 2014.","Finally, we are financing the under collection with short-term borrowings.","Now let's discuss our updated earnings guidance on Slide 10. We have increased our core earnings guidance by $0.30 per share to a new range of $3.60 to $3.70 per share. We have also updated our key guidance assumptions. I think it's easier to walk through how 2013 guidance has evolved.","Let's turn to Page 11. When we gave 2013 guidance in late February, we used our simplified earnings model for SCE and identified the potential for $0.31 of upside from repair deductions, O&M savings and energy efficiency. Concurrent with the SONGS shutdown announcement in June, we lowered core guidance by $0.20 per share. This action incorporated lower debt, preferred and common equity and AFUDC earnings and other transition costs. All those elements remain in effect. Today's guidance increases -- increase reflects 2 items. First, our operating expenses and other miscellaneous items. With continued strong cost management, we forecast an additional $0.10 per share benefit, bringing the total to $0.23 for the full year. As we said in February, the cost savings will flow through the customers and are embedded in our 2015 General Rate Case.","Second, our tax benefits. Tax benefits relate primarily to property-related deductions including updated estimates of completed projects that qualify for repairs for tax purposes and cost of removal deductions and new tax guidance for generation-related repairs, as I previously mentioned. Together, we see this increasing our full year benefit by $0.30 per share on a core earnings basis. We have reaffirmed our parent company and other costs at $0.15 per share for the year, yielding an updated core EPS guidance in the midpoint of $3.65 per share, which we have ranged to $3.60 to $3.70 per share in our formal guidance.","We anticipate providing 2014 earnings guidance when we report full year results in late February of next year.","Thanks. And now, I'll turn the call over to the operator to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] First question comes from Dan Eggers with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Jim, I -- just following up on that -- the O&M question or the O&M trajectory. Can you talk a little bit about how the better savings are coming together, where you guys are finding the benefits? What carry-through that -- should have into the \u201814 expectations as you kind of look at maybe some run rate savings, and then, how the GRC is recalibrated, if you guys remain successful in doing better than planned as you've done this year?","William James Scilacci","Okay. So just taking \u201814 -- I'll do it in reverse order. We said all along, you should look to our rate base growth, so I used the simplified model. And there will be O&M and tax benefits that flow into \u201814, but we haven't made any projections of what those numbers will be. And I think we've said that the tax benefits will be less in \u201814. And we'll have to update those based on what we're seeing as we flow through \u201813. And again, we won't make any estimates of what our guidance will be for \u201814 until February. But I think it's the best model you can use, is the simplified approach using the rate base model. Especially as you push out to \u201815, which all the tax benefits and the O&M reductions should flow back to customers and be picked up as part of the rate case process. So using that simplified approach is the soundest way to project earnings beyond \u201814. Going back to \u201813, now we've said there's $0.23 of operating expense savings as you can see in the key assumptions in our guidance page. And what's driving this, clearly, we're seeing some benefits flowing through from some of the cost reductions we have undertaken through the course, the first 3 quarters of this year. Some of that has been masked, too, because we've had a number -- amounts -- a significant amount of severance-related expenditures that as you work through the reductions have slowed now as you get into the third quarter, we have fewer anticipated for the fourth quarter. So now you'll see the benefit of the cost reductions coming through. And I'll pause and look at Linda or Ron if they want to add anything to the answer. Anything?","Ronald L. Litzinger","I mean, our O&M cost reductions, largely 3 areas. SmartConnect flowed through this year, reduction in meter readers and field service reps. The bulk of it has been reductions in our overhead or staff functions and then, there's been the San Onofre reductions as well. We continue to benchmark ourselves against the industry on an O&M dollar per customer benchmark. We continue to identify potential savings but known savings, as Jim said, are reflected in our 2015 rate case filing.","William James Scilacci","Do you want to follow-up, Dan?","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Yes. And I guess, just on the CapEx program and the kind of the mix of transmission and distribution with the higher level of distribution and the forward plan now, how visible is the distribution spending as you look out to \u201815, \u201816 and \u201817? And how do you guys plan to manage that with the Commission to make sure you get as good of a yield on CapEx as you have in the last rate case?","William James Scilacci","Yes, I'll take that first and I'll let Ron and Linda provide a little bit more detail. So distribution is ramping up and it's primarily in 2 areas. It's infrastructure replacement and pole loading. So we're doing more based on the age of the infrastructure. And in our General Rate Case proceeding, the rationale or the reasoning for this is all laid out in the testimony. And the challenge is to ramp-up, and part of what we said for \u201813 is because of the increased spending in distribution and a number of items we have to do is having the manpower in order to achieve these capital expenditures increases. So I'll pause there and let Ron and Linda add anything to that.","Ronald L. Litzinger","The bulk of the increase from our past infrastructure replacement levels is the pole loading program that Jim noted. In addition to the normal pole deterioration we see with the large influx of additional telecom attachments, we need to replace poles to address the loading on the poles. And so we have ramped that up to a level that's consistent with our long-range replacement target for poles, the level that we feel we need to be at to stay in equilibrium. So it's the first asset that we've ramped up and achieved that on in this rate case. And we're just going to continue ramping up our infrastructure replacements to be more consistent with the age of our assets.","Scott S. Cunningham","Dan, this is Scott. Just one other comment, everything that Jim and Ron have spoken about were factors that were included in our presentation for CapEx. Previously, the changes that Jim alluded to this quarter were largely related to updated transmission project cost estimates for 2 specific projects.","Ronald L. Litzinger","Yes. We had put in preliminary estimates for West of Devers and Coolwater-Lugo from several years ago. And now that we're going formally into the licensing phase, we've updated those costs.","Operator","Next question comes from Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","On SONGS and timing and the OII, I think it was your comment, Jim, you were confident you could wrap like the whole thing up during 2014. And then you were speaking to being in Phase 2 but I think the really broader comment was about the whole OII.","William James Scilacci","Yes, I think I've been indicating consistently that we hope to get it through by the end of 2014, so essentially leave the bulk of the proceedings, which is the Phase 3, for the balance of 2014. So that's just a hope or an expectation.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And what are your hopes of being able to maybe get to accelerated resolution?","William James Scilacci","I can't go there, but we're just going to go through the process and keep on track in terms of what the Commission has established for the proceeding.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then on a -- to a different topic. Could you just -- I have no chance to see all the filings but where do you stand on equity ratio, currently? And should we think of these benefits that you're having in, some of which will flow through and then others weren't, as something that's going to just help to build a little equity cushion?","William James Scilacci","It can, it does have that effect. We're at 49.5 as of September 30. And so that's the 13 month basis, obviously. And we do use short-term debt at times to moderate the impact. And so, again, just kind of hidden in your question is we have no plans to issue equity, if that's what you're alluding to. So we're going to manage this based on what we know and we'll watch our capital expenditures and we'll use short-term debt and we'll take that all into consideration and how we're trying to moderate the need for potential capital financing.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Again, my question probably was more accurately on how much headroom do you think you have?","William James Scilacci","We do have some. And again, this is all we're looking out well into the next couple of years as we look at that number. So we'll bounce around based on how we do long-term financings, how we use short-term debt and what the earnings will be going forward.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So, some is the answer?","William James Scilacci","Yes, it has an impact.","Operator","Next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So you alluded to on the call earlier some of the energy storage possibilities that are, I suppose, coming to fruition perhaps next year. If you could talk about what the rate base potential is. You talked about, I suppose, 500 and change megawatts, 50% rate baseable, what kind of an investment could that translate to ultimately?","William James Scilacci","Just let me start here because we haven't put out anything in our -- in the General Rate Case proceeding. It does not include anything at this time related to the storage potential. So we're going to evaluate it and consider what's there but it's premature, I would say. And I'll let Ron fill in here to suggest what the earnings potential might be from that.","Ronald L. Litzinger","No, that's right, Jim. We're taking a look at the decision. We're primarily interested on the distribution side, that would go through the rate case process. And on the transmission side for energy storage, we haven't made a decision. We're still evaluating and estimating what, if any, capital we would look out on the transmission side.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Got you. And then just looking at the rates in here in the discussion ongoing, I mean, when do you look for something out of the CPUC as far as addressing and reconciling the issue?","William James Scilacci","Is that related to the storage? I missed those.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Sorry, with regards to the DG and the legislation in the quarter.","William James Scilacci","Oh, the 327. The Commission right now is working on a schedule. And then I don't know if it's public. Ron, could you comment?","Ronald L. Litzinger","I don't think so. I don't think there's a schedule out yet.","William James Scilacci","From what we're hearing, it's going to be sooner rather than later. So they're trying to move it along as rapidly as possible so we could hopefully incorporate it in rates. It could go into effect in \u201814.","Theodore F. Craver","So, summer of \u201815 -- summer of \u201814.","William James Scilacci","Summer of \u201814.","Operator","Next question comes from Ali Agha with SunTrust.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","First question, just -- can you remind us again, you -- every call you alluded to us that one of the key drivers for you is ramping up the dividend. You've also told us your range for payout and you're below that. When I look at the different things going on, your CapEx ramps, I think, 2016 is the peak year, according to your schedule. You got the GRC case, most of next year, and, of course, the SONGS issue. Can you just again prioritize to us how you look at these issues in terms of how that will influence the dividend? And when, at the earliest, should we think of you getting into that range that we've been seeing for the last several years?","Theodore F. Craver","Well, Ali, they've dubbed me the one to answer that question. This as Ted, how are you? I don't think we will attempt to provide any kind of a schedule for when we would get back into the 45% to 55% payout ratio. What we have said is that we believe we'll be able to move our way back to that 45% to 55% target in steps over time. And in order to do that, that means you have to have a dividend rate increase that's greater than your earnings rate increase. So I think that gives you some sense of how we would, at least, see the trajectory to get there. But we won't provide a specific target date for getting back into that target zone.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Ted, fair enough. But just to prioritize, or at least, the way you think about it between the CapEx timing, SONGS resolution, GRC, can you just give us a sense of how you think about what's more important than the other, as you're thinking through this conceptually?","Theodore F. Craver","I don't know that I could say what thing is more important than the other. I mean, frankly, a lot will depend on how these things evolve. But I think you put your finger on some of the key considerations. The part that I think is most important to reemphasize is because of the substantial investments that we've made over the last several years, we have a much larger rate base, which is producing much larger cash flows. And now, we really see our CapEx kind of leveling out albeit at a high rate, but leveling out, not continuing to increase. So we're kind of in this roughly $4-billion-or-so zone per year in CapEx. So with the growing rate base and a level annual CapEx that produces substantially more cash, which allows us to get back to our target payout ratio on dividends. Yes.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","I was just going to say my second question, you've talked about and you've shown that your rate base numbers in the back end have actually gone up slightly because of the transmission CapEx. Are there any scenarios in which any of those projects could be in jeopardy because of the cost overruns? I mean, is there a scenario where we may have to actually reduce the rate base numbers as we look out the next year through \u201817?","Theodore F. Craver","Well, again, it kind of gets into the specifics of each one. If you could take Tehachapi as an example. A big chunk of that increase, of course, came from a Commission order on Chino Hills to underground the 3.5-mile section. So, I think we look at that as, that's what's been ordered by the Commission, it certainty will be important from a FERC approval standpoint. So it's a host of things that affect the costs. In some cases, we've actually come in on budget, indeed a little bit below budget and on time on some of these transmission projects, the ones that were just completed here. So it's a mix and that's kind of what you would expect. Some things will be a little bit higher, some things will be a little bit lower but I think, in general, we're in the zone of what we have projected previously.","Operator","Next question comes from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","A couple of items, and I'll touch on them in order and then I'll be quiet. One, can you talk about the potential investment on the transmission side related to either the SONGS retirement or the retirement of the 6-plus gigawatts of gas generation capacity in California that must meet some of the cooling water regulation? That's question one. Question two, right after you announced the SONGS retirement, the commissioners put out a release basically implying their desire for an expedited resolution settlement, et cetera. Have the commissioners themselves, either in ex-partake talks or in other, done any follow-up in a similar vein related to that initial release? I think, it came out by the commissioners literally within a week or so after your retirement announcement.","William James Scilacci","Okay, let me take the first question. There is a potential for capital expenditures based on the retirement of SONGS and once-through cooling plants. We are looking at that but I think it's premature, Michael, to try to put some numbers out there. So I would feel uncomfortable should you not -- just throwing some numbers out. We've got some large transmission projects that we're working on at Coolwater-Lugo and the West of Devers projects that are primarily for renewable support. But we are looking, as part of the SONGS shutdown and how we're going to replace SONGS, what the steps might be to replace that. And it's going to be a host of different things. It's going to be energy efficiency, it's going to be DG, there could be additional transmission upgrades. So we're looking at the gamut along with a large group of folks from the ISO and the CPUC and other stakeholders, determining what's appropriate. And clearly, we're looking at it as a package, you don't look at it as -- in isolation. You have to take a look at all these things so you can plan accordingly. I'll pause there and look back to Ron before I answer the second question.","Ronald L. Litzinger","In the state agencies, the Energy Commission, PUC, they put a strong emphasis on what they call preferred resources in Orange County, which are distributed generation energy efficiency and the like that Jim had mentioned. So we have a strong focus on how do we facilitate that through distribution investment would be the primary area there. What it comes down to with the once-through cooling and the SONGS retirement is where does the replacement generation get located. If the bulk of it were to be in the Los Angeles basin, the amount of transmission upgrades would be fairly minimal. If a significant portion is located out of the basin, the transmission needs would go up. As part of the review process, there's been several potential projects thrown about but none of those have been formally incorporated into the Cal ISO planning process as of yet.","William James Scilacci","Going back to the second question, Michael. We have obviously heard the commission's comments and we've read about similar comments and various analyst reports that have been out over the last couple of months. And I'll stay, we won't go beyond just acknowledging that we've read that.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. One thing on the transmission, your neighbor in San Diego has actually put out a slide deck for the Cal ISO. They outlined 4 projects, the smallest of which was $1.6 billion or so, the largest of which was close to $4.5 billion, $5 billion. I was under the impression that SoCalEd would have to make similar type of high-level disclosures to the ISO for transmission, is that correct? And if so, when would you likely have to start putting kind of more firm estimates around potential alternatives that the ISO could evaluate?","Ronald L. Litzinger","It would be in the next ISO formal planning process which I think is about to begin shortly. I don't remember the precise date but it's coming up and we'll have to outline our potential projects as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Fremont with Jefferies.","Paul B. Fremont - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","It looks as if a level of short-term debt is -- has been accelerating, so it looks like it's about $1,350,000,000. Is that primarily due to the purchase power under recovery or what other reasons might there be for the short-term debt to be going up?","William James Scilacci","Good question, Paul. The short-term debt will ebb and flow on a variety of different reasons. Partly, the balances we were carrying before had to do with the under collections in our fuel and purchase power. However, we're also over collected in other accounts. Also, we did a large financing recently with $1.6 billion and the proceeds, some of it was to refinance some upcoming maturities and some of it was new money. So the short-term debt will ebb and flow based on the timing of financings and what we're seeing for our under collections and over collections. So you can't -- it's not all tied directly to the fuel and purchase power situation that we've got right now.","Paul B. Fremont - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","And you've estimated sort of an under collected position this year for fuel and purchase power of $1 billion yet. At the current rates that are in place, would there be sort of a similar under collected amount next year?","William James Scilacci","Well, it depends on the timing of the rate proceedings because there's 2 separate ones. There's a 2013 ERRA proceedings that would increase rates and then there's the 2014 proceeding, which would increase rates. And the timing of those would impact the ramp-up of potential short-term borrowings. But we'd expect the Commission to render decisions in this because they know the importance of getting these done in a timely basis. The hang up has been the crossover with the SONGS proceeding. So the short-term debt and the under collected balance that doesn't relate directly to short-term debt is going up about $100 million a month based on current rates. And then, you have to look at all the other factors to see what the short-term borrowing implications might be.","Operator","Next question comes from Hugh Wynne with Sanford Bernstein.","Hugh Wynne - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","My question was around AB 327. The legislation seems to create a lot of latitude for the Commission to revise the tiering structure of the rates, to revise the tariff for net energy metering. My question was what are your objectives vis-\u00e0-vis, the Commission for the rate structure, for net energy metering and why are those objectives important to the company?","William James Scilacci","Okay, Ted's going to take that one, Hugh.","Theodore F. Craver","I think in the broadest sense, the objective is to try to have a rate structure that eliminates some of the inequalities that the current rate structure has. So for instance, in the current tiering, you have higher use customers really picking up the bulk of increased infrastructure investments and other policy-related increases in costs, while the lower-use customers are largely immune from those cost pressures. As a result, we now have a good $0.20 or more separating the low-use customers from the high-use customers. And really, the bulk of the burden landing on the high-use customers. We estimate roughly speaking that about $650 million a year is being shifted from low-use customers onto the high-use customers, or said differently, the high-use customers are subsidizing the low-use customers to about $650 million a year. So that's one of the things that the AB 327 seeks to address, is providing the opportunity for the tiers to be reduced in number and the differential between the tiers also potentially reduced. Second part is, I think, equally or more important than that is increasingly, as distributed energy resources find their way into the distribution system, you have more and more of the fixed cost of the system really being avoided, and that needs to be addressed. So -- and that's one of the inequalities. We really feel that everybody that makes use of the grid, whether they are pulling electricity directly from it or whether they are using it as a backup resource or what have you, that, that's an important resource that needs to be -- the costs needs to be shared by all users. Said a little differently, the distribution system really enables the distributed energy resources, and so that's a cost that everybody should participate in. So that's what the fixed cost seeks to address. I think those are the principal issues that drew us to support the legislation. And certainly the author, Henry Perea, biggest issue he had was really this cost shifting. And a lot of that ends up impacting the lower income customers.","William James Scilacci","Just -- Hugh, to follow-on the net energy metering, there's a subsequent work that needs to be done on that. The legislation really didn't directly affect that and the Commission's doing some work now to try to determine the impact of net energy metering. And there could be some subsequent work by the Commission that follows up on that.","Theodore F. Craver","They need a new tariff by 2017, and the direction they gave for the new tariff was to look at how the benefits and costs are shared amongst all customers rather than just the distributed generation customers.","Hugh Wynne - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Right. Could I trouble you just to comment quickly on what are the mileposts that we can use to monitor the progress on the MHI arbitration, if any, and similarly, on the NEIL insurance collections?","Theodore F. Craver","Hugh, really, on the EME stuff, we're really going to stay...","William James Scilacci","MHI.","Theodore F. Craver","MHI, Excuse me. On MHI stuff, we're really going to -- thinking litigation and arbitration here, sorry about that. We're going to really stay away from trying to speculate on exactly what goes, what those time tables or milestones would be. I mean, right now, as we said in the comments, we just have issued our arbitration notice and so we've got that to get through and then we'll see where that takes us from there.","Operator","Next question comes from Ashar Khan with Visium Asset Management.","Ashar Khan","My questions have been answered.","Operator","Next question comes from Kit Konolige with BGC.","Kit Konolige - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division","Most of my questions have been answered. Just wanted to refresh my memory. I think in the past, you've talked about -- in the OII for SONGS, about Phase 3 being really the most critical of those phases. Is that -- am I remembering correctly?","William James Scilacci","You got it right, Kit.","Kit Konolige - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division","Okay, good. That's simple enough. And Jim, what -- do you have some idea when Phase 3 might be started, when there could be filings in that? Is it sequential after Phase 2 is done, then Phase 3 starts?","William James Scilacci","That's how they did Phase 2, but they've been going on, well, almost concurrently to a certain degree. So they haven't put out anything, Kit. We would expect it would occur sometime in 2014 and we'd hope they get through it by the end of 2014. So that's what we've been consistently saying, so let's see what the Commission actually does.","Operator","Next question comes from Angie Storozynski with Macquarie.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Research","So as we're approaching December, and in December, your Board of Directors usually reevaluates your dividends.

My name is Princess and I will be your operator today. Today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Sam Ramraj, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Ramraj, you may begin your conference.","Sam Ramraj - Edison International","Thank you, Princess, and welcome, everyone. Our speakers today are, President and Chief Executive Officer, Pedro Pizarro; and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Maria Rigatti. Also here are other members of the management team.","Materials supporting today's call are available at www.edisoninvestor.com. These include our Form 10-Q, prepared remarks from Pedro and Maria, and the teleconference presentation. Tomorrow, we will distribute our regular business update presentation.","During this call, we will make forward-looking statements about the outlook for Edison International and its subsidiaries. Actual results could differ materially from current expectations. Important factors that could cause different results are set forth in our SEC filings. Please read these carefully. The presentation includes certain outlook assumptions, as well as reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the nearest GAAP measure. During the question-and-answer session, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up.","I will now turn the call over to Pedro.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Well, thanks a lot, Sam, and good afternoon, everyone. Second quarter core earnings were $0.85 per share, roughly flat to the same period last year. Please remember this comparison is not particularly meaningful, because SCE has not received a decision in its 2018 General Rate Case. Maria will provide more detail in her remarks.","Today, I will touch on several policy and growth topics, but let me begin with comments on wildfires. We continue to support the communities affected by the wildfires and mudslides by ensuring customers affected by these disasters are receiving support, including bill forgiveness, extended payment arrangements and help with temporary power. We are committed to helping our customers recover and rebuild from these events.","In order to help, we have set up a dedicated web page for customers impacted by these events, are providing specially trained resources in our contact center and are assisting customers through in-person meetings at local assistance centers. A number of external agencies have been investigating the potential origins and causes of the Thomas Fire and smaller fires that were in our service territory. As we do in all wildfire matters, SCE is also conducting its own review. The investigations continue and we currently cannot predict when they will be completed.","In the meantime, Southern California Edison has spent extensive time reviewing and strengthening our wildfire mitigation and prevention efforts in preparation for the new normal. Our focus has been on five major areas. First, vegetation management. We have increased the vegetation patrols in the most severe high-risk areas and we are evaluating opportunities to perform more expansive tree trimming and tree removal. As a reminder, high fire risk areas identified in the CPUC's fire risk maps account for approximately a quarter of our service territory.","Second, hardening our system. We are increasing the use of fire-resistant poles, insulated conductor and non-expulsion fuses in select high fire risk areas. Third, operational practices. During Red Flag Warning conditions, we continue to restrict certain types of work and our standard procedure is to not automatically reenergize circuits in high fire risk areas after interruptions until lines are physically inspected. Also, we have refined our protocols for the de-energization of lines when critically necessary to prevent fires and protect public safety, and continue to discuss these with potentially impacted communities.","Fourth, partnerships. Wildfire response planning occurs with fire agencies, local emergency operation centers and community groups throughout the service territory.","Finally, we maintain a 24-hour situational awareness center and around-the-clock incident management teams when conditions merit. In certain areas, we are also installing additional weather stations to improve our awareness of local conditions and high-definition cameras to provide early warning of fires both internally and to local fire agencies.","We continue to make progress on wildfire policy issues as well. We are engaged with state leaders, including the governor's office, legislative leaders and stakeholders across the State on the solutions we believe are needed.","As we have discussed before, we are focused on four key principles, including a wildfire management plan to guide system investments and new operating protocols, which will create more transparency and clarity with regards to prudency; reform of inverse condemnation to transition from strict liability regardless of fault to a reasonableness standard; reform of the current cost recovery structure at the CPUC to incorporate the concept that liability must be proportionate to the utility's contribution to a fire; and recognition of the continued importance of financially healthy utilities to meet California's ambitious climate change policies.","We continue to be encouraged by the dialog that we and other California utilities are having with members of the legislature. This includes the amended Senate Bill 901, which has moved to a Legislative Conference Committee and can be further amended to continue the State's progress toward reaching the goals that the governor and legislative leadership set forth in March.","The goals noted five key areas, from updating liability rules and regulations for utilities, to enhancing prevention and mitigation efforts surrounding these events. While SB 901 is the focus of the Committee, other bills can be considered to address the goals as well.","As of early July, a number of wildfire bills passed legislative Committees. At this stage in the legislative process, the individual bills matter less than the substance and we are fully engaged with the legislature on these issues with a goal of achieving reforms that provide more transparency and additional efforts to mitigate catastrophic events and mechanisms that fairly allocate responsibility among the multiple causes, which contribute to wildfires.","It is important to note that we do believe utilities should still be held responsible in proportion to our actions, if there was serious misconduct. I want to reiterate from last quarter that implementation of solutions through a legislative process will take time, and bill language can change during that process either through existing bills or through new legislative vehicles as they come up. We are hopeful a solution can be achieved this legislative session, but there are no guarantees.","On the judicial pathway, the Round Fire hearing associated with the motion for legal determination of inverse condemnation has been removed from the calendar and will not be rescheduled, because the plaintiffs' claims have been resolved through a settlement. Additionally, we are aware of the many lawsuits filed related to the Thomas Fire and Montecito mudslides naming SCE and, in some cases, EIX as a defendant. The cases have been coordinated in the LA Superior Court.","The litigation process, which is in preliminary stages, will likely take a number of years to be resolved because of the complexity of the matters and the time needed to complete the ongoing investigations and analysis. The Thomas Fire and Montecito mudslides litigation presents an additional opportunity to challenge inverse condemnation.","On the regulatory pathway, I want to briefly mention the recent denial of the Applications for Rehearing in San Diego Gas & Electric's Wildfire Expense Memorandum Account, or WEMA proceeding. While this doesn't have a significant effect on our current position in any of the three pathways, it does increase our sense of urgency to get legislation passed to reform cost recovery mechanisms. Conversely, we were supportive of the decision by the Commission to approve the alternate proposed decision in the PG&E WEMA which approved the Wildfire Memorandum Account as of the date of filing.","Building on this decision, we received a scoping memo for the SCE WEMA application in mid-July, which stated that evidentiary hearings are not needed, and a proposed decision would be issued within 90 days of the date of the ruling. In the meantime, SCE continues to support California's ambitious environmental policies. Multiple paths exist for California to meet its 2030 and ultimately 2050 climate goals with varying levels of difficulty and costs. However, all feasible paths must significantly reduce emissions from the transportation sector.","As a reminder, last fall, SCE explored several of these scenarios to better understand feasibility, costs, and trajectory to reach California's goals. We found the most feasible pathway to reach the state's 2030 goals to be an electric grid supplied by 80% carbon-free energy made reliable by up to 10 gigawatts of energy storage, which will support more than 7 million electric vehicles in California roads and nearly one-third of space and water heaters powered by electricity. I will highlight several regulatory proceedings that begin to enable some of this transition, specifically related to electric vehicles.","At the end of May, the Commission issued a final decision on our January 2017 Transportation Electrification filing. The decision approved a five-year $356 million program, of which $242 million is capital spend supporting funding for medium and heavy-duty vehicle charging infrastructure.","For light-duty electric vehicle charging infrastructure, we filed our Charge Ready Phase 2 application at the end of June, which requests $760 million of total costs, including approximately $560 million in capital spend for infrastructure to support 48,000 new EV charging ports and increased marketing, education and outreach.","The application continues the implementation of our Transportation Electrification pathway and expands on the Light-Duty Infrastructure Pilot that was launched in late May 2016. These programs as well as earlier actions taken by the CPUC and other agencies continue to demonstrate California is at the forefront of electrification efforts by investing more than any other state in this area.","Moving to our 2018 General Rate Case, we are looking forward to a proposed decision from the administrative law judges following the recent oral arguments. We cannot speculate on the timing for a proposed decision and subsequent commission decision but we do remain optimistic about getting a final decision before year-end.","Regarding SONGS, just a few hours ago, the Commission adopted the proposed decision from the ALJ, which generally adopts the settlement as drafted except for the disapproval of a provision providing $12.5 million of greenhouse gas reduction research funding. The settling parties now have to convene and determine if the group or a significant subset of them will accept the changes. A notice must be filed with the Commission within 10 days of the decision. We look forward to achieving a final resolution of the SONGS cost recovery matter.","While we are focused on resolving wildfire-related issues, we continue to push forward on key regulatory proceedings that we believe are necessary to meet California's 2030 climate goals. This will require strong, financially healthy utilities, so we remain optimistic that a durable solution to the wildfire issues will be achieved.","As we work towards, that our company will also remain focused on improving our safety culture and broader operational excellence and on delivering strong solutions to be a key enabler of our state's long-term policy vision.","With that, I'll turn it over to Maria for her financial report.","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","Thank you, Pedro. Good afternoon, everyone. My comments today will cover our second quarter 2018 results compared to the same period a year ago, and other financial updates for EIX and SCE. As we have communicated to you before, until we receive a decision on the 2018 General Rate Case, we will continue to recognize revenues from CPUC activities, largely based on 2017 authorized base revenue requirements, with the reserve taken for known items including the cost of capital decision and tax reform.","Also consistent with last quarter, we are providing our SCE key drivers analysis at the prior combined statutory tax rate of approximately 41% for both 2018 and 2017 for comparability purposes. Therefore, the effective tax reform will largely be isolated so we can focus on the underlying financial and operational drivers and business. Let's begin with a look at our core earnings driver. Please turn to page 2.","For the second quarter 2018, Edison International reporting core earnings of $0.85 per share, roughly flat to the same period last year. From the table on the right-hand side, you will see that SCE had a negative $0.03 EPS variance year-over-year. SCE revenue increased $0.07 over prior year. CPUC revenues were up $0.05 mainly due to the absence of a refund to customers booked in 2017 as well as balancing account activity, which is partially offset by our cost of capital reserve.","Additionally, FERC contributed $0.02 of higher revenue as a result of higher expenses. Our core EPS in the second quarter was negatively impacted by $0.10 of higher total expenses year-over-year. The largest driver was an $0.08 impact from higher operation and maintenance costs, primarily related to higher wildfire insurance premium. The $0.08 include the quarterly impact of the $121 million premium we discussed last quarter, as well as additional insurance associated with obtaining new policies to fill out our coverage.","We have requested approval from the CPUC for regulatory mechanism to track and recover wildfire insurance premiums in excess of the amounts that are ultimately approved in our 2018 GRC decision. We are currently evaluating the regulatory accounting for incremental wildfire insurance cost.","As a first step, based on the outcome of the PG&E WEMA, we expect that we will be allowed to track our own incremental wildfire cost, including wildfire insurance premiums beginning at our April 3 application date, and these will ultimately be subject to a reasonableness review. Based on the information presently available, we expect to defer $0.30 per share of wildfire insurance costs during the third and fourth quarter. The incremental wildfire insurance costs for the full year of 2018 are expected to be $0.38 per share before considering the regulatory deferral. I will give a further update on the insurance market in a minute.","Moving to net financing costs, we saw a $0.04 increase over the same period last year, mainly related to higher interest expense, primarily related to higher debt balances to fund rate base growth. The key EPS drivers table for SCE on the right-hand side of slide shows other smaller contributing items.","For the quarter, EIX Parent and Other had positive $0.03 per share core earnings variance mainly due to the absence of the SoCore Energy goodwill impairment taken in the second quarter of 2017. EIX Parent had a negative impact of $0.01, as lower corporate expenses were offset by the absence of an IRS tax settlement achieved in 2017.","Please turn to page 3. I don't plan to review the year-to-date financial results in detail, but the earnings analysis is consistent with the second quarter results. As I've said previously, comparisons pending a 2018 GRC decision are not meaningful. We expect to record a true-up in the quarter we receive a proposed decision.","I will next speak to our capital expenditure and rate base forecasts on pages 4 and 5.","Our SCE capital expenditures and rate base forecast have remained unchanged from last quarter. As a reminder, while 2019 and 2020 CPUC jurisdictional capital expenditures remain at the GRC request level, our 2018 capital expenditures align with our work execution plan for this year.","There are two items to note related to our capital spending plan and we have provided information on the slide to outline the impacts of some recent regulatory activity. In the quarter, we received a final decision approving a $356 million medium- and heavy-duty transportation electrification program, as Pedro noted. Given the expected timing and size of the capital program, we expect cumulative capital spending to increase approximately $115 million by the end of 2020 and the associated rate base would increase $78 million.","At the same time, we are awaiting a Commission vote on the proposed decision and alternate proposed decision on the Alberhill System Project. Both these decisions deny the Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity based on the conclusion of the ALJ and the assigned Commissioner that the project is not needed.","We continue to believe the project is needed to serve forecasted local area demand and to increase reliability and operating flexibility and have filed comments on the proposed and alternate proposed decision.","If the project is ultimately cancelled, SCE's cumulative capital spending through 2020 will be reduced by approximately $85 million and the associated rate base will decrease $100 million in 2020. The rate base reduction includes amounts that SCE has already incurred and may not be recoverable as the project is cancelled.","Depending on the outcome of the Alberhill proceeding, these two decisions could largely offset each other during our forecast period. We expect to update our full forecast when we get a final decision on the 2018 GRC.","On page 6, you will see our financial assumptions for 2018. We have laid out a few key items on the page that you should consider as you model 2018 and beyond. Most of the information on this page has remained unchanged since last quarter. As a reminder, the information we provide on this slide reflects our new combined statutory tax rate of approximately 28%.","Further, we will provide 2018 earnings guidance only after we receive a final decision on the General Rate Case.","I would like to take a moment to update you on our insurance coverage. During the second quarter, our team continued to build our insurance tower for the upcoming policy period, which is generally June to June. We now have approximately $1 billion of wildfire-specific insurance coverage for the period June 1, 2018 through December 30, 2018; and approximately $940 billion for the period December 31, 2018 through May 31, 2019. SCE may obtain additional wildfire insurance for these periods in the future.","This coverage includes the $300 million policy we purchased at the end of last year, which will remain in place through December 2018, as well as the new policy placements that extends to June 2019. As we work to address our insurance needs, we continue to see a tightening market in terms of both availability and price and the cost is significantly higher than we requested in our General Rate Case.","SCE forecasted expenses of $92 million for liability insurance in its test year 2018, of which approximately 80% is related to wildfire insurance. Overall for 2018, premiums are approximately $237 million.","I want to provide a few additional comments on other financial topics. At SCE, our average common equity component of total capitalization was 49.5% as of June 30, including the charge from the revised SONGS settlement. Based on the adoption by the CPUC or the proposed decision earlier today and subject to the adoptions by settling parties or a significant subset of them, the revised settlement allows SCE to exclude the $448 million after tax charge from its equity capitalization ratio, which would bring our ratio to 49.9%. We continue to maintain a strong balance sheet at both the holding company and SCE as we work through the uncertainty around the wildfires cost recovery concern and a way to 2018 General Rate Case decision.","During the quarter, we increased our credit facilities at EIX and SCE to provide additional liquidity to meet our ongoing funding needs. Total facility size is now $4.5 billion and availability at quarter end was $4.1 billion net of commercial paper borrowing and letters of credit postings at SCE.","We also effectively accessed the capital markets for $650 million during the quarter to fund our rate base growth and free up operational liquidity during this period of managing through the legislative, legal, and regulatory solutions required to address the California wildfire issue, although spreads are higher than we have experienced prior to 2017 wildfires.","That concludes my remarks and I'll turn it back over to Sam.","Sam Ramraj - Edison International","Operator, please open the call for questions. As a reminder, we request you to limit yourself to one question and one follow-up so everyone in line has the opportunity to ask questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question is coming from Ali Agha from SunTrust. Ali, your line is now open.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you. Good afternoon.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Hey, Ali.","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","Hi, Ali.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","First question to Pedro. I was curious if \u2013 as you've gone through and your team has gone through the proposal that the governor put out to the Committee, what is EIX's views on that, and do you think that would address the issues as you laid them out?","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Yeah. Ali, thanks for the question, and I think I would sum up our reaction, is, it's early days. We appreciate that there are discussions going on and that the governor's office put in a proposal, but we really view this as the beginning of there will be a very active discussion in Sacramento and particularly within the Conference Committee that's been established. The proposal addresses a number of key areas, there's probably additional things that I'm sure the Committee will work on.","So, while it's a short time period between now and August 28, it's also a long time period in terms of the \u2013 I think the nature and extent of discussions that we would expect to take place through the end of the session.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. And my second question, Pedro, in your prepared remarks, you mentioned a number of investigations that are ongoing about the fire and the causes et cetera, including an internal one by SCE itself. And I just wanted to find out, as you've done your own internal investigation, have you found information that contradicts the statement you gave us back in December when you did a very preliminary investigation when the fire started, or is that statement still valid based on updated investigation by SCE?","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Ali, I think you're referring \u2013 and let me just confirm this. I think very early on, there was an initial location of origin that CAL FIRE had published and we had said that we were not aware of utility equipment near that area, and I think that was factual.","As the fire grew, as we learned more, I think that became a much more complex fire. And so, while I think that statement stood on its own for that specific pinpoint that had been drawn by CAL FIRE initially, we are now looking at the totality of the fire. We, I think, said in our disclosures that we're aware there's more than one apparent point of origin. And so it's something that we continue to investigate. We know CAL FIRE and other agencies are investigating. And so we're not able to really comment on what may come out of the various investigations until those are concluded.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith. Julien, your line is now open.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Hi, Julien.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, good afternoon. Can you hear me?","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Yeah. Really well.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Excellent. Great. So I wanted to come back to this deferral piece of the equation and the WEMA and your expectation. So again, maybe just do the implied math here, so there's a $0.38 minus the $0.30 you expect to defer. There's about an $0.08 impact in 2018, if I'm hearing you correctly. How are you thinking about that carrying forward and annualizing into 2019 with any drag? And what I'm trying to get at there, if I can elaborate is, is there any incremental insurance that you anticipate that you'll be pursuing and would any of that not necessarily be covered under the WEMA, as best you initially interpret it, shall we say?","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","Hey, Julien. It's Maria. So let's think about \u2013 so we'll walk you through maybe the thought process we have around this. So as I mentioned earlier, the request that we made for our 2018 GRC in the year 2018 was about $92 million total liability insurance. About 80% approximately of that that is wildfire-related.","So the thought process we go through is we'll have a rate (27:18) asset and we'll defer the incremental costs based on an assessment of probability of recovery. So now we looked at two things. First, when can we \u2013 at what point in time can we really establish that we have a regulatory mechanism that will allow for that recovery. And we do have a number of those proceedings ongoing right now, both the Z-Factor as well as the WEMA case. And based on some of the recent decisions, we are thinking that we won't get a memo account based on what we know today, and that we do think that once that's established the costs that are tracked in that memo account would be probable of recovery.","Then we have to figure out what's incremental, because those memo accounts are really only for incremental costs. So, as I mentioned before, the $92 million, 80% of that is wildfire-related. We have a 2018, so calendar year expense for wildfire insurance of $237 million.","So, we looked at that and we looked at the incremental costs associated between those two numbers, as well as the timing of our application for the WEMA, and that's how we came up with the $0.38 of incremental cost, $0.30 of which is recoverable. And as we roll forward into next year, now we've only kind of covered in terms of 2019, June to June, we're only partway through covering 2019 at this point.","We're going to look at, obviously at some point, covering the rest of 2019, and SCE could actually look at incremental insurance even above what we currently have for the period in 2018. So \u2013 and as we do that and think about what else might be subject to the WEMA or tracking the WEMA, we would say that anything is incremental to what we've asked for in the GRC, and that falls into this period, post the application for sure, would be part of that WEMA account that we will then be tracking.","And that's not to say we will continue to pursue the Z-Factor mechanism that we filed last year and see if there's any other additional recovery that we could kind of be entitled to. So, that was our thought process.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Excellent. So \u2013 but \u2013 maybe to put you a little bit on the spot, it seems as if it's your expectation that you would expect to continue to raise the total amount of insurance that you have, right? We should expect that to come at some point here?","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","We're going to continue to look at it.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay.","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","I can't say right now in part because the market is very tight and things are very expensive to what extent we will obtain additional insurance. We'll look at every avenue. There is insurance, there's reinsurance, there's some other capital markets approaches that one could use. We'll look \u2013 we'll be evaluating all of that. I think a lot of it is determined by what's really available in the market as well.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Right. All right. I'll leave it there. Thank you very much.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Thanks, Julien.","Sam Ramraj - Edison International","Operator?","Operator","Our next question comes from Praful Mehta from Citigroup. Your line is now open.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Hi, Praful.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks so much. Hi, guys. So, Pedro, just following up on your prepared remarks. You had color there saying legislation can take time. And so, you're qualifying a little bit, or I guess balancing expectations around timing of legislation getting done. But we do know that it's critical to try and get this done especially for your neighbors to get it done this year if possible.","So I'm just trying to understand how are you thinking about the timing and what are the pushes and pulls in your mind that could end up causing a problem on timing?","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Yeah, that's a good question, Praful. Probably useful to just step back for a second and repeat a theme that I think was in my remark, and in frankly prior earnings call remarks. We think about this as a broad economy-wide problem needing an integrated solution across the really broad buckets of preventing and mitigating fires across the state with all the field we have and dead trees, about so much of our state's lands, hardening the state's infrastructure including utilities, and that includes how we think differently about our operations and then dealing with the financial consequences, the allocation of the risk.","There are a lot of elements inside of that, including the reform of inverse condemnation, thinking about moving to from a strict liability standard to a standard of reasonableness, ultimately ensuring that utility is absolutely are on the hook, to the extent that they have in pro forma as they should, but that they are liable to an extent proportional to their actions, right?","There are other pieces that the state will need to address around \u2013 in wildfire mitigation and prevention, wildfire management plans, how the PUC then looks at the prudency or utilities around those plans, a lot of pieces there.","If you look at some of the discussions, for example, yesterday in the hearing that the Conference Committee had or the discussions we would expect the Conference Committee to have over the weeks ahead between now and the end of August. They may be talking about \u2013 most or all of those areas ideally, we would like to see the state develop a final piece of legislation that has the package that addresses all of these pieces that are needed. We think that's feasible. However, we also recognize, it's challenging. And there are a lot of pieces and a lot of fact-gathering and thinking and drafting of language and debate I'm sure that will happen inside the confines of the Conference Committee.","And so, all along, we've just started to be realistic with our investors about, fact that, while it's seasonable and how we're all working very hard and I'll just ask that our coalition and \u2013 a lot of us that are stakeholders across the state, they may or may not be, that all of these pieces get done in this legislative session. We hope they are, but they may not. And so, hard to handicap at this point what pieces \u2013 what the success will be, maybe it's all if it. Maybe it's most of it. It's certainly possible there can be pieces that get handled outside the Conference Committee in parallel legislation with a broader senate assembly. It's certainly possible there are things that go beyond this scheduled legislative session.","So, I always try to do is acknowledge that possibility, Praful without trying to handicap or point to, gee, we think this element, there is a 90% probability and that other one has a 60% probability.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","That is super helpful color, Pedro. Thank you for that. Just a quick follow-up on this AB 33 securitization. It clearly seems like a constructive way to meet any funding needs. But it was \u2013 looks like it was PG&E only at this point. Is that something that you would look to replicate if it were to go through, so it would apply to EIX as well?","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Well, I think you're correct that the AB 33 is written \u2013 it's focused on PG&E. it clearly \u2013 we still don't know to what extent we may have liability for the 2017 events. I think I would just step back and say more broadly to the extent that there are events whether it's 2017, as it's the context of AB 33 or whether it was in terms of the framework for moving forward.","To the extent that there are events where customers end up having to bear part of the costs for one interesting feature of AB 33 is the ability to basically securitize and amortize that exposure over a longer time period. And so that in and of itself is an interesting tool that could be beneficial to customers to the extent that we all encounter new wildfires in the future as part of this new normal.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great. Thanks so much, guys.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Welcome.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Stephen Byrd from Morgan Stanley. Stephen, your line is now open.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Hey, Stephen.","Stephen C. Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi, good afternoon. I wanted to just follow-up on insurance. I know you've given a lot of color around insurance but I wondered if you might be able to speak just to tell where you see that market going over time obviously the cost has been rising quite a bit.","I'm curious if what sort of feedback you get from the insurance community in terms of just not only where the price is now, but future availability trends in terms of the nature of the product or anything else just so we can try to extrapolate over time where that market's going and sort of how to think about the level you received? And also to the extent possible, any feedback from the CPUC in terms of sort of the amount of cost that is palatable given just how high these costs are going?","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","Sure. So, Stephen, I think one of the elements required in order to answer your question is sort of just how does the current work around reforming inverse and strict liability versus a reasonable standard, how does that all turn out. Because if it continues to be the case that the utilities are going to be what I'll say the insurance of last resort, or these incidents then people that we buy insurance from are going to be exposed to a fair amount of risk, and I don't think you would see necessarily a moderating of the insurance premium from that perspective.","Obviously, as wildfires continue to be more prevalent and to increase in intensity, the size of the losses could also grow and so people will be taking that into consideration.","To the extent that there are new tools that can be implemented that help to mitigate that risk, I think insurance companies will take all of that into consideration. But I don't think that a moderation of premiums is necessarily in the card until we have a lot of, I'll say, fixes on all those fronts.","In terms of your second question on CPUC reaction, what they have seen thus far from us, is the filing we made at the end of last year where they could see $120 million premium for $300 million of coverage. They're considering our application there, the advice letter that we filed there. We've gotten some questions and back-and-forth. But I think they are seeing that and they also can see the incredible increase in cost for the customer. And that really is, at the end of the day, something that gets recovered in rates typically and so it's something that goes right to the bottom line for our customers.","And just to put it in perspective, we had saved quite a bit of O&M expense in this rate case versus our prior rate case, we passed it through to our customers, it was about $85 million and in one fell swoop, that $120 million premium last year wiped it out.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Maria, I would just add one more little bit of color for the first part of the question. We keep talking about the new normal, and we experience here events that I don't think we have really experienced not only as the utility, but as a state, and the same is true for the insurance companies.","One little bit of color there are folks who interact with the insurance companies, color they've received is that the insurance companies are having to basically rework their models because the fundamental assumptions, the way that the models are wired, they're realizing needs change. And when you see events like during the Thomas Fire, the fact that that was in December and on the coast around Santa Barbara, Ventura, we were experiencing humidity levels of 1% to 3% on a December day, that's not something that a lot of us who have lived in the state for a long time have seen before. And so, it's a radical change in the underlying assumptions that's driving then questions, I think, for the insurance companies about their models and just adds uncertainty and therefore adds to pricing.","Stephen C. Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","That's very helpful. Thank you very much.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Thanks, Stephen.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Angie Storozynski from Macquarie. Angie, your line is now open.","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","Hi, Angie.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Hi, Angie.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","How are you? Well, I have to ask a question about fires, because that's almost required. So how about \u2013 I mean, what if the legislative session ends and nothing happens? Can the governor issue any type of a, I don't know, directive that would help you carry you guys through the next fire season, if there is even such a thing as a fire season at this point?","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Yeah. Angie, that's a tough one to answer. I think we're, to be honest with you, very focused on the next several weeks, getting us to the end of August end of the (40:37) legislative session. As I said earlier, we think it's feasible, very feasible to have progress here, and we're certainly hopeful of that. If that doesn't work out, then I don't want to speculate on what some of the options might be for the government at that point.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. And an unrelated question, so about just your ongoing operations. What is going on as far as any types of adjustments to the costs that those CCA or communities that are trying to self-procure electricity needs to pay for the costs that you have incurred to procured renewables? I mean, it seems like there's more and more of those CCAs happening, and I mean, I'm wondering if the reason why they are multiplying is because there's some inefficiency in the costs that they need to incur. And so, I know that you guys have been trying to make changes to that cost that the CCAs would have to pay. And my question is if that would be retroactive to all of those communities that are, in a way, starting to self-procure and how that would actually impact the municipalities that are still staying on your system. Thanks.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","That's a great question, Angie, and it has \u2013 doesn't have anything to do with wildfires, so for variety. So on CCA, we are seeing a growing number of cities and communities that are looking at the potential for Community Choice Aggregation. Just as a reminder, from an investor perspective, we should be neutral to that because this is covering the commodity procurement part of the business. That's a cost pass-through activity for us, so it doesn't have a direct impact on the potential earnings power for the company. However, there is an issue that we've been addressing and through the PUC process and it's really an issue of fairness of allocation of costs between customers.","The concern has been that the, what's called the PCIA, the Procurement Cost (sic) [Power Charge] Indifference Adjustment, which is essentially the exit fee that a community choice aggregator or the customers of a CCA have to pay in order to make the remaining bundled customers whole for the cost we've taken on for long-term procurement contracts, for renewables or for other resources, we said at the PUC that we have a concern that that current fee has been not sufficiently compensatory and needs reform. The three utilities filed a joint proposal with the PUC in a PUC docket that's open right now, and we're expecting a proposed decision, I believe, sometime throughout this summer.","In parallel with that, we've seen some constructive actions at the PUC, including, for example, I think around a couple of months ago, the PUC ensuring that CCAs have the same requirements for resource adequacy demonstrations, the year-ahead resource adequacy demonstration that utilities have. Again, that's part of ensuring that there's fair cost allocation across all customers. So some really constructive steps, but waiting to get the decision on the proposals for reforming the PCIA.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Thanks for the question, Angie.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Jonathan Arnold from Deutsche Bank. Jonathan, your line is now open.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. Good afternoon, guys.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Hi.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","I just wanted to double-check on the \u2013 as we think about the way you're treating this incremental insurance cost. Are you assuming that all of the incremental cost is effectively recoverable in the math you walked us through, Maria? Do we adjust out the 20% that is not to do with wildfires, potentially, or is it just the timing, like the April date that drives the number (45:04)?","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","So I think, Jonathan, how you should think about it is, this is wildfire-related.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah.","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","So other insurance, we hope to play it in the normal course, so it's not \u2013 that's not the same situation. And what we think is, we have $0.38 cents of incremental wildfire-related cost vis-\u00e0-vis what we requested in our GRC.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay.","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","In the third and fourth quarter, we'll be deferring, based on what we know today, obviously, we'll continue with that, but based on what we know today, we'll be deferring $0.30.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And the difference between $0.38 and $0.30 is the sort of three and a bit months.","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","Yeah. It would be incremental cost above what we requested that we don't think are recoverable because of timing of various mechanisms, et cetera, and that would be flowing through.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. But aside from the April date and the fact that that wipes out the early parts of the year, your assumption is any incremental wildfire insurance costs you're incurring should be recoverable through the WEMA and you're deferring it for that reason.","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","That's correct. And we'll \u2013 as I said, we'll make an assessment every quarter, but that's our current thinking, yeah.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. That was kind of my question. And then, maybe my follow-up, I may have just missed this, but was there some mention, Pedro, of a possibility? Is there a precedent where the governor could possibly call a special session, or how could that happen if maybe August 28th turns out to not be long enough?","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","So as you can imagine, we're focused on this session and hopeful and working hard to make \u2013 hopefully, legislature will make a good progress there. I don't think there's been a lot of talk around other mechanisms, given the focus on the Conference Committee process and the proposal that the governor put in. In theory, special sessions can be called after the regular session of the legislature. But again, our focus right now is on supporting the current Conference Committee effort.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Thanks, Jonathan.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Lasan Johong from Auvila Research Consulting. Lasan, your line is now open.","Lasan A. Johong - Auvila Research Consulting LLC","Yes. Thank you. Instead of asking a follow-up, I'm just going to ask two questions. First of all, probably, there's a heat wave going on in California \u2013 Southern California right now. I'm just wondering how the grid is performing, A, and related to that, if the renewables are doing what they're supposed to do, or it's being strained.","And second question is, how is the CPUC, the utilities and interveners thinking about undergrounding cables at high risk wildfire areas? It seems to me that's the proper (47:47) long-term solution. Thank you.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Well, on the first question around the heat wave, I think the broad answer is that the system has been managing that reasonably well. But let me turn it to Ron Nichols, President of SCE.","Ronald Owen Nichols - Southern California Edison Co.","Our system is holding up well. In fact, our teams have been reporting on that regularly. We're obviously putting a lot more people out in the field to make sure we're able to respond to it, but our grid is holding up well, the resources are there. We're just encountering some pricing issues as we look at the market, but supplies have been there. We haven't had any reliability concerns today.","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","And on the second question on the CPUC, undergrounding, I think that is a topic that has been coming up a lot, particularly in discussions around grid resiliency and the like. The Commission has \u2013 we've identified it obviously as an alternative, but it's very expensive. The Commission is looking at, is comparing that to other alternatives, for example, insulated conductors as opposed to undergrounding. So, it's really something that's still being assessed by the Commission, and frankly, by the utilities as well.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Right. As you can imagine, we have a large effort, and I think that's part of what I mentioned under the broad umbrella of the operational considerations that we are looking at right now to look at alternatives for how we help address the risk in those areas.","Lasan A. Johong - Auvila Research Consulting LLC","But insulating a cable doesn't prevent it from being cut by a falling tree?","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","Yes, because they'd still be above ground, so they could still be damaged by things that are going around and the like, but they do provide an additional layer of security and prevention because of the insulation.","Lasan A. Johong - Auvila Research Consulting LLC","Understood. Thank you.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. And that was the last question. I will now turn the call back to Mr. Sam Ramraj.","Sam Ramraj - Edison International","Thank you for joining us today and please call us if you have any follow-up questions.

[Operator Instructions] And I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Scott Cunningham, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Cunningham, you may begin your conference.","Scott Cunningham","Thanks so much and good afternoon, everyone. Our principal speakers today will be Chairman and CEO, Ted Craver; and Chief Financial Officer, Jim Scilacci. Also with us are other members of the management team.","The presentation that accompanies Jim's comments, the earnings press release and our SEC filings are available on our website at www.edisoninvestor.com. We will be using these and other slides in our regular quarterly business update presentation that will be issued next week for our ongoing investor discussion.","During this call, we will make forward-looking statements about the financial outlook for Edison International and its subsidiaries, and about other future events. Actual results could differ materially from current expectations. Important factors that could cause different results are set forth in our SEC filings. We urge you to read these carefully.","The presentation includes certain outlook assumptions as well as reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the nearest GAAP measure. When we get to Q&A, please limit yourself to 1 question and 1 follow-up. If you have further questions, please return to the queue.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Ted Craver.","Theodore F. Craver","Thank you, Scott, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, Edison International reported third quarter GAAP earnings of $0.58 per share compared with $1.31 per share 1 year ago. Core earnings were $0.72 per share compared with $1.26 per share 1 year ago.","The decrease in earnings was primarily due to 3 factors: Losses at Edison Mission Group, delay in the California Public Utilities Commission final decision on SCE's 2012 General Rate Case, and an increase in holding company costs due to state tax adjustments.","Jim Scilacci will provide additional details on the quarter in his remarks.","There are 3 main areas on which I will focus my comments this afternoon: Our restructuring efforts at Edison Mission Energy, the recently received Proposed Decision on SCE's 2012 General Rate Case and an update on the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station, or SONGS, as we call it.","Let me start with Edison Mission Energy. In past earnings calls, I have explained Edison International's overall strategy. We believe the most effective way to participate in the growth opportunities arising from the substantial changes occurring in the electric power industry is through a dual platform of regulated and competitive businesses.","However, we are acutely aware that the competitive generation sector has been deeply challenged for some time by cyclically low margins and capacity values. For the last few years, EME has focused on developing innovative approaches to environmental compliance and careful capital stewardship, principally as a means to buy time for a recovery in power markets and energy margins, and stabilize the company.","But despite great efforts and many successes by EME, the adverse power market trends have only deepened and EME's operating losses this year have increased significantly and are expected to continue. At the same time, EME has a capital structure and financial leverage, created in better times, that is no longer workable under current and foreseeable conditions.","Under current projections, EME will not be able to repay the June 2013 bond maturity of $500 million. There is also no assurance that EME will pay the $97 million of interest due on its bonds on November 15 or within the 30-day grace period that follows. Failure to pay interest on the bonds will likely result in EME filing for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code.","A bankruptcy filing by EME this year would result in its being deconsolidated from Edison International. This means that the assets and liabilities of EME would be removed from Edison International's consolidated balance sheet upon a bankruptcy filing. The earnings of EME would be included in Edison International's earnings up to the time of a bankruptcy filing, together with any charges related to deconsolidation.","After a bankruptcy filing, the results of EME would no longer be included as part of Edison International's earnings, and our results will largely be the earnings of Southern California Edison less our holding company costs.","As we discussed on our last call, EME entered into nondisclosure agreements in June with the advisors to holders of the majority of its unsecured bonds. Discussions with the advisors have been ongoing. As disclosed in our 10-Q filed today, certain of the advisors' clients executed nondisclosure agreements last month to facilitate further discussions.","We remain in discussions and under nondisclosure agreements, and therefore, Jim and I will not be able to comment further during the Q&A session in this call or in subsequent discussions with investors until a public filing about the discussions occurs. I recognize this may be frustrating to some of you, but we appreciate your understanding in this regard.","Let me now turn to Southern California Edison. Rate based growth at SCE, spurred by needed investment and California public policy mandates, has been the cornerstone of our stock's investment thesis for some time.","SCE received its long-awaited proposed decision for its 2012 General Rate Case on October 19.  The Proposed Decision provides a level of base revenue through 2014. As is normal procedure, SCE intends to file comments with the commission on November 18 (sic) [November 8] that identify various technical and other procedural items in the proposed decision that need correction. Oral arguments are scheduled for November 16, and a final decision could come at either the November 29 or the December 20 meetings.","The Proposed Decision does significantly reduce SCE's requested operations and maintenance expense, overhead expenses and rate base in order to moderate customer rates. Although challenging, we expect SCE will manage its costs over the rate case period, consistent with the final authorized revenue requirement, such that it can earn its allowed return on common equity.","Moreover, during the 2012 to 2014 rate case period, capital spending continues to support infrastructure investment and results in rate base within our previously disclosed forecast range.","Turning to our San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station, SCE has filed plans with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to restart Unit 2 at 70% load for an initial 5-month period.  Unit 2 did not experience anything near the level of tube-to-tube wear found in Unit 3, even though it operated twice as long as Unit 3, and consequently, is in a condition that it can be restarted earlier.","A team of outside experts has confirmed that operating at reduced power will eliminate the physical conditions that caused fluid elastic instability, which is the phenomenon that caused the unusual tube-to-tube wear and tube failure in Unit 3.","The shorter 5-month operating period we are proposing is designed to provide an additional margin of safety. The NRC has made clear that they will not commit to any schedule for a return-to-service decision.","Concurrently with their review, SCE continues to work with its outside experts and the steam generator designer and manufacturer, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, on what it will take to restore both units to full load.  It's not clear at this time if the units can be repaired, and it appears complete replacement of the steam generators would take some years.","We continue to place the highest priority on safety before a restart of any unit at SONGS. And we will remain diligent in recovering costs incurred from the outage from warranties and insurance.","A comprehensive review of the outage at San Onofre by the California Public Utilities Commission will take place under the Order Instituting Investigation adopted on October 25. This will consolidate all proceedings and consider appropriate cost recovery for applicable SONGS costs after January 1, 2012, including steam generator project as well as the market power costs, capital and O&M costs, and seismic study costs.","SCE will file a response to the order by November 26 and testimony by December 10, detailing costs subject to refund pursuant to the provisions of Public Utilities Code 455.5.","I would like to note that the EdisonConnect smart meter program is nearing completion. The program remains on schedule for completion this year and is on target at its authorized capital cost of $1.25 billion. Close to all of the planned 5 million meters have been installed as of September 30.","SCE is rolling out new products and services to its customers, providing monthly budgeting tools and incentives for managing electric use, which will be increasingly helpful when tight supply and demand conditions return next summer as a result of reduced output from San Onofre.","The other key regulatory decision coming up at the California Public Utilities Commission in December is the first phase of the cost of capital decision. This first phase includes SCE's allowed return on equity for 2013.","The proceeding remains on schedule for a proposed decision on November 19 and a final decision on December 20. The second phase of the proceeding, which would address terms of any trigger mechanism, is scheduled to conclude in April of next year.","SCE continues to make its case for a proposed 11.1% rate of return, a 40-basis-point reduction from the current 11.5%. As the General Rate Case Proposed Decision acknowledges, California wants strong public safety, and infrastructure and policy-related investments from its utilities.  We expect the commission will similarly consider California policy-specific facts that have traditionally resulted in an above-average, national-average rate of return.","I would like to finish by reiterating what I mentioned on our last call regarding dividend policy. As we gain clarity on the cash flow outlook for Southern California Edison with the final General Rate Case and cost of capital decisions, we will be in a better position to, over time, move back toward our target payout ratio of 45% to 55% of utility earnings.","This will, of course, depend on successful execution of our capital spending program and earning our allowed return. I believe the resolution of several strategic uncertainties, combined with a strong rate base and dividend growth potential make Edison International an increasingly attractive company to investors.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Jim Scilacci to provide his financial comments.","W. James Scilacci","Thanks, Ted, and good afternoon, everyone. Please turn your attention to the teleconference deck, and we're going to step through the various pages.","Page 2 of the presentation summarizes the quarterly earnings comparison that Ted has already touched on. The quarter has a number of moving parts and is complicated by the absence of SCE's General Rate Case decision and a couple of tax items that I will walk through.","Please note that the non-core items in the quarter relate to 2 things: First is the presentation of Homer City, which is now recorded in discontinued operations in both periods; second is a gain at Edison Capital, which is part of Edison Mission Group, related to the third quarter sale of its remaining lease interest in the Beaver Valley nuclear station.","Before I talk about the business results, holding company costs in the third quarter included a $0.09 per share impact from the changes in state tax calculations. The majority of this impact relates to a change in our consolidated state tax apportionment factor going forward, as we expect lower sales outside California from declining revenues from Homer City and Midwest Generation facilities.","The balance of the change reflects an increase in income apportioned to California from prior periods due to a recent court case. Even though these items are from prior periods, we have included them in core earnings, because changes in estimates are part of managing our ongoing tax positions.","SCE's third quarter core earnings were $1.11 per share, $0.14 below last year. The decline largely relates to the delay in the General Rate Case decision and SONGS outage-related costs.","As we have said on prior calls that SCE's 2011 revenues -- authorized revenues, does not cover certain costs, mainly higher depreciation and financing costs. These total $0.09 per share in the quarter.","As Ted indicated, if the final GRC decision is received timely, revenues to offset these costs would be recorded in the fourth quarter.","SCE continued incur inspection and repair costs related to SONGS outage, which had a $0.09 per share impact during the third quarter. In addition, SCE's third quarter results included a $0.09 per share severance reserve, which reflects the previously announced staffing reductions at SONGS. To be clear, we have included inspection and repair costs and the severance reserve in core earnings.","During the third quarter, SCE continued to manage its costs carefully, given the rate case uncertainties, providing a benefit of $0.06 per share. And finally, income taxes and other items contributed a net favorable $0.04 per share. The effective tax rate declined on lower pretax income and higher property related deductions, part of which resulted from finalizing our 2011 tax returns.","Next, I'd like to turn to the implications of the Proposed Decision in the General Rate Case on capital spending and rate base. Page 4 summarizes some of the specifics that Ted alluded to in his comments. Importantly, the post-test year escalation for capital additions is commensurate with our projected range of capital expenditures.","Turning to Page 5, we have added, at the lower left of the slide, capital spending incorporated in the Proposed Decision. In all years, keeping all other factors constant, capital spending would remain within our request and range cases. As noted at the bottom of the slide, we now see actual capital expenditures are likely to fall below the range case during 2012, primarily from the delay in receiving the General Rate Case decision and from delays associated with the Tehachapi transmission project.","We would expect to make up this shortfall in CPUC jurisdictional capital spending by the end of 2014, consistent with the overall 3-year authorized spending levels.","We will update SCE's capital spending forecast after we receive a final rate case decision, most likely as part of our full year financial reporting.","Page 6 shows the corresponding impact of the Proposed Decision on rate base, again, keeping all other factors constant with the prior forecast. You can see that the authorized rate base, which is on an average year basis, falls within our request and range cases, consistent with a 7% to 9% rate base growth.","Turning to Page 7, regarding SONGS. Ted has already spoken to many of these points, but I want to touch on a few financial elements. We believe we have incurred the cost needed to return Unit 2 to service at partial load. We have no further estimates on any cost to return Unit 2 to full-service or to restart Unit 3, pending the technical evaluation that Ted discussed.","In September, SCE invoiced Mitsubishi for $45 million for inspection and repair costs paid through June 30 by SCE and its partners. We expect to issue additional invoices for recovery of inspection and repair costs.","In October, SCE submitted its initial claim to Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited, or NEIL, for loss recovery under its outage insurance. SCE will recover the maximum indemnity amounts for each unit under our outage policy, which is $3.5 million per unit, per week after a 12-week deductible.","For both the warranty and insurance, there is no assurance of any recoveries. SCE has not recorded any recoveries in its results, pending further actions by NEIL and MHI.","Please turn to Page 8. We provided information on EMG's results, and the appendix pages have the detailed operating information. Suffice to say that business conditions for merchant generators remains challenging. The availability and forced outage rates at Midwest Generation for the quarter improved over last year, and Midwest Generation controlled its O&M costs in light of the market conditions.","However, Midwest Generation's results were adversely impacted by lower energy prices. This also resulted in lower generation levels, higher fuel costs driven by higher coal transportation costs and lower capacity prices. Natural gas project earnings declined at the Sunrise project due to the expiration of its long-term power contract.","Page 9 updates liquidity position for our companies, and the bottom half of the page provides EME's tax benefit position. On the latter point, $185 million tax allocation payment made by EME in the quarter was as expected, and EME anticipates receiving a net $160 million in payments from EIX by next spring.","Given the lateness in the year and a lack of a final GRC decision, we do not plan to provide 2012 earnings guidance. On February 26, 2013, tentatively, we plan to report fourth quarter and full year results and to provide 2013 earnings guidance.","Okay, thanks. Now, I'd like to turn it over to the operator and move into the Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Dan Eggers with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Ted, when we think about Mission, I know you're not going to go to comment on where negotiations are. But a little over a year ago, you said that the resolution should be done in 12 months, and obviously, your negotiations, which has continued this on. But are you thinking there is kind of a mental deadline where you need to be done with this process? Or is this something that could stay open ended, even beyond the interest payment timeline, if you're comfortable with negotiations going forward?","Theodore F. Craver","I think kind of the short answer is, the pending interest payments really pretty much bring this thing to a head. So I'd be hard-pressed to see how it could extend past the interest payment period.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So the November 15 plus 30 days is kind of the timeline within that, that band would be as far as it could go?","Theodore F. Craver","That's the way we've been thinking about it.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And I guess, just one other question on the 10-Q. I guess On Page 43, you showed the book value for EME, as you guys have it right now. Should we assume that the -- effectively net, $1.1 billion, is that what we should think of as your book value that would be exposed to a tax loss carryforward if -- or exposed loss to get a tax benefit if it were to go bankrupt or you were to give up your interest in the business?","W. James Scilacci","Dan, this is Jim. I think it's really complicated to tell you that what kind of tax loss there might be associated with EME because there's a time element here. And it depends on potential monetization of tax benefits. So I can't even begin to suggest what is appropriate to use for modeling purposes. And I think, overall, you should consider it not material.","Operator","And our next question comes from Hugh Wynne with Sanford Bernstein.","Hugh Wynne - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","My question is around SONGS. I wonder, first, whether you could outline for us your expectations with respect to a determination or the date by which the CPUC would determine the amount of your revenue requirement that would be subject to refund? What is the schedule of the proceeding?","Theodore F. Craver","Ron, you want to take that?","Ronald L. Litzinger","Yes, this is Ron. The commission really hasn't laid out a schedule. It's very early on. President Peevey did comment that the review would be exhaustive. So it would likely be some time.","Hugh Wynne - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","\"Would likely be some time,\" is that the end of the sentence?","Ronald L. Litzinger","Yes. Period.","Hugh Wynne - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Period, right. The second part of that question is are there precedents that we could use from, for example, the treatment of Unit 1 or other nuclear power plant outages or other plant outages in California, as to the range of possible outcomes in this proceeding? What portion of the plant's revenue requirement is most at risk?","W. James Scilacci","Hugh, this is Jim. I can't even begin to speculate on something like that. As we've said before, we believe our actions surrounding SONGS have been reasonable. And we will look to maximize our recoveries and insurance through our warranty from MHI. And so we will do all we can to minimize the potential costs for all parties involved.","Operator","And our next question comes from Gregg Orrill with Barclays.","Gregg Orrill - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I was wondering if you could address the rate base on Slide 6 of the 2014 GRC PD of $23.4 billion. And then Footnote 1 breaks it into -- breaks the forecasted range into a number of components. I wonder if you could maybe, at least, break it into -- the PD into jurisdictional rate base and then transmission?","W. James Scilacci","Just think of it this way. FERC jurisdictional rate base would be about approximately 20% of the number here that you see for the GRC PD at $23.4 billion. So that's just a rule of thumb. And I'll pause there, because I'm now forgetting the first part of your question. You need to reask it, Gregg.","Gregg Orrill - Barclays Capital, Research Division","That was really just to break the 2014 PD rate base for cash into its components. So maybe we could get a sense on our own of potential earnings impact?","W. James Scilacci","Yes. So I think if you take the $23.4 billion and you have 80-20 as a rough rule of thumb between CPUC jurisdictional and FERC jurisdictional.","Operator","And your next question comes from Steve Fleishman with Bank of America.","Steven I. Fleishman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just a question on the San Onofre review. To the degree that the commission, I think, potentially has to move the asset out of rate base into some other laws pending the review, are you still able to book the earnings from the asset during the review even if it's in a separate clause? Or is there any kind of accounting issue with continuing to book the terms?","W. James Scilacci","Well, I think we can, and under 455.5, it specifies what the mechanism is. But I'll look over to Linda Sullivan, and she can provide some additional information.","Linda G. Sullivan","So, if the asset is taken out of rate base, what we would do is remove it from rate base, move it into a regulatory asset account. And then, we would have to continually assess the probability of recovery as we move forward.","Steven I. Fleishman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. But there would have to be some kind of issue in the process that would cause you to assess, and it's unlikely for it to be a problem to book it?","W. James Scilacci","So we're going to have to make a determination. And if you remember back during the...","Theodore F. Craver","It's quarter by quarter.","W. James Scilacci","It's going to be quarter-to-quarter. We have to assess -- it's under FAS 71. As you assess the recoverability of the cost. And based on where we stand today and the facts that we know, our actions were reasonable, and we will look to recover those dollars. Now, if the commission did something otherwise, the facts may change.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","First question is can you -- I know you don't want to go anywhere on these negotiations on Mission. But I'm just wondering if you could give us sort of, conceptually, some kind of an idea of what types of things would trigger a disclosure filing? And how -- is that part of the process, or is that just something that may happen?","Theodore F. Craver","This is Ted. I think, essentially, the consideration there is, as I mentioned, originally, we were just discussing and negotiating with the advisors of some of the holders of the bonds. More recently, that's moved to discussions with the advisors of a subset that are -- of clients. So we have nondisclosure agreements with those clients and so that means they are restricted. So there are some spots here, and this is what we were alluding in the comments, there are some spots here where those holders, the direct holders, are not going to be -- or not going to want to be restricted. And there would be some disclosure that would give the history of the discussions, so-called cleansing disclosure. But I think that's the next disclosure that would likely come forward. But while we're still in negotiations, all parties have decided that we would just simply state we're in negotiations, and that's where we are at this point.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So Ted, remembering back to the Homer City, that would be a kind of -- you're talking about some kind of a financial outlook disclosure that would be triggered by having disclosed it to them. It wouldn't necessarily be a sign you are agreeing on anything, is that -- are we thinking of that correct?","Theodore F. Craver","You can't really -- I mean, there are so many potential outcomes here. I think, what we are relating to is there's some spot here where there will be a so-called cleansing disclosure. Whether that will be the result of an agreement or not, we really can't speculate. And there are different percentages of bondholders that end up getting involved in this thing over time. But I think you just -- it's unfortunate, we'd like to be a lot clearer about some of these things, but really all we can say is we're in continuing discussions with the advisors and the bondholders. And that's really where we are for the time being.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Coming back to the proposed decision in the rate case, looking at Slide 4, that $15.09 billion rate base in 2012, is there any CPUC items, CPUC-regulated items, that you can earn on but are not included in that $15.09 billion?","W. James Scilacci","I'll pause here and look at Linda Sullivan for help.","Linda G. Sullivan","So, it does not include the solar rooftop program for the 125-megawatt reduction. It also does not include the SmartConnect program and the steam generator replacement program.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Can you quantify, just put some numbers around those 3 items, please?","Linda G. Sullivan","We have not disclosed that.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","You've not disclosed...","W. James Scilacci","So what we're trying to do in the Page 6, it provides the full rack-up of the full rate base numbers. So we haven't provided the individual pieces here, Michael.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. So the GRC PD of $20.1 billion, if I subtract $15.09 billion from that, the rest of it is a combination of the other CPUC-regulated items, plus FERC-regulated transmission.","Linda G. Sullivan","That's correct.","W. James Scilacci","You got it.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. Just curious though, I don't know -- I think you've done it in a public filing. What your latest FERC transmission rate base is?","W. James Scilacci","Well, what we said in 2014, it's going to be about 20% of the $23.4 billion number. So we'll have to back up. So we're right in the midst of filing our update proceedings for this year. And I think it's less than 20%. Why don't we just say we'll get you a number? It's approximately 15% of the total rate base, but we'll get you a more exact number because that's in the public domain.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just real quick. Were there dramatic changes to depreciation schedules as part of the PD?","Linda G. Sullivan","There were many different changes to the depreciation schedules that were in the request. And in some cases, the judge agreed with our recommendations. In other cases, he agreed with the interveners. And overall, it was a reduction of about $100 million from our request. And we're still working through the Proposed Decision and through all of the details.","W. James Scilacci","Just to follow up on that, we'll have -- we're filing comments on the Proposed Decision to the extent that there are things we will comment on and depreciation could be one of those.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Chin with Citigroup.","Brian Chin - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I know you guys didn't touch on it in your prepared comments because it's a bit more California related in a broad sense, but we've seen a lot more color or chatter recently about resumption of resource adequacy and capacity market type commentary in California. And to my knowledge, I don't think you guys have really commented on that formally. But can you just give me your sense of where you think that's headed? Particularly since Calpine-Sutter decision seems to have touched off a little bit of concern in the state?","Theodore F. Craver","Okay, Ron Litzinger will cover that.","Ronald L. Litzinger","There's nothing formally set-up or established any proceeding at this point. But certainly, as you stated, Sutter has got everyone thinking about capacity markets again. And the people are starting to prepare to engage in discussions in an appropriate forum, if one develops.","W. James Scilacci","And Brian, just to follow-on, on that, because of the potentially need for capacity out past the end of the decade with once through cooling situation still ongoing and potentially SONGS. There's -- that's why I think you're seeing a little bit more chatter associated with capacity markets.","Brian Chin - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Is there a particular structure or approach to that, at least in broad terms, you know that would be supportive of?","W. James Scilacci","I don't think we can have a company policy that we could tell you. We're obviously, given our experience at EME, we're very familiar with the capacity structure in PJM. We've been heavily engaged since the capacity market was ultimately created. There are some very positive things associated with that, but there's also some challenges in terms of the way they've managed it. So you have to weigh the pluses and minuses, and you have to ultimately think about the impact on the rate payer overall. So if there were a proceeding, what would it go through? The long-term resource adequacy proceedings or would that create a separate proceeding?","Theodore F. Craver","I think it would be a separate rule making.","Operator","And our next question comes from Kit Konolige with BGC.","Kit Konolige - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division","Just a couple of kind of follow-up questions. Jim, did I hear you correctly saying that any tax-related loss or tax advantage from a loss at EME would be not material at the EIX level?","W. James Scilacci","I did say that.","Kit Konolige","Okay. And then can I ask, generally, should we be assuming, I know this is kind of early in the central [ph] process, but can we be assuming that you would want to replace the steam generators at San Onofre again? In other words, is -- should the base case assumption be that SONGS will run for a good number of years in the future?","Theodore F. Craver","Kit, this is Ted. I'm going to answer that with kind of largely a non-answer. Fundamentally, we're focused on Unit 2, making sure that we can restart Unit 2 safely. We did a lot of work on that, came to the conclusion that we could. That's why we applied for approval to the NRC to restart Unit 2. There's things that we are going to -- once we run Unit 2, assuming it's approved to restart, once we run it for the 5 month period, take it down, reinspect, that will certainly provide quite a bit of information. As we said in the comments here, a lot of work continues around what are the possible options for Unit 3, what might be able to be done in a repair or a replace scenario. So there's a lot of work that's going on, but way too early at this point for conclusions or speculation around whether units would be replaced or repaired or run at partial power or for how long. It's just premature at this point.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ali Agha with SunTrust.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Ted, coming back to you, big picture question. In your opening remarks, you painted the picture on EME markets have not improved nor seeing any signs in the foreseeable future. If you take your year-to-date results, at the EBIT level, you're reporting a loss. So even if all the deck was eliminated, you would still be booking losses at EME. Am I missing something here? Or other than a bankruptcy filing, I mean, what is left here to be thinking about in this process?","Theodore F. Craver","Well, we did indicate that there's significant losses this year and also said that we would anticipate, under current market conditions, for there to be losses in future years. And that is part of our thinking around what's the best course. I think we've been pretty clear on this and I won't spent a lot of time reiterating it. But -- that if we are continuing with EME, we've got to address the capital structure. It's over-levered for the type of conditions that we see. And we have to be able -- we, Edison International, have to be able to see a stable path forward with EME. We have to be able to turn to our equity investors and say, \"It makes sense to retain ownership of EME because we see a stable capital structure that's appropriately fitted for the market conditions.\" Absent that, then we look at the other principal option, which is no longer having ownership. So those are the areas that we've been talking about and looking at with all of you. And I think you've put your finger on the principal problem, and that is market conditions don't really support positive earnings for some period of time.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay, fair enough. And then second question on SONGS. Can you remind us, year-to-date, how much expenses have been incurred that you believe ultimately are eligible to be reimbursed to you? What's the total amount?","W. James Scilacci","$96 million.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","$96 million pretax?","W. James Scilacci","Correct.","Theodore F. Craver","Correct.","Operator","Our next question comes from Angie Storozynski with Macquarie.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Research","I have a question about the timeline for the next couple of months. So you mentioned that you need the cost of capital proceeding to be done to have a better visibility into SCE's earnings power, and that will determine the ability to increase dividends going forward. Now, I'm worried because we've seen a number of cases being delayed in California. And how comfortable are you that there's going to be a decision in the cost of capital proceeding still this year?","W. James Scilacci","It's a great question, and the history with our PD hasn't been good in terms of the delay. And cost of capital, it's gone very efficiently thus far. The hearings were on time. The ALJ that's involved in the cost of capital proceeding that's assigned, has had a history of doing this proceeding, and he's is knowledgeable of it. And so I would anticipate a Proposed Decision on time in the latter part of November. Now, then it's up to the commissioners to make a decision before the end of the year. I think an important thing here, why the commissioners are going to be interested in making a final decision by the end of the year, because there's a rate reduction that they want to put in place. And if you delay that decision, you can't effectively get that rate reduction. So I think they'll be motivated to do it on time.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Research","Okay. And then say, I mean -- assuming that there is a resolution with EME and their potential lawsuits, we should assume that any lawsuits will not impact your ability to decide on the future dividends?","W. James Scilacci","Well, Angie, just so we're clear, the source of the dividend is solely and completely from Southern California Edison. And I can't speculate on what might or might not occur during that process. But we rely solely and exclusively on SCE for the dividend.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Research","Okay, and last question. Can you give us at least a ballpark of the amount of costs that are going to be coming back to the parent? I assume that Edison Mission currently absorbs some of the parent level costs. I mean, could you give us at least a sense of how big about number that is?","W. James Scilacci","It's pretty small, it's Angie, it's Jim again. I think we've put something in the disclosure. It's maybe $0.02 or less, so it's a minor amount of cost.","Operator","Our next question comes from Leslie Rich with JPMC.","Leslie Rich - J.P. Morgan Asset Management, Inc.","I'm sure I've asked this question before, but your ROE on the FERC transmission, I think in the past, you said it basically earns the same ROE as the California-regulated business. Is that the case? And in the cost of capital proceeding, the distribution ROE will be reset. Does the FERC ROE sort of automatically get reset or does that sort of happen gradually over time? Do you have incentives on some of the larger lines? Just if you could just flesh out what the sort of average FERC rate base ROE would be.","W. James Scilacci","Okay, Leslie. This is Jim. We're going to have Linda Sullivan, who is the CFO of the utility, answer that.","Linda G. Sullivan","Leslie, for the FERC ROE, currently for the 2012 General Rate Case, which is currently under settlement proceedings, we have a 9.93 base ROE. And then we add to that a 50-basis-point adder for participating in the Cal ISO and then we have specific project incentives on our major transmission projects, the Tehachapi project and the Devers-Colorado River project, which puts us at a weighted average ROE at 11.1 for FERC. Now, in terms of how that works going forward, as I mentioned, we are currently in settlement proceedings.","Leslie Rich","For the FERC component of the ROE?","Linda G. Sullivan","Yes.","Leslie Rich","And so that, you file annually with FERC. So that could potentially impact the FERC ROE for 2013?","Linda G. Sullivan","We have filed for a 2012 FERC formula filing, and that formula filing is currently under settlement proceedings.","W. James Scilacci","So FERC return on common equity could go up or down depending upon the mechanism we use there, Leslie. So that's a good question. And there's information in our disclosures that gets to a little bit more detail on that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Travis Miller with MorningStar Securities Research.","Travis Miller - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","A little bit of speculation here. But if the CPUC were to adopt the PD as is, on the final day of the year, what do you estimate that full year impact on EPS and possibly revenue would be?","W. James Scilacci","Yes, Travis, this is Jim. I'm sorry, we haven't put out guidance for 2012, and we'll just have to wait and see what the decision actually says. I know you said assuming that they approve the Proposed Decision as is. So we will look to provide information regarding our earnings for 2012 when we report the full year financial information in February. So I just can't be helpful there.","Travis Miller - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay. One other follow-up, if -- what projects in that CapEx reduction -- are there any specific projects in that CapEx reduction? Are they maintenance CapEx projects? What kind of projects were in that PD CapEx reduction?","W. James Scilacci","Okay. You're talking about the Proposed Decision. There's a host of different things. I think the important part, from our perspective, that we received about 96% of our distribution capital. So that goes to the core reliability issue. So the things they did not approve has to do with a host of different things, IT related. There's solar rooftop program that we had a timing problem, where we went in at the full 250-megawatt, and we voluntarily reduced it by 125. So they had to pull that out of the decision. There's some real properties. Linda, anything else you want to...","Linda G. Sullivan","Capitalized software project.","W. James Scilacci","Capital -- so we will have more detail on that as we file our comments on the Proposed Decision. We'll have some charts on that, but that will be later.","Travis Miller - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Are you pretty okay with that? Is that going to be a key part of the rebuttal, whatever you -- for the [ph] file? Or is that pretty well accepted?","W. James Scilacci","I think what Ted said is, is the fact that we will adjust our spending to what's authorized by the commission. And I think, importantly, we got the majority of our distribution capital expenditures.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ashar Khan with Visium Asset Management.","Ashar Khan","Can you just, Ted -- I haven't read the Q, can you just talk about, regarding what's happening with Mitsubishi in terms of when we hear back from them, whether they accept, and the negotiations going on? Is there any feedback that you can provide on timing of talks with Mitsubishi?","Theodore F. Craver","Yes. I seem to get the questions where I provide little to no information. We really can't go into it at this point. And we've, of course, been very much involved with Mitsubishi all along the way on the whole root cause evaluation, all of the work that led to our response to the Confirmatory Action Letter to the NRC. Mitsubishi was very much involved, working with ourselves and a number of other outside independent experts, on coming to those conclusions. So at the technical level, there's been quite a bit of interaction with Mitsubishi. And they've been cooperative throughout all of that. In terms of the commercial elements, really, our focus has been so much on the safety requirements and on the technical issues, relatively less on the financial side. Jim gave you some specifics about some of the early billing that we've done, or invoicing that we've given them around some of those costs. But it's what I would really characterize as fairly normal course kind of discussion at this point.","Ashar Khan","But Ted, have they said that they're not going to pay or anything like that, they've accepted the bills? What is the kind of the due date on that invoice?","W. James Scilacci","So we've billed them the $45 million, and the invoices are being reviewed.","Operator","And this does conclude the question-and-answer session. I will now turn the conference back to over Mr. Cunningham.","Scott Cunningham","Thanks very much everyone for participating today, and, please, don't hesitate to give us a call if you have any follow-up questions.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Edison International First Quarter 2012 Financial Teleconference. [Operator Instructions] Today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Scott Cunningham, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. Mr. Cunningham, you may begin your conference.","Scott Cunningham","Thanks, Sharon, and good afternoon, everyone. Our principal speakers today will be Chairman and CEO, Ted Craver; and Chief Financial Officer, Jim Scilacci. Also with us are other members of the management team. The presentation that accompanies Jim's comments, the earnings press release and our 10-Q filings are available on our website at www.edisoninvestor.com. Tomorrow afternoon, we will issue our regular quarterly business update presentation that will use of these and other slides for our ongoing investor discussions.","During this call, we will make forward-looking statements about the financial outlook for Edison International and its subsidiaries and about other future events. Actual results could differ materially from current expectations. Important factors that could cause different results are set forth in our SEC filings. We encourage you to read these carefully. The presentation includes certain outlook assumptions, as well as reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the nearest GAAP measure.","[Operator Instructions] ","With that, I'll turn the call over to Ted Craver.","Theodore F. Craver","Thanks, Scott, and good morning -- or good afternoon, everyone. Today, we reported GAAP earnings of $0.28 per share. As expected, a decline from the $0.61 per share last year. Core earnings were $0.35 per share compared to $0.65 per share a year ago. There are 2 high-level points I would like to make about our first quarter earnings. Southern California Edison's first quarter results reflect a mismatch of costs and revenues, given the delay in receiving our General Rate Case decision. Once the California Public Utilities Commission issues a final decision, revenues will be recognized retroactively to the beginning of the year. Second, in anticipation of transferring EMG's Homer City plant to the owner-lessors, we reclassified Homer City's $0.03 per share loss last year and this year's $0.07 per share loss into noncore earnings. ","I would like to update you on a few important matters since our year-end earnings call. Let me start with the cost of capital application Southern California Edison filed with the CPUC on April 20. SCE's application recommended continuing its current capital structure of 48% equity, 43% long-term debt and 9% preferred stock with a recommended ROE of 11.1%, down from the current 11.5%.","SCE also recommended continuation of the same automatic trigger mechanism, which has been in place for several years, that uses the Moody's Baa utility bond index. We recommended this mechanism be continued for a 3-year cycle and adjusting the baseline to reflect the 12-month average of the index at September 30 of this year. SCE's proposal would result in a 2013 reduction in customer rates of $128 million, about half associated with the lower ROE and the other half related to the true-up of our embedded cost of debt and preferred stock. Hearings are anticipated in late summer or early fall with a final CPUC decision by year end and effective January 1 of next year. There are summaries of the filing and an illustrative example of the index mechanism in the presentation appendix. ","Let me now turn to our San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station. SCE is continuing to assess the causes of the steam generator leak discovered January 31 at Unit 3, working together with the NRC, the manufacturer, and other consultants and industry experts. Over the last 3 months, we have been conducting a battery of tests and studying the phenomenon causing the tube wear. We have identified some unusual wear in approximately 1% of the nearly 39,000 steam generator tubes that transfer heat to produce the steam, which drives the turbines and generates the electricity. While tube wear is to be expected, we are taking this very seriously since it is occurring in newly installed steam generators. When we are satisfied that we sufficiently understand the mechanisms and the causes of the wear, we will seek confirmation of our remediation plan with the NRC. The plan will likely follow standard industry practice of plugging, stabilizing and removing from service all affected tubes along with some other operational changes. We are absolutely committed to the safe operation of San Onofre and will not return the units to service until we and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission are completely satisfied it is safe to do so. ","It is possible the time required to do all this will keep one or both of the units offline into the summer, straining our ability to meet peak electricity demand. Therefore, we have been working with the California Independent System Operator and San Diego Gas & Electric on power supply contingency plans for this summer. Those plans include transmission upgrades, bringing idled plants owned by other companies back into service, conservation and demand response programs to reduce the possibility of service interruptions. ","I'd like to turn next to EMG and come back to several key points I made on our year-end earnings call. First is our strategic intent. I want to reiterate what I said on the last call, that we continue to believe that a dual platform of regulated and competitive businesses best positions our company for the significant change we expect in the electric power industry. Second, I reaffirm our commitment that we will not invest new funds into EMG, given the challenging market conditions. Finally, given the simultaneous need to retrofit the Midwest Generation fleet and meet future debt maturities at a time when power and capacity prices are at a cyclical low, I stated that a restructuring or reorganization of EME's capital structure may be needed. Further to this point, we take note of reports that EME bondholders may be seeking to organize themselves. We continue to believe this year will be definitive for EMG in terms of making decisions about the path forward. ","I would like to review some of the important decisions made since our last earnings call and some of those to be made in the months ahead. Let me start with Homer City. EMG continues to work with GE Capital to transfer Homer City to the owner-lessors. On March 29, Homer City and GE Capital signed an agreement that sets forth a road map for completing the transfer. ","Turning to Midwest Generation. EMG has accelerated the timeline for closure of the Fisk and Crawford facilities to September 2012. EMG has also requested a 1-year extension to December 2014 of the compliance deadline for environmental retrofits at Waukegan Unit 7. The closure of Fisk and Crawford stations and the resulting emissions reductions more than offset any impact of a 1-year extension at Waukegan and give EMG more time to assess capacity market and forward power prices that will affect final retrofit decisions. EMG continues to implement its renewables financing strategies. These will enhance liquidity while allowing EMG to grow its renewables investments through the Capistrano venture announced in February. ","With those comments, I'll now turn the call over to Jim Scilacci.","W. James Scilacci","Thanks, Ted, and good morning -- I did it too. Good afternoon, everyone. Ted has already touched on the high-level first quarter comparisons, which are summarized on Page 2 of the presentation. Please note that the first quarter holding company costs of $0.02 per share are in line with our normal quarterly trend. ","Turning to Page 3. The delay in the 2012 CPUC General Rate Case decision that Ted mentioned impacted first quarter earnings by about $0.08 per share. Our first quarter CPUC revenues are largely based on 2011 authorized revenues. As a result, higher costs in the first quarter are not currently being recovered, including higher depreciation and new debt and preferred stock costs. When SCE receives its final GRC decision, it will record the revenue retroactively through January 1. The remaining $0.03 negative variance is lower AFUDC as SCE is utilizing more short-term debt in 2012. ","In addition, SCE incurred $0.04 per share of unplanned outage inspection and repair cost at San Onofre, reflecting the $20 million pretax figure that Ted mentioned. During the first quarter, inspection and repair costs were largely offset by lower operation and maintenance costs in other areas of the company. Subject to the NRC review under the confirmatory action letter and any new developments that may result from further analysis, testing and inspection, SCE's estimated share of the total incremental inspection and repair costs associated with returning the units to service remains uncertain but is currently projected to be in the range of $55 million to $65 million pretax.","Currently, SCE is expensing the SONGS inspection and repair cost as incurred. And such cost will, as appropriate, be offset later to recognize recoveries SCE obtains under the warranty applicable to the steam generators. Replacement power costs are recorded in the fuel and purchased power balancing accounts but are subject to later reasonableness review by the CPUC. As a result of this treatment, there is no impact on 2012 earnings. There were no significant changes to SCE's capital spending or rate case forecast and the details are included in the appendix. ","EMG results are shown on Page 4 and reflect the treatment of Homer City as noncore for both periods. EMG's first quarter core loss increased by $0.17 per share from lower generation, lower average realized energy and capacity prices along with higher fuel costs at Midwest Gen. Reduced generation resulted from lower economic dispatch, increased planned maintenance outages and thermal discharge limits at 2 stations in March due to unseasonably warm weather. Our regular Midwest Gen operating report summary, hedge position and capacity market summaries are contained in the appendix. There were no significant hedge or coal procurement transactions in the quarter.","On Page 5 presents 2011 quarterly and full year EPS results for Homer City that can be used for updating models. With the expected pending transfer of Homer City to the owner-lessors, we are no longer including Homer City-specific information in our presentation and earnings commentary. It remains in the 10-Q disclosures for those that want the information. On March 29, Homer City and GE Capital entered into an implementation agreement and both parties are now working on related agreements for the construction of environmental improvements at Homer City and the transition of the plant to the owner-lessors. GE Capital and certain of the Homer City debt holders have been in discussions regarding the terms of the existing secured lease obligation bonds and funding for the scrubbers. At this time, it is uncertain when Homer City will transition to the owner-lessors. Ted already mentioned that we will close Fisk and Crawford stations in September. When this occurs, EME will record a tax deduction equal to the remaining tax basis of the assets. At March 31, 2012, the tax basis for Fisk was $64 million and the tax basis for Crawford was $87 million.","I'd like to turn now to EMG's wind financing and capital raise strategy on Page 6. EMG continues to make progress implementing this strategy, which now includes the Capistrano Wind Partners venture that closed in February. In the first quarter, EMG completed a new $98 million project financing for the 2 wind projects under construction in Nebraska, Broken Bow and Crofton Bluffs. EMG's capital spending plans, which are shown on Page 7, are essentially unchanged from what we discussed last quarter. The scope in the forecast includes basic maintenance capital spending, the large unit environmental retrofit program at Midwest Gen and completion of the 2 Nebraska wind projects this year and the Walnut Creek gas-fired project next year. All of the growth investments now have dedicated construction financings in place which will convert to permanent financings upon completion of construction. ","Turning to Page 8. At March 31, EME had liquidity of just over $1.3 billion and had recognized $908 million of tax benefits from net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards compared to $520 million at the end of last year. We expect deferred tax benefits to increase based on further operating losses, plant closures and from recognition of ongoing wind production tax credits. Last quarter, we had reported that EME would make a tax allocation payment to EIX of $185 million, but this amount may be substantially offset by tax allocation payments to EME by Edison International. ","Page 9 covers the same key points as our year-end presentation. As we have previously said, we will not provide earnings guidance for 2012 until after the CPUC GRC is final. We do however anticipate that EMG's full year adjusted EBITDA will be negative. ","This concludes my comments. And now I'll turn the call back over to the operator for the questions and answers.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Dan Eggers of Credit Suisse.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I guess, on EMG at this point, with a -- your continuing deterioration in fundamentals, can you just -- if you want to share any more thoughts on how you're evaluating that project and maybe how you could advance the conversation with the bondholders if the capital restructuring is a viable option for the timetable you guys have discussed for coming to a solution?","Theodore F. Craver","Dan, this is Ted. I think we're getting to that spot on EMG, particularly as it relates to potential discussions with bondholders, that, just frankly, is not going to be helpful or wise for us to kind of weight in and speculate on how those things might go. So I'm afraid you're going to kind of more likely than not get responses from us on those types of questions. We're just going to have to see how it develops. I think we've tried to lay out -- tried to lay it out in my comments that the fundamental approach is we believe that there needs to be some sort of -- some element of work with the bonds, looking at the capital structure, restructuring the capital. And that's going to most likely lead to a conversation with the bondholders. And that's probably just where we need to leave it at this point.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. That's fair. And I guess, just on the outlook for SCE this year. I know you've pulled guidance. But if we thought about how it will work once the GRC gets done, is it fair to assume this year you do still expect to yield or earn your allowed ROE at SCE less the $55 million or $60 million for the SONGS cost, which would presumably get recovered maybe next year once the warranty work gets resolved?","W. James Scilacci","That thing that's -- this is Jim, Dan. I think it's the key we're going to need to get before for us is a General Rate Case decision. And you have all the metrics that we've been using for year-after-year. But the key piece that's missing here is the proposed decision is the first step, and ultimately a final decision. And once we have this -- that in hand, then we'll be able to give you a good assessment of where we think 2012 is going to come out.","Operator","Next question comes from Jay Dobson.","James L. Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","Wanted to follow up a little bit, maybe if we could just talk EMG and just what capacity factors we sort of saw in the quarter. I'm not sure if a lot of that information was in the handout, Jim. But just talk about, given coal-to-gas switching and these sort of things, what we saw?","W. James Scilacci","Okay. The information is included in the deck. I'm just going to flip through it and probably tell you what page it's on, and I'll stop for a second. There was some limited coal-to-gas switching that we saw. In fact, in my comments, we talked about 3 areas where we saw reduced generation. And we think it had to do with the coal-to-gas switching for a piece of it, higher planned maintenance quarter-over-quarter and some thermal limits that we encountered because of the unseasonably warm weather in March. So that dropped the generation and some of the capacity factors for the Midwest Gen units. So I'll pause there. Can you see it? Page 33, Jay.","James L. Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","Okay. Perfect. I'll take a look at that. And then going back to San Onofre, I just want to understand your comments. The $55 million to $65 million, you're talking about pretax cost return. That's the total cost, so you're including in that what you've spent in the first quarter?","W. James Scilacci","Yes.","James L. Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","And how...","W. James Scilacci","I just want to sure it's clear. Pretax.","James L. Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","And how would that roll over the year? I mean, obviously, when it comes back is an important element in that. But if we were to assume it wasn't coming back for summertime is what we've seen in the first quarter a reasonable run rate? Or just how should we think about those flowing? And I know it's a difficult question because we don't know or you don't know when it's coming back.","W. James Scilacci","Okay. I'm going to turn this over to Ron. He'll give you some more detail around that.","Ronald L. Litzinger","Yes. The $55 million to $65 million is what we are projecting for repair cost. And I want to keep those distinct from replacement fuel costs. And staying with the repair cost, that's what we're projecting. We still have a long way to go to finalize that. But that's where we think we'll end up, and then we can seek recovery under the warranty. Replacement power, which we had in the disclosures for the first quarter, which is around $30 million, we also disclosed that those costs would be substantially higher in the summertime.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jonathan Arnold of Deutsche Bank.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I think my question was pretty much answered. But just to follow up a little bit on SONGS. The process here is that you'll determine what the costs are expected to be and then make a claim under the warranty. So it will be kind of -- or will you need to expense everything and then claim back later?","W. James Scilacci","So this is Jim. And I'll start, then Ron can fill in. So what we've done already, we've expensed all the costs to date, and we gave you numbers for what we think it's going to cost to bring the units back online. That's the $55 million to $65 million pretax, based on the current plan. And so we'll continue to expense them as we incur them, then we will look to seek recovery based on what we believe is appropriate under the warranty. Ron, would you like to add anything more?","Ronald L. Litzinger","Yes. The primary focus now is identifying the root cause so that we can return the units to service at some point. We are working cooperatively with MHI, as Ted stated, and just add that additional fact.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just looking through some of the transmission project data in one of the back slides, I noticed that some of the projects that are due on online or operational next year, they're like 16%, 18% done. Devers-Colorado, is 18% complete. Eldorado-Ivanpah is 6% complete. And just wondering how you feel about the schedules and getting them operational and in earnings by year-end 2013.","Theodore F. Craver","Ron?","Ronald L. Litzinger","Those particular projects, Devers-Colorado and Eldorado-Ivanpah, we have no indications of them been delayed. That said, it is always possible to run into delays with regards to environmental concerns on those projects. But at least for now, we've got no anticipated change in DCR and Eldorado-Ivanpah.","W. James Scilacci","And Michael, just to add. If you look in the capital expenditures on Page 22, 2012 and 2013 are very heavy construction years. And a big part of that is [indiscernible] DCR, Eldorado-Ivanpah. So those are why that we have such a peak in this year and it drops off a little bit in 2013 but still stays elevated.","Operator","Our next question comes from Hugh Wynne from Sanford Bernstein.","Hugh Wynne - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","My question goes to SONGS. You mentioned that there may be steps you'll have to take in the summer to ensure adequate power supplies in California, bringing plants owned by others back into service, for example. Are any of those costs likely to be unrecoverable? Or do you anticipate that all of them will be recoverable under the GRC?","Ronald L. Litzinger","It's not -- this is Ron, Hugh. It is not done through the GRC. Our fuel and purchased power costs are reviewed annually through our ERA proceeding. And all of the cost that we incur for SONGS being down will be subject to a reasonableness review, and it's tough to predict at this time where that will go next year.","Hugh Wynne - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Is that the point also of your disclosure on 19, that the steam generator replacement cost remains subject to CPUC review? Is that something to remind us that, that's a reasonableness test as well?","Theodore F. Craver","That is an additional reasonableness test. We've really got 3 categories here, fuel and purchased power cost, which are the ERA proceeding. We've got the steam generator replacement reasonableness application that we need to make for the capital, and then there's our O&M cost, which we talked about earlier.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Fleishman of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Steven I. Fleishman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Question on the kind of thinking on dealing with EMG. As you've talked about all the issues that you resolved in the last 6 months, the pieces, I guess, we still have the RPM auction piece left. So it seems like there should be more certainty of the pieces of the company. But there are certain things, such as power prices in the future, also things like what happens with bonus depreciation, that are going to be hard to really know in making this decision. So how, if you're going to try and work this out, do you mitigate the risk to shareholders that you'd make the wrong call on those things? Or how do you deal with -- there's no way you're going to know all these pieces.","Theodore F. Craver","Steve, this is Ted. I'm trying to be a little more serious. I think you put your finger on, obviously, one of the big issues. We are looking well into the future. We're looking at what the potential cash flows are going to be. Certainly, if we're engaged in conversations with bondholders and the like, they're going to be doing similar types of things. So there's judgments that have to be made, and there's no way to be assured that those things -- that you can make all those judgments perfectly. The one part that I think is immutable is we are not going to be making additional capital contributions from EIX and EMG. So it is a closed loop as far as we look at the cash flows. Number two, I think we see some ways in which cash can flow through the system more readily, which, presumably, would have value for EMG and for bondholders. And I'm sure that will be a big part of any kind of restructuring conversation with them. Beyond that, it's all the usual stuff. If you could tell me exactly where gas prices are going to be and coal prices, this is a pretty easy equation, but nobody has that. So we have to make those judgments as do the bondholders.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Fremont of Jefferies.","Paul B. Fremont - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I guess the first question that I have, I guess, relates to Midwest Gen. Given the much lower level of output that you saw in the first quarter, do you expect that to translate to the remaining 3 quarters? Or would you look at that more as sort of a one-time event in the first quarter?","W. James Scilacci","Paul, this is Jim. I think with the lower prices, and given the economics, I think we've seen some lower generation generally. Now these are the ramping units for ComEd and it really depends on demand within ComEd. And so we've seen it from a high end. I think in years past, we've been as high as in the low 30 terawatt hours, and we've seen it trend down as prices have come down. And it really just depends on what's happening economically throughout ComEd. But I would wager that generation levels would be lower than historical levels that we've seen. Pedro, would you like to add anything?","Pedro J. Pizarro","Yes. The one thing that I would add is that I agree with what Jim said in terms of the perspective relative to prior years. I think your question also went to did we expect that the first quarter gets reflected in terms of how the units generate throughout the later quarters? I think we had that overlay of probably -- more likely than not that it's lower than in prior years. I would say that in the first quarter, as Jim mentioned earlier, we did have fairly unique things going on simultaneously, some higher planned outages. We had to adjust the effects of weather, including the river temperature-related curtailments. So to the extent that some of those things turn around in terms of the summer months, those unique factors won't be there presumably in the summer that were there in the first quarter. So I think the overall trend of lower than last year makes sense. So it would be good to have Fisk and Crawford, you're going to have to factor in the equation, which would lower generation levels from historical levels, certainly for a full year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Travis Miller of Morningstar.","Travis Miller - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","I wanted to get to the Joliet 6 and Waukegan retrofit decision. What's the key time variable, I suppose the variable and then the timing of that variable, that you need to see to decide that retrofit? And then I guess along those lines, can you meet the Illinois CPS agreement without those units retrofitted?","W. James Scilacci","I think in one of the pages that we have in the deck, it shows the timeframe, Page 34 for those that are on this call. It shows the timeframe under the CPS agreement, where we need to comply. And the Joliet station is further out. And in our plans and what we've talked about, based on what we believe is going to happen with CSAPR and what we believe is going to happen with MATS, we believe that most of the expenditures has got to be completed by the 2015 timeframe in order to comply with both state and federal requirements. So that's the key time area that we'll have the majority of all the decisions made. Now if you look in our disclosures, we try to divide the numbers between the larger units and the smaller units, so we give you visibility in terms of the cost differences between the 2. And we've added some additional information in the deck this quarter so you can break it down by plant, so you can see what the cost would be.","Travis Miller - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Is there any reason that you would go forward with retrofits before 2015 on those 2 units?","W. James Scilacci","Pedro?","Pedro J. Pizarro","Yes. I think our approach all along has been in general to make sure that we are complying with the Illinois standard. And within that, frankly, wait as long as reasonable in order to build more time to test the value of the options. So I think as long as we are complying with the requirements, you'd probably expect us to continue to find -- look for ways to extend that runway.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Frank of Catapult Capital.","David Frank","Ted, my question was pretty much in line with Steve's and it was about trying to gauge your comfort level given all the uncertainties that we face in the future for things like natural gas prices. And so I guess, is the strategy here just to maybe pick something really low? And if you can get an agreement on that, you go ahead? And if not, you don't.","Theodore F. Craver","Yes. Well, that gets into some of the judgments, which I'd probably -- I would probably prefer at this point not to go into those. I think the one other point that I might leave out there is one that I believe I made at the last call. And that is I don't think we really have a lot of interest in having EMG kind of lurch from quarter-to-quarter here. We need to, I think, really understand, is there a viable plan for EMG that allows us to make the retrofits that are economically sensible to make, reduce the debt in the order of $1 billion and have sufficient cash flow to refinance remaining debt. So it's kind of right-size the leverage and make the capital commitments that we need to make under the CPS agreement. We need to see a credible plan for that, and we need to be able to assure ourselves that EMG is viable and able to meet those objectives. Going quarter-to-quarter makes it increasingly difficult to manage the business, manage it effectively and, frankly, I don't think really helps the value for EIX shareholders. So that's really our objective, is to try to get this thing resolved, see a credible plan, take the approach we've done with other parts of this. We work cooperatively, that's always the way we start, and we work cooperatively to figure out if there is, in fact, a path and then make the decisions and move on from there.","Operator","Our next question comes from Angie Storozynski of Macquarie.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Research","I have a question about the utility, believe it or not. Now I'm wondering, given that the rate case decision is getting delayed by so much, how does it impact your CapEx schedule? Because you have ranges of CapEx, even for this year. Should we assume simply that you are spending at the low end of the CapEx range?","W. James Scilacci","Yes. Angie, this is Jim. And I'll let Linda Sullivan jump in here for further detail. We're purposely spending at a lower level because we just don't know what's going to occur. And so that's probably a good assumption. Now historically, when we've gotten delays in receiving GRCs, we watch about capital and O&M. And then so you may see times when you have -- the actual closings can lag with what you would normally expect if you've got the GRC on a timely basis. But it's really over the 3-year period that's important for the plan. And we would have a lower capital spending, and we'd hope to, over time, at least over the 3-year period, catch back up to what we thought was necessary, especially in the distribution area, because that's just spending for reliability. We want to get those dollars spent. That's the care and feeding of the overall system, and you need to get those dollars spent to maintain your overall service reliability levels. Anything else you want to add to it, Linda?","Linda G. Sullivan","I would add, Angie, on the CPC GRC side for the first quarter, we are spending at the 2011 run rate. And then transmissions were about $75 million above where we were last year. And then the special projects are treated differently from a rate case perspective as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from Stephen Byrd of Morgan Stanley.","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just a question on the April 20 cost of capital application. In the application, you proposed an equity ratio of 48%. What was the rationale for not seeking a higher equity ratio, say, in the 52% range? There's been quite a bit of discussion in the state about that level. Just curious as to how you all think about the capital structure question.","W. James Scilacci","Yes. There's a -- it's an art, probably not as much as a science, in terms of how we look at this. Going back just from when we hit the height of the financial crisis, we had access to the capital markets and were able to finance in really the depths of the ugly times. And we feel that given the access to the capital markets that we've enjoyed at the current equity ratio, that's sufficient for current needs. Now that could change dependent upon how we view the overall business. It could change on the amount of debt equivalency that we're facing because of all the contracts we enter into for fuel and purchased power. There could be other factors that I'm not thinking of now. But we have good access to capital markets under reasonable prices. And I think if we were to bump up the equity ratio, that would just add cost per customers that we don't think is a good trade-off.","Operator","Our next question comes from Terran Miller of Cantor Fitzgerald.","Terran Miller","Two quick questions. Jim, on Page 8, when you talked about the potential offset for the $185 million payment, does that mean that EIX will end up with an IOU from EME going forward? Is that how we're supposed to think about that?","W. James Scilacci","How about N-O? That's not going to happen. So Terran, just...","Terran Miller","So it's a forgiveness?","W. James Scilacci","No, no, no. I don't want to be flip on this, because it's real important. You plan and look and see what your taxable income is going to be. And taxable income can change for a lot of different reasons. So you can go up or down at the utility. Edison Capital still has some impact on the overall tax position for the enterprise, so it is constantly and monthly changing. So we gave you a number back at the end of the year. And as a result, as you roll forward in time, some of those numbers now are changing. So we will just give you a view as we see it at the close of every quarter and we'll update it. We won't get into every reason why it changed, but we're just signaling that taxable income can change and can offset some of the actual payment that EMG would normally make.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ashar Khan of Visium.","Ashar Khan","Can I just ask on the slide, why is the AFUDC lower? I thought it would be because CapEx was lower this quarter, but you were saying you're spending at the same level as of last year. Could you just amplify why the $0.03 lower AFUDC is?","W. James Scilacci","Yes, this is Jim. And if I mess it up, I'll give it over to Linda. When you have more short-term debt, the way the calculation works, it lowers your aggregate AFUDC rate, which can lower earnings. I'll have to prove it to you mathematically offline, Ashar, but that's the way it works. We have more short-term debt balances year-over-year that's causing AFUDC earnings to change. So if you want to have a further discussion, why don't we call back later and we can take you through it?","Operator","Our next question comes from Kit Konolige of Konolige Research.","Kit Konolige","Most of my questions have been answered. Quick question. If you have a view on the proposal to allow the inclusion of hydro as a renewable in California, either what you're feeling is about the substance of that proposal or the likelihood of passage.","W. James Scilacci","We'll have Ron Litzinger address that.","Ronald L. Litzinger","If hydro is included as a renewable, that would certainly be a positive for us in meeting the RPS standard and the amount of investment we need to make in transmission. Hydro is also much more flexible and reduces some of the pressure we would have on integration costs. So we would view that as a positive.","W. James Scilacci","So Kit, just your sense for numbers. We were at 21% RPS requirements at the end of 2011 and hydro can go up and down year-after-year because this is probably a low season, last year was a high season. And large hydro was about, what did we say, 6%? In 2010, it was about 6%. So if you have 21% or plus or minus 6%, you're getting up to the high-20s now.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ali Agha of SunTrust.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Ted, just to summarize and make sure I'm understanding the message on EMG, and you've laid out a number of data points from your side. But first off, to be clear, you had previously been talking about having your decision by the summertime this year. And I wanted to confirm that is still the timeline. And then secondly, when you talk about EMG not lurching quarter-to-quarter, being viable, et cetera, should we assume that when all of this is done and assuming you get what you want, et cetera, however we get there, that EMG should be a profitable, i.e. positive earnings contributor, for EIX in the current price environment that we are in? Is that what we should be thinking?","Theodore F. Craver","I think we've typically made the statement that we need to be able to meet the capital requirements, the retrofit capital requirements under the CPS agreement, and more recently, U.S. EPA rules. Number two, that we can delever EMG. We've typically used this number, around $1 billion of debt. And that the subsequent cash flows in the business would allow credit metrics such that we could refinance the remaining debt when it comes due. So those are kind of the key markers, which are not really earnings-related markers, or if anything probably a little more related to EBITDA. But that to us would really spell a stabilized business that's able to meet its obligations and have positive cash flow, which I think ultimately translates into positive earnings. The exact timing on all of those, that's a little harder to predict at this point. But those are the key markers that we've typically laid out there. The conversations that we would have with all the other stakeholders, they're going to come to the table with things that are important to them. But those are the ones that kind of most on our mind.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","SCE, can you refresh us? What is the base FERC-authorized ROE on transmission? What would you describe as your weighted average concerning the incentive that some of your projects have ROE? And when is the next filing or docket process where the base ROE could be up for revision?","W. James Scilacci","Okay. Michael, I'm going to have Linda Sullivan grapple with all those questions.","Linda G. Sullivan","Michael, this is Linda. The base ROE that is currently in rates is 9.96%, and then we add to that the Cal ISO incentive of 50 basis points and the project incentives, where we get into a weighted ROE of 11.1%. That's currently in rates that is subject to refund and settlement procedures. And we are in that process right now.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And what's the docket schedule for the next review of -- or what's a likely docket schedule for the next review of the base level ROE?","Linda G. Sullivan","The next -- well, we're in the current schedule with the settlement procedures, where the next proceeding is expected in the June timeframe.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jay Dobson of Wunderlich Securities.","James L. Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","Ted, I wanted to come back to timing a little bit on EMG. And I guess, as we all remember sort of, I guess, just about 9 months ago, you set that 6- to 12-month timeframe. And as I think you just responded, you're going to be pretty much on track there. As we start and turn the page or maybe turn the chapter to what now is going to be a new timeline, and I know there's as much uncertainty now as there was 9 months ago, how do you see this playing out from a time perspective? I imagine the bondholders on the phone may have their own views of that. But how do you see with the idea that the 2013s in June or so create sort of their own ending, if you will, as far as the process?","Theodore F. Craver","Well, certainly, the maturity in middle of next year is something of a forcing function. But our intent is not to wait until June of next year. So the 6- to 12-month kind of marker that I put out there last summer, I think, still represents pretty much the right timing. So we've been getting more and more information. And as we've gotten that information, we've made some decisions, such as the Fisk and Crawford decisions, which clarify a little bit what some of the CapEx requirements are going to be. In a few weeks here, we'll hear where we are on the capacity prices, which I think will be important when you look at those in the context of last year's auction. So I think we're pretty much on the schedule that I mentioned, and most of the information that's relevant to making important decisions for us, as well as for the bondholders, other stakeholders, I think most of that information is either on the table or about ready to hit the table.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jason Mandel of RBC Capital Markets.","Jason Mandel","Just 2 quick questions. First off, on Capistrano Wind, just so I understand the dollars in and dollars out, there's some timing issues with when money gets paid and gets spent and whether or not there would potentially be any impact to those dollars from a restructuring event at EME. And the second one, just basically on the capacity auction and plants that are being bid in and process-wise, how that works in the event that the capital spending is either not there or doesn't make any sense in the future and basically can't be met.","W. James Scilacci","Well, let me take it in reverse order. This is Jim. And then I'll look over to the EMG folks for a little help on Capistrano numbers. But we'll anticipate bidding in our plants on a normal course, and we're working down that path now. And I'll stop there because I think we gave you the key message. And Maria and Pedro on Capistrano, the ins and outs.","Maria Rigatti","On Capistrano, the investors paid $230 million for the 3 operating projects that have been now become part of Capistrano. Subsequently, there are 2 construction projects that will at COD and conversion from construction financing to term financing be contributed down into Capistrano. At that point in time, there's another $140 million earmarked, which will reimburse CME for any equity contributions. As Jim noted earlier, those projects have been also project-financed, and the debt on those projects will go towards the balance of the construction costs.","Operator","Your next question comes from Angie Storozynski of Macquarie.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Research","I actually had a question about San Onofre. We see some indications that San Onofre 2 is supposed to be back online on June 2 -- well, 1, actually, and then the Unit 3 back on June 12. But I understand that the NRC needs to voice its approval for the units to come back. I mean, could you talk us through the process and how likely this NRC will be comfortable with the solutions that you're presenting them with?","W. James Scilacci","Angie, we're going to have Ron take you through that.","Ronald L. Litzinger","I believe you're looking at what we've posted with the California ISO on the returns to service. And we update that periodically. We are currently, as Ted mentioned, evaluating the causal analysis and where we might go with the -- responding to the Confirmatory Action Letter. But we will likely update those numbers within the next couple of weeks with CAISO that are officially posted.","Operator","Our next question comes from Terran Miller of Cantor Fitzgerald.","Terran Miller","Second question is, Jim, EM -- Capistrano, does that sit at EMG? Or does that sit at EME? And second question is the $98 million of proceeds from the project financing, is that cash available to EME? Or does that go with the project? It sounds like in the last time, it goes with the project to complete the project.","W. James Scilacci","On the latter one, yes. Maria?","Maria Rigatti","In terms of the ownership structure?","W. James Scilacci","Yes.","Maria Rigatti","So Capistrano is indirectly owned by EME.","Terran Miller","Indirectly owned by EME.","Maria Rigatti","Correct.","Operator","Our next question comes from [indiscernible] of JPMorgan.","Unknown Analyst","So the 2013 notes mature obviously a year from now, but the Midwest Gen credit facility expires next month. What are your plans with regard to that?","W. James Scilacci","The Midwest Gen revolver, we've said in the disclosures that, in fact, there is hardly any usage on it, and it will likely just expire on time. And so we have plenty of cash currently at this time at EME, and we'll use that cash really to take care of our working capital requirements. And we don't at this point in time have a plan in place to put any kind of replacement revolver. And part of the big picture here is working to figure out how we're to work with the bondholders before we have the maturity that coming up. Now the disclosures do show that we have -- thank you, Scott -- an LC facility in place, a cash-collateralized LC facility, to take care of some of the requirements we have with the things that go on, admission, to back up the trading shop, and other requirements. And then we've disclosed that in terms of the usage in our current quarterly report.","Operator","The last question comes from Raymond Leung of Goldman Sachs.","Raymond M. Leung - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just following up on -- just questions about flowing of cash. But related to Walnut Creek, have you guys made the entire equity contribution? If not, how much more do you need to put out there and over what timeframe?","W. James Scilacci","Yes. The equity went in first, and now we're drawing down on the facility to cover the construction expenditures, Ray.","Raymond M. Leung - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. So you're done funding that. That wouldn't be another cash drain.","W. James Scilacci","Correct.","Operator","That is the last question. And I will now turn the call back to you, Mr. Cunningham.

My name is Brian and I'll be your operator today. (Operator Instructions).","Today's call is being recorded and I would now like to turn call over to Mr. Scott Cunningham, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you, sir.","Scott Cunningham","Thanks, Brian, and good afternoon everyone. Our principal speakers today will be Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Ted Craver and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Jim Scilacci. Also with us are other members of the management team.","The presentation that accompanies Jim's comments, the earnings press release and our Form 10-Q are available on our website at www.edisoninvestor.com. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements about the financial outlook for Edison International and its subsidiaries and about other future events.","Actual results could differ materially from current expectations. Important factors that could cause different results are set forth in our SEC filings. We encourage you to read these carefully. The presentation includes certain outlook assumptions, as well as reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the nearest GAAP measure. When we get to Q&A, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. If you have further questions, please return to the queue.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Ted Craver.","Ted Craver","Thank you, Scott, and good afternoon everyone. Today Edison International reported solid first quarter results. Core earnings were $0.90 per share, up 17% over last year. These results are consistent with our full year earnings guidance, which we also reaffirmed today. Jim Scilacci will cover this in more detail in his remarks.","In the last few months, we made good strides in resolving the two major uncertainties for investors Edison Mission Energy and San Onofre. I'll touch on both starting with the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station.","On March 27, a settlement agreement was reached on all of the issues in the cost recovery proceeding before the California Public Utilities Commission related to the shutdown of SONGS.","This comprehensive settlement was formerly submitted to the CPUC on April 3. The original signatories included the two principal's owners of SONGS; Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas and Electric and the two largest and most active consumer advocacy organizations in the State on utility matters.","These are the California Public Utilities Commissions, Office of Ratepayer Advocates and the utility reform network. Since that announcement, two additional groups have joined the settlement. The first is; Friends of the Earth, a prominent environmental group and the most active advocate for closing SONGS in the Nuclear Regulatory Commission Proceedings.","The second; is the Coalition of California Utility Employees. The only organized labor group intervenient in the SONGS OII. As a result, the settlement is supported by representatives from four key constituencies. The consumers, environmentalist, labor and the owners. All of the parties have agreed to work to obtain timely consideration and approval of the settlement by the CPUC.","On April 14, the settling parties held a series of briefings on the settlement for CPUC representatives. On April 24, the Administrative Law Judge for the SONGS OII published a schedule to review the settlement. The ruling plans one evidentiary hearing in mid-may and a public participation hearing in early June.","The CPUC will receive written comments from the other parties to the proceeding on May 5, with reply briefs due on May 27. While the ruling does not have a proposed decision date. This timeline could accommodate a proposed and final decision this summer; although we can't predict the timing of any decision.","The ruling notes that only two objections to the settlement have been served. One from an individual and one from an anti-nuclear group. The strong support for the settlement and minimal opposition, the settling parties continue to encourage prompt approval.","As we discussed, during our March 27 investor call when we announced the settlement. Most refunds related to the settlement will be credited against the current under collections in SEC's fuel and purchased power balancing account known as \"ERRA\". A favorable decision on the settlement and timely CPUC decisions on the 2014 and 2015 ERRA forecast proceedings should substantially reduce the under-collections by the end of next year.","The March 25 proposed decision on the 2014 ERRA forecast proceeding is consistent with this outcome and on April 1, FCE received a proposed decision that would grant it's request to accelerate the timeframe for filing its 2015 ERRA forecast proceeding. This would allow SEC to complete its 2015 ERRA proceeding. Well before year end and implement it in rates next year.","These are constructive developments and we are hopeful that both will be approved by the CPUC at their May 1, meeting. While these developments are not material to earnings, they are important to FCE liquidity. Let me move to Edison Mission Energy; EME's bankruptcy has now been completed with the sale of substantially all of EME's assets to NRG Energy.","On April 1, we closed on the settlement agreement transaction with EME's note holders. EME remains a subsidiary of Edison International free of bankruptcy claims and consolidated for tax purposes. We made the first of three scheduled payments for $225 million to a newly established trust on April 1.","The remaining payments are due in September, 2015 and September, 2016. The exact amounts of these last two payments will be finalized once EME's tax attributes currently estimated to be $1.2 billion are finally determined. This work will be concluded in the next several months.","As we move beyond these uncertainties, we continue to make progress on our 2015 general rate case. The schedule adopted by the CPUC calls for public participation hearings in late May, early June evidentiary hearings in July and August and the hearing record being completed in October.","Well no date has been set for a proposed decision. We intend to meet all of the FCE deadlines to support a timely decision, although we can't predict that there will be one by the end of the year. The significant progress made in resolving SONGS and EME should allow investors to focus on Edison International's long-term earnings and dividend growth. We see forecasted capital investment producing a 7% to 9% compound annual growth rate and FCE's rate base through 2017.","Beyond 2017, we see the need for annual capital expenditures in electric infrastructure to support reliability at level similar to those we are proposing in our 2015 GRC. A central tenet of our strategy is that we should lead in modernizing the distribution system. Building this next generation grid require significant technical know-how and capital investment.","This is something Edison is particularly well positioned to do. The foundation of our investment case is the strong growth prospects for SCE. We also recognized the need to have a strategic eye on the transformative changes occurring in our industry that extend even beyond California. With this in mind, we are selectively pursuing other growth initiatives both with SCE and in competitive businesses.","The last several years of investment has built a rate base that is now generating substantial earnings and cash flows. We believe this additional cash will support both strong future growth and larger dividend increases. I have said before and reiterate here, that we plan to return in steps overtime to our target of paying out 45% to 55% of FCE's earnings in dividends.","Finally, to help achieve our mission of providing safe, reliable and affordable electric service to our customers. We need to increase our focus on rate design and operational excellence. We improved rate design called for with the passage of Assembly Bill 327 is central to managing rates and customer satisfaction in a period, when critical infrastructure improvements have to been undertaken.","In the same vein, to be a best-in-class utility. We must continuously identify new cost efficiencies. The principal metrics we are using to guide our efforts to achieve affordable electric service for our customers are system average rates, operation and maintenance cost per customer and unit energy cost per megawatt hour.","Using these high level metrics, we are able to create a range of initiatives to improve efficiency. The more SCE can provide customers with the benefits of these productivity improvements. The more we can maintain reliability and keep rates reasonable and also deliver on our growth opportunities. With that, let me now turn the call over to Jim Scilacci.","Jim Scilacci","Thanks, Ted and good afternoon everyone. I'll cover the following topics; first quarter earnings, an update on the SONGS settlements and our fuel and purchased power inter-collection. Then I'll rate base in 2014 earnings guidance.","Please turn to Page 2 of the presentation. As Ted just said first quarter core earnings are $0.90 per share. The higher earnings reflect rate base growth in lower O&M. there are also additional income tax benefits during the first quarter primarily from higher repair deductions. The overall impact of SONGS was a net $0.02 per share.","For Q1, 2013 earnings for SONGS were lower than normal because of higher than authorized O&M cost and refunds recorded in our SONGS balancing accounts. At the holding company, first quarter cost of $0.03 per share consistent with our full year guidance. With the year-over-year comparison impacted by tax benefits in last year's first quarter.","There are two non-core items in the first quarter of 2014. The first is the additional SONGS impairment, which is $0.29 per share. This is slightly lower than our original estimate of $0.31. I'll explain the reason for the difference in a moment. The second is $0.07 in cost related to the EME bankruptcy.","Please note that, that since EME bankruptcy was concluded on April 1, the income from the settlement will be recorded as non-core in the second quarter. We also re-affirm our belief that the settlement will yield approximately $200 million of net benefits with a little more than $115 million expected in the second quarter.","Please turn to Page 3, on our March 27, call announcing the settlement. We increased SONGS charges to $730 million pre-tax and the $465 million after tax. We have updated the charges that are included in our first quarter results with total pre-tax charge of $806 million and $461 million after taxes.","There are number of items that were updated and are detailed in Page 16 of the Investor presentation appendix. The largest change is from an item that only affected pre-tax income and not after tax income. This is a refund of revenue from SONGS prepared deductions and other tax items that are flow through items for income tax purposes.","SCE will ultimately recovery these revenues from customers, when these deferred taxes are paid to the IRS. This is the primary reason why the pre-tax impairment went up, while the after tax impairment didn't change that much. The charge of $0.29 recorded in the first quarter does not impact the estimated ongoing income benefit from a settlement of $0.03 per share in 2014 and which will be recorded after the settlement was adopted by the CPUC.","More information on the regulatory asset accounting is provided in the appendix. The appendix also includes a settlement overview and a new slide that lays up this sharing mechanics between shareholders and customers of any future recoveries from either MHI or NEIL. There is nothing significant to record on either MHI or NEIL.","Please turn to Slide 4. Slide 4 is the year of recovery chart that we showed on our March 27, call. This chart depicts the SONGS settlement refunds and increase in fuel and purchased power rates and distribution from the SONGS Nuclear Decommissiong Trust that would materially reduce the ERRA inter-collection by the end of this year.","Please turn to Page 5. Page 5, is the updated ERRA recovery chart because of higher natural gas and market prices impacting both the March 31, actuals and our April to May forecast our projection of the ERRA inter-collection through May 31, has increased by $185 million to just over $1.6 billion.","The expected distribution from the SONGS Nuclear Decommissiong Trust have not changed. The estimate of the settlement refunds has increased by approximately $95 million to $575 million. There are number of items that increased to refund but the most significant is the refund of flow through tax benefits I mentioned earlier.","The last item is the impact on our 2014 ERRA filing on the inter-collection. On Thursday as Ted said at this week, we expect the CPUC to approve our amended 2014 ERRA obligation because of the increase in natural gas [forwards] and market prices not included in our filings.","A reduction in the inter-collection is expected to be substantially less to what we've previously showed. As we all know, natural gas in power markets have been quite volatile this winter and prices are now off their peaks. Therefore the ultimate inter-collection of fuel and purchased power at year end 2014 is highly expected but likely to be higher than what we showed on March 27.","In late May, SCE will file its 2015 ERRA obligation and at that time we will provide a revised ERRA forecast for year-end 2014 and 2015. On Page 6 and 7, we have reaffirmed our capital spending and rate base forecast through 2017. As Ted said, this includes the 7% to 9% compound annual growth rates. A rate base through 2017.","I would note two things; first our actual capital spending for the first quarter was $684 million below the full-year trend line. However, we expect the full year spend to come in within the range provided. Second; our forecast largely reflects the scope of work included in the 2013, 2014 California ISO Transmission Plan recently approved by its Board of Directors that plan does include additional investment in SCE service territory that will be made in 2018 and beyond.","Additionally, the California ISO deferred action on the proposed Delaney-Colorado River Project which would be a competitive project under the new FERC rules and one that we would be interested in pursuing if the project is economic.","On Page 8, we've highlighted key elements of our capital spending and rate based growth from transmission and distribution investments from testing our liability as well as meeting California renewable goals.","On Page 9, we have reaffirmed our core earnings guidance of $3.16 to $3.80 per share and updated our GAAP guidance to reflect actual non-core items recorded in the first quarter. We continue to exclude future non-core items for guidance. Our key earnings assumptions are unchanged.","Although, we don't provide quarterly earnings guidance. I do want to remind everyone that when we use this simplified earnings model as a starting point for earnings guidance. SCE's operating expenses are generally recognized more evenly throughout the year, while revenues are more weighted to the third quarter.","I'll close on Slide 10 by reiterating, what we believe our shareholder value commission model is an attractive one. We worked through our major uncertainties as Ted said and in the case of SONGS created alignment between customers and shareholders to aggressively seek recoveries from MHI and NEIL.","We have reaffirmed our growth opportunity through T&D focused investment program complimented by decoupled business model that mitigates the impacts of fluctuating energy sales. Lastly, our total return prospects are supported by our significant dividend growth opportunity.","In short we believe we're executing on our commitments to our shareholders and we will continue to do so. Okay, operator. Let's move to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) first question from Michael Weinstein, UBS. Your line is open.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS Investment Bank","Hi, good afternoon. It's Julian here. First quick question, if you can just following up on the transmission side of the equation. I'd be curious to the extent to which the State is pursuing broader solicitations beyond just the Delaney one. Could you comment to the extent to which that, your CapEx budget is exposed to that, the near and long-term and also to the extent to which you're interested in pursuing other projects that are within the State?","Jim Scilacci","Okay, let me start with that one and I'll have others to fill in. I don't really think it's going to affect our capital budgets that we've shown publically which goes out through 2017. Beyond 2017, there could be some implications and I will suggest that we having interest if not through Southern California Edison through the competitive side of the business to participate in transmission projects outside the Southern California Edison service territory, so there is potential if we lose at SCE, they may be able to pick it up through the competitive side of the business, but that's still very premature.","Do you want to follow-up?","Julien Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS Investment Bank","Yes, on a separate topic, I don't know if anything left there. But just again going back to ERRA liquidity just from a high level here just to make sure I'm hearing you correctly. At the end of the day, despite some of the impacts that higher power prices might be having on your liquidity and ERRA balancing accounts. Ultimately, your rate base and CapEx plan is intact and obviously has been shifted but I just want to make sure I'm hearing you, with respect to your current spending versus plan two.","Jim Scilacci","For us, it's has not changed.","Operator","Next question. Daniel Eggers, Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Daniel Eggers \u2013 Credit Suisse","Can you just updating investment talk about extending bonus depreciation and some talk recently about a permanent decision on bonus depreciation, what affect would that have A; on cash flow and B; on the agreement you have with the EME bankruptcy as with the estate as far as your ability to monetize those tax attributes?","Jim Scilacci","You're probably seeing, Dan, it's Jim. You're probably seeing the same things we have from the Senate side proposal to extend bonus depreciation at 50% for two years. As it been here last several years, 50% bonus depreciation is a tremendous source of cash for the utility given the large amount of its capital budget running at $4 billion a year.","I can't give you number off the top of my head, but its meaningful. So in effect what happens is, that cash would be available to Southern California Edison and since it would cover both 2014 potentially it's retroactive and looking forward prospectively 2015, that's a little hard to say what the impact would be on 2015 because right now it's not contemplated in our general rate case filing with the [tax] here is 2015.","So we may have to update the filing, if that were the case. So it's harder to say what the impact would be on 2015 cash flow because it could be updated through the making process. Flipping over the other side of the equation, Edison International and the impact on the settlement. It would likely be that Southern California Edison had 50% bonus level would be in an NOL position or would be utilizing all the tax benefits available with the 50% bonus.","Therefore, the NOLs that sit at EIX that our EIX loans or EME's would sit there and wait for future timeframe when we could actually monetize those and we're talking Federal Tax benefits here because as you recall, the State of California does not recognize bonus depreciation.","So there are tax benefit that can be utilized for State Tax purposes that may not be able to being utilized for Federal Tax purposes. So I would suggest roughly if there's a 2-year extension of bonus. It could in effect backup the monetization probably 1.5 years to 2 years.","Daniel Eggers \u2013 Credit Suisse","That means you have the fund the payments to the State via other means until the money is available to be procured from the EIX tax up, is that right?","Jim Scilacci","Right, so we've got our revolvers shooting up EIX that we use to fund requirements and we would look to use our revolvers with some other type of similar facility for a 1 year to 2 year, if that's going to be delayed to 2 years.","Operator","Next question. Hugh Wynne, Sanford Bernstein. Your line is open.","Hugh Wynne \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","So I was wondering, if I could I could trouble you though walk us through Chart 21 and comment a little bit about old residential rate design OIR, what is the discount that [indiscernible]?","Jim Scilacci","Okay, so Page 21, it's the residential rate design. OIR page in the deck for those who are on the phone. I'll start then hand it over to Ron. The chart here depicts what currently, we have in place is the four-tier structure and the price of each tier goes up, as you step up through the tiers. So the highest tier being approximately $0.32, a kilowatt hour as you're using those incremental kilowatts and we have proposed through the rate design proceeding to reduce the tier's down to two tier's ultimately and also increasing the fixed charge which is currently $0.94 a month to $10 and that's currently working its way through the PUC and I'll stop there and throw it over Ron, add detail here.","Ron Litzinger","Right, what Jim was describing as what's referred as the phase one of the proceeding which will be ongoing throughout the year. We expect the decision either late in the year or early next to be implemented in time for summer 2015. We will step down the tiers overtime. We expect to get the two tiers by 2017. We will increase the fix charge over a 3-year period and what that will enable us to do is reduce the differential between our highest tier and our lowest tier to arrange that we're targeting.","So that's really the long-term. In the short-term, for this summer which is referred to as Phase II, don't ask me why Phase II comes before Phase I but we've reached settlement with the consumer advocates there. The Commission had given us direction to stay within the four tier arrangement. So the way we are getting the upper tier rates down in relation to the lower tier's, is we are putting the majority of the rate increase into tiers I and II, that's the 12% and the 17%, we are showing on the slide, that keeps the rate increases in tier's III and IV much smaller, they'll be set residually that we are currently estimating about 2% to 5%.","So that will help shrink the upper tier to lower tier differential, which is really our long-term, our overall goal to take that cross subsidy out between higher used customers and the lower used customers.","Hugh Wynne \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","Okay and the fee you're phasing for the fixed charge. I assume you're talking I'm sorry, $15, $16, $17 is that right?","Ron Litzinger","Yes, $15, $16, $17, $5, $7.50, $10.","Hugh Wynne \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","And the reason for the $10 long-term target. I'm sure that's maturely below the sort of fixed cost of supply to the customer, is there are reason that you chose $10?","Ron Litzinger","That's what the legislation dictated was $10.","Hugh Wynne \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","That's the maximum that you can request?","Ron Litzinger","That's correct.","Jim Scilacci","I think we've said publically, that the process service is probably closer to nearly $30.","Ted Carver","Nearly, $30 right.","Hugh Wynne \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","The fixed portion of the cost of service, is that what you mean it?","Jim Scilacci","Yes.","Operator","Next question. Gregg Orrill, Barclays. Your line is open.","Gregg Orrill \u2013 Barclays Capital","Just two quick ones. First on quarterly drivers, if you could break out the tax impact of repair taxes versus other and then just back to Slide 20. The 33% reserve margin and how that impacts you thinking in ERRA or otherwise?","Jim Scilacci","Okay, so maybe we can reverse the order and talk about the reserve margin. So this is the current situation state and now how are the effects. You can tell by the numbers that 33% reserve margin is a quite a bit capacity and energy within the state to meet the needs for this year. There are some local issues that we have; we have done a lot of work in South Orange County to relieve both of these issues.","And there are some other related in pass up in the San Joaquin Valley where we have been working on a transmission project seems like forever and we are delayed right now and hopefully with the \u2013 we can get that resolved, but the drought is impacted some regional areas up that.","So this is incorporated in our current forecast and I guess one other thing, I should point out Gregg, that when you think about the drought there in California. We've got about 1,000 megawatts of hydro in our system. Clearly, the capacity of hydro system will be down this year, but what this chart was trying to show that we are heavily dependent on the Pacific Northwest and they are much closer to normal there as opposed to what happened here in California.","So if we looked to the Northwest that is the critical factor and of course, we've got the Pacific intertie set up lines quite a bit of power from a Pacific Northwest to the Southern California, well that's the point of this chart here.","I'll pause for a second and let you follow-up on, if we cover the question on related to ERRA.","Gregg Orrill \u2013 Barclays Capital","No, I think you did that's fine.","Jim Scilacci","Okay, so on the earnings related to the pieces for taxes. Mark, do you have anything there?","Mark Clarke","So on the pre-tax impact on for the quarter was $231 million. The tax component of that is $135 million, so the after tax was $96 million and then the 10-Q has some additional details in it, on what the amounts are in the effective tax rate [indiscernible].","Gregg Orrill \u2013 Barclays Capital","Okay, but the other outside of the pair. The other items were, are they general category that they were related to?","Mark Clarke","The flow through items for the quarter were all property related majority relates to repairs and so our effective tax rate, when you set aside the SONGS non-core item was very similar to first quarter of last year, which is around 25%, 26%.","Gregg Orrill \u2013 Barclays Capital","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Next question. Michael Lapides, Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Ted, I want to just touch base on the comments you made about potential investment both looking for avenues or opportunities for growth within the utility but also outside of the utility? Can you talk about some of those in both categories, maybe starting with ones outside of the utility that you're likely to look at going forward and then some if there are non-traditional ones within the utility touch on those as well, please?","Ted Craver","Yes, just probably at a high level at this point but we've mentioned before the acquisition that we made a while back of SoCore, the rooftop solar generation company and that's really the starting point for a platform focused on providing integrated energy services to commercial and industrial customers and that would be largely aimed outside of the SCE territory.","We also are looking selectively at some projects that would involve electric transportation and potentially some water reclamation, water treatment activities. Where there is a strong nexus between electricity usage and water quality. Inside the utility, the pieces that we've mostly focused on are really things that further public policy initiatives within the State.","So for instance, that California ISO along with some other State agencies have clearly identified a set of 'Preferred resources' that would be used for dealing with some of dislocations with San Onofre going out. So these are things like distributed generation, storage, energy efficiency, demand response.","So we are looking at some pilot projects that would provide referred resources particularly in the areas most affected by San Onofre going out. And that would be additional growth opportunity within the utility. The State has a mandate on energy storage 1,300 megawatts across the State. Our share of that is a little less than 600 megawatts within SCE and half of that can be actually owned and put in rate based by the utility.","So we are looking at those opportunities that would really ducktail with our modernizing the distribution system efforts. Community solars and other areas where that actually might be a combination of growth opportunities both within the utility and outside of the utility. So those are some of the high level areas.","I think our approach is pretty well on this Michael. We prefer not to go out and ballyhoo all kind of nifty ideas before we really had a chance to kind of run them to ground and really have a more factual rendition of what those growth opportunities would be. So this point, we are looking at number of things.","We think there are some good opportunities and as I said in my comments. It's important to have a strategic eye on, where some of these transformational changes might take place to both within California and outside and those can represent some decent growth opportunities.","Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs","How do you think about kind of [bogie] or the metric you would use between allocating capital to non-utility investments versus allocating more capital back to your shareholders including potentially revising upward the dividend payout ratio target that we are seeing a couple of other companies in the industry kind of go through the same thing, you have big CapEx periods, been a little of a slowing and a target payout ratio that keeps getting bumped up multiple times over a several year period.","Ted Craver","Well I think very long-term, if in fact we have good growth opportunities that's really what will provide sustained earnings growth and sustained earnings growth ultimately circles back to providing sustained dividend growth. So it's the usual balancing acted every company has to go through.","We see some very good opportunities both within California and potentially outside to operating solid sustained earnings growth rate. So we will look at each of those and it meets the hurdle requirement and we can see something that's really durable not just kind of one-off stuff or things that really are more distractions than sustained growth opportunities, we will look at those and invest accordingly.","The reason I keep coming back to the statement, time and time again that we intend to return to our targeted payout ratio 45% to 55%, which I think is roughly correct for a company that has the level of growth that we have been experiencing for the last several years.","So first step is to get ourselves back to that targeted payout ratio. Today, we're somewhere in the neighborhood of 35%, the payout ratio. Our target is 45% to 55%. So in order to get there, that suggests you have to have dividend increases that are a higher rate than what your earnings growth rate is and as we've said, we intend to do that in steps overtime.","Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Got it, thank you. Ted. Much appreciated.","Ted Craver","You're welcome. Thanks for the good questions."," Jim Scilacci","And Michael just one additional thought just from a rate making perspective. We have a holding company decision that we must give first priority to the utility when allocating capital, but there is plenty of capital to go around that's hasn\u2019t been a factor for sometime but we must live under that requirement.","Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Understood, thank you Jim. Much appreciated.","Operator","Next question. Angie Storozynski with Macquarie. Your line is open.","Angie Storozynski \u2013 Macquarie Research","So I wanted to go back to this question about the statement about the 33% reserve margin despite the retirement of SONGS. So I know that this is on 2014, but does it mean that you think that you can meet the reliable needs of your service territory without actually signing PT's and your gas plans to replace to the [nuke] and purely throw some transformation upgrades and managing efficiency another non-generation methods?","Jim Scilacci","Well, there's Angie, it's Jim. Ron and you jump over and then Ron can probably give you a full answer on this here, but the fact is we've got a lot of energy in this state of times, but may not be in the right place and we need to have voltage in the right places too and to in order need combination a lot of things.","So we're going to need to meet the 33% renewable requirements. We have the storage requirements and we are going to have, the Commission has recently decided preferred resources to replace SONGS that includes Natural Gas powered generation and we have one through cooling plants going out at the end of the decade.","A certain portion of that is going to need to be replaced with new generation. So there is a whole host of things that need to be done here and coordinated to get it right and I'll pause here and look to Ron or [Stu] to add detail.","Ron Litzinger","I think it largely captured, Jim this is Ron. In the short-term, we've been focused on transmission upgrades to deal with local constraints in remediate term there is a long-term procurement decision out that identifies local generation resources that are required in the LA basin for both SONGS and eventually the ones through cooling units going away and you know at a very high level there are targets of what we are going to achieve with preferred resources that we've been talking about, the energy storage, distributed generation, energy efficiency but the balance or the bulk of it.","And [Stu] probably has the precise number will be solicitations that we do for natural gas fired powered plants. Our desires within the basin to reduce the amount of transmission we need to do.","Angie Storozynski \u2013 Macquarie Research","Thank you and separately about the SCE's rate base growth, the 7% to 9% key growth. How does it translate into earnings growth meaning, should I anticipate that there is a possibility for earnings to grow faster than the rate base? Thanks to for instance some efficiencies on the PAN side of another reasons.","Jim Scilacci","So, Angie it's Jim. It should imply that if we are earning off for as return, that rate base growth should be coming pretty close to earnings growth and what can affect that upper-down is the level of short-term debt. You might have in the capital within -- you maybe carrying at any particular time because that's in effect at UDC earnings, but we typically don't carry a lot of short-term debt unless, we are bridge funding over a certain period.","Now clearly tax benefits for our O&M savings have the capacity to enhance your earnings over and above your authorized return. We are not forecasting anything and what we have right now is being given up as part of the test year of the 2015 GRC and we would look to continue to seek efficiencies wherever we can and drive our cost down.","So we are targeting to, want to get our cost metrics more in line with second to first quartile performance and we are not there yet. So there is the possibility for additional savings, we just have to fund it. So that, I'll pause. If you want to follow-up, how about that?","Angie Storozynski \u2013 Macquarie Research","No, I'm all set. Thank you.","Operator","Next question. Jonathan Arnold, Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Jonathan Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Just curious and you've talked about this before, you've said in the past on the topic of going to distributed generation in the speaking the residential sector, that you'll focus more on upgrading the grid in California to the level, what will be needed as you see that thing out and is there some kind of structural impediment to you considering participating in that business some point in the future? Maybe you need to sort of have the rate design issues sort it out, especially those you know to address.","I guess, planned as to your satisfaction. Is there any side of business that we could ever see you sort of deciding to competing on your own territory?","Ted Craver","Jonathan, it's Ted. I'll take a crack in answering that. I think generally, our sense is been the residential rooftop solar business models really largely requires subsidies and kind of cost shifting mechanisms to really be viable that is not been as appealing to us. As a result, we've really focused more on the commercials and industrial distributed generation activities.","I think for the foreseeable future. We would not really look to try to put residential rooftop solar into owned that, put it into our rate base. Outside of the utility we do participate in couple of funds that really are companies that provide funds for doing both residential rooftop solar but that's a fairly indirect and small involvement in our part.","So really the way we see it is, our primary strategy is provide the network, provide the backbone through a modern distribution system that really facilitates any and all of these distributed resources. Whether that's rooftop solar or whether its storage and anything else. That's the part that we are uniquely positioned to do well and that's really where our investment dollars are focused in the utility.","Operator","Next question. Brian Chin, Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","John Apgar \u2013 Merrill Lynch","I just had a follow-up question on the income tax repair deduction for the quarter.","Jim Scilacci","John, can you speak up a little bit?","John Apgar \u2013 Merrill Lynch","Yes, I have a follow-up question on the income tax repair deduction for the quarter. I don't think you quantify that but it's $0.14 for the entire year was that mostly recognized in 1Q or how should we think about the timing of that recognition?","Jim Scilacci","We are scratching our head here. You mean along the guidance, right. Yes, I'm sorry that was included in our guidance. I think we will have to take a closer look at that, we will come back to you on that.","John Apgar \u2013 Merrill Lynch","Okay because it looks based on the quarter it looks there was a decent amount of property related tax gains for the quarter and I didn't know how much of that was the associated with that $0.14 that you laid out in guidance because it was $0.16 according to quarter and I'm not sure if most of that was recognized during the quarter.","Jim Scilacci","We are going to have to follow back.","John Apgar \u2013 Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thank you.","Jim Scilacci","Thanks for the question. You stumped us.","Operator","Next question. Ashar Khan. Begin, your line is open.","Ashar Khan","My question has been answered. Thank you.","Operator","Next question. Kit Konolige \u2013 BGC. Your line is open.","Kit Konolige \u2013 BGC Partners, Inc","On Jim to follow-up on your comments that nothing new recovery from MHI or NEIL. I see on Slide 18, it seems to indicate that NEIL might have communication about recovery in the second quarter, but maybe not is that sometime around the second quarter?","Jim Scilacci","That's our best estimate from what we've heard thus far.","Kit Konolige \u2013 BGC Partners, Inc","Okay and \u2013 what's your thinking on when the arbitration with MHI might run its course?","Jim Scilacci","It will take some time, Kit. We've said previously that we would expect the process to take up to three years. So we are just really getting into it now and unfortunately we can't give you a lot of details regarding the status of the arbitration. So its early on and we've got a lot of steps to go down the past.","So I think you should probably just keeping asking us, but there is not a lot we can give you, given the confidentiality around it.","Kit Konolige \u2013 BGC Partners, Inc","It doesn't sound like I have to ask every week though.","Jim Scilacci","Please don't.","Kit Konolige \u2013 BGC Partners, Inc","Right, I won't and one other area on energy storage. Ted, you addressed that as sort of overview. The first procurement is done in December, 2014 but it looks like most of that is already in existence. When would we start seeing significant amounts of energy storage that would indicate whether Edison is going to be the one investing in energy storage?","Ted Craver","We are going to need to file an application in order to incorporate our plans for energy storage besides the ones that were shown on Page 22, at the investor deck. So it will be public and very obvious in terms of what our plans are and it's going to be wider.","Now I wouldn't expect it to be until later this year and probably first starting next year. Ron, do you want to follow-up.","Ron Litzinger","The only other opportunity for storage is within the preferred resource pilot storage is an option there, where you may see some movement as well.","Operator","Next question. Ali Agha \u2013 SunTrust. Your line is open.","Ali Agha \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc","First question, what is \u2013 at the end of the quarter what was for regulatory purpose calculation, what was the equity ratio at the utility?","Jim Scilacci","It's almost right on top of 48%, 48.9%.","Ali Agha \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc","Sorry?","Unidentified Company Representative","48.9%.","Ali Agha \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc","48.9%, okay and second question, Ted you know historically the company, the board has used December as the time period to make changes to the dividend. As we look forward, then your plans to catch up over the next several years or next few years. Should we continue to think of December as the time period for that? I mean is there any reason why it could not be during the course of the year.","How should we be thinking about this going forward?","Ted Craver","Well, obviously you're right. December is typically one we've made dividend decision but that's just choice of ours that's not anything that's hardwired. So I think, I would basically say at any point in time based on what we see as the prospects for cash. We would have the ability to address the dividend and there is not in there, it has to be in December or annually, but I think at this point.","I would just say, our primary focus right now is trying to make sure that we have complete the bits necessary to finish the EME settlement implementation and obviously I'll be focused on getting the San Onofre settlement approved, those are the key parts that we are focused on right at the moment.","Ali Agha \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc","Understood, thank you.","Operator","Next question. Neel Mitra, Tudor, Pickering. Your line is open.","Neel Mitra \u2013 Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co","I just wanted to touch on the opportunities surrounding competitive transmission outside every service territory. Where do you see those opportunities and when you think about investing in those would you partner with an incumbent utility or do you see yourself positioned to win some of those projects by yourself?","Ted Carver","This is Ted. It is one of those potential growth areas, it's a reality that the FERC Order 1000 there is going to be a change in the way many of the transmission projects both within the State and outside get billed. I would say, really at this point all the above is possible.","What we have observed is that, most of the transmission projects that are being bid on competitively involves some level of partnership activity. There is some good reasons for that and I would suspect that would be certainly one of the strong options open to us, but it is an active area of enquiry and we are interested in pursuing additional projects on the competitive transmission side, if they make sense and clear the return, how it is.","Neel Mitra \u2013 Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co","Can you comment just geographically, where you see some of those opportunities within California?","Ted Carver","I'd rather not get highly specific but the Cal ISO identified particular projects they're going to be looking at and so those are potential opportunities and some cases, it will make the most sense for us to do those as we've always done them with Southern California Edison participating directly.","And in other cases, it might make more sense to do those through so-called competitive transmission vehicle.","Neel Mitra \u2013 Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co","Would you out of State or just within California?","Ted Carver","I think we would look, it\u2019s a core competency that we have and we would look at projects again, so long as we are confident, they can be done for the right kind of risk reward trade-offs and that would clear out return hurdles.","Operator","Travis Miller. Your line is now open.","Travis Miller \u2013 Morningstar","Wanted to go back to the CapEx forecast. I heard correctly the 2018 and beyond you're looking at that same kind of run rate at that $4 billion, is that correct?","Jim Scilacci","Again, Travis this is Jim. We haven't put any forecast out in the domain that we could give you a firm number but directionally, the distribution spending we don't expect will decline and we are trying to get our replacement rates for various components. We need to get them up higher than where we are today and that would imply that distribution spending could go up, somewhat.","Expect with it, to try to put a number out there. What the transmission side of the equation would be because those are typically large and bulky investments. There is to be certain layer of maintenance CapEx for transmission investments that will be steady state and it will go up and down, if you have some new expenditures, you need to do it for lines or facilities, sub-stations.","On the generation side, we just have some minimal legacy investments and the only, only thing we can't predict here today and I think Ted has already focused on those, is walking in the way of either of storage or preferred resources or related investments might due to the overall numbers.","I don't think sitting here today, we can tell you what that's going to be because we are just looking at it now and it's something that we will have to evaluate and we won't put out a forecast beyond 2017 and so that's probably well over year from now or if not longer, so it's going to be awhile before we actually get into the public domain and what our thinking's are for that?","Travis Miller \u2013 Morningstar","Okay and then at these levels, if you have the GRC accepted as you proposed similar level. How do you think about needs for new equity and timing on that?","Jim Scilacci","Again, this is Jim. We have no plans for equity and what's helpful is the EME settlement provides earnings up to $200 million of additional income and things like bonus depreciation is a tremendous source of cash for the utility, should Congress decided to want to extend it and the President actually execute something here.","Well there's just a tremendous amount of cash involved bonus depreciation, when you have a $4 billion of \u2013 around that level of capital expenditures. So we don't foresee any need for equity given our current plans.","Operator","That was the last question.

My name is Riya, and I will be your operator today. Today's call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Scott Cunningham, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Cunningham, you may begin your conference.","Scott S. Cunningham - Edison International","Thanks, Riya, and good afternoon, everyone. Our speakers today are our President and Chief Executive Officer, Pedro Pizarro; and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Maria Rigatti. Also here are other members of the management team.","Materials supporting today's call are available at www.edisoninvestor.com. These include our Form 10-K, Pedro's and Maria's prepared remarks, and the teleconference presentation. Tomorrow afternoon, we will distribute our regular business update presentation.","During this call, we will make forward-looking statements about the outlook for Edison International and its subsidiaries. Actual results could differ materially from current expectations. Important factors that could cause different results are set forth in our SEC filings. Please read these carefully. The presentation includes certain outlook assumptions as well as reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the nearest GAAP measure. During Q&A, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up.","I'll now turn the call over to Pedro.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Thanks, Scott. Good afternoon, everyone. Edison International delivered excellent fourth quarter and full year results, led by SCE's strong operating performance. Core earnings were $3.97 per share, at the high end of our core earnings guidance range. We have introduced 2017 earnings guidance with the midpoint of $4.14 per share, which is above consensus analyst estimates of $4.11 per share.","We've been able to improve on our targeted 2017 EIX holding company costs compared to what I foreshadowed on our third quarter earnings call. Maria will provide further details in her comments. Since this is our first year-end earnings call in our new roles, I want to take a few minutes on a couple of topics from my first few months as President and CEO and from reviewing our full year results against our company goals.","First is the helpful and candid feedback we received from many of you from the Investor Perception Study we launched in October and I want to say thank you. Your comments resonated well with much of what we've heard in person. In particular, it reinforced some of the strategic thinking we've had underway on maintaining a strong focus on SCE as our core growth engine and on the best areas of focus for Edison Energy Group.","I'd like to touch on a few of the key non-financial metrics the board uses in measuring our performance annually. Though they may not be as critical to investors, they are critical to how we measure our performance in delivering safe, reliable, clean and affordable electricity to our customers. A major priority across our company is being safe and though we've improved our performance in our journey to injury free, we have much more to do to meet the performance of our best-in-class peers. To that end, we have elevated safety to one of our company's core values and dedicated additional senior leadership in this area.","We're doing better in our customer service goals, with SCE ranking in the second quartile among peer utilities in the most recent J.D. Power survey. While we have continued to improve, our top quartile peers have continued to improve even more. We have done better in the past and first quartile is clearly achievable for SCE. Kevin, his leadership team and our employees are hard at work to make it happen.","SCE also improved its cost performance, as our 2016 earnings performance demonstrates. One way we measure SCE cost efficiency is controllable O&M per customer. We also track system average rates. SCE continues to reduce O&M costs and meet our system average rate targets.","Regarding SONGS, SCE continues to move into the decommissioning phase. It is also implementing the meet and confer process with interested parties in the SONGS proceeding, as required in last December's CPUC assigned commissioner ruling. The second required meeting is scheduled for February 24. We can't comment on the substance of the meetings or speculate what will come from these sessions. As part of that process, last month, we shared with the CPUC an update from the Arbitration Tribunal handling the MHI case that they expect a final decision by the end of next month.","Other important metrics we follow are purchases from minority business enterprises where we continue to exceed our targets, and building a diverse workforce more reflective of our broader Southern California community. On a related note, I'm proud that Edison International has joined in supporting two national initiatives to advance gender parity, by joining the Paradigm for Parity coalition and signing the Equal Pay Pledge that was sponsored by the prior White House. We take seriously our role in creating a diverse and engaged workforce, consistent with the larger corporate social responsibility policies that we similarly embrace.","At the top of that list of social responsibility policies is climate change, reflecting California's ambitious policy goals. Governor Brown, in his January 24 State of the State address, reaffirmed California's commitment to global leadership in encouraging renewable energy and combating climate change. While President Trump has signaled policy shifts in Washington, we believe Governor Brown and the California Legislature will continue to move forward with broad support from the State's electorate.","As the only major all-electric investor-owned utility in California, we offer potentially unique insights in transitioning the California economy away from fossil fuels through a more robust and renewable rich electric grid. We have seen considerable interest in SCE's grid modernization proposals included in its 2018 General Rate Case and had good engagement with CPUC staff and interveners through a series of well-attended workshops.","These grid modernization efforts will provide the ability to accommodate customer choices around solar, storage, electric vehicles, and energy conservation. At the same time, they will enable SCE to implement technologies and make investments in related infrastructure to enhance reliability for all customers and meet policy objectives.","SCE awaits more specific CPUC guidance this fall on their views on the technology roadmap, which we expect will sync up with our GRC request. In the interim, SCE is proceeding with some modest critical path investments to ensure as much flexibility as possible so it can then ramp-up once a GRC decision is received, hopefully, by year-end.","Last month, SCE and the other investor-owned utilities collectively proposed roughly a $1 billion of investment in the area of transportation electrification to complement the passenger vehicle pilot programs now underway. SCE's proposals accounted for more than half the total, at $573 million. These include some more immediate pilot projects such as electrification projects for cargo handling and other mobile equipment at the Port of Long Beach and for electric transit buses.","The largest proposal is for heavy duty vehicle charging infrastructure, which will support development of appropriate battery technologies for heavy duty vehicles, including creative tariff proposals to accelerate early adoption. SCE's proposals also create an opportunity to improve the health and environment for many communities located near major transportation corridors and encourage investment in disadvantaged communities.","As I look ahead toward the next decade of significant investment by utilities and by customers to move the needle meaningfully on California's greenhouse gas emission reduction goals. The pace will always need to be balanced by affordability. That's why operational excellence will remain a key element of SCE's business strategy, helping to improve both O&M costs as well as capital productivity.","We are proud of having the lowest system average rate among the California investor-owned utilities and the lowest cost of capital. We believe these are two good starting points for finding the right balance of investment and customer affordability. In addition, we believe that the new types of electric loads resulting from electrification of current fossil fuel applications across the California economy in order to meet the State's greenhouse gas emission reduction goals could lead to better utilization of our grid and, therefore, help moderate rate impacts.","We still see a reasonable floor for SCE investments of at least $4 billion annually in SCE capital spending and at least $2 billion annually in rate base growth. We will continue to see some timing related movement in capital expenditures and rate base, especially on transmission project approvals. We continue to see some shift to the right for projects included in our formal forecasts, which delay the rate base and earnings growth slightly.","Keep in mind that, at the same time, we have more potential rate base than this in opportunities we have not yet included in our formal forecasts. Maria will cover more of the specifics in her comments.","Turning now to Edison Energy Group, since our last earnings call, we have continued our strategic review of these businesses and narrowed our focus to Edison Energy Group's energy advisory services and solutions. We see great potential in integrating these into broader energy advisory services offerings for large commercial and industrial customers throughout the U.S. with a largely capital-light business model.","We have scaled back business development at Edison Transmission. We see limited FERC Order 1000 opportunities in our target markets. We will continue our role as a launch partner for the Grid Assurance initiative to support transmission system reliability nationally.","We have also shut down the Edison Water Resources business development effort. We have moved key individuals from both businesses to other roles in the company. And we still plan on a much more robust business plan discussion regarding the commercial and industrial energy advisory services business with all of you by this fall. In the meantime, we want investors to see these businesses as a long-term valuation upside, not a near-term valuation drag.","Looking ahead, some of the key macro topics driving our long-term growth opportunities and performance are broad topics like California's climate change targets and policy enablers such as transportation electrification, grid modernization, and new transmission investment. These are all underpinnings of our growth strategy and warrant a deeper dive than what we can cover in an earnings call and in our quarterly investor materials.","So in April, we're going to launch what we call the Edison Insights series of periodic conference calls and videos on topics such as these. We look to have prepared remarks, as we do for our earnings calls, along with presentations and Q&A. The first of these will be the week of April 10 and we'll cover the California climate change policy arena and transportation electrification. We hope these will be helpful additions to our investor dialogue.","With that, Maria will provide her financial report.","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","Thanks, Pedro and good afternoon, everyone. My remarks cover our fourth quarter and full year results compared to last year and to our 2016 earnings guidance. I'll then cover the 2017 guidance that Pedro has already highlighted, update our capital spending and rate base forecasts and touch on a few other topics.","Please turn to page 2 of the presentation. Fourth quarter core earnings grew 16% on SCE's strong performance. As was the case in previous quarters, SCE earnings comparisons still have some timing issues related to the adoption of the General Rate Case decision in the fourth quarter of last year.","The principal earnings growth driver is lower operations and maintenance costs, which contributed $0.09 of the $0.15 per share in SCE core earnings growth. Revenues primarily reflect the normal GRC attrition year increases and modest additions to FERC revenues to reflect additional construction and operating costs.","We also had a positive $0.09 per share revenue variance, primarily due to recognition of the impact of the GRC decision in the fourth quarter last year. Roughly half of this is offset in taxes.","Higher depreciation reflects SCE's ongoing capital spending program. Net financing costs, which include allowance for funds used during construction, AFUDC, together with interest and preference stock dividend expense, are $0.05 per share higher in the quarter. This largely reflects $0.03 per share of lower AFUDC contribution due to less construction work in progress. AFUDC rates of return, however, are still above average, given SCE's low short-term debt balances and the contributor to our earnings relative to rate base math, as I'll discuss in a few minutes.","Overall, there was not a variance within the income tax line for SCE, although there is $0.04 of tax benefits on stock options, largely offset by the GRC revenue item I mentioned earlier. The $0.04 benefit is related to the new accounting standard that requires recognition in earnings of the permanent tax benefit that arises when employees exercise stock options. Previously, this flowed to the balance sheet only.","As we noted in the third quarter 10-Q, we adopted this standard early, in the fourth quarter. We similarly anticipated this adoption in our November earnings guidance update, although the actual amount recorded in total for the company is higher than our guidance assumption.","To finish up on the SCE earnings discussion, there is a $0.01 per share of other items, primarily from insurance programs. This gets us to a 17% increase in core earnings or $0.15 per share for SCE.","Let's look next at Edison International parent and other. This includes both core holding company operating costs as well as the Edison Energy Group businesses. The same adoption of the new accounting standard on share-based payments applies here. The overall $0.02 per share positive benefits at the holding company are from tax benefits from stock options, partly offset by other tax items.","Moving next to Edison Mission Group, comparisons reflect the continued absence of earnings from the affordable housing portfolio sold in the fourth quarter of last year.","To finish up, the only non-core items in the quarter relate to the EME bankruptcy. Last year's fourth quarter results include non-core charges for the final accounting for the GRC implementation and the NEIL insurance recoveries at SCE. Also included are the sale of the EMG affordable housing portfolio and the non-core treatment of certain tax equity income at SoCore Energy, as well as results from discontinued operations.","Turning to page 3, the full year core earnings story is much more straightforward since the GRC quarterly timing issues are not relevant on an annual basis. Remember that last year's core results included a $0.31 per share benefit from a change in uncertain tax positions. This dampens the overall earnings comparisons. Excluding this item, SCE core earnings increased 8% in 2016. It's probably more helpful to compare our results to our earnings guidance.","Please turn to page 4. Overall, core earnings of $3.97 per share are $0.06 per share higher than the midpoint of guidance. SCE earnings are $0.04 per share higher, due primarily to increased O&M savings and financing benefits, partially offset by lower energy efficiency incentive award and higher income tax expense.","Edison International parent and other losses of $0.25 per share are $0.02 per share better than guidance, largely from the stock option accounting item.","Edison Energy Group full year results are generally consistent with our guidance. As Pedro touched on in his remarks, we've taken time since the third quarter call to assess the priorities and opportunities at Edison Energy Group and narrowed our strategic focus accordingly. The actions he summarized are reflected in our updated 2017 guidance.","Please turn to page 5. Our 2017 earnings guidance is built off the rate base model we have discussed with you in the past. We have used our updated 2017 weighted average rate base forecast of $26.2 billion, which is $200 million lower than our prior rate base guidance. This provides a SCE starting point of $4.05 per share.","As we saw in our 2016 financial results, we anticipate further O&M cost savings that will be returned to customers starting in 2018 under SCE's GRC filing. We also anticipate continued financing benefits related to long-term debt costs and above-trend AFUDC earnings relative to what are assumed in our rate base math.","Together, these total $0.31 per share. We also assume $0.03 per share in energy efficiency earnings. This gives us $4.39 per share as a midpoint for 2017 SCE GAAP and core earnings guidance. For EIX parent and other, our guidance is at a loss of $0.25 per share. Costs for the holding company itself are estimated at $0.17 per share, which is consistent with our prior informal guidance of a little more than $0.01 per share a month.","The lower Edison Energy Group losses make up the difference. This gets us to a midpoint of $4.14 per share. We are including a range of $4.04 to $4.24 per share. Our key assumptions are as follows. One, a base CPUC ROE of 10.45% and FERC ROE of 10.5%. Two, no changes in Federal or state tax policy. Three, shares outstanding are kept flat at 325.8 million shares through share purchases to offset incentive plan share needs. Four, we assume the SONGS settlement continues to be implemented as approved. Five, we exclude any decision on the MHI arbitration, which could include core earnings benefits from recovering legal costs and non-core earnings benefits from the balance of SCE's share of an award, if any. And six, we assume tax benefits from stock options of $0.02 per share recognized in January 2017.","Please turn to page 6. We have updated our SCE capital spending forecast largely to reflect revised estimates for the timing of major transmission projects. Overall, capital expenditures between 2016 and 2020 are approximately $450 million lower, with $350 million of the change related to transmission projects.","First, spending on the Tehachapi transmission project is essentially completed. Now that the line is in full service, we've removed roughly $90 million from our forecast to reflect lower final project costs. This benefits our customers, but reduces rate base for 2017 and beyond.","We were pleased to receive the final CPUC approval for our Mesa Substation Project earlier this month. SCE is now moving ahead on construction planning activities, with actual construction to start in the second quarter. This decision, as with the West of Devers project approval from the U.S. Bureau of Land Management published in January, reaffirms our view that approval and construction of our key California ISO-driven projects are more a matter of timing rather than whether they will be built.","With increased clarity around the planning process, construction completion for some projects is now scheduled for 2021 and 2022 and a portion of the spending previously anticipated to occur through 2020 will now occur in that later time period. Though the projects are all scheduled to be in service by 2021, there can be some final remediation and closing out of final project costs following a project being placed in service. The details on our larger transmission projects are included in the presentation appendix.","Note that our updated forecast does not include approximately $1 billion of potential capital investments that we have outside of normal GRC and FERC spending that could be approved and implemented between 2017 and 2022. This includes the significant transportation electrification proposals that Pedro discussed and the second phase of SCE's Charge Ready program for passenger vehicles, as well as any appropriate storage investments under existing and future CPUC guidelines. I'll come back to this shortly.","Please turn to page 7. The capital spending shifts have been incorporated into our estimate of rate base through 2020. Rate base at that point is lower than prior forecasts. However, we expect that to reverse in 2021 and 2022. The reason for the catch-up in 2021 and 2022 is the manner in which certain FERC projects are added to rate base.","Some are added to rate base during construction while for others, cumulative capital is added to rate base when the project is complete. Also, keep in mind that our rate base forecast is on a weighted average year basis, consistent with how SCE earns its return. So this also contributes to the time lag.","As those projects achieve completion in 2021 and 2022, rate base will adjust upward accordingly. On the chart, this is the $500 million increase offsetting the $500 million decrease in 2020. However, this does not change the fundamental above average growth opportunity we see at SCE. Depending on our own recommendations on timing and on CPUC approvals, there may be additional rate base earnings potential in this period.","Please turn to page 8. We've talked about most of these opportunities previously, but thought it a good reminder, and so, we've revised this slide to include the significant transportation electrification proposals that SCE recently filed. The first two elements, infrastructure reliability and grid modernization, are at the heart of our current and future General Rate Cases. Our currently identified transmission projects will continue through 2021 and 2022 and in the interim, the California ISO will be planning for potential additional transmission requirements to meet the 50% renewables mandate for 2030. Most of the potential for energy storage rate base investment is a future opportunity, as is transportation electrification.","On page 9, we've identified several other topics I'll touch on more briefly. The first is the CPUC cost of capital settlement now pending before the CPUC. The details on the mechanism are included on page 10. We believe the outcome is a fair balance between customers and shareholders. It continues what we see as a constructive mechanism that provides visibility and transparency on potential changes in allowed rates of return and authorized costs of debt and equity.","As we indicated in our 8-K filing, we have estimated the earnings impact in 2018 preliminarily at $66 million pre-tax or $0.12 per share. The true-up of long-term debt authorized rates to estimated actual rates is $41 million of the $66 million. The true-up of preferred equity is actually a positive $4 million, as SCE's portfolio cost is slightly higher than what is authorized. And the new ROE of 10.3% could have a roughly $29 million impact. Ultimately, the impacts will depend on the final outlook for interest rates and preferred dividend rates, as well as the timing of SCE financings. We will file those debt and preferred rates of return with the CPUC in the fourth quarter.","Staying on page 9, our current FERC settlement runs through calendar year 2017. We plan to file our 2018 FERC formula rate filing in the fourth quarter. Our current FERC settlement terms would remain in effect, but subject to adjustment, until a new formula rate is approved.","SCE's balance sheet remains strong, with the weighted average common equity component of total capitalization at 50.4% compared to the required 48%. SCE had commercial paper outstanding of $769 million compared to long-term debt of roughly $10.3 billion. SCE termed out $300 million in a separate bank credit facility early in 2017. SCE will continue to access the capital markets for first mortgage bonds and preferred equity, consistent with our capital spending forecast.","At the holding company, we maintain a modest amount of debt. We have $400 million of senior notes maturing this year, and we will look to refinance that at some point. We continue to see no need for equity issuance to support SCE's capital spending program at this time.","Please turn to page 11. Our growth opportunities remain intact even with potential tax reform. Let's consider the possible elements, interest deductibility, tax rate and capital expensing from a customer perspective. Most impactful to customers would be the negative effect of eliminating the deductibility of interest expense. As a pass-through under the cost of service model, this would result in a permanent increase in customer rates. Lower tax rates are a positive to customers and would mitigate some of the interest deductibility impacts on customer rates.","Full capital expensing will result in higher deferred taxes, although also mitigated by lower tax rates. Over time, this will lower customer rates. The specific impact will depend on the relationship between these changes and the current rate making methodology of immediately passing certain accelerated property related deduction benefits to customers.","Edison International also benefits from the interest tax shield, although the modest amount of holding company debt mitigates the impact of eliminating interest deductibility. A lower tax rate also reduces the value of the tax shield created by holding company costs. In addition, a lower tax rate would reduce the value of the EIX holding company tax assets, the net operating losses and tax credits, which largely relate to the EME bankruptcy settlement. A remeasurement of these assets would be triggered by a lowering of the tax rate.","There are still many unknowns regarding tax reform and implementation, but we have considered these key elements and overall, we believe that we can deliver long-term above-average rate base growth with associated earnings and dividend growth opportunities. I'll close with a comment on what we see as our above industry average dividend growth opportunity.","Please turn to page 12. In December, we increased the dividend by $0.25 per share for the third year in a row, and are proud of our record now of 13 years of annual dividend increases. We still have plenty of opportunity to grow our dividend toward the high end of our target payout range. Based on the midpoint of our 2017 SCE earnings guidance, we are at 49% of our payout target of 45 % to 55% of SCE earnings. The dividend will need to grow faster than earnings to move toward the high end of the range.","That's it from me, Riya. Would you please open the call for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","One moment for the first question. The first question is from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Hi, good afternoon.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Hi, how are you?","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","Hi, Julien.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Good. First quick question if you could. You talked about the $0.08 with Edison Energy, Pedro more for you, can you discuss perhaps the line of sight on turning that around and how should we read anything into $0.08 relative to the north of minus $0.10 previously?","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Yeah. Let me just comment on it briefly and Maria or Ron Litzinger can add, as needed. In the last earnings call, we first focused on 2017 in total holding company guidance. And we told you then that, while we were not ready to provide you all the details in Edison Energy, we wanted to make sure that folks understood that we were working at holding the total holding company expenses including Edison Energy, the $0.27 for 2017, and now, you see that we've updated that to be $0.25 for the year, of which $0.08 is the piece in Edison Energy.","Hopefully, it gives folks comfort that we are very focused on driving the work at Edison Energy in a disciplined way. We see a big opportunity there, Julien, but we also recognize that investors do want line of sight in terms of what the ongoing investment looks like. I'm glad that we've been able to affirm that $0.08 for 2017. As I had shared in the third quarter call, we expect to provide you more detail on \u2013 the details behind the business plan for Edison Energy no later than the fall of this year.","So until we get to there, I'm going to hold off and I don't have any new news to report other than that we continue that work. In the meantime, we're out in the market. We continue to be encouraged by the activities across the piece parts of Edison Energy and are looking forward to sharing more with all our investors.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. Excellent. Perhaps to expand on that a little bit as a follow-up, which businesses are looking more attractive within the Edison Energy, within the $0.08, within your business plan, I know I'm pushing a little bit further, but can you give us a sense on what you see your primary focus has been or will be given kind of the different activities you're pursuing?","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Yeah. I think the easiest, and frankly, the shortest way to answer that is, we're focused on the advisory services across the large C&I customer space. I don't think we're ready to provide a lot of detail on, this piece looks better than that piece, because quite frankly, part of the larger gear is that providing that broader set of advisory services across the full portfolio of needs is the core idea. And so, we'll have more to share with you as we get into the details of the business planning exercise by the fall.","But nothing to report right now on this piece looks better than that piece or actually we're seeing value and having expertise across the gamut of on-site and off-site renewables, energy efficiency and building management and bringing that suite together is the value nugget here in terms of more customer needs.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thank you.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Thanks, Julien.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Ali Agha with SunTrust.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you. Good afternoon. First question, Pedro, a big picture, as you laid out your updated rate base CAGR 2016 through 2020 is 8.6%, but over the last \u2013 this rate case cycle, you've been benefiting significantly in your core earnings from the tax benefits and also the O&M savings, at a minimum the tax benefits go away, O&M probably get strewed up as well in the next GRC. But then, the Edison Energy losses would move around as well. So when I look at that mathematically of your 2016 actual earnings that you've booked here, how should I think about the EPS CAGR versus the rate base CAGR given that you're actually over-earning on the EPS front right now?","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","Hey, Ali, it's Maria. So obviously, there are some things in the mix that I think you mentioned that aren't flowing through to the bottom lining, more primarily around the tax benefits in the early part of two years or three years or four years ago that we're seeing. But we continue to find or look for opportunities where we can actually reduce our costs and put ourselves on a good trajectory.","We have opportunities there. We talked a little bit about the opportunities that we're looking at relative to other capital investments, Pedro mentioned the transportation electrification proposal that we recently submitted. So we think that there are opportunities across the board that we can be looking at and incorporating on a go forward basis around our earnings.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","So what you would say, Maria, is given all the puts and takes EPS CAGR should be in line with the rate base CAGR?","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","We certainly think that our earnings and our rate base are aligned.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. And my second question, and I think you alluded to that up a little bit in your remarks as well, but on the dividend front, is the goal to eventually end up at the higher end of the range? As you mentioned, you're pretty much at the midpoint right now. So we're not done yet in terms of ratcheting up the payout ratio, is that correct?","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","Ali, yeah, that's been our payout ratio range for a long time, 45% to 55%. We'll continue to work it, as we move forward in time, but I think that that incepts over time, we want to be there.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","The higher end, did I hear that right?","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","We want to be in that range over the long-term, yeah.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Angie Storozynski with Macquarie.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Thank you. Just...","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Hi, Angie.","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","Hey, Angie.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Thank you. Two questions. One is, so given the pending GRC and the fourth quarter filing on the true-up on the cost of debt, should I basically assume that you'll have no efficiencies in your earnings in 2018?","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","Well, certainly, when we file a GRC, the tendency would be to give things back to the customer, that's the construct around which we try and find efficiencies whether it's around O&M or debt. So I think you'll see that as we move forward.","On the other hand, as we continue to work and we continue to probe the opportunities that we have, we will still work on finding and achieving additional efficiencies, which \u2013 then when we get back to the next rate case, we'll get back to customers once again. So I think you'll see that as sort of our mantra and certainly the cycle that we go through here.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. And the second question on the potential MHI arbitration award, you said the amount equivalent to the costs incurred would be reflected in core earnings. Can you remind us what are those costs?","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","Sure. So that would be really just costs associated with legal expenses that we have previously incurred through core earnings and that would be if we were \u2013 we don't know what the award would be or if there would be an award at this point, but if we were to recover anything and we had sufficient amounts to cover prior legal expenses, that would be about $0.09 per share.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Very good. Thank you.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Thanks, Angie.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah, good morning, guys \u2013 good afternoon, guys, excuse me. I just have quick question Pedro on the non-GRC capital spending that you referenced in the slide, but it's now between grid modernization and the mobile home program. It's $289 million and last quarter that was $100 million or so higher, I think, between the two. What's driving the change there and what you're assuming you'll spend outside the GRC, is there some indication from staff, the things in grid mod that causes you to be more cautious there?","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","Hi, Jonathan. It's Maria. No, it's nothing about grid mod is causing us to be more cautious, but I think the grid mod numbers for 2017 haven't changed at all since Q3. We are finding some efficiencies in some of the unit cost, if you will, on some of the programs outside of grid mod, so that's really all you're seeing roll through that.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","And then, Jonathan, it's something that we'll continue to be very keen on. I know we mentioned in the comments, but obviously, while we present an important growth opportunity here for investors, we want to make sure that it's good capital and in our view, good capital is efficient capital. So just like we're doing the O&M, we'll continue to look for capital productivity opportunities for customers.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, great. Thank you. And then, just you talked about the reasons for the rate base decline in 2020 having to do with the way that \u2013 I think if I understood this right, the way that grade making rolls the projects into rate base. So I'm just curious what change did something in the rate making change or is it more just the timing to let to the rate, because I'm presuming that would have been the case in November too.","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","So certainly, it all starts with the timing slipping to the rate. In the various projects that we have that are part of our FERC rate base, some of the projects are actually eligible for certain incentives, specifically where the capital enters rate base while it's still in construction. So CWIP incentives, others do not. And when you have projects move around that aren't subject to that incentives, staggering it by a year can actually, in that first year or two, have an outsized impact, and then, you catch up when you get to the first full year.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. So it's not that the methodology changed, it's more the timing changed.","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","Correct.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Great. And then, just finally on Edison Energy, you say you're narrowing the focus. So does that embed it within that statement? Are there businesses that you acquired that you're not going to continue with? Or just how can you help us understand what's actually changing in that narrowing of focus?","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Sure, Jonathan. And I think I covered it in my comments that the two specific examples we wanted to highlight were with Edison Transmission where we have been pursuing opportunities in the various organized markets. The reality is that we are just not seeing the same level of opportunity under FERC Order 1000, as I think the whole market thought there might be at one point.","And now, in particular, as we think about what the impacts maybe of the new administration of Washington, potentially moving away from the clean power plant implementation that is probably continued negative for the likely availability of FERC Order 1000 project. So Edison Transmission was one of two businesses we wanted to highlight where we're decreasing the level of effort there, although still keeping our position in Grid Assurance.","The second one that I highlighted was Edison Water Resources. I think I had mentioned that in the past as an exploratory activity. We had a team that did a lot of great work there and there's clearly customer interest, but frankly, it's a market that it's still not mature in terms of the transparency of pricing and just the complexity of regulation across it. And so, while we saw some real technical feasibility there, and frankly, I think water is something that's important to society over the long run, our judgment after doing some pilot work was that, the mass there wasn't a good fit for us at this time.","And I think as we look at potential opportunities broadly across the space, some of this is exploration on the radar screen and try some of these and we determine that they are not ripe or prime, then we move on. And so, we moved on Edison Water Resources.","So those were the two. We remain very focused on the central idea of the energy advisory services for large commercial and industrial customers, and so, I was not trying to telegraph anything about businesses inside that portfolio.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. That's great. I hadn't realized that was sort of an expansion of that comment. So thank you, Pedro.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","You bet.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And then, just finally on that, you talked about 2017 guidance factor, lower EEG losses, the $0.08, had you previously disclosed the bigger EEG number, I thought it was all kind of wrapped within the holding company?","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","Yes.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","That's right.","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","It was previously all in that $0.27.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. So you're just commenting that there was a bigger number in that before, but it was kind of within the $0.27?","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","Correct.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","That's right.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. All right. Thank you very much.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Thanks, Jonathan.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Praful Mehta with Citigroup.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi, guys.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Hey, there.","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","Hey.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi. So quickly on Edison Energy, I know you don't like to touch or dig deep into it, but just wanted to understand from a tax reform perspective, any implications on what that could mean from a growth strategy, I know it's more capital light, but wanted to just understand if it has any implications for you guys?","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","So I think it's the same thing probably that lots of other companies have been telling you. We'll be obviously looking at any sorts of border taxes and how that affects costs for our company and others, and how it would impact our customers. And also, in terms of tax rate, tax rate affects every company, and so as that changes, we'll be keeping an eye on that as well.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Yeah, I mean, and just to tag on to that, so I do think Maria has it right that it might be some impacts on what the overall cost position is, but that wouldn't be just for our offerings, it would be for the offerings of other folks in the space, other competitors as well. And I think, importantly, as we look at the large C&I customers that the business is aiming to serve, they're being driven by a lot of things, they're being driven by economics, they're being driven by sustainability objectives, the tax changes could have some impact on some of the underlying costs, but at this point, we don't see a material change in the overall interest that large C&I customers have in the broad portfolio advisory services theme.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got you. And that's very helpful color. And then, secondly, on community choice aggregation, the CCA, there is an expectation of meaningful amount of load being served through CCAs over time. Any implications for you guys, how do you see that going forward in your service territory?","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Well, let me give a top-level answer, and then, perhaps Ron Nichols or Kevin Payne want to answer further. I think the short answer is that while I think we've mentioned we could see low departures of as much as 40% to 50% by 2025 or so, under the rules set by the legislature, under the framework set by the legislature, there should be no impact to our investors, because it's just all really about who is serving the commodity energy needs, but those customers would still be relying on our grid investments for provision of electricity.","So done right, should be no impact, that we do spend time on making sure that the program is implemented appropriately so that there isn't that cross subsidization between folks \u2013 having the folks who are leaving being cross subsidized by some of the remaining customers, and so, we have a lot of focus on making sure that the rules are being implemented right.","Ron or Kevin, anything you'd like to add there?","Kevin M. Payne - Edison International","Praful, this is the issue that we're dealing with right now. And the Commission is tracking this. They've been having workshops on this matter as well to get more clarity about how they plan to implement the legislative rules on this. So we're just going to continue to track that carefully.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. And I'm assuming then cross subsidization is the core issue just to ensure that that is done fairly?","Kevin M. Payne - Edison International","Yes.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got you. Thank you, guys.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, guys. Congrats to a good end to 2016. Two questions, one on the dividend payout ratio. And can you talk a little bit, Pedro or Maria, about why the 45% to 55%, why you and why the board still thinks that's the right metric? I mean if I think about what happened, you still have $4 billion-ish plus of CapEx, maybe even closer to $4.5 billion to $5 billion, but the overall size of the company is significantly bigger since you first set that as a payout ratio target, depreciation that's what covered in rates and cash flow is significantly bigger. Just talk about how the board today versus five years ago comes to that level as the target, what are some of the metrics you look at in setting that target?","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Let me kick it off and Maria may have more here. I think at the end of the day, we're looking to provide a total shareholder return to our investors and we deliver that through both the dividend growth as well as the earnings growth.","And like you said, we have a very strong and, frankly, I'd say, a premium growth story relative to our peers across the industry, driven largely by the organic growth opportunity at SCE, and that rate base growth is driving earnings growth and we view that as being above industry average earnings growth, which I think coupled with above industry average dividend growth rates to deliver a very compelling package to our investors. So we don't look at a dividend growth rate in isolation. We looked at married with the earnings growth rate. And so, as we look at what that earnings growth rate is, the board and we and management still feel that that 45% to 55% payout range present a compelling attractive opportunity when coupled with the earnings growth rate.","Maria, anything else you'd add there?","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","No. Michael, I think it's all part of the package. The total value that we're delivering to shareholders is not just one piece or the other.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. The other thing is and this is a rate base question. So 2016 CapEx came in a couple of hundred million dollars lower than I'd think your last business update or your last forecast had. 2017 is a couple of hundred million dollars lower than your last forecast. If I add those up, I don't get to the same number that 2018 is down, and maybe my math is off, but 2018 rate base is actually down less than what the sum of the 2016 and 2017, if I just added up what the differences in old versus new CapEx was going to be any.","Can you help A, make sure help me understand what's going on there and it may just be a timing deal? And B, what drives such a big step-up in rate base in 2018 over 2017? I mean you talk about having $4 billion plus of CapEx, but $2 billion of rate base growth, and yet, rate base growth in that year is over $3 billion?","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","Okay. So maybe let's take the piece parts of your question. So the first part of your question was, you see capital spending down in the first couple of years, but not a commensurate decline in rate base and some of that really is the timing issues that we've talked about before. It's timing that then rolls through, as you move out towards the end of the 2020 period, you can see that rate base more catches up with the reduction in capital spending, and then, you'll see that offset again through 2022.","Part of that's related also to just how do projects enter rate base, do they have this incentive feature or not. And then also, every time you change particular assets that are in rate base, you will get in different impact on accumulated deferred taxes. So there's a lot of things like that that roll through. But at the end of the day, CapEx and rate base, they catch up with each other.","In terms of your second question as to why there's a step-up in 2018, when we bought \u2013 so right now, we're deploying capital, et cetera, we filed our 2018 GRC. We actually have a true-up in the 2018 GRC to reflect the capital that we've been spending over the course of the last few years. If you recall, in the 2015 GRC, the way that our revenue requirement is set in 2016 and 2017 is by looking at capital additions and capital additions and escalation on those capital additions.","Capital expenditures, ultimately, match the escalation in capital additions, but because of that, that methodology that the CPUC has adopted, which is frankly a simplified methodology, you'll see a catch-up in 2018 when we go into our next rate case.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Okay. Thank you, guys. Much appreciate it.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Thanks, Michael.","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Anthony Crowdell with Jefferies.","Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC","Hey. Good afternoon. Just the company, and I guess the other utility down in the state were very \u2013 I guess, got a very balanced decision in cost of capital. Can I use that the same parties involved to think about the discussions around SONGS or are there other parties involved?","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","I'll turn it over to Adam Umanoff, but I think the broad message here is, we had a constructive outcome in terms of a cost of capital proceeding, where those parties involved, the SONGS matter, separate matter (52:56) we have, obviously, we want to make sure we have a constructive set of discussions with the parties involved there.","You saw the assigned commissioner ruling that from December that setup this whole meet and confer process and so we had our first meeting, we'll have our second meeting coming up at the end of February, and I know we'll certainly do our part to have constructive discussions with all the parties, but we cannot handicap at this point where that might lead.","Adam or Ron Nichols, anything to add to that?","Adam S. Umanoff - Edison International","I wouldn't add anything, Pedro.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Okay. Thanks.","Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC","Just what other \u2013 are there like a very important party involved with the SONGS discussion that are not involved with cost of capital?","Adam S. Umanoff - Edison International","This is Adam Umanoff. There are a number of parties involved in the SONGS proceeding who are also involved in the cost of capital negotiations. But the playlist of parties in the SONGS proceeding is wider. Anyone who intervened in that proceeding has a seat at the table.","Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC","Great. Thanks for taking my question.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Travis Miller with Morningstar.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Hi, Travis.","Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Good afternoon. Thank you. Just one on the transmission side, if you think out the 5 years, 10 years, whatever, how close is the transmission system, especially where you guys are to getting to that 50% RPS to be able to transmit all that power that might be needed for the 50%, and then, I'll add on to that about the 100%?","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","I think, a couple of comments on that, and again, Kevin Payne, Ron Nichols may have more to say here. Ultimately, we look to the California independent system operator to do the planning for that and they are still working on the planning to meet 50% renewables. So that really return it to them, you mentioned 100% renewables, we did see a draft bill that was submitted by the pro Tem of the Senate, Kevin De Le\u00f3n, last week, that would accelerate the State to 100%.","It calls for reaching the 50% mark by 2025, and then, reaching a 100% renewables by 2045, that is, as you can imagine, early days of the legislative session. Last week was the deadline for submitting bills, often place holders gets submitted, so we'll be obviously ready to engage in discussions as that (55:35) and other proposed bills make their way through the process, but I don't think that the ISIL has included a 100% renewables that I know of in any of the scenarios so far.","Ron, Kevin anything to add?","Unknown Speaker","Yeah. Just to maybe clarify that the projects necessary, I mean 33% are already identified and underway planning in the upcoming cycle at the California, and so, we'll determine what projects are needed for 50%, and beyond that point, I don't believe that are going away (56:06).","Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Okay. So the incremental you get 50% or even a 100% is not included in your forecast, right? Because (56:14).","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Yeah. Certainly, no.","Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","2020, 2021. Okay.","Unknown Speaker","That's right.","Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Okay. And then, real quick, very generally speaking, what are you seeing in terms of corporate renewable energy purchases? I guess it gets somewhat into the Edison Energy, but even just more broadly, what you're seeing from corporations who want to buy renewable energy?","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Let me ask Ron Litzinger to comment on that.","Ronald L. Litzinger - Edison International","Yeah. As we \u2013 Edison Energy corporate PPA is a significant portion of our business and it continues to grow strong and we see interest and growing year-over-year. So it continues to be an important part of the business.","Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Is there any way to quantify that in terms of percent of system or percent of renewables delivered anything like that, any numbers in that?","Ronald L. Litzinger - Edison International","No, not at this time, let's think that would be included in the business plan in the fall.","Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Okay. Great.

Mr. Cunningham, you may begin your conference.","Scott S. Cunningham - Edison International","Thanks very much and good afternoon, everyone. Our speakers today are President and Chief Executive Officer, Pedro Pizarro; and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Maria Rigatti. Also here are other members of the management team.","Materials supporting today's call are available at www.edisoninvestor.com. These include our Form 10-Q, Pedro's and Maria's prepared remarks, and the teleconference presentation. Next week, we'll distribute our regular business update presentation.","During this call, we'll make forward-looking statements about the outlook for Edison International and its subsidiaries. Actual results could differ materially from current expectations. Important factors that could cause different results are set forth in our SEC filings. Please read these carefully.","The presentation includes certain outlook assumptions as well as reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the nearest GAAP measure. During Q&A, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up.","I'll now turn the call over to, Pedro.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Thanks, Scott, and good afternoon, everyone. Edison International is off to a solid start in 2017. Today, we reported strong first quarter earnings of $1.11 per share compared to $0.85 per share a year ago. It is early in the year, so for now, we have left our full-year guidance unchanged, since our normal practice is to wait until more of the year has gone by before formally updating guidance. At the same time, we recognize there is a bias toward the upper-half of the range. Maria will cover this in detail in her remarks. My comments today focus on Southern California Edison's long-term growth opportunity. I'll start with the SCE 2018 General Rate Case.","SCE's filing outline a continued focus on infrastructure reliability investment. It also proposed the first elements of a multi-year grid modernization initiative, one that will be a key enabler of California's ambitious climate change policies, as well as supporting improved system reliability and public safety.","As I have said before, California has only 13 years to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 40% below 1990 levels. Policymakers have identified a robust, modernized electric grid as a critical element in the effort to achieve significant GHG reductions. The CPUC will set SCE's initial pace for grid modernization in its GRC decision.","Agreeing on the right pace for grid modernization will be a key topic in the GRC process, as we saw two weeks ago. In testimony submitted by the Office of Ratepayer Advocates, or ORA, they recommended zero capital spending for this key enabler of climate and clean air policy. This is contrary to the CPUC's stated goal of completing grid modernization by 2025, and we don't believe is consistent with California's climate policy objectives. Testimony from other intervenors is due tomorrow. We will respond to all intervenor testimony on June 16. We will reiterate the strong case we believe we have made for these investments in our GRC filing.","In terms of rate base, ORA's overall capital spending recommendations would still yield annual rate base growth of 6.6% to 2020, above the industry average, compared to our request case of 8.6% average annual growth. This includes ORAs acceptance of about 90% of our non-grid modernization capital spending recommendations.","Once we have testimony from other intervenors, we will provide an update to reflect the overall picture of intervenor positions as it relates to capital spending, and rate base, and any other major new issues. You'll hear more from us on this topic in our May Business Update investor presentation.","Transmission is another important element of SCE's growth opportunity. SCE is extending and strengthening its system through a number of major projects. The paths to permitting and constructing these projects are complex, but the benefits to system reliability and greenhouse gas emissions reductions cannot be understated.","This is especially important as we look ahead to the retirement of a number of gas-fired power plants owned by third parties. These are located along the coast, many in our service territory. These plants have to shut down or repower due to the future prohibition on the use of once-through cooling water. Most of them have to shut down by the end of this decade.","Other projects will enable increased access to renewable energy resources. These are necessary to meet our 33% renewables target by 2020. It is particularly important to avoid regulatory delays on these and future transmission projects; these projects are foundational if we are to add new sources of low-carbon renewable energy to the grid as soon as possible.","On April 12, we launched the first in our planned Edison Insights teleconferences. The topics were California's climate change policies and transportation electrification. I won't repeat the details of the call, but for those of you who could not participate, let me summarize just a few key points. First, we provided more context for the potential $1 billion multi-year investment opportunity, not currently included in our capital forecast. Most of this relates to transportation electrification. Given the broader discussion on the April 12 call, we see even more to be done in the next decade.","The day after our Edison Insights call, the CPUC issued its scoping ruling on the utility transportation electrification filings. The CPUC is targeting decisions on our pilot project proposals in October of this year, and on our much larger medium and heavy-duty vehicle charging proposal in April of next year.","These proposals represent a total potential investment of $574 million, almost all of it capital spending and rate base opportunity. On our April 12 call, we indicated we'll likely file our request for the second phase of our SCE Charge Ready program in the spring of next year. We will continue to target the balance of the 30,000 commercial charging systems in this phase.","Now, 30,000 is roughly a third of the 100,000 systems SCE estimated would be needed to achieve the SCE service territory share of California's 1.5 million electric vehicle target by 2025. Our early cost estimate for these 30,000 charging systems was about $225 million. We will leverage the experience from our current pilot program in estimating average per-unit capital costs for this filing.","A second key discussion point was the potential need for significantly more commercial charging infrastructure longer-term. This is based on the California Air Resources Board's, or CARB's recently published targets for zero emission vehicles. CARB's January 2017 recommendation calls for 4.2 million zero emission vehicles to be on the road by 2030. This goes well beyond the 2025 target I mentioned.","SCE estimates that 1.9 million of these could be in our service territory, and could require as many as 220,000 commercial charging systems. In fact, as we analyze other alternative scenarios, we can see the potential need to double CARB's target of 4.2 million zero emission vehicles on the road by 2030 to meet California's GHG reduction and air quality targets in a more cost-effective way. The application we expect to file next year for the balance of the 30,000 charging systems will likely be followed by filings for significant additional investment in charging infrastructure in the next decade.","Our sense is that, there will be policy support for having SCE make much of the necessary infrastructure investment. We see our main role as owning the electrical infrastructure up to the charging station, but typically not the charging station itself, and we believe there is good support for this general split of responsibilities.","We will continue the conversation about our long-term growth opportunities. Our next Edison Insights teleconference will be this summer. It will focus on the long-term outlook for the distribution system. We will put grid modernization and infrastructure reliability into a longer-term context.","There are two other topics I'd like to cover now. The first is the cost of capital settlement among the three investor-owned utilities and two key consumer advocate groups, ORA and TURN, covering the 2018 through 2019 period.","Last week, the CPUC withdrew the proposed decision recommending settlement approval, and two new Administrative Law Judges were co-assigned to the proceeding. The next step will be to issue a revised or new proposed decision, but the CPUC has not yet provided information on timing or on reasons for these extra steps. We continue to believe the settlement is full and fair, and given that there have been no comments from other parties on the settlement, we expect it will eventually be approved.","The last item is the status of the SONGS regulatory proceeding. We were disappointed to receive the news in March that the International Chamber of Commerce, or ICC, arbitration tribunal found that, while MHI was responsible for the defective design of the SONGS replacement steam generators, the contractual limit of liability capped MHI's obligations. This came in an unusual 2-to-1 decision; we understand these are normally unanimous decisions.","The SONGS owners were awarded damages capped at the $137 million contract limit. Given the limited grounds to appeal an ICC arbitration award, SCE and the other owners have decided not to appeal the tribunal's decision. As we have mentioned before, as soon as the decision has been redacted for proprietary information, we will make it publicly available. As we expected, the majority of redactions have been requested by MHI.","The next steps in the CPUC-ordered meet-and-confer process will be additional meetings to be held over three days in June under the auspices of a mediator, the Honorable Layn Phillips. He is a former U.S. Attorney and U.S. District Court Judge, and is a leading alternative dispute resolution mediator. Reflecting this new schedule, the SONGS' owners and most of the parties to the meet-and-confer process filed a request last week with the CPUC to extend the deadline to report on the status of the meet-and-confer process out to August 15.","We are taking the meet-and-confer process very seriously, and we will engage fully and in good faith with the parties in the upcoming mediation. Same time, given our strong conviction that the existing settlement is fair and reasonable, and that the late-notice ex parte discussion between the former CPUC president and a former SCE executive had zero impact on the 10 months of negotiations among the settlement parties, we are prepared to return to litigation if the meet-and-confer process is ultimately not successful, and the CPUC takes that step.","Whatever the path to ultimately resolving the SONGS matter, we are committed to doing our part to do this as expeditiously as possible, so that we, the other parties, and the CPUC and its staff can focus our collective time and resources on the other important topics we have at hand. Investing in a safe and reliable grid, modernizing the grid to support customers' choices of distributed resources, and using the grid to decarbonize our economy and clean our air are the major opportunities that the people of California are depending on all of us, together, to get right for our state's future.","Well, before I turn it over to Maria, I have just one additional set of comments, and it's bittersweet. After 10 years with Edison International, Scott Cunningham will be retiring at the end of June, so this will be our last earnings call together. We expect to be able to name Scott's replacement very soon, but that individual is going to have some very large shoes to fill. Scott has been an outstanding leader on our team, and we will all miss him. Although we know that he and his wife Kathy (13:47) have great plans for many happy years ahead together.","Even before joining EIX, Scott had a diverse career in Investor Relations at AES and also at Praxair, where he established their IR program. Scott's 20-year career at Praxair, which had just been spun-off from Union Carbide Corporation, included leadership roles in corporate strategic planning, business development and marketing, and finance. You all might not know that Scott began his career in research and water quality programs at the U.S. Department of Interior and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.","It is so hard to imagine Investor Relations here at Edison without Scott. He built our program into something truly special. While I and the rest of our team just think the world of him, frankly the report card that matters the most is that from our investors, and by all measures, you have also given him an A+ in your informal comments, and in more formal ratings. Most recently, Institutional Investor Magazine placed Scott on the 2017 All-America Executive Team as the number two ranked IR professional in our industry, and has recognized Scott in the top rankings for several years.","Scott's expertise is undeniable, but his contributions can't be captured just by numbers. And saying that Scott is an expert investor relations professional doesn't even begin to express what he has meant to us. Scott combined integrity, intellectual curiosity, and deep knowledge of our company's strategy and disclosures with a true commitment to transparent and effective communications for our investors.","Scott has also been a wonderful coach and mentor to many within our organization. He has served on the Board of Trustees at the California Science Center on the company's behalf. And \u2013 it's a fun one \u2013 he was involved in bringing the Space Shuttle Endeavour to the Science Center, as well as supporting the California Science Center Foundation's educational programs.","On top of it all, and I can say this after having spent many weeks on the road with Scott to visit with many of you, I can confirm that Scott met the ultimate test. He is still fun to be with even when you're stuck together in yet another airport after yet another flight cancellation. We wish Scott and Kathy (16:10) all the best in their new adventures, but we all are. and especially I am. so very sorry to see him retire. Scott, thank you so much for your outstanding leadership and friendship. You are just simply the best, my friend.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Maria.","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","Thanks, Pedro. And I just want to echo those comments; we deeply appreciate Scott's contributions to the company. He's a wonderful colleague and thought partner, and has been an integral part of our team for the past 10 years. We will miss his expertise and counsel tremendously. We know, however, that the friendship will continue. Thank you, Scott.","This afternoon, I'll now cover our first quarter results, our reaffirmed guidance and a few other financial topics. Please turn to page 2 of the presentation. First quarter results reflect strong SCE operating performance, so let's begin by looking at the key SCE earnings drivers shown on the right of the slide.","Higher revenues reflect the normal attrition mechanism in SCE's current General Rate Case. As a reminder, increases in revenues are authorized by the CPUC in the second and third year of each rate case cycle. These increases essentially anticipate standard cost growth for operations and maintenance expenses, depreciation, taxes, and other items. The mechanism also provides our rate base earnings for capital additions in that second and third year. Higher revenues contributed a positive $0.12 per share variance compared to last year's first quarter.","SCE continues to implement various operational and service excellence initiatives and O&M was lower in the quarter, contributing $0.06 per share to the higher earnings. I would note that some of this can be related to timing of various activities, and is not necessarily indicative of a trend line for the full year. Higher depreciation is to be expected since it's the partial offset to the higher authorized revenues related to SCE's major capital spending program. Depreciation is a $0.04 per share negative variance in the quarter. Net financing costs were also higher by $0.03 per share mainly due to increased borrowings to finance our capital program.","Income tax benefits contributed $0.06 per share. This includes $0.03 per share related to the settlement of all open tax positions with the IRS for taxable years 2007 through 2012. This settlement benefit was included in our 2017 earnings guidance. The balance of the tax items relate to smaller factors such as tax benefits related to cost of removal and depreciation.","Taken together, this gets us to an overall SCE earnings increase of $0.17 per share. One item not included in the quarterly results is the MHI arbitration award we received the last month. Although SCE was awarded $47 million net as its share of the award, the legal costs we incurred are subject to a reasonableness review by the CPUC.","We thought it prudent to offset the gain with a regulatory liability to reflect the uncertainties around the disposition of this award. This is consistent with our approach to guidance, which did not assume any financial recovery in the arbitration.","At the Edison International holding company, we include traditional holding company costs and competitive business activities, including Edison Energy Group. For the quarter, the holding company recorded $0.04 per share of earnings compared to a loss of $0.05 per share last year. This is mainly driven by $0.10 per share of higher tax benefits on stock option exercises.","On a consolidated basis, we had $0.13 of tax benefits from stock option exercises this quarter, in comparison to $0.03 last year. Our guidance assumed $0.02 of benefit, based on exercises through the end of January. In February and March, we saw additional benefits from further stock option exercises. Edison Energy Group results were consistent with our full-year guidance assumptions, but not a driver of quarterly earnings variance.","As a reminder, as a result of our 2016 adoption of the new FASB accounting rules on share-based payments, comparisons with the first quarter of 2016 are on an adjusted basis. Previously, we had reported $0.82 per share of core earnings in the first quarter of 2016; this is now $0.85 per share as adjusted. We presented this adjustment of the quarterly results in our 10-K and our February Business Update. The same quarterly earnings schedule is again included in the presentation appendix.","Now, please turn to page 3. We recognize we had strong first quarter performance, in part driven by tax benefits from stock option exercises above what was in our original guidance. Our normal practice is to consider updating guidance later in the year, and we have reaffirmed our core earnings guidance at a midpoint of $4.14 per share with the range unchanged as well, although we acknowledge the upward bias that Pedro already mentioned.","Our principal key assumptions, including SCE authorized rate base, remain unchanged. We've noted that we had $0.13 per share in tax benefits related to stock option exercises compared to the $0.02 per share in our original guidance. As noted earlier, we have not included the MHI arbitration award in our guidance or any outcomes from the current meet-and-confer process related to the SONGS settlement.","Pedro commented on the key elements of ORA's testimony related to the 2018 SCE General Rate Case that are most relevant to investors, page 4 shows the details. While most of the issues that ORA raised are consistent with those raised in their testimony in the last rate case, grid modernization is perhaps the most important new topic, as expected. The bottom of the slide shows how our capital spending and rate base forecasts would be impacted if the CPUC were to adopt ORA's recommendations. Note that ORA's written testimony does not provide 2019 and 2020 capital spending estimates. It does provide forecasts of rate base.","Please turn to page 5. We have reaffirmed our prior capital spending and rate base forecasts for the 2018 through 2020 GRC period based on our request. Recall that CPUC rate base earnings are derived from authorized rate base and is not adjusted in the same year if there are capital spending variances, but trued up in future periods. Also, what we call rate base math is derived from authorized average annual rate base.","I mention this only because SCE could see 2017 capital expenditures ending up at $4 billion rather than $4.2 billion. This would generally reflect the lack of approval of a grid modernization memorandum account and minor delays in the start of construction for the $608 million Mesa substation project. This would not be a factor in 2017, but could result in an adjustment of CPUC 2018 rate base, which is still subject to GRC approval.","Longer-term, we continue to see a base case with SCE investing at least $4 billion per year and adding at least $2 billion per year of rate base for the foreseeable future as SCE continues to implement its wires-focused business strategy.","For the Mesa Substation project, SCE has extended its construction completion schedule by six months, from the fall of 2021 to the spring of 2022, to better reflect pre-construction requirements and seasonal considerations affecting the start of construction. This has only a minor impact on the profile of construction expenditures. This update came out of a project scheduling review process that SCE is undertaking for all of its major construction projects. We want our forecasting to be as consistent as possible across all of these projects, given our recent experience with regulatory delays.","We were pleased to see constructive developments recently on two other transmission projects. The CPUC denied ORA's appeal of its decision approving the $1.1 billion West of Devers project on March 23. On April 7, SCE received the final environmental impact review for its $397 million Alberhill System. This review accepted SCE's recommended project scope. Final CPUC approval will still be required. Details on our capital spending, rate base and transmission projects are included in the presentation appendix.","We continue to see no need to issue equity to support SCE's capital spending program. We also continue to target no dilution from benefit plans or stock purchase plans. In the first quarter, we bought common stock in the market to offset potential dilution from employee benefit plan at a net cost of $139 million.","SCE continues to maintain a strong balance sheet and significant financial flexibility. SCE had no short-term debt outstanding at the end of the quarter, and the weighted average common equity component of total capitalization is unchanged from year-end at 50.4%. The Edison International holding company remains only modestly leveraged. We termed out more than half of the holding company commercial paper balance in March with a $400 million, 2.125% senior note due in 2020. We continue to maintain what we believe is a prudently conservative balance sheet at both SCE and at the holding company.","That concludes my remarks, Princess, please let's start the Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from Ali Agha from SunTrust. Ali, your line is now open.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Good afternoon.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Hi, Ali.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Scott, congratulations for a job extremely well done, and wishing you all the best as well.","Scott S. Cunningham - Edison International","Thanks very much, Ali.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","First question, Maria, for modeling purposes, what effective tax rate should we assume for EIX for the year? And how should we think about that to book tax rate going forward as well?","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","We usually think about effective tax rate at SCE at 20%, and then a percentage or two lower at EIX, so that really should be how you're thinking for the next several years.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. And that would factor in this year as well given the tax benefits that you booked?","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","Yeah. I would use those assumptions starting with this year, yeah.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. And then on the SONGS process, given the new date you've talked about extending it to August 15, assuming things fall into place et cetera, what's the earliest you believe you could reach a final conclusion on that issue?","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Hey Ali, it's Pedro. I don't think we're in a position to speculate on timing, what we've done is, we've provided visibility to the three sessions that are coming up in June. But just don't want to speculate or presume that we get resolution to these three sessions or one or two of them, the parties decide to go into more sessions, so the parties decided to have mediation, it's not going to work out, so just want to stick to the timeline as we've given it, and not speculate further. Hope you appreciate that.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. Last question, Pedro, given the ORA's position on the GRC, and I know, others will be filing tomorrow as well. Do you still believe there is a possibility to reach a settlement on this rate case or do you think it's going to be fully litigated most likely?","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Again, I'm not going to be able to give you any sort of quantification of probabilities left or right on that. I think, what we said before, and would reaffirm now is, certainly open to that. The PUC staff set a schedule for the first set of settlement discussions. So we'll take them seriously, and see how it goes. So now, certainly intellectually open to that, but not in a place where we can give you a probability in either direction.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Thanks, Ali.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from UBS. Julien, your line is now open.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Hey.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Hi, Julien.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Good afternoon. Hey, well, first-off congratulations, Scott. I really appreciate everything you've always done for us and the team, it really means a lot. So with that said, I'll just kick-off a couple, basic questions. First, in terms of SONGS, just to set the expectation, could you see a further extension or is there actually a drop-dead timeline?","And then, a second unrelated question. But going back to what Sempra was talking about, on the safety-related CapEx they're talking about, the ramp. Is there any potential to see any of that flow into your CapEx, perhaps not necessarily in the current instance, but perhaps future rate cases? I'd just be curious how you think about embedding more of that safety culture?","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","All right, Julien. Let me start with the SONGS piece, and turn it over to Maria or Ron Nichols for the ramp question. On the SONGS piece, kind of similar to the answer I gave Ali, don't really want to speculate on where this may go. I think, answering your question head-on, I think anything is possible. Parties could decide that they want to continue discussions. I'm not aware of (31:09) a predetermined drop-dead date or what have you. So I think we'll leave it fairly open at this point, and see where it goes. Let me turn it over to Maria on the ramp question.","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","Sure, so Julien, we actually will file \u2013 for our 2021 GRC, we will file a similar filing next year. It's part of the process as it is unfolding. I think, from a safety culture perspective, we actually already look at all of our capital through a safety lens and are determining all the time, with or without the ramp, whether or not we are appropriately addressing all of the safety concerns and the safety needs of the company. So I would say, you'll continue to see us have that focus on infrastructure replacement, which has both the safety aspect to it as well as the reliability aspect to it.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Great. And then lastly, I hate to bug you on this again, breakeven on Edison Energy, can you even talk about that for 2018 yet, or anything, I know that was a third quarter subject?","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","So, still same comments that we made last time around, we've given folks visibility into the costs for 2017, $0.25 guidance at the total holding company level, $0.08 of that is Edison Energy, and then we will be coming back sometime in the fall with comments on the broader business plan. And that we do expect to be able to provide some insights on, at what point we would get the business to or expect to get the business to breakeven. So nothing new to report there yet. Look forward to chatting about it in the fall, Julien.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","All right. I'll leave it at that. Thank you all.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Okay. Thanks, Julien.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jonathan Arland (sic) [Jonathan Arnold] from Deutsche Bank. Jonathan, your line is now open.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi, good afternoon, guys.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Hey.","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","Hey.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And congratulations, Scott, and thank you for all your help over the years, as well.","Scott S. Cunningham - Edison International","Happy to, Jonathan.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. So I just wanted to ask about the cost of capital situation, and to make sure we understand the process. And there was some comments made at the Commission Meeting on Thursday about, I think, the ex parte being no longer in effect because the item was withdrawn from the agenda. Does that mean that your people can start to engage with the Commission, and figure out where they're headed with this, but you just don't have anything to share with us yet, or you may choose not to anyway, I would guess. But am I understanding that right?","Ronald Owen Nichols - Southern California Edison Co.","Yeah. Jon, this is Ron Nichols, they have opened back up, so we can request those meetings.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Are they the sort of meetings you'd have to disclose or would they not be ex parte meetings effectively, if ex parte is not in effect?","Ronald Owen Nichols - Southern California Edison Co.","No, they'll still be ex parte. There was a total ex parte ban for that period, they've lifted the ban, but they would still be reported meetings.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. So we might see some indication of you guys going in there and whatever, before we hear what's actually happening?","Ronald Owen Nichols - Southern California Edison Co.","Possible.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. That was one. And then, I was also curious on what you said about the tax in February and March, you said you'd seen continued benefit. Are those similar in size to what you saw in the first quarter or are you just letting us know there's a little tail that carries on?","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","No. Actually, all of the benefits from the exercise of stock options are now in the results for the first quarter. So that reference to the $0.10 variance and the $0.13 for the entire company on a consolidated basis, that takes into account all of those exercises through March.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","What you're really telling us is, you have roughly $0.10 of exercises over and above guidance for the front end of this year?","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","That's correct, we had $0.02 embedded in our guidance.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And that $0.02 would typically mostly show up in Q1, right?","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","Well, actually when we included it in guidance \u2013 in the original guidance, it was on the basis of option exercises that had already occurred, so they were in Q1, we knew about them.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. So it's not impossible you'd have more going through the year, but what you've had so far is roughly $0.10?","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","Right. It's always \u2013 you can't really predict when people will exercise, so that's what we have through the end of March.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And could I just go back to \u2013 I think I just heard you say that, we should be using 20% as an effective tax rate, is that just a 2017 comment or does that go beyond?","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","No, that's for next couple of years.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah. What was your \u2013 is that what you have in the rate case filing as well or?","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","The rate case filing is just a little bit more complicated just because there's a lots of puts and takes when you get into the RO (36:16) model, but from a forecasting perspective that's an appropriate number.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And this is the primary reason for the difference with statutory rate?","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","I'm sorry, could you say that again, Jon?","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","What is the \u2013 well, there's a big pictured reason for the difference with more of a normal rate?","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","Well, the biggest reason is really the property-related deductions, so the tax repay reductions, bonus et cetera.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Right. All right. Thanks for the help.","Operator","Thank you. Next in queue, we have Mr. Michael Lapides from Goldman Sachs. Michael, your line is now open.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey guys, congrats on a good quarter.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Hi, Michael.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Quick question, if I go back to the last rate case or two, when the final outcome came from the CPUC, were the ending revenue requirement in rate base assumptions, were they generally kind of closer to what your request was or were they kind of closer to what the ORA testimony implied?","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","Over the last few rate case, I think you know, the percentage of the CapEx that was authorized was, I'll say between the \u2013 approaching 92% in the last rate case, high 80s in the one prior to that. I think, you often do see some give and take over the course of the litigation of the proceeding, so that \u2013 where people first start in terms of their testimony when they're intervening may not be where we end up.","But it's hard to say, this is a new proceeding from the perspective of \u2013 we've added the grid modernization expenditures. And so, we'll have to see how that turns out, and it's one of the reasons why we didn't provide more boundaries around the outcomes as we have in the past, simply because it's a new type of investment or a different approach that we think people will review the testimony on.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. But if I look at their testimony, their testimony actually had a little bit lower rate of return in it, just 7.2% versus the 7.9%, I'm sorry, it maybe the other way around, I'm just curious why those things would be different, I would think both the ORA and SoCalEd would be using the same assumed rate of return in the testimony?","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","We definitely would be using the same assumed rate of return in testimony, based on our authorized rate of return, they may have some differences just from modeling issues or they may have adjusted some things due to, for example, things like customer deposits. So when you do the math through, it looks like a different calculated number. But I think the going in assumption on ROEs and cost of debt, et cetera, would be the same.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. And finally, just real quick. I think, the difference in rate base was about $700 million for 2018. How much of that was grid mod versus other items?","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","It was really all generally related to grid mod, it's related to both the portions related to the 2018 spend, but the results of 2017 spend that we had sort of the pre-test year spend on grid mod that also affects that number.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Thank you, Maria, much appreciated.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Michael.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Fleishman. Steve, your line is now open.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Yeah. Hi, good afternoon. Just at the end of your comments on cost of capital, you did say that you expect it \u2013 it will eventually be \u2013 the settlement will eventually be approved?","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Yeah. I just said...","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","And I just wanted...","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","...in my comments, and we view the settlement as a very fair one. TURN, ORA, the utilities all agreed to it, and importantly, there were simply no comments from anybody else in the proceeding. So there was no stated opposition to it.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. So even though you don't know exactly why the delay, there's nothing that would indicate any issues with the settlement?","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","We're not aware of anything.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Yeah.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Of course as I also said in my comments, I don't think, the PUC has made any public statements about the reason for the withdrawal of the PD or what the timing will be for next steps. We are staying tuned in that regard.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay, great. That was it. Thank you.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Thanks, Steve.","Operator","Thank you. For our next question, we have Mr. Greg Gordon from Evercore ISI. Greg your line is now open.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Hey, Greg.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Thanks. Congratulations, Scott.","Scott S. Cunningham - Edison International","Thanks, Greg.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","It's been a long good run, unfortunately most of us have to keep working for a while. I just want to be clear when you give the guidance on the effective tax rate, when we think about rate base math, because a lot of the benefits that you're experiencing that lower the effective tax rate are ultimately putting the balancing account, and refunded the customers.","We should still think about the right after-tax ROE assumption for the fiscal year for SCE still being at or around your cost of capital plus or minus incentive revenues, right? This isn't going to somehow allow you to \u2013 from a tax rate perspective earn in excess of the, the authorized return?","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","Absolutely correct. Yeah.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Okay. And your guidance on earnings per share at the parent as articulated, also contemplated that tax rate?","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","Yeah.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Okay. That's all I had. Everyone else asked my questions. Thank you.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Thanks, Greg.","Operator","Thank you. Next in queue we have Mr. Praful Mehta from Citigroup. Praful, your line is now open.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks, so much. Hi, guys, and congrats, Scott.","Scott S. Cunningham - Edison International","Thanks, Praful.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","So quickly, on O&M savings. Just want to understand the $0.06 O&M savings this quarter, how do you track that for the full year, and then going forward, given the GRC cycle, how should we think about O&M over the next GRC cycle?","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","So I think, Praful, you know that, we're always working on reducing O&M costs, affordability, operational and service excellence there, it's really key components of our strategy, because we need to manage customer rates over the long-term. So we're always going to be looking for those improvements, when we get to the beginning of a next rate case cycle, things that we've accumulated over time, we're going to return to the customer, but because we have to always be working in order to get them, you'll kind of see that happening periodically up until the point, and get to the rate case and then again after that we'll continue that work.","When I mentioned the $0.06 quarter-over-quarter change in O&M, this quarter that's obviously \u2013 reflects a lot of our operational and service excellence, initiatives. I was just noting that, not to extrapolate that to a trend line for the year necessarily, because you can have timing of initiatives that vary year-over-year, sometimes work happens in the latter half of the year as opposed to beginning of the year, but we have embedded in the guidance that we've given that $0.31 of combined efficiencies and financing benefit. And so, that's kind of where, I think, I would land at this point.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","And just to put an accent on that, when you think about it, Kevin Payne, and the team at SCE, at any point in time, I have a dozen or more different individual projects going on in areas of opportunity. So that adds to the rationale behind Maria's point about, this is not a simple linear process, there's real work underlying it with implementation steps that have to be taken.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got you. Thanks, guys. That's helpful color. And then, just secondly, wanted to just understand a little bit on the strategic side. There still seems to be potential M&A opportunities that can come up at the utility level, for example, in Texas. Wanted to understand how you're thinking broadly about M&A, and if there would be any interest if any opportunities come up?","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Yeah. Thanks, Praful. I'll take this one, and I think, you'll hear a repeat of similar comments I've made in prior earnings calls, general comment with Mr. Cunningham sitting here next to me, where he usually reminds me that, that we don't comment on M&A.","And then, I might go further and just say that, as we look at the environment, it is an environment where we are fortunate that we have these strong organic growth opportunity that we do at SCE, some not all, but some of the transactions that we've seen out there have been expensive acquisitions done by folks who don't enjoy the same sort of organic growth opportunity, so we don't feel any pressure to go pay the heavy premiums that you're seeing in the current market, in order to go chase further growth. That said, you never say never, always we remain open to understanding the landscape, but it'd have to be at a value point that is different from what we've seen in the market recently.","And finally, if you'll ever see us do a transaction, it will be very well considered in terms of not only the valuation aspects, but the actual real work behind the transaction, which is the integration aspects. That's where you see a lot of deals goes out, and when you actually get real people and real teams together, and have to merge companies, and having done some of that in my days as a consultant, we know it's very hard work.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got you. And just finally, one quick clarification. I know, the electrification call was very helpful and you talked about the opportunity there, but what does that mean for gas generators, given there was an earnings call from an IPP talking about RMR contracts. How do you see that playing out, and is there a need to have some gas around? Thanks, guys.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","I'll give you a quick answer, and Kevin Payne or Ron Nichols might elaborate more. Thinking of the reality in our current California market is that, these resource stack includes gas, gas is needed, and I think, I've even said in prior comments that we need to make sure that the market pricing structures are fair to all the parties involved, and certainly we're seeing the pinch that gas generators are feeling.","That said, over the longer-term, as we see the state continue to move towards 40% greenhouse gas reductions by 2030 and 80% by 2050, we do expect that, the amount of gas in the system will continue to be squeezed down, if the state is really going to make this greenhouse gas reduction and air quality targets. Kevin or Ron, anything you guys would add to that or?","Ronald Owen Nichols - Southern California Edison Co.","Well, I'd just add to that, we do see a need for gas, but we're going to see more of it just being peakers and very flexible generation to be able to meet the ramps that we see as we increase more and more renewables. But it will be there likely burning less fuel over time.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Just on that point that, you might have seen, I think we talked publicly about couple of projects we did at two of our utility owned peakers, where we integrated 10 megawatts of battery storage into each of those 50 megawatt peaker projects. And to Ron's point, that's the kind of flexibility that's needed because more and more gas isn't about meeting peak demand, it's about meeting the ramps in the much more volatile California system.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got you. Great. Thank you so much, guys.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","You bet.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Angie Storozynski from Macquarie. Angie, your line is now open.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Hi, Angie.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Hi, how are you? So, just a couple of small questions. So on the MHI reversal of legal costs, I understand that you haven't recorded it yet. But could you quantify it, assuming the current allocation of the award, would it be about $0.09?","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","Yeah. So we had about $79 million of legal expenses that we \u2013 in total, a portion of which we had already recovered, and so the remaining amount would be about $0.09 we'd mentioned in the fourth quarter call. To the extent we realize that, that would be a core item.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. And so that would be trued up along with the update to your guidance on the second quarter earnings call, correct?","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","I think we'll still be looking at the status of whether or not the CPUC has determined reasonableness before what we do that.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. And then on the transmission ROE, I mean, I'm actually looking at the slide here, can you tell me if this 10.5% on the transmission ROE, I mean, is it still subject to the FERC quorum, what are we waiting for there?","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","That's our 2017 ROE, we're going to file it later this year for 2018. So the 2017 number has already been fully litigated and negotiated; we'd have to go back at the end of this year to get a new arrangement.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. And the last question. So yes, we're waiting for the remaining interveners to opine on your grid mod CapEx, among others. But now that you can actually talk to the Commission, are you getting any guidance or you think you're going to get any guidance as to what the Commission actually thinks about this level of spending? And what is the right pace of adaptation of those CapEx that is in a way requested by the state?","Ronald L. Litzinger - Edison International","Yeah. Angie, this is Ron. I think that you might \u2013 there might be a little bit of confusion. When we were talking about our ability to go back and talk to the Commission, that's in the cost of capital case. We still are obviously in the middle of the GRC at this point right now.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","The GRC decision is where we expect to get firm guidance on re-modernization by way of what approval that we get for the grid mod request that we made there.","Ronald L. Litzinger - Edison International","Right. So that's...","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. So just besides the positions of the interveners we're not going to know anything about the grid mod CapEx until the GRC approval?","Ronald L. Litzinger - Edison International","Well, there is still the separate DRP (51:27) proceeding, and earlier they had intended to have something to us by end of Q2; now it looks like that's going to slip later into the year at this point. So there could be \u2013 it could be guidance, and that, we would not \u2013 it may or not be that \u2013 it wouldn't be explicit as to the GRC. It'd be broader guidance in general \u2013 general policy is where they're headed, but that would be later this year.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Fantastic. And Scott, thank you so much for all your help. Thank you.","Scott S. Cunningham - Edison International","My pleasure, Angie.","Operator","Thank you. Next in queue, we have Mr. Travis Miller from Morningstar. Travis, your line is now open.","Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc.","Good afternoon. Thank you. I think, again Scott it's worth reiterating, thank you. It's been a pleasure and certainly all the accolades are well-deserved, and I'll say, I hope you enjoy retirement in steps over time.","Scott S. Cunningham - Edison International","Well done, Travis.","Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc.","Apart from that, I have a very quick question, follow up on that O&M. So the O&M and financing benefits, this quarter, if I'm reading that correctly, it was $0.06 lower O&M, $0.03 higher financing, so net $0.03, and that corresponds to that $0.31 in guidance such that there's $0.28 left, am I reading all that correctly?","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","No, the variances I was referring to were quarter-over-quarter, so year-over-year not relative to guidance. But the guidance that we gave had actually $0.31 of total benefit, we're continuing to work towards that, and extracting that value over the course of the year. So, it's two different, I'll say, comparison points.","Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc.","Oh, because it was off the rate base, okay. I got it.","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","Thanks.","Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc.","How are you tracking on that $0.31?","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","So, we reaffirmed guidance at $4.14, as Pedro mentioned earlier, the bias to the upside.","Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc.","Okay. Very good. Thanks a lot.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Thanks, Trav.","Operator","Thank you. Next, we have Mr. Shar Pourreza from Guggenheim Partners. Shar, your line is now open.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Hey, guys. My questions were answered. Scott, congrats on the retirement.","Scott S. Cunningham - Edison International","Thanks, Shar.","Operator","One moment please. Thank you. Next, we have Mr. Paul Fremont from Mizuho. Paul, your line is now open.","Paul Fremont - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","All right. Thank you very much. First off all, best wishes to you, Scott and thanks for all your help. Can you guys breakout the EEG losses for the quarter and also how are you tracking relative to your expectation on the year for that?","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","Yeah, we have actually a table in the 10-Q when you get a chance to look at it, but it's about...","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","$6 million.","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","It's $6 million, so it's roughly $0.02 or so. It's \u2013 as you know, there's no \u2013 as I noted earlier, there is no quarter-over-quarter variance, and that's consistent with the guidance that we had for the year as well.","Paul Fremont - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Okay. And then, on the holding company, what debt level would you expect to end the year at for EIX holding company?","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","Yeah. So we don't forecast sort of where we'll end up in terms of debt either at SCE or at Edison International. Right now, we're about 12% of the consolidated debt as a company, and we think that we're managing to a reasonable level. We're fairly conservative about the SCE and the EIX.","Paul Fremont - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","And then, on absolute basis, are you about $1.5 billion at EIX parent?","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","We just termed out. So that's about right. I should go back and double-check that, it's about right. All right.","Paul Fremont - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. That was the last question. I will now turn the call back to Mr. Cunningham.

Pizarro","Thanks, Sam, and good afternoon, everyone. As we review the results for 2018, I would like to reiterate that our thoughts are with all those across the state who are affected by the wildfire crisis. Our company\u2019s number one priority continues to be the safety of our public, our customers and our employees, and we remain committed to supporting our communities affected by these events.","Turning to our financial results, Edison International\u2019s core earnings for 2018 were $4.15 per share compared to $4.50 a year ago. As I have mentioned before, comparison of year-over-year results is not particularly meaningful because SCE has not received a decision in its 2018 General Rate Case.","For the fourth quarter, EIX reported core earnings of $0.94 per share. This excludes non-core items, mainly a $1.8 billion after-tax charge related to existing and expected claims arising from the wildfire and mudslide events that occurred in SCE\u2019s service territory in 2017 and 2018. I will explain the accounting rationale for this later in my comments, and Maria will cover our overall financial performance in more detail in her remarks.","Today, the Board of Directors of Edison International declared its first quarter 2019 common stock dividend of $61.25 cents per share. In making its decision to declare the dividend, the Board again evaluated a broad range of potential negative outcomes pertaining to the wildfires in 2017 and 2018, and the mudslides in Montecito in 2018 and determined that the California law requirements for the declaration were met.","The Board\u2019s evaluation took into consideration a broad range of potentially unrecovered wildfire-related costs and financing scenarios, including potential outcomes worse than what are reflected in the charge accrued as of the fourth quarter 2018.","Mitigating increased wildfire risk and its related financial impacts continues to be our top priority. Catastrophic wildfires across our state have caused billions of dollars of property damage and taken over a hundred lives. It is evident that the risk conditions in which all of California\u2019s utilities deploy and operate electric infrastructure have changed significantly.","From an operational standpoint, SCE has taken substantial steps to reduce the risk of wildfires in our service territory. We are going beyond long-standing industry practices to address the conditions we are facing. The foundation we are laying to mitigate the risk of utility equipment-ignited fires is reflected in several recent regulatory filings. These include our Grid Safety and Resiliency Program that we filed with the Commission last September, the Risk Assessment and Mitigation Phase of our 2021 GRC filed in November, and our proposed Wildfire Mitigation Plan which was filed earlier this month.","These filings detailed the near and long-term actions that SCE is taking to significantly reduce the risk of fires starting, and effectively fortify the system against future impacts of climate change. Specifically, SCE\u2019s Wildfire Mitigation Plan focuses on three key areas: first, is hardening the grid to significantly reduce potential fire ignitions; second, is bolstering situational awareness capabilities; and third is enhancing operational practices, including by harnessing the power of data analytics.","SCE will seek opportunities to accelerate wildfire mitigation efforts beyond the 2019 compliance goals proposed in our plan where possible. The CPUC and stakeholders are reviewing this plan, including through workshops, and SCE expects approval by May, within the 90-day timetable laid out by SB 901. As part of our Wildfire Mitigation Plan, we are enhancing and accelerating inspections on all of the company\u2019s overhead transmission and distribution power lines in high fire risk areas. These risk-based inspections go beyond compliance checks, enabling us to both make needed repairs and conduct preventive maintenance to reduce risks and enhance public safety.","In addition, across these high fire risk areas, in 2019 SCE plans to identify and remove 7,500 hazard trees that pose a threat to the company\u2019s power lines; replace at least 96 circuit miles of bare conductor with covered conductor; install more than 7,800 fast-acting, current-limiting fuses; and deploy 62 high definition cameras and 350 micro weather stations.","We continue to look for additional solutions and are evaluating further mitigation measures such as enhanced vegetation management and other new technologies. We are also proposing to use public safety power shutoffs when situational awareness warrants a grid shutdown in high wildfire risk areas for customer and community safety purposes.","Turning to regulatory actions. I would like to give you a brief update on the other key wildfire related regulatory proceedings before the CPUC. In January, the CPUC approved the establishment of an interim memorandum account, effective in September 2018, to track our expenditures in the $582 million Grid Safety and Resiliency Program while the Commission considers our overall request.","We have also filed an advice letter to establish an additional memo account to track and record incremental costs related to our SB901 Wildfire Mitigation Plan that are beyond those included in the GS&RP and our 2018 GRC. In February, the CPUC had approved our Z-factor advice letter to recover $107 million in incremental wildfire-related liability insurance. We expect to collect this amount through rates over the course of 2019.","Finally, on February 11th, SCE filed comments in a proceeding opened by the Commission to implement the part of Senate Bill 901 related to determining the maximum amount of wildfire costs that may be disallowed before harming customers; some refer to this as the Customer Harm Threshold or Financial Stress Test.","See proposed to extend the proceeding\u2019s scope beyond establishing a narrow stress test methodology. We recommended that the Commission first establish a clear, durable and repeatable process for assessing the prudency of utilities wildfire operations and the timely recovery of wildfire-related costs and expenses. We have asked for expedited action and decision on this process tied to approval of the wildfire mitigation plans in May or June of this year.","We asked that the Commission deem an IOU prudent for cost recovery purposes, if the utility is found to have substantially complied with its Commission approved wildfire mitigation plan. Substantial compliance is the appropriate standard by which to judge an IOU\u2019s wildfire mitigation efforts. We see it as a good faith attempt to meet every reasonable objective of the utility\u2019s approved WMP, but utilities cannot reasonably be expected to be infallible.","Remember, prudency does not and cannot mean perfect operations. This approach is similar to that adopted by California in Assembly Bill 57, which was implemented after the energy crisis to provide for Commission-approved energy procurement plans to ensure compliance with those plans. We have also asked the Commission to adopt a more timely financing authority and approval process to better match the financing capabilities of the utilities to the timing of the cash flow needs for wildfire damage claims that we may bear.","We continue to challenge the application of inverse condemnation in the courts. We have pending motions challenging inverse in two cases arising out of the Liberty Fire. In all these cases, the fact that an IOU cannot broadly socialize costs runs directly counter to the principle underlying the application of inverse condemnation.","On the legislative front, we are encouraged by the actions that Governor Gavin Newsom has taken since assuming office in January. During his first full day in office, the Governor made clear that the issue of increased wildfire risk is a priority of his administration. He issued two executive orders and proposed a significant increase in the State\u2019s resources dedicated to wildfire prevention and suppression.","The Governor has also acknowledged the importance of having financially healthy utilities to meet the State\u2019s ambitious climate change policies. In his first State of the State address on February 12th , the Governor indicated he has convened a Strike Team which includes financial advisors from the energy sector and bankruptcy lawyers who will work with the Governor\u2019s staff to develop a comprehensive strategy that will be presented within 60 days.","He strongly emphasize the climate change adaptation is more than a utility issue and specifically noted that regulations and insurance practices created decades ago did n0t anticipate these changes. The Governor called for the state to map out longer-term strategies for California\u2019s energy future and to ensure that these current issues not stand in the way of California\u2019s clean energy policies and the cost of climate change not fall on those least able to afford it.","Overall, we are encouraged by these comments and his demonstrated interest in moving quickly to address these challenges. The Governor also appointed a new Commissioner to the CPUC and three members to the Commission on Catastrophic Wildfire Cost and Recovery. This Commission was created by SB901 and tasked with making recommendations on the equitable distribution of catastrophic wildfire costs and damages.","This five-member commission, including appointees from each chamber of the State Legislature, is expected to hold at least four public meetings and submit its report by July 2019 or sooner, as requested by the Governor. The first public meeting was held on February 25th . Former CPUC Commissioner Carla Peterman was unanimously selected as the Chair.","Based on the meeting, the scope of work will include an assessment of the status of utility wildfire liabilities, and recommendations on the equitable distribution of these costs and a fund mechanism for payment of wildfire damages. The Commission will evaluate the impact of these recommendations on the commercial and residential insurance markets, and on communities.","In addition to the Governor\u2019s office, we continue to engage with State legislative leaders on these issues with a goal of reforming policies on how the State addresses wildfire prevention and response that are essential to protecting Californians and the State\u2019s Clean energy policy goals. February 22nd was the deadline for the introduction of bills in the legislature and over two dozen wildfire related bills were introduced.","As we know, through the legislative process, we may see many of these bills amended before the end of the session. We are fully engaged on proposed legislation regarding SCE\u2019s wildfire risk mitigation efforts and are advocating for the need for healthy utilities through reforms to the current uncertain cost recovery structure at the CPUC.","Like our legislators and other stakeholders, our focus is on our communities. In light of the impact of wildfires on communities within SCE\u2019s service territory, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors decided, in consultation with management and with our full support and agreement, that no annual incentive award would be paid for myself and my four senior-most executive colleagues.","The Committee\u2019s decision was not a reflection on the performance of the company or these five individuals. In addition, the full Board approved a $3 million donation to the Edison International Wildfire Assistance Fund to enhance community resiliency and wildfire prevention and mitigation. We hope our shareholders will agree that this use of your resources will have a positive impact on our communities and is worth doing in this exceptional and challenging period in our region\u2019s history.","Now I would like to give you an update on the 2017 and 2018 wildfires and mudslide. Investigations into the causes of the fires are ongoing and final determinations of liability, including determinations of whether SCE was negligent, will only be made during the lengthy and complex litigation process. Even when investigations are still pending and liability is disputed, an assessment of probable outcomes, including through the possible settlement of disputed claims, may require a charge to be accrued under accounting standards.","Therefore, as of December 31, 2018, based on SCE\u2019s internal review into the facts and circumstances of the wildfire and mudslide events in 2017 and 2018, and consideration of the risks associated with litigation, EIX and SCE expect to incur a material loss in connection with these events. We have accrued a non-core, after-tax charge, net of expected recoveries from insurance and FERC customers, of $1.8 billion. This charge corresponds to the lower end of the reasonably estimated range of expected potential losses that may be incurred and is subject to change as additional information becomes available.","We believe that prudently incurred costs should be recoverable in electric rates. However, given the substantial uncertainty created by the CPUC\u2019s flawed decision to deny all of SDG&E\u2019s uninsured wildfire costs in the 2017 San Diego WEMA decision, we have not recorded a corresponding CPUC regulatory asset.","Based on history and regulatory practice, we have recorded a FERC regulatory asset. As we get additional information regarding the CPUC\u2019s framework, and potential changes to it through future CPUC or legislative actions, we will continue to evaluate our ability to recognize a CPUC regulatory asset.","Looking ahead, SCE continues to make significant investments in electric infrastructure including Transportation Electrification which we believe are necessary to support California\u2019s ambitious environmental policies. Specifically related to electric vehicles, in December, the CPUC approved an additional $22 million in bridge funding to continue our Charge Ready pilot at existing levels until the Commission approves additional funding requested through the Charge Ready Phase 2 program. ","You will recall that we filed the Charge Ready 2 application in 2018, requesting an additional $760 million in funding over four years. This includes $561 million in capital spend for infrastructure to support 48,000 new EV charging ports and increased marketing, education and outreach. We anticipate a proposed decision in the second or third quarter of this year. Moving to our 2018 General Rate Case, we should get a proposed decision soon but cannot speculate on the exact timing.","At the request level, the rate base is forecasted to grow to $34.7 billion in 2020, which translates into a 9.8% cumulative average growth rate over the 3-year GRC period. This rate base forecast will be updated once a decision is issued by the CPUC.","I would now like to provide an update on our operational and service excellence efforts and a few of the key non-financial metrics our Board uses in measuring our performance.","Operational and service excellence starts with the safety of our workers and our communities. This continues to be a major priority across our company and is at the top of our core values. Our 2018 performance on employee safety did not meet our expectations; particularly, our rate of injuries leading us today's away, on restricted duty, or transferred -- known as the \u201cDART\u201d rate -- fell short of our target.","Nonetheless, we continue to focus on improving our safety culture. In 2018, we enhanced our efforts on training, especially for our field employees who work on higher risk jobs.","Turning to another key measure, customer satisfaction, SCE improved its ranking in residential customer satisfaction, and we believe that first quartile performance is achievable. SCE already ranks in the first quartile for business customer satisfaction. Furthering our operational excellence goals, SCE significantly improved system reliability in 2018 and exceeded its goals for the year.","We implemented several operational actions to reduce the number and duration of repair outages. We are aiming to achieve top-quartile performance in this area. More broadly, we took significant steps in 2018 to deploy digital technologies to transform processes across our business, and expect this to be a major thrust in 2019 and beyond.","Finally, SCE also improved its cost performance in 2018 and exceeded its goal of controlling costs in support of affordable customer rates. We believe our cost efficiency performance, measured in terms of O&M cost per customer, is within the top quartile of our peer group. We will strive to maintain this level of performance across the bulk of our business, but we recognize that wildfire-related risk mitigation and insurance costs will add significant pressure beyond what our peers in other states experience. ","We will remain focused on improving our safety culture and broader operational excellence, while we continue to actively engage with State leaders on comprehensive policies to address statewide wildfire risk mitigation. At the same time, SCE will continue to invest in grid hardening and resiliency as well as the other capital programs that support the state\u2019s ambitious clean energy goals.","With that, turn it over to Maria to provide her financial report.","Maria C. Rigatti","Thank you, Pedro and good afternoon, everyone. My comments today will cover fourth quarter and full-year results for 2018 compared to the same period a year ago, our updated capital expenditure forecast, and other financial updates for SCE and EIX. ","As we\u2019ve communicated to you before, until we receive a decision on the 2018 General Rate Case, we will continue to recognize revenues from CPUC activities largely based on 2017 authorized base revenue requirements with reserves taken for known items including the cost of capital decision and tax reform. Also, consistent with prior quarters, we are providing our SCE key drivers analysis at the prior combined statutory tax rate of approximately 41% for both 2018 and 2017 for comparability purposes.","Before we take a look at our core earnings drivers, let me provide a bit more detail regarding the $1.8 billion non-core charge related to the 2017\/2018 wildfires and mudslide events that Pedro mentioned earlier. Please turn to page 2. 9 We have recorded a gross charge related to these events of $4.7 billion prior to recoveries and taxes which represents the lower end of a reasonably estimated range of outcomes.","We have also recorded a $2 billion insurance receivable and a $135 million regulatory asset related to FERC recovery. The combination of these results in the $1.8 billion after-tax charge. Considering the San Diego WEMA decision and the uncertainty regarding how the CPUC will interpret and apply its prudency standard in wildfire cost-recovery proceedings, we have not at this time recorded a regulatory asset related to CPUC recovery.","We will continue to evaluate the probability of recovery based on available evidence, including guidance from the Wildfire Commission and new judicial, legislative and regulatory decisions.","Please turn to page 3. For the fourth quarter 2018, Edison International reported core earnings of $0.94 per share, a decline of $0.16 from the same period last year. From the table on the right-hand side, you will see that SCE had a negative $0.14 core EPS variance year-over-year. There are a few items that account for the bulk of this variance. To begin, lower revenues had a negative impact of $0.06 cents. This includes lower CPUC revenue of $0.04 due to the recognition of revenues largely based on 2017 authorized base revenue requirements with reserves for known items and lower FERC and other operating revenue of $0.02.","There was also a negative impact of $0.03 due to higher O&M. This is primarily related to increased vegetation management costs. We had a negative impact of $0.04 from higher financing costs due to increased borrowings and higher interest expense on balancing accounts, partially offset by higher AFUDC equity.","Finally, increased income tax benefits were largely offset by an increase in property taxes and other expenses. For the quarter, EIX Parent and Other had a negative $0.02 core earnings variance related primarily to two items. First, a negative variance of $0.04 related to a goodwill impairment at Edison Energy. The impairment reflects a shift in the business model since we purchased the companies which make up Edison Energy in 2015 to our more measured proof-of-concept approach.","This was partially offset by an income tax benefit of $0.02 primarily related to a reduction in uncertain tax positions that resulted from the settlement of our 1994 through $2.6 California tax audit partially offset by the lower 2018 corporate tax rate on pre-tax loss.","Please turn to Page 4. For the full year, Edison International core earnings per share decreased $0.35 from the prior year. This includes core earnings decreases of $0.16 and $0.19 at SCE and EIX Parent and Other, respectively. Significant drivers at SCE include higher O&M expenses of $0.13 related to increased wildfire insurance premiums and vegetation management costs as well as a negative variance of $0.12 cents due to higher net financing costs. These were largely offset by a tax benefit of $0.19, primarily from higher income tax benefits, including true-ups related to the filing of our 2016 and 2017 tax returns.","At EIX Parent and Other, the majority of the $0.19 decrease in core earnings was due to the absence of tax benefits in 2018 relative to 2017, largely related to stock-based compensation and federal tax settlements. As I have mentioned previously, earnings comparisons pending a 2018 GRC decision are not meaningful. We expect to record a true-up when we receive a decision and we have established a memo account to track costs. The decision will be retroactive to January 1, 2018.","Please turn to Page 5. While we continue to wait for a decision on SCE\u2019s 2018 general rate case, SCE has developed, and is executing against, a capital expenditure plan for 2019 in support of our business objectives. This plan will allow SCE to execute its capital spending program over the three-year GRC period, that is 2018 through 2020, to meet what is ultimately authorized in the decision while minimizing the associated risk of unauthorized spending.","Our total 2019 CapEx forecast is $4.5 billion and includes $346 million for wildfire related programs largely related to the GS&RP we filed last year and the Wildfire Mitigation Plan we filed in early February. We have accelerated some activities included in our GS&RP into 2019. This acceleration will primarily target our covered conductor program. ","We will track this spending through various memorandum accounts and pursue cost recovery through current and subsequent CPUC proceedings. Given the significance of wildfire-related risks and the need for skilled resources to complete activities, SCE may reallocate spending authorized in the 2018 GRC to maximize wildfire mitigation efforts.","For 2020, we continue to present our capital forecast at the request level included in our 2018 GRC. While we wait for our 2018 GRC decision, over the long-term, we continue to see SCE investing at least $4 billion per year and adding at least $2 billion per year of rate base for the foreseeable future. As SCE focuses on investments in the grid and resiliency and continues to be a key enabler of California\u2019s ambitious climate change policies.","On Page 6, our rate base remains essentially the same from the last forecast and it is still shown at our GRC request levels. I would note that we expect to update our full forecast when we get a proposed decision on the 2018 GRC. On Page 7, you will see our financial assumptions for 2019.","As I mentioned in prior quarters, we will not be providing earnings guidance for 2019 until we receive a final decision on the GRC. However, we have laid out some additional information on this page that you may consider as you model 2019 and beyond. This includes, other items that reflect some considerations outside of the simplified rate base model. The approval of the Z-factor filing related to recovery of previously-incurred wildfire insurance premiums will create a benefit of approximately $0.05 per share in the first quarter of 2019.","Additionally, we expect energy efficiency incentives of $0.05 for 2019. This includes $0.03 related to a 2018 CPUC approval that was delayed and which we now expect in the first or second quarter of this year. We are still in settlement discussions regarding our 2018 FERC Formula Rate. However, we plan to file a new Formula Rate with an updated cost of capital to reflect the impacts of recent events in California since FERC procedures require a new filing when requesting a rate increase.","For EIX Parent and Other, we expect an earnings drag of $0.30 to $0.35 per share. Included in this is approximately one penny per share per month related to EIX operating expenses. The overall increase from last year is primarily due to higher forecasted interest expense driven by higher long-term debt issuances and rates. At Edison Energy, we continue to work towards our target of achieving a break-even run rate for earnings by the end of this year.","I now want to provide a few comments on other financial topics. Let me start with our wildfire insurance coverage. Market conditions are more difficult than last year and we continue to see a decline in the number of insurance providers willing to underwrite policies in California. We have also included co-insurance in the structure in order to more effectively obtain coverage.","SCE has secured new wildfire-specific insurance coverage of approximately $700 million from early February through the end of May, subject to $10 million of self-insurance and up to $15 million of co-insurance. SCE has also initiated efforts to place coverage for the period starting June 1st and currently has $750 million of wildfire-specific insurance coverage from that date through June 30, 2020, subject to a $10 million of self-insurance and up to $115 million of co-insurance.","We will continue our efforts to secure additional coverage in amounts generally in line with previous years for the period June 2019 through June 2020. The 2019 wildfire insurance cost, prior to any regulatory deferrals, would be $321 million for the current policies.","Over time, we have worked diligently to maintain a strong and flexible balance sheet. SCE will continue to access the capital markets to support its large investment program. Both SCE\u2019s and EIX\u2019s credit ratings have been negatively impacted as the rating agencies consider the ability of the regulators and legislators to provide a durable framework for wildfire cost recovery.","As we work with state and regulatory officials to find a solution to the current problem, SCE will continue to use its first mortgage bond secured debt structure when issuing new debt as well as other options such as commercial paper and term loans to meet short-term requirements. EIX continues to have access to the debt capital markets although currently investors require much higher spreads than were necessary for previous debt issuances.","As you are aware, SCE is required to maintain an authorized capital structure under its CPUC jurisdiction and the current authorized equity level is 48% calculated over a rolling 37-month period. As of December 31st, SCE is in compliance with this requirement with a 49.7% average equity ratio. In addition, SCE is required to file an application for waiver if in any month, its actual equity ratio, or spot ratio, falls 1% below its authorized level.","Based on the non-cash charge related to wildfires included in the year-end financial statements, our spot ratio has fallen below this level and SCE filed an application notifying the CPUC. The waiver requests exclusion of any equity charges resulting from the 2017 and 2018 wildfires and mudslides as well as any debt issued to finance payment of these claims.","We have requested that these adjustments to the calculation of SCE\u2019s regulatory capital structure remain in effect until a determination is made regarding recovery of costs related to these events. While the CPUC reviews the waiver application, SCE is considered in compliance with the capital structure rules and therefore continues to issue debt and make dividends in the ordinary course of business and considering its capital spending and other needs.","As discussed, we continue to have significant capital needs, those that will ultimately be authorized in our 2018 GRC as well as additional capital needs related to wildfire prevention and mitigation and programs that support the environmental objectives of the state. Our upcoming Cost of Capital proceeding will be an important venue to demonstrate the critical nature of the work that investor-owned utilities undertake in California and the need to support financially healthy utilities.","It is imperative that we maintain a robust capital structure and strengthen our investment grade credit ratings and be positioned to continue to attract capital to support our customers\u2019 needs. We will be evaluating and requesting the appropriate level of equity return and capital structure changes to achieve these objectives. We look forward to giving you an update after our Cost of Capital filing in April. That concludes my remarks.","Sam Ramraj","Caron, please open the question -- call for questions. As a reminder, we request you to limit yourself to one question and one follow-up, so everyone in line has the opportunity to ask questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jonathan Arnold of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Jonathan Arnold","Good morning -- good afternoon guys.","Pedro J. Pizarro","Hi, Jonathan.","Maria C. Rigatti","Hi, Jonathan.","Jonathan Arnold","Don\u2019t know which way this are. I guess, is it possible, Pedro, can you give us some insight into the background to the taking of this charge today based -- it doesn\u2019t seem to us for where we sit as there is much new information that\u2019s being publicly announced. And so I\u2019m just curious sort of what you know today that you didn\u2019t know last quarter that prompts the charge of this pie?","Pedro J. Pizarro","Well, Jon, let me start with that and thanks for the question. We tried to provide you a framing of that in both my remarks and Maria's. And let me just sum it up again by saying, we're looking at the totality of the -- not only the events themselves or continuing internal evaluation of the facts, but we're also looking at the number of claims that are being filed, the potential for litigation, litigation history in similar cases. And so when you put it all that together, we determine that we face a potential material liability here and under the accounting rules we felt that it was appropriate to disclose that through the reserve and in this case with the accounting rules, you need to have somebody that is first probable -- and believe it's probable. And secondly, it needs to be estimable. In this case, we believe we can estimate the number we provided today as the lower end of the range for potential outcomes. To be honest with you, I think we indicated this, we will be very hard pressed to try and estimate an upper end of the range. And so we provided investors the combination of the disclosure with the reserve in it as well as disclosure that says that actual results could be different. Importantly, and we covered this in our comments, but just to make sure that the folks understood the rationale on this one, there's the gross exposure, the gross of total reserve, there's a netting out from that of insurers, we are confident in our ability to access our $2 billion through our insurance policies. And then we also netted out FERC recovery amounts. But importantly, we did not net out -- we were not able to create a regulatory asset for CPUC recoveries. And as I explained, this is really due to the deep uncertainty that was created by the CPUC's flawed decision on the San Diego WEMA case. So given that that is the one major data point that we have here in California in terms of how the CPUC would handle cases and the fact that they essentially adopted a perfection standard as opposed to a prudency standard, they allocated zero cost recoveries in San Diego instead of some proportionate cost recovery based on a more detail examination of level of prudency. Given all of that, we did not feel it was appropriate to record a regulatory asset for CPC recoveries offsetting some portion of the overall liability. So that\u2019s how we ended up with a $1.8 billion after-tax charge. Maria, I don't know if there's anything you would add to that?","Maria C. Rigatti","No.","Pedro J. Pizarro","No?","Jonathan Arnold","Perfect. That's very, very helpful. Thank you, Pedro. And for my follow-up, could I just ask, what happens from a practical standpoint if the legislature and\/or the CPUC don't move quickly enough to convince the rating agencies to keep your investment grade ahead of next fire season? Can we -- could you just review what the implications of a downgrade would be if it came to that.","Pedro J. Pizarro","Jon, I will kick it off and sure Maria will have more here. But from a rating agency perspective, rating agencies as you know are independent, they\u2019ve been publishing their views on the subject. I think most recently S&P's report was frankly fairly pointed about, in their view which we share, the need for action at the state level to reform the overall liability framework. And they indicated a strong likelihood of further potential downgrades if there isn't reforms at the state level in the near-term, which will take, I mean, months, not years. And so, I will let Maria talk about the implications where we -- to be downgraded below investment grade. It becomes an issue of cost. We believe there is access there, but certainly at a very different cost ultimately due to the consumer. Just before turning it over to Maria, little commenting on what happens down in Sacramento, it feel like I\u2019m repeating myself in terms of prior calls, but once again, it feels like it's early days later down in the card, but it's early days again, right. We now have the Wildfire Commission that has just been formed and had its first meeting, as I mentioned in my comments, we have the Governor having created his Strike Team. Those are advisors to the Strike Team getting organized. You've seen the comments that the governor has made. It seems like there is an understanding, certainly in the part of the Governor and his administration that this is a substantial issue, not just for utilities, but clearly to the broader objectives in the California economy. And so it feels like the case for action is certainly being articulated. But how that translates into specific recommendations, particularly along the areas that we are stressing leading to reform that the cost recovery framework, and also looking at additional potential vehicles like potential for our Wildfire Insurance Fund or needs for securitization, potential exposures of the like, lot of devils in those details and we will be very engaged, but it is difficult to handicap at this point when -- specifically where that might be addressed in Sacramento. Maria, maybe on the implications?","Maria C. Rigatti","Sure. So, Jonathan, obviously there is the cost issue associated with the downgrade and [indiscernible] market and see where costs would go at lower ratings. I would note that for SCE and also it's going to bleed through into their cost of capital filing because as their debt costs increase that's going to be part of the filing that we make and ultimately demonstrate to the CPUC and that will -- at some point in time when that case is concluded, it would then flow back through to their cost of capital. So there is a connection there. I think the other thing that people usually are considering when they ask about implications of a downgrade would be collateral posting. We have disclosure around -- we had disclosure around that for a while. If we get downgraded below investment grade under our PPAs, I'm going to say, there is about a $25 million impact. Obviously, that's somewhat related to where prices are at the time, but that's at the point in time that we did the calculations that $25 million. There is another amount that we would have proposed around some of our environmental remediation, a few other cats and dogs, but I\u2019m going to really round numbers; it's about $100 million thereabouts. So that's -- I think those are the two primary cost implications of a downgrade.","Jonathan Arnold","Perfect. Thanks. Thank you for the very cool answers.","Pedro J. Pizarro","Thanks, Jonathan.","Maria C. Rigatti","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Praful Mehta from Citigroup. Your line is now open.","Pedro J. Pizarro","Hi, Praful.","Praful Mehta","Hi. So maybe just to get this out of the way, dividends, is there -- if there is no wildfire litigation that\u2019s done this year, but there is also no wildfire. There is no risk of dividends at this point as we understand it or are there any other scenarios if there is a downgrade that could impact dividends in anyway?","Pedro J. Pizarro","Praful, I think you will -- sorry, this is going to sound repetitive, but once again, the Board took a look at a broad range of potential negative outcomes and determined that we met all the conditions to continue to issue this dividend. So we told you before, we never make that decision until the quarter when we make it for that quarter's dividend installment. But I think you should read into the comments today that once again the Board looked at a broad spectrum of potential bad outcomes and feel comfortable with this next dividend.","Praful Mehta","Got you. Fair enough, that\u2019s super clear. And then, secondly, in terms of the charge, I know that the language says lower-end and you've highlighted a couple of times of the charges, the lower end of the range that you've looked at. Is there any color you can provide on what other elements that would make it go up to the higher end or -- brought in the upper end of your range of outcomes that could increase the charge? Any color on that would be helpful.","Maria C. Rigatti","So, Praful, I think as Pedro noted earlier, we actually can't estimate a high-end of the range. I think the accounting rules are pretty clear. You obviously -- we as an organization did look at a lot of different factors, looked at a lot of different components, did check data points across the board from its vailable from the insurance commissioner to what we're seeing in our litigation. But it is as per the accounting rules, the lower end of a reasonably estimated range of outcomes. I think that's as much as we can share with you. We went through a diligent process, but that\u2019s the evaluation at the time.","Praful Mehta","Fair enough. And just one -- last clarification, on the regulatory asset point that you mentioned where you're not creating regulatory asset for any recovery related to the charge that you've taken. You highlighted the WEMA case, but since the WEMA case the Senate Bill 901 did expand what the CPUC can do in terms of review and gave them broader scope to allow for recovery. Is your -- should we read into that that you believe that the Senate Bill 901's broader provisions aren't sufficient and there is still enough uncertainty that you didn't feel comfortable taking the regulatory asset related to the charge.","Maria C. Rigatti","So Praful -- so we rely on objectively verifiable evidence and very heavily emphasizes prior precedents. So the WEMA cases is a very strong prior precedent. I think what I noted in my prepared remarks was that we will continue to evaluate the situation based on additional information as it becomes available whether that\u2019s from the Wildfire Cost Recovery Commission, other legislative or judicial regulatory proceedings, etcetera. But I think there is a very strong emphasis when you come to these conclusions on actual precedents.","Praful Mehta","Got you. Super helpful. Thank you, guys.","Pedro J. Pizarro","See you Praful.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs. Sir, your line is now open.","Michael Lapides","Hey, guys. Thank you for taking my question. Real quickly, can you talk to us about the status -- Pedro, you referenced the litigation regarding inverse condemnation in the application. Can you give us an update regarding the status of that litigation, where it stands in the process and what are next steps from here?","Adam S. Umanoff","Why don't I take this one, Pedro? This is Adam Umanoff, the General Counsel. We have made motions in most of our wildfire cases, challenging the application of inverse condemnation. By and large those notions have not been granted by the trial courts. We currently have pending motions in two Liberty fire related cases. The Liberty fire was a smaller fire in our service territory. We appealed denials of our motions in the Thomas Fire, but those appeals are discretionary. The appellate court can, with or without reason, accept the review or reject it. And to date, no appellate court has taken a review, discretionary review. So we have not had an opportunity to take these issues up to the appellate courts for review.","Michael Lapides","Got it. And can we -- is there a scenario where this winds up in federal court or is this primarily in your view, a state court, state jurisdiction and it's simply a question of will a certain case -- any of the cases, your case, the San Diego Gas & Electric 2007 wildfire related one, will any of those actually get picked up by the Supreme Court, and we get clarity of that -- the state Supreme Court and we get clarity at that level regarding inverse condemnation?","Adam S. Umanoff","So for appeals to be heard by the appellate courts is a matter of right, as opposed to a discretionary appeal. You have to have a verdict, a jury deciding that inverse damages are payable. We are not in that position. SCE is not in that position. I will note that in one of the cases that PG&E has, there is a current verdict, directed verdict on inverse, which if they get relief from the stay and the bankruptcy, could be appealed.","Ultimately that appeal would have to be heard by the appellate court. You led off by asking, can you get into federal court? As a practical matter, in our cases, the path to the federal court is largely through appeals up to the California Supreme Court, which if unsuccessful would give you an opportunity to appeal to the US Supreme Court.","Michael Lapides","Meaning, and your appeal would be some things along the line of a takings clause related case or something like that?","Adam S. Umanoff","Yes, we have a number of legal arguments, the policy argument of -- under the Takings Clause is one. We have a due process argument as well. The bottom line is, we believe firmly as a matter of the principle underlining inverse condemnation that you must be able to socialize broadly, inverse costs if the standard of inverse condemnation is applied to create liability. And because we cannot automatically socialize those costs, but rather we have to get approval of our regulator, we think it is unfair under various theories for that -- the inverse condemnation standard to be applied.","Michael Lapides","Got it. Thank you. Much appreciated.","Pedro J. Pizarro","Thanks, Michael.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ali Agha of SunTrust. Sir, your line is now open.","Pedro J. Pizarro","Hi Ali.","Ali Agha","Thank you. Hey, good afternoon, Pedro. First question, Pedro, as you outlined there are a number of initiatives the governor has talked; the Task Force, there is the bills and the legislature etcetera. From your vantage point, what do you think is the most important and likely path through this process? Is it that Commission that's been set up and looking at that, I mean what\u2019s the confidence that something does take place before the end of the session, which I believe is end of August, correct me there, but just to understand how do we tracking this from your vantage point?","Pedro J. Pizarro","So, thanks for the question, Ali. Technically, the legislative sessions is actually a two-year session, so going into next year. Difficult for us to handicap again, specific pathways or specific [indiscernible] release around them. You have heard consistently from our Company and you will continue to hear a level of confidence that over time in the future, this will be resolved because the state needs financially healthy utilities to keep the lights on in the world's fifth largest economy and to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to something climate change. So we continue to see that as the ultimate proof point that there will be high confidence of ultimate reforms. As you've heard from me, probably over the last year, 1.5, while I have that personal sense of confidence, I cannot translate that into a handicapping of, and therefore it will happen through this vehicle by this date. And I think that\u2019s where we remain. The Wildfire Commission will be a very important vehicle. I think there's a number of quality appointments to that and they've had their first meeting and they're setting a process and it seems like they're setting up the right kind of scope for the questions that that Commission needs to address. It's been encouraging to hear the governor talk about trying to accelerate the timeline earlier than the July timeline that was provided in SB 901. Ultimately, legislative action may be needed. And so, Wildfire Commission will make recommendations to the Legislature, but then the legislature needs to pick up them. The governor will need to provide leadership in order to frame that for the legislature. And the fact that he has created a Strike Team and they've staffed it up both with folks internally led by the Chief of Staff. So this is really being led at the highest level of the Governor's administration and with a number of outside advisors. Those are all good indications that this administration is taking this seriously, and looking at their range of things that need to be done. We talked earlier about some of the things that we are -- we believe are important, probably first and foremost among those is fixing, resolving the issue with the liability framework for investor-owned utilities. And I shall -- I would say even for utilities more broadly because the municipals also face exposure here. So it's probably about all I can say, I'm not sure I've given you any new data points, maybe a little bit from framing around, there are multiple pieces of the puzzle here that will be important and it does just start with leadership from the Governor and I think his early signals have been encouraging.","Ali Agha","But, just to clarify that -- thank you for that, Pedro. I mean is it fair to say logically that nothing concrete probably happens until after the Wildfire Commission recommendations are in?","Pedro J. Pizarro","I don't want to give you anything -- that firm in conclusive because I do think anything could happen. Certainly one path would be that the Wildfire Commission makes recommendations and then you have the legislative process. On the other hand, you've seen the Strike Team that the Governor created have -- in fact the Governor mentioned in his State of the State address, a 60-day timeline and with 60 days that's about half of the time that the legislature allocated to the Wildfire Commission's process. So, we have to see what the Governor develops in terms of proposals in which I would speculate would include vehicles for those proposals. Maybe one final point in all this is that, we do have the issue in the state right now and impacts the state as a whole of the PG&E bankruptcy and one of the tenets of Chapter 11 is that the debtor needs to have a plan of reorganization that will create sufficient confidence that the bidder won't find itself in Chapter 11 within a short time period. We believe that, not only do we, as Edison need reform of this framework, we believe it will be integral to PG&E having a successful point of reorganization themselves. So I think that does add to the imperative here for the state.","Ali Agha","Great. And then second question, you talked about the charge, you talked about the fact that your ratio is currently a spot level below the right level and that this is sort of the lower end of outcomes. When in your thinking does equity -- on equity needs, external equity needs come into it. You've talked about a fair amount of debt and so on, but when are you thinking equity needs to come into the equation?","Pedro J. Pizarro","So, Ali, [indiscernible] accounting there because that second question felt like number three or four, but just having a little fun with you. I think, Maria commented on the fact that the cost of capital proceeding will be a very good frame in place to think about the overall capital structure.","Maria C. Rigatti","Yes, I think Ali, obviously there is a lot of stuff going on in the state. There is all the things that we've just been talking about in terms of the wildfires and when that will be resolved. But we have a lot of other unknowns that are coming out. We're going to get our TRC decision. We have capital requirements related to proceeding, they're actually separate and apart from our GRC. So as we are getting that information we will be able to provide a more fulsome response, but in particular, in our cost of capital proceeding, we would expect that we would be able to share more information with you. We're developing that right now. It's going to be filed at the end of April. And I think, that that would be a good point at which to continue the discussion.","Pedro J. Pizarro","Thanks, Ali. Appreciate it.","Ali Agha","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Hey, good afternoon, everyone.","Pedro J. Pizarro","Hi there.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Hey. So, I wanted to follow-up on this waiver you all are seeking with respect to capital structure. Just wanted to understand what does that involve? I suppose it's ultimately to the extent to which it does get approved, how do you come to them with the plan on improving that to get back to authorize equity over time? What are the tools at-hand there? And also what are the consequences if they don't approve the waiver. I just want to understand that as well. And especially, how that waiver works with respect to the charge, if there is any latitude, if they don't too?","Maria C. Rigatti","Okay. So, I will say that the charge is not a CPUC issue. It's not a waiver issue. The charge related to our GAAP accounting. So put that to the side, right. The waiver is -- and we filed it so that's out there and I think the Commission's looks at it at this point right now. But the way that\u2019s structured, if you think about the fact that our spot equity ratio is more than 1% below our authorized in this level and that\u2019s because frankly, we have a charge, but we don't have a corresponding CPUC regulatory asset. And our discussion in our application with the Commission is that, you should disregard both the charge and any financing associated with the charge, debt financing to pay claims, until we get through a proceeding that would then determine our ability to recover that through rate. So I think when you think about the waiver, it's really about -- the initial point of the waiver is that we have an uncertainty due to this WEMA decision that doesn't permit us to book a regulatory asset. So we are asking for, I will say, a period of time, until we get a decision on that whereby we would just exclude the calculation from our charge -- the charge from our calculation rather. So I think that's one. I think, what does the commission do in the meantime as they're reviewing application and reviewing a waiver, we were in compliance with the plan. If you look at our 37 month average -- weighted-average equity ratio, it's 49.7%. So we're still actually in compliance with the peace of the authorized capital structure or the tenant of the authorized capital structure that's actually applicable. That's the piece we have to comply with 37 month average. This is more of an -- this -- I would say falls more into the context, I noted that -- I notice to the Commission. And then, as we get through that process and they determine yes, we will take your application. Okay, we will continue on. If at some point they determine that they do not want to accept our application, then we will have to see are we still in compliance with the 37 month average. And if we are not, typically what would happen if you would then provide a plan to the Commission as to how you would get back into compliance. There is a lot of other moving pieces at the same time, I referred to our cost of capital proceeding just a few minutes ago. So there is going to be a lot of things that happen in there, before we get to the point at which the Commission is going to need a plan from us.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Got it. All right. Excellent. And then just coming back to some of the nuances on the charge specifically and the allocation, just on the FERC allocation, how should we think about the percentage there? Should we take that on the notional 47 or on some kind of netted basis? And then, also just within that, the charge itself is, I know it's the low end, but what is reflected even in that low-end in terms of subrogation claims or assumptions on settlements etcetera. I just want to make sure we understand that a little bit more specifically here, beyond just the insurance netting.","Maria C. Rigatti","So when you think about the gross charge basically, before you would recover from your customers, first you would get recovery from all the other third parties. So in this case, insurance and then the FERC regulatory assets is really based on -- you allocate the FERC based on your labor allocator that you use for, more generally speaking, when you are separating cost into the FERC and CPUC jurisdiction. So that\u2019s how I would think about the FERC asset. And then as to other things that went into our estimate of the charge, I think it's just kind of that\u2019s what we said before. We looked at all the information that we have available, whether it's from the Insurance Commissioner or whether it's through the process of litigation and we make a determination based on the risks that we see in litigation, prior experiences that we either had or observed around settling and things like that, and that's how we came to the conclusion.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","It's roughly 3% of the growth?","Maria C. Rigatti","Are you taking about FERC?","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Yes.","Maria C. Rigatti","5%.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Thank you all.","Operator","That was the last question. I will now turn the call back to Mr. Sam Ramraj.","Sam Ramraj","Thank you for joining us today. And please call us if you have any follow-up questions. This concludes the conference call and you may now disconnect."],"7907":["Edison International (NYSE:EIX) Q3 2015 Earnings Conference Call October 27, 2015  4:30 PM ET","Executives","Scott Cunningham - Vice President, Investor Relations","Theodore Craver - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer","James Scilacci - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Pedro Pizarro - President, Southern California Edison","Adam Umanoff - Executive Vice President and General Counsel","Analysts","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS","Hugh Wynne - Bernstein","Daniel Eggers - Credit Suisse","Shar Pourreza - Guggenheim","Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs","Ali Agha - SunTrust","Greg Oro - Barclays","Praful Mehta - Citigroup","Operator","Good afternoon, and welcome to the Edison International third quarter 2015 financial teleconference. My name is Brandon. I will be your operator today. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Scott Cunningham, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Cunningham, you may begin your conference.","Scott Cunningham","Thanks, Brandon, and welcome, everyone. Our principal speakers will be Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Ted Craver; and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Jim Scilacci. Also here are other members of the management team.","Materials supporting today's call are available at www.edisoninvestor.com. The key items are Form 10-Q, Ted and Jim's prepared remarks and the presentation that accompanies Ted's comments, Jim's comments. Tomorrow afternoon we will distribute our regular business update presentation.","During this call we will make forward-looking statements about the future outlook for Edison International and its subsidiaries. Actual results could differ materially from current expectations. Important factors that could cause different results are set forth in our SEC filings. Please read these carefully. The presentation includes certain outlook assumptions as well as reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the nearest GAAP measures.","During Q&A please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up.","I'll now turn the call over to Ted.","Theodore Craver","Thank you, Scott, and good afternoon, everyone. Today we reported core earnings of $1.16 per share. While this is well below last year's third quarter core earnings of $1.52 per share, year-over-year third quarter earnings comparisons, as was the case with the first two quarters of the year, are not very useful. This is because of the way we have had to recognize revenue with the delay in SCE's 2015 General Rate Case and how we are accounting for the recently released proposed decision.","We have said in the past that we would provide 2015 earnings guidance when we received a final GRC decision. However, with the noise in our quarterly earnings numbers, we thought it a disservice to investors to have them guessing about 2015 earnings. Therefore, we decided it was best to provide 2015 guidance at this time today.","So today we introduced core earnings guidance for 2015 of $3.77 to $3.87 per share. This guidance has some key assumptions that Jim will review in his comments. Of course, should the final GRC decision differ substantially from the proposed decision, we may have to revisit our guidance. We plan to return to our normal practice of providing annual earnings guidance for 2016, when we report full year 2015 results in late February.","One more comment on the General Rate Case. While we feel the GRC proposed decision is overall generally constructive, SCE identified several important issues in its October 8 comments to the CPUC. Jim will cover most of these, but I want to touch on one in particular.","The proposed decision attempts to recover certain tax repair benefits that were reflected in earnings in 2012 to 2014 through a permanent reduction to rate base of $344 million. We consider this retroactive ratemaking and a potential violation of Internal Revenue Service rules. We are hopeful that the CPUC will correct their legal error.","If the Commission were to adopt the proposed decision's retroactive treatment of repair deductions, then SCE would be forced to write-off some or all of the $380 million regulatory asset related to future recovery of taxes. The final decision on SCE's General Rate Case is currently scheduled for the November 5 CPUC meeting.","I assume most, if not all of you, are aware of the Administrative Law Judge's proposed decision released yesterday on penalties related to SONGS ex parte communications. In short, the ALJ found in her PD that there were eight communications that were late reported to the Commission, and found two Rule 1.1 violations. The PD proposed a $16.74 million penalty on Southern California Edison.","There are additional procedural steps yet to come on this issue, but we are thankful that this appears to be moving towards resolution. This has been a painful episode, including for Edison, and I feel obliged to make several comments on it.","First, I want to set the record straight on some misconceptions that are constantly being repeated. Contrary to the many reports, SCE has not engaged in, improper talks or communications with regulators, related to the SONGS OII.","The important distinction is that the Judge found that we didn't report in a timely manner permissible communications with regulators. The communications themselves were not found to be improper or illegal under the ex parte rules, as certain parties have repeatedly and wrongly asserted.","In our recent filing, we maintained that seven of these eight communications were either not required or outright not allowed to be reported under the ex parte rules. The difference of opinion is a direct result of ambiguity in California's overly complicated ex parte rules.","Ambiguous rules require the parties to do their best to interpret them in practice, which creates a risk. We believe the rules need to be clarified and simplified, so that we do not find ourselves underwriting the risk of after-the-fact reviews.","It is worth noting that even the ALJ concluded in her PD that the ex parte rules were ambiguous, and cited that as a mitigating factor in calculating the penalty. As I said in an earnings call a few quarters ago, we look forward to working with President Picker to clarify the ex parte rules soon.","Many of the matters we deal with in our business involve tough judgment calls in contentious proceedings under ambiguous rules and conditions. We don't particularly like it, but it comes with territory. We expect controversy. We also expect a great deal of ourselves and our employees, because we provide such an essential service to society and we rely on the public trust.","That is why it is important to do the right thing. We expect nothing less of ourselves. We want to earn the trust of our customers, the public and the CPUC, based on our conduct. While we aren't perfect and there will be times when we fail to live up to our own expectations and those of others, we must and we do set high standards of conduct for ourselves.","We have an obligation to be transparent and open, and we will redouble our efforts to conduct ourselves in this manner. We will also work hard to support President Picker's efforts to clarify and improve the current poorly crafted ex parte rules. Strong efforts on both fronts will go a long way to avoiding a repeat of this in the future.","On a brighter note, we were pleased to report last week the settlement reached with Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited, known as NEIL, on insurance claims related to the shutdown of the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station. The settlement is for $400 million and covers all insurance claims by the three owners of SONGS related to the events leading to the shutdown. All necessary approvals have been received from the owners and NEIL.","This is another important step in implementing the SONGS settlement, approved unanimously by the CPUC last November. Consistent with the SONGS settlement, insurance recoveries will first pay associated legal costs, and then 95% will be allocated to customers and 5% to the owners.","SCE customers will receive its allocation as a credit to the purchased power balancing account known as ERRA. Assuming payment from NEIL is received in the fourth quarter, then customer benefits should show up in their bills as a reduction in purchased power costs in 2016.","The larger claim against Mitsubishi Heavy Industries for the failed design of the replacement steam generators continues to proceed under binding arbitration through the International Chamber of Commerce. We still expect a decision on that case by late 2016.","SCE's share of the NEIL recoveries and any MHI recoveries, including recovery of legal costs, will be treated as non-core. That is, they will not be included in our core earnings.","There is still much procedurally to be accomplished before the SONGS OII and related matters can be completed. We are hopeful that this is all moving toward a conclusion this year or early next. We continue to believe that no new information has been presented to suggest that the SONGS settlement was anything other than independently-negotiated that warrants continued full support by the CPUC and customers.","I'd like to turn to a couple of items that address some of our longer-term growth opportunities, starting with SCE's Distribution Resources Plan or DRP. Since the July 1 filing, we have seen tremendous interest among stakeholders, and some encouraging early support from a number of parties on our conceptual long-term approach. Appropriately, there will be concerns about cost and the pace of implementation of building a flexible 21st Century grid as outlined in our DRP filing.","We are awaiting a more definitive schedule for the balance of the proceeding, which the CPUC indicates will be completed next spring. This should give SCE adequate time to incorporate DRP elements into its 2018 to 2020 General Rate Case, which we expect to file in the fall of 2016.","Moving on, the California legislature provided its own form of support for Governor Brown's low-carbon goals and the DRP with the passage of Senate Bill 350. The Governor signed this bill into law earlier this month. Senate Bill 350 will move renewables targets to 50% of delivered energy from qualifying renewable resources by 2030.","The current renewables target is 33% of delivered power by 2020. The new law provides some valuable implementation flexibility that will help us meet the goals at the lowest reasonable cost to our customers. It also provided legislative support for future utility investment in transportation electrification.","This is one of the long-term growth opportunities that we see for Southern California Edison, just as we see similar opportunities around electric vehicle charging infrastructure and energy storage, as complements to SCE's wires-focused investment strategy.","One final comment. I continue to believe that we have an attractive multi-year dividend opportunity that complements a strong earnings growth outlook. The GRC proposed decision, the DRP and SB 350 are all data points that underscore SCE's growth potential.","This in turn reaffirms the dividend growth opportunity I've discussed on recent earnings calls. We recognize that for a few years now we have been below our targeted payout ratio of 45% to 55% of SCE's earnings. We remain committed to moving well into that target range in steps overtime.","Hopefully, we will be well along the way to resolution on both the SONGS OII and the GRC before the Board's usual December consideration of a dividend increase. Even if both are not fully resolved by then, I don't see it impacting our ability to continue to implement our dividend policy. That concludes my comments.","Now, Jim will provide his financial report.","James Scilacci","Thanks, Ted. Good afternoon, everyone. I plan on covering third quarter and year-to-date results, SCE's 2015 General Rate Case proposed decision, capital spending and rate base forecast, a few other financial topics and guidance.","Please turn to Page 2 of the presentation. Let me first address revenue recognition for the first six months and then for the third quarter. For the first two quarters of this year, we recorded revenues largely based on 2014 authorized revenues, which included a revenue deferral of $85 million or $0.16 per share related to incremental flow-through tax repair deductions. Our accounting was based on management judgment that these revenues would likely be refunded to customers.","Having received the proposed decision, we updated our estimate of probable refunds to customers, as part of our third quarter reporting. This in turn lowered third quarter revenues. The GRC-related revenue reduction was $0.42 per share. This is comprised of the two elements shown under key earnings drivers at the right of the slide.","As Ted noted, earnings comparisons will not be useful, until we receive a final GRC decision and report full year 2015 earnings. Of course, if the final GRC decision is different than the proposed decision, then there could be other related adjustments.","With that background, I'd like to walk through the key earnings drivers, starting with SCE. There are two key earnings drivers of the $0.35 per share decline in SCE's earnings. First, as I mentioned before, we recorded revenue largely based on the GRC proposed decision, including a catch-up adjustment. Second, there were favorable cost and tax benefits realized in 2014, which did not recur in 2015.","Looking at revenue, I've highlighted the $0.42 per share related to the GRC proposed decision. $0.20 of this revenue reduction is from the flow-through tax repair benefits to customers with a related offset in the form of higher tax repair deductions. The remaining decrease in GRC revenues are $0.22 per share.","Also we continue to see revenue increases from a growing FERC rate base and higher operating cost. This is a positive $0.02 per share. Lastly, please note that the revenue variances is a net of SONGS for comparability. The SONGS detail are footnoted.","Moving to the O&M. SCE had $0.03 per share in higher costs this quarter versus the third quarter of last year. This includes $0.01 per share of additional severance at SCE. Depreciation is $0.02 per share higher, primarily due to transmission and distribution investments. Net financing cost provided a $0.02 per share benefit, primarily due to higher earnings from AFUDC.","Turning to taxes. I've already covered the $0.20 per share for the 2015 repair deductions. Most of the remaining variance relates to the $0.11 per share in earnings from incremental repair deductions recorded last year.","In all, SCE's third quarter core earnings are $1.19 per share, down $0.35 from last year. For the holding company, costs are $0.01 per share higher than last year, largely on lower income from Edison Capital. I'll come back to Edison Capital later in my remarks. Non-core earnings in the quarter of $0.13 per share largely relate to EME bankruptcy, tax benefits and insurance recoveries.","Please turn to Page 3. We've added this slide to simplify the explanation of third quarter core earnings. As you can see, the difference on this slide versus the prior slide is that we netted out the impact of lower revenues and income tax benefits related to repair deductions in 2015. As indicated on this slide, the two key drivers are the lower revenues based on the GRC proposed decision of $0.22 and the $0.11 of 2014 incremental repair deductions. That gets us to $0.33 of the $0.35 reduction in third quarter SCE quarter earnings.","Please turn to Page 4. For year-to-date earnings, GRC-related revenue is $0.58 per share or lower, reflecting the $0.42 for the third quarter and the $0.16 for the first half of the year. Again, this is a mix of lower tax repair revenues $0.36 per share, which is offset in taxes and the third quarter revenue adjustment of $0.22 per share.","Most of the costs items continue their trend and for the year-to-date we also have higher depreciation and O&M and lower financing costs from higher AFUDC earnings. You will also see the significant impact in both years related to changes in uncertain tax positions and lower tax benefits in other areas. Last year, we also had the generator settlements and other items that are absent this year. All in, year-to-date SCE core earnings are $3.31 per share, down $0.27 from last year.","Page 5 has a similar waterfall chart of year-to-date core earnings. Please turn to Page 6. This slide compares the key revenue and rate base differences between the 2015 GRC proposed decision and SCE's updated request. The revenue adjustments are recorded in the third quarter; largely reflect the three quarters' worth of proposed decision's authorized annual revenue.","Please turn to Page 7. This slide summarizes the most important issues identified in SCE's comments on the proposed decision. Ted has already talked about the tax repair deduction issue. Next is the customer deposit issue. Since the 2003 GRC, the CPUC has treated customer deposits as a rate base offset. However, PG&E and San Diego Gas & Electric do not have this adjustment.","The third item is a proposed reduction in the pole loading program. The proposed decision did not approve approximately $100 million of capital, which has a 2015 rate base impact of $73 million. Putting aside the rate base adjustment for repair deductions, the proposed decision would adopt 92% of our requested capital. This is higher than previous GRCs, and of course, this percentage could change with a final decision.","I will note two other key issues. The principal one is incentive compensation. The proposed decision recommended significant reductions in authorized revenues related to incentive compensation for the entire workforce, even though the jointly sponsored SCE and ORA compensation study concluded SCE's total compensation is on average 5% below market.","We are strong believers in a pay-for-performance compensation philosophy and incentive-based compensation for all employees, not just executives, is a fundamental element of that philosophy. This reduction is larger than experienced in prior cases.","Lastly, there is a $10 million disallowance for a contract termination payment dating back to SCE's commercial rooftop solar initiative. We believe the termination payment is reasonable and benefited customers substantially. In accounting for the quarter, the revenue adjustments track the proposed decision except for two items, the tax item and the solar program contract cancellation disallowance. I'll pick this up later when I discuss the rate base forecast and earnings guidance.","Please turn to Page 8. Pages 8 and 9 update forecasted capital expenditures and rate base for the GRC proposed decision and known FERC-related capital expenditure changes. SCE is experiencing licensing and permitting delays with a few of its transmission projects, notably the West of Devers project. As a result, the timing of expenditures was moved out beyond 2017. Once SCE files its 2018 GRC application and we update our CapEx and rate base forecasts, these delayed expenditures will appear back in the forecast.","The FERC adjustments are shown on the right side of the slide. The balance of reduction is related to the GRC proposed decision, largely infrastructure replacement, inspection and maintenance and nonelectric facility capital projects.","Historically, we have shown what we call a request level of capital expenditures and rate base, and a lower range level. As you can see on the charts on Pages 8 and 9, we have replaced the word request with the word outlook. For CPUC capital, we now forecast that we will spend all authorized dollars for 2015 through 2017.","For FERC capital, we have continued our practice of reducing outlook expenditures by 12% to arrive at the range level of expenditures. Once we file our 2018 general rate case, we will revert back to using both request and range monikers.","As a reminder, the CPUC capital expenditures do not include any Distribution Resources Plan expenditures. We have asked the commission to approve a memorandum account, so we can track costs associated with the DRP spending. So if we were to spend all authorized CPUC amounts provided in the GRC proposed decision, then we would need to have the DRP memorandum account in place in order to be allowed to seek cost recovery in the next GRC.","Beyond 2017, we still believe that long-term capital spending will continue to run at least $4 billion annually, and spending could be higher depending upon CPUC approval in future rate cases.","Please turn to Page 9. Based on our revised capital spending forecast from the prior slide, we have updated our rate base forecast. The updated rate base forecast yields compound annual growth rates of 8% from 2015 through 2017. The prior forecast was 7% to 9% annually. Consistent with our accounting for the proposed decision, we have not factored in the proposed $344 million reduction in rate base related to the disputed tax repair deduction issue in this forecast. If the final GRC decision adopts the rate base adjustment, then each of the years rate base would decline by the adjustment amount.","Please turn to Page 10. As expected, the CPUC cost of capital mechanism did not trigger any change in allowed ROE for 2016. Though the spot Moody's Baa Utility Index rate moved quite a bit, the moving average dampened the full-year impact. Starting October 1, we began the new measurement period, starting with the moving average where the spot rate ended at September 30 at 5.45%. We are currently scheduled to file our next cost of capital application in April 2016.","Please turn to Page 11. This page covers a handful of other financial topics. SCE's weighted-average common equity component for regulatory purposes was 49.5% at September 30, increasing from 48.9% we reported in the second quarter. This excess equity gives us additional financial flexibility.","Next, you will recall that SCE's fuel and purchased power balancing account, or ERRA, had been deeply under collected as recently as yearend 2014. With a previous rate increase, SONGS settlement refunds, lower natural gas costs and the balancing account has moved to an over-collected position of $112 million as of September 30. When SCE receives the NEIL settlement proceeds, expected in the fourth quarter, they will be credited to ERRA.","Turning to the holding company, last month we renewed an EIX holding company shelf registration to provide us flexibility to access the capital markets as needed for liquidity and general corporate purposes. EIX commercial paper outstanding was $738 million at September 30, compared to a total EIX credit facility of $1.18 billion.","Also, earlier this month we reached an agreement to sell our remaining affordable housing portfolio at Edison Capital. Terms of the transaction have not been disclosed pending final due diligence and negotiations. In any case, the amounts are not material and the transaction will be treated as non-core. For the past few years, Edison Capital's earnings have helped offset holding company costs.","Please turn to Page 12. This page provides detail of our 2015 earnings guidance that Ted discussed. We have followed the same approach we have used for the last several years. We start with SCE rate base earnings. We used the $23.1 billion weighted average rate base outlook as shown on Page 10. Based on SCE's authorized capital structure and flat share count, that gets us the $3.56 per share of rate base earnings.","We then identify $0.41 per share of SCE items that take earnings higher. The principal item is the $0.31 per share revision to uncertain tax positions recorded in the second quarter. We have also discussed AFUDC being a net positive factor for the year, rather than just offsetting costs not recovered by general rate case revenues.","We continue to estimate $0.05 of energy efficiency earnings in the fourth quarter as previously disclosed. We have recorded severance costs of $0.03 year-to-date. The balance of all other items is a positive penny a share, including the ex parte proposed penalty. We have estimated full-year holding company costs at $0.15, getting us to the midpoint of $3.82 per share.","To the right we have included key guidance assumptions. We had excluded the shareholder portion of the NEIL settlement proceeds and related litigation costs. We consider these revenues non-core. Our guidance tracks our accounting for the GRC proposed decision, so it excludes the $344 million rate base adjustment for repair deductions and the solar termination payment disallowance.","That concludes my comments. I will turn the call over to the operator to moderate the Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley.","Stephen Byrd","Just want to follow-up on a couple of things in terms of spending outlook. The memorandum account for the GRP spend that you'd like to effect, could you talk a little bit procedurally just about how we should think about the steps to get approval for the memorandum account?","Theodore Craver","Well, we have actually already filed for it. It was part of the DRP application that's gone in and procedurally the commission then will have to act, and will look at over the SCE folks, any time frame for that Pedro or Maria?","Pedro Pizarro","This is Pedro Pizarro, not just about the memo account, but procedurally in the DRP filing there is public workshops that are scheduled for the November 9 to November 10, and there the PUC is looking at a broad DRP roadmap for how the DRP proceeding will be faced out in the next three to four years. With respect to the memo account itself I don't think we have a specific timing. We'd expect it would be handled as the proceeding moves along next year.","Stephen Byrd","And then just follow-up on just thinking about the tax positions you highlighted in 2015. There are a number of moving parts in terms of uncertain tax positions and lower tax benefits. On a going forward basis in '16 and beyond without being specific numerically, how should we think about those kinds of moving parts? When do they start to settle down and when will they become less material, if you think future years?","James Scilacci","That's a good question. And it really depends on ultimately how things turn out. I can tell you, for repair deduction, that's been a challenging one for us to forecast accurately. And I wouldn't expect that going forward that you will see potential shareholder benefits from repairs. But there're other tax benefits we realized, so it really comes to how accurate we are forecasting our cost versus what actually occur, so there could be differences both, for or against us.","And the other related piece is O&M benefit, that's the other companion we've been talking about this whole time, where I think in the proposed decision it was clear that, it left open the door that there could be incremental O&M savings that we could realize and we've said repeatedly that we will continue to look for benefits to reduce our cost for our customers.","Stephen Byrd","And as you think about those moving parts, in terms of the magnitude or volatility, I know it's hard to have a crystal ball to think about that. But do you see the same degree of potential volatility in terms of movements in these accounts or are there reasons why that volatility might be reduced in future years?","James Scilacci","I think my answer around that was, around repair deductions, where I was talking about specifically, the proposed decision, I think effectively we'll probably capture those benefits. And there is also a balancing account that has been set up for our pole loading program, which a lot of the repair deductions are rising from. That's why these repair benefits have increased so dramatically over the last three years. So with that balancing account, there's not an opportunity for earnings or losses associated with differences from forecast. A lot of complexity there, sorry for all the -- there is still more to be written here until we get a final decision.","Operator","Our next question is from Michael Weinstein with UBS.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","It's Julien here. So just following up here on the transmission reduction in the rate base, can you elaborate a little bit on nature of the issues in pushing up this CapEx, part one. And perhaps part two there, you talk about a $4 billion number, but is that fair to say that there might be some higher oscillations in that, call it, rounded $4 billion number in the '18 period now that you've pushed out this transmission CapEx. Just trying to get a sense of exactly what's going on in terms of those pieces.","James Scilacci","So I'll just point you to Page 8 in the investor deck, which has the capital expenditures, and it provides the detail of the amounts that are changing. In terms of the reasons, what my script falls up on was these are permitting and scheduling delays and the principal the largest one is the West of Devers project. There is some other smaller ones, but West of Devers is a rather large project and we're just seeing it slip out in time. And I'll pause and look over to Pedro and Maria to see if there is anything else to add?","Pedro Pizarro","All right.","James Scilacci","So that's what you've got. Now as far as the above $4 billion --","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Just to clarify, if you will, you guys have historically talked about hitting a $4 billion CapEx pace consistently, does this now mean that you have call it a 2018 number that you're not closing here that would be call it materially above that $4 billion figure to reflect, call it a one-time true up on the CapEx for transmission?","Theodore Craver","Yes. And this is going to be a difficult one, because we don't have information in the public domain beyond '17. So I'm just going to touch a couple of items that we see that are changing both up and down to be fair. So clearly the DRP is a big element of potential new expenditures. We've provided information at public domain and you can see there is substantial ramp up of expenditures since '17 and as you go into '18, but those expenditures will be subject to review as part of our general rate case process.","There are other things that are going up that would include our -- and we have an opportunity through the storage program. We have an opportunity through electric vehicle charging program. And those are still working their way through. And all three of those just to emphasize are not included in the numbers we're seeing here today, so there is some potential upside depending upon how those proceedings progress.","On the down side, there is the transmission issue is they're still going to be -- we'll have to see where that goes, as you fit each some of this larger projects and we've ramped up in transmission area, then we ramp back down as they're finished and we'll get to a steady state of capital expenditures.","We will just have to see how load growth goes that could be up or down depending upon the health of the service territory and the penetration of distributed generation resources. So I'll leave it there. There is ups and downs. There is probably more of a bias that we see to the upside, because of some of these large projects.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","And just to clarify, in the transmission CapEx, just a tad bit more, is there any risk around, obviously you had the competitive project allocated. Is there any other moving piece that we should be aware of in the transmission bucket that could develop one way or another here? Obviously, the permitting was kind of unexpected.","Theodore Craver","Nothing that would stand out right now, Julien, beside what I told you.","Operator","Our next question is from Hugh Wynne with Bernstein.","Hugh Wynne","Jim, I just had some, what I hope are, simple questions on Page7 around the rate case proposed decision. On the left-hand column there, the bottom bullet, the $73 million pole loading capital spending reduction? And then in the parenthetical below that it says $100 million capital expenditure reduction. What is the difference?","James Scilacci","To one's capital to one's closings, and they don't always line up exactly. And so really, when you think about rate base, it's what's close to plant. So forecast don't line up exactly.","Hugh Wynne","So they are basically telling you that they want you to spend $73 million more in your spending plan, and that is reflected in closings fulfilling by $100 million.","James Scilacci","That was reverse. So they've taken out of the -- in the PD, they've take out $100 million of capital expenditures, which translates into $73 million of rate base. So it's lower, not higher.","Hugh Wynne","And then the second point. What is the bone of contention around the customer deposits?","James Scilacci","When you look at our forecast, they take the $180 million of customer deposits and reduce our rate base by that amount. And the bone of contentions is if there is not similarity of treatment among the three utilities, we seem to be treated differently, as a result of whatever reason. And then we've had this -- we keep raising this issue in the last several GRCs, and there is inconsistent treatment. We think that's unfair.","Hugh Wynne","And then, finally, on the first point, I agree with everything you say there in the second bullet that seems like retroactive ratemaking and violation of normalization regulations, et cetera. But presumably the ALJ, who has a law degree, and I don't, has a different view. Could you characterize the different perspectives around this point?","James Scilacci","Yes, it would be hard to characterize it completely; there was a number of arguments. But I think the simple argument that was made is that they set rates prospectively, so therefore how could it be retroactive ratemaking. We just fundamentally disagree on that point. And so that's something we'll have to figure out hopefully in the final decision that will address this issue. But we'll have to see.","Operator","Our next question is from Daniel Eggers with Credit Suisse.","Daniel Eggers","Just on the $80 million of compensation expense that wanted you to get recovery on. Would you find ways to offset that or do you see opportunities to change your compensation structure like the other utilities to mitigate that drag?","James Scilacci","Well, we'll certainly have to look at it. It was obviously a sensitive issue in oral argument in our comments. And we'll have to see what the final decision is. And we'll have to see how it unfolds. Hopefully, they turn it around.","Daniel Eggers","And then, I guess, on the $344 million for this year's guidance, if you didn't get that or if the ALJ found against you, what is your course legally to address that, given the IRS issues and how would that affect the '15 guidance as you laid it out today?","James Scilacci","In the course of action here, and I know Pedro talked about in the oral arguments and in our comments in the proposed decision that retroactive ratemaking, then you have a legal recourse. And there is a potential, as Ted said in his script, of a IRS issue, it's a normalization violation. So there is two different paths here that you might pursue.","Hopefully, the Commission addresses that as part of the final decision, but we will have to see. So if it were adopted, and I think it was clearly in my prepared remarks, you'd have to take the $344 million off the rate base numbers for '15 through '17 to get back to an adjusted rate base approach.","Operator","Our next question is from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim.","Shar Pourreza","Most my questions were answered. There is a likely delay in the SONGS OII into early 2016, is there any impact to you providing 2016 guidance?","James Scilacci","I guess, off the top of my head, and I'll hesitate and look at my collogues here. If we have a GRC decision, I think that's the critical piece we need to move ahead in providing guidance for '16. But I'll look at everybody else, I don't see the SONGS being a factor that would slow us down. And unless if they reject the whole decision, and maybe I have to go back and rethink it, but I think if we had a 2015 GRC final decision, we'd find a way to give guidance for '16.","Shar Pourreza","And then just on MHI, we're obviously reaching some sort of a conclusion by hopefully the end of 2016. Is there any opportunities to give some incremental data points on that or is it just one of those where you get an order, you get a settlement, you'll disclose it at the same time?","James Scilacci","So I'll pause here and look over to my friend, Adam Umanoff, our General Counsel. Adam any pros of wisdom?","Adam Umanoff","No. Really we can't provide any additional guidance. We're operating under strict confidentiality rules of the International Chamber of Commerce proceedings. So you'll have to wait for a final decision that's announced publicly.","Operator","Our next question is from Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank.","Jonathan Arnold","Couple of quick questions on. As we look forward, Jim, with Edison Capital out of the picture now, is it reasonable to assume that that $0.15 drag from the parent company that you are sharing for 2015, is the kind of number we'd be looking at going forward with no offset or are there other things to think about that?","James Scilacci","We're a little premature on getting to that point. We'll give you hopefully guidance, when we report full year earnings at the end of February. But clearly what I was trying to indicate in my prepared remarks, that you lose that revenue source and so there might be a little upward pressure at the holding company.","Jonathan Arnold","And then, secondly, I think you said you booked the impact of the GRC PD through the first three quarters. Is the fourth quarter impact just negative, because it's lower revenue requirement or is there something else I need to think about?","James Scilacci","I'm looking over my accountants that booked the first three quarters. Anything else in the fourth quarter that would be relevant to what Jonathan's brought up?","Scott Cunningham","We'll continue to follow the proposed decision, until we get a final decision. And then we'll look at what the terms are and adjust to the final decision.","James Scilacci","So the guidance, obviously, Jonathan is adjusted to reflect what we think, based on the proposed decision the fourth quarter will be.","Jonathan Arnold","And I guess, just finally, then should we read into the fact that your booking earnings according to the PD, apart from the tax adjustment item is that your best estimate of whether it shakes out, on your own accounting basis currently that you likely don't improve too much on the PD, but you do when this one issue. Is that how we should think about you giving guidance that way?","James Scilacci","I think our view was, we felt it was important to get something out there as a stakeholder, because there is going to be -- if you wait until you get a final decision, it's really not clear that what it's going to be and we wouldn't get yearend earnings out until February. We felt that it was better for investors, as Ted said in his prepared remarks, to give some clarity.","And I think we gave through our guidance, you'll have enough pieces of information to make adjustments accordingly. And so we felt that was the clearest and fairest way for everybody to do this.","Jonathan Arnold","And then just one other topic. Ted, I think you made the comment that you expect to; no, you hope to have the SONGS issues result this year or at worst early next. I just want to be clear that you are talking about the overall issue, including the settlement, not just the penalty piece when you make that comment?","Theodore Craver","Yes.","Operator","Our next question is from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.","Michael Lapides","I was just curious, when I look at the data on Page 15 in the 10-Q and kind of the new band for CapEx, and that you've disclosed on the slides. How should we think about how this impacts the timeline to get to a higher payout ratio? And CapEx coming down frees up some cash for the balance sheet in the cash flow statement, by the time you get out to about 2018, 2019 timeframe, you'll have a higher earnings power, you'll have higher cash from operations and at lower CapEx level. Just curious about how you and the Board are thinking about kind of the timeline and the pace prior to get up for the dividend, prior to getting the proposed decision versus going forward?","James Scilacci","Yes. It's a good question. I guess I would try to respond to it this way. If you kind of pull up from looking at one year versus the next year, any individual year, with just kind of the larger theme, the larger trends, as you know I tried to strike this theme consistently, we expect somewhere in this $4 billion-plus kind of annual CapEx. We expect pretty significant rate base growth.","And we expect that as the base gets larger, as the rate base gets larger, we're going to have more cash flow. So we feel that we're going keep a good balance between solid annual CapEx and related earnings from a growing rate base, but cash to move us back in that 45% to 55%.","Any given year, any couple of years, you might run a little harder on CapEx, you might run a little slower on CapEx that may give you on the margin a little more room to move on dividends or slow it down a little bit. But fundamentally, I think rather than try to pick it apart year-by-year that's the teeter totter. It's keeping CapEx in that kind of $4-plus billion range and getting back solidly. I think I use the term well within the range of 45% to 55%.","So I wouldn't get too wrapped up on any one year movement. Both of those things are going to be really what we're focused on. And we believe as a result, we'll be able to provide investors with a higher than industry average growth rate in earnings and a higher than industry average growth rate in dividends.","Operator","Our next question is from Ali Agha with SunTrust.","Ali Agha","Jim, just to be clear on Slide 9, where you've laid out your rate base numbers, new ones '15 through '17. Just to understand the moving parts there once the GRC is finalized, if I am hearing you right, you've already assumed the big tax benefit and $180 million, I believe goes in your favor, if I heard you right. And so if there is going to be any change to these numbers, it's probably to the downside if they stick with the PD or is that further upside that maybe I'm missing here?","James Scilacci","So what I said was the $180 million, the customer deposits, is already baked into these numbers. This is net of that. And what also, I said, and I think we have it here on the first pull it on the right, the $344 million rate base reduction for the repair deduction is not included in these numbers, is not. And so to the extent, if the commission were to decide to adopt it, then you need to reduce these numbers by the $344 million.","Ali Agha","But also, if they stick with the PD on the customer deposit, that would be another $180 million reduction?","James Scilacci","No. I'm sorry. We incorporated the $180 million already.","Ali Agha","Are you stuck with the PD on the $180 million?","James Scilacci","Yes. So the only things that we haven't adopted from the PD are the tax issue, the $344 million rate base reduction. And the second thing is the SunPower termination payment for the solar panels. Those are the only two items we have not incorporated.","Ali Agha","And then secondly on the SONGS process, just to be clear on resolutions, so the PD came out on the ex parte issue and may come up on the December meeting. Should we now expect another PD has to be issued on the petition for modification, and then at some later date that gets picked up by the CPUC or what is exactly the process for dealing with those modification petitions?","James Scilacci","Adam, you want to take that?","Adam Umanoff","Sure. And you're right. There are separate petitions for modifications and a request for rehearing, all of which are pending, and for which there has been no decision by the commission. I really can't tell you when to expect a decision. As Ted pointed out, we're hopeful that we'll see a decision later this year or early next year. Once that decision comes out, there will be an opportunity for parties to comment before it is final.","Ali Agha","But to be clear, Adam, you need to first have a PD, which will set a 30-day clock on those issues?","Adam Umanoff","Yes, on the petitions for modification, that's right, there will be a PD, a comment period and then a final decision.","Operator","Our next question is from Greg Oro with Barclays.","Greg Oro","Back to Page 12, just regarding the AFUDC at $0.07 that it is added back, is that a good number going forward, just as an average, is there a timing issue in there, or maybe I need more of a discussion what that is?","James Scilacci","Well, we're happy to have a further discussion, but there is a lot of moving parts associated with AFUDC. Historically, the way we've done this over the last several years, we assume that AFUDC earnings offset all the cost that aren't not recovered through the rate making process. There is executive compensation Board related cost, our corporate dues and philanthropy activities. There is a whole bucket of that costs that aren't recovered and we have assumed historically that AFUDC earnings offset those.","And what can cause it to go up or down is the balance of what's in the account or the rate. So the rate can go up and down depending upon what's happening at any point in time. So I think for planning purposes, it's probably appropriate to assume that AFUDC will not come out again in the future in terms of providing the benefit and go back to that rate base approach as the core utility source of earnings and a little bit of energy efficiency that we've talked about repeatedly adjusted for the holding company cost to get you to a decent starting point.","Operator","Our last question is from Praful Mehta with Citigroup.","Praful Mehta","So I'll be quick, given it's a long call and the last question. So just quickly on the rate base that you've guided to now, if we had to bridge from the last quarter to this quarter in terms of rate base, is it just the CapEx and these GRC adjustments that you've talked about or is there other stuff that we should be thinking about in terms of reaching from last quarter to this quarter rate base?","Theodore Craver","So the two principal items are the GRC adjustments and the FERC delays. And you can see the dollar amounts of the FERC delays that's shown on Page 9 -- I'm sorry, Page 8, it has both rate base and capital expenditures and the balance is what the commission did not pick up as part of the rate making process. Scott anything else fits in there?","Scott Cunningham","And probably just remember, as Jim said in his remarks, so the FERC spending is being pushed out, so you would model it later. After the current forecast period, you see it picking up in 2018 and beyond.","Praful Mehta","And just quickly the final question was on that point itself, which is, you talk about the long-term $4 billion annually. When you say long-term, how long is long-term when you think of it is? Is it a three-year window, five year window, just so we have a sense of what is it?","James Scilacci","I don't want to be flip and say it is Wall Street long-term. But, I think it is appropriate to think through the 18 generate case cycle.","Operator","That was the last question. I will now turn the call back to the Mr. Cunningham.","End of Q&A","Scott Cunningham","Thanks, very much, everyone, for participating and don't hesitate to call us if you have any follow-up questions. Thanks and good afternoon.","Operator","Thank you for participating in today's conference. All lines may disconnect at this time."],"8066":["Edison International (NYSE:EIX) Q3 2018 Earnings Call October 30, 2018  4:30 PM ET","Executives","Sam Ramraj - Edison International","Pedro J.

I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Sam Ramraj, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Ramraj, you may begin your conference.","Sam Ramraj - Edison International","Thank you, Ash, and welcome, everyone. Our speakers today are President and Chief Executive Officer, Pedro Pizarro; and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Maria Rigatti. Also here are other members of the management team.","Materials supporting today's call are available at www.edisoninvestor.com. These include our Form 10-Q, prepared remarks from Pedro and Maria, and the teleconference presentation. Tomorrow, we will distribute our regular business update presentation.","During this call, we will make forward-looking statements about the outlook for Edison International and its subsidiaries. Actual results could differ materially from current expectations. Important factors that could cause different results are set forth in our SEC filings. Please read these carefully. The presentation includes certain outlook assumptions, as well as reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the nearest GAAP measure. During the question-and-answer session, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. I will now turn the call over to Pedro.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Well, thanks a lot, Sam, and good afternoon everyone. Third quarter core earnings were $1.56 per share, $0.12 higher than the same period last year. This was mainly due to the regulatory deferral of certain O&M costs and tax benefits at SCE, partially offset by lower tax benefits at EIX Parent and Other. Please remember this comparison is not particularly meaningful because SCE he has not received a decision in its 2018 General Rate Case. Maria will provide more detail in her remarks.","As we continue to wait on proposed decisions and rulings from key proceedings, I would like to update you on some significant events that occurred in the third quarter.","On the legislative front, during the 2018 session, we advocated for reforms to mitigate the risk of catastrophic wildfires and fairly allocate financial responsibility among the multiple causes which contribute to wildfires. We focused on four key principles. The first was the establishment of an objective of wildfire management plan to guide system investments and new operating protocols. This would create more transparency and clarity with regard to prudency. The second principle was reform of inverse condemnation to transition from strict liability regardless of fault to a reasonableness standard. The third principle was reforming the current cost recovery structure at the CPUC to incorporate the concept that disallowance must be proportionate to the utility's contribution to a fire.","Finally we emphasize the continued importance of financially healthy utilities to meet California's ambitious climate change policies. With the end of the 2018 legislative session, I wanted to briefly review the key actions taken.","Senate Bill 901 was the most significant wildfire policy bill signed this year. We appreciate the legislature's attention to this critical and complex issue. Climate change has resulted in long-term drought conditions that weaken and kill trees due to bark beetle infestation and more severe weather events. At the same time, dry vegetation increases fuel on the ground which increases the risks of devastating wildfires. SB 901 includes many elements related to vegetation management and land use practices that will help mitigate this risk. Beyond that, the bill includes four key elements: wildfire mitigation plans, wildfire cost recovery considerations, securitization, and a 2017 stress test. The wildfire mitigation plans and cost recovery considerations are two constructive elements that increase clarity for the prudent manager standard and improve the regulatory construct to appropriately allocate financial responsibility. However, further work is required to establish a set of prudent manager standards for wildfire prevention and event response and reform current policies on post-event liability. These are essential to fairly balancing risk for Californians in the future.","The bill also establishes the Commission on Catastrophic Wildfire Cost and Recovery to identify additional elements that address the ever-increasing threat posed by wildfires in California including the equitable socialization of wildfire costs. The committee will be comprised of five members, three of whom will be appointed by the new governor. SCE will work with stakeholders as a thought partner and a resource as the state continues to address these issues.","Mitigation and prevention are the best defenses against future wildfires. In September, SCE filed its Grid Safety and Resiliency Program application. This was the result of an internal effort to review and strengthen our wildfire mitigation and prevention efforts in response to the new normal. Our approach aligns with the wildfire mitigation plans required by Senate Bill 901. This $582 million program proposes $407 million of capital spending in three key areas: grid hardening, operational enhancements, and situational awareness.","Most of the capital spend request is related to a covered conductor program to help mitigate the risk of ignitions in high fire risk areas. Our risk analysis has shown this to be more prudent from a cost-benefit perspective than other options. The requested program will replace 600 circuit miles of bare wire in high fire risk areas with insulated wire in the 2018 and 2020 period. SCE has identified another approximately 3,400 circuit miles of bare overhead conductor in high fire risk areas that will also merit re-conductoring beyond 2020 through future GRCs. Further, the request includes capital investment and O&M for several other areas that help reduce the risk of wildfire ignition. These requests are incremental to those contained in our pending 2018 GRC application. While we are in the initial phase of the proceeding, we believe these expenditures are necessary and have therefore started investing moderate amounts on these programs without waiting for CPUC review of our application.","However, we are requesting timely review of our application because our mitigation activities are significant and will involve substantial incremental costs over the coming years. To this end, we have requested a memorandum account be established as soon as possible to track initial costs and a balancing account to recover costs once the program is approved.","Turning to the 2017 wildfires, we continue to support the communities affected by these events by setting up a dedicated webpage for impacted customers and providing specially trained resources in our contact center. Additionally, our efforts to mitigate future wildfires are critical to the customers we serve. We are committed to helping our customers and communities recover and rebuild from these events and communicating directly with them is another key element of our support.","A number of external agencies have been investigating the potential origins and causes of the Thomas Fire and smaller fires that occurred in our service territory. As we do in all wildfire matters, SCE is also conducting its own reviews.","Determining wildfire origin and cause can be a complex and time-consuming process that examines items like possible ignition points and their locations, review of physical evidence in these locations and fire progression analysis that may become particularly important in the case of fires with multiple ignition points. Based on the progress of our ongoing work in these areas with the information currently available to us, we believe that the Thomas Fire, which developed in Ventura County in early December 2017, had at least two separate ignition points.","With respect to one of these ignition points, Koenigstein Road, SCE believes that its equipment was associated with this ignition. SCE is continuing to assess the progression of the fire from the Koenigstein Road ignition point and the extent of property and other damage that may be attributable to that ignition. At this time, SCE has not determined whether the separate ignition in the Anlauf Canyon area involved our equipment.","In the case of both general areas, CAL FIRE has removed SCE equipment. We have not been granted access, which has delayed the completion of our own review.","Given the uncertainty as to the contributing causes of the Thomas Fire, the complexities associated with multiple ignition points and the potential for separate damages to be attributable to fires ignited at separate ignition points, we are currently unable to reasonably estimate a range of losses that may be incurred. However, we do expect to incur material losses in connection with the Thomas Fire.","Given the importance of communicating not just with investors, but also with our communities and other stakeholders, we have echoed some of these disclosures in a separate press release issued simultaneously with today's earnings release.","In the meantime, SCE continues to support California's ambitious environmental policies. Senate Bill 100 augmented these policies by setting a goal for the state to reach 100% clean energy by 2045. The bill also requires California's utilities to source 60% of their energy from renewable energy sources by 2030. If implemented thoughtfully, SB 100's goals are broadly consistent with the targets we set out in our Clean Power and Electrification Pathway.","Last fall, SCE explored several of these scenarios to better understand feasibility, costs and trajectory to reach California's aggressive climate goals. We found the most feasible pathway to reach the State's 2030 goals to be an electric grid supplied by 80% carbon-free energy made reliable by up to 10 gigawatts of energy storage. This will support at least 7 million electric vehicles in California roads and nearly one-third of space and water heaters powered by electricity. We continue to implement and seek approval for key programs that we believe will help enable the states to meet these goals.","These include our approved medium- and heavy-duty vehicle charging infrastructure programs and our requests for a full-scale Charge Ready program that advances charging infrastructure needs for light-duty vehicles. We are currently in the early phases of implementing the medium- and heavy-duty vehicle transportation electrification programs and are actively engaged in the Charge Ready proceeding. In fact just yesterday, we received the scoping memo for the Charge Ready II application, which laid out the procedural schedule. We anticipate a final decision in the second or third quarter of 2019.","While we see significant investment related to California's climate policy, we are also very conscious of rate pressure on our customers. Residential rate design will be discussed again in 2019 at the CPUC. We received a positive position in early October in the Power Charge Indifference Adjustment or PCIA proceeding related to Community Choice Aggregation or CCA. The decision adopts revised inputs to the market price benchmark used to calculate the PCIA. It also provides for an annual true-up to ensure that any forecast-related errors in the annual PCIA are reconciled to minimize cost shifting from CCA customers to those customers who continue to receive power from SCE.","We continue to push forward on key regulatory proceedings that we believe are necessary to meet California's 2030 climate goals and lay the groundwork for 2045, while we address the uncertainty around the 2017 Wildfire outcome and we wait for a decision on our General Rate Case. At the same time, our company will continue to strive for improvement in our safety culture and broader operational excellence.","With that, I'll turn it over to Maria for her financial report.","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","Thank you, Pedro. Good afternoon, everyone. My comments today will cover the third quarter 2018 results compared to the same period a year ago and other financial updates for EIX and SCE. As we have communicated to you before, until we receive a decision on the 2018 General Rate Case, we will continue to recognize revenues from CPUC activity largely based on 2017 authorized base revenue requirements with reserves taken for known items including the cost of capital decision and Tax Reform. Also consistent with prior quarters, we are providing our SCE key driver analysis at the prior combined statutory tax rate of approximately 41% for both 2018 and 2017 for comparability purposes. Therefore, the effects of Tax Reform will largely be isolated so that we can focus on the underlying financial and operational drivers of the business.","Let's begin with a look at our core earnings drivers. Please turn to page 3.","For the third quarter 2018, Edison International reported core earnings of $1.56 per share, up $0.12 over the same period last year. From the table on the right-hand side, you will see that SCE had a positive $0.19 core EPS variance year-over-year. This variance was driven by $0.08 of lower operation and maintenance costs and $0.18 of income tax benefits versus the same period in the prior year.","The lower operation and maintenance expense is mainly due to the regulatory deferral of incremental line clearing and wildfire insurance costs. Higher income tax benefits were primarily related to the favorable impact of the lower 2018 tax rate on higher pre-tax income and true-ups related to the filing of our 2016 and 2017 tax returns.","The key EPS drivers table for SCE shows other smaller contributing items.","For the quarter, EIX Parent and Other had a negative $0.07 per share core earnings variance. This was largely due to a $0.5 negative variance at EIX Parent due to the absence of tax benefits from the same period last year and the impact of the lower 2018 tax rate resulting in a lower tax shield.","Please turn to page 4. I'm not going to review the year-to-date financial results in detail, but the earnings analysis is largely consistent with the third quarter results, except for higher operation and maintenance costs as compared to the same period last year.","The negative variance shown in the year-to-date period is primarily related to the net impact of costs that are not, at this point, being deferred into a regulatory asset. You may recall from the last earnings call that based on the outcome of the PG&E WEMA, we expected to be allowed to track our own incremental wildfire costs, including wildfire insurance premiums beginning at our April 3 application date.","Yesterday, we received a proposed decision in our WEMA application that does allow us to start tracking costs as of our application date. This proposed decision is subject to CPUC approval and these costs will ultimately be subject to a reasonableness review. As we discussed last quarter, SCE forecasted expenses of $92 million for liability insurance in its GRC for the 2018 Test Year. Approximately 80% is related to wildfire insurance. Overall, for 2018, premiums for the wildfire insurance we have obtained are approximately $237 million. In the third quarter, cumulative expenses for wildfire insurance for the period following our application date exceeded the Test Year 2018 amounts. As a result, we began to defer wildfire insurance costs.","As I have said previously, earnings comparisons pending a 2018 GRC decision are not meaningful.","We expect to report true-up when we receive a proposed decision. Once a proposed decision is issued, there is a regulatory requirement for a 30-day review and comment period before any final decision can be voted out.","We continue to expect a proposed decision by year-end, but based on the current CPUC meeting calendar, any proposed decision will need to be issued by November 13 in order to receive a final decision this year. As you know, we have established a memo account to track costs and the decision will be retroactive to January 1, 2018.","Please turn to page 5. In total, our SCE capital expenditures remained unchanged for the quarter on an aggregate basis. As a reminder, while 2019 and 2020 CPUC jurisdictional capital expenditures remain at the GRC request level, our 2018 capital expenditures aligned with our work execution plan for this year.","There are two items to note related to our capital spending plans. First, as we discussed previously, in May we received the final decision approving a $356 million medium- and heavy-duty vehicle transportation electrification program, of which $242 million is capital. We have now incorporated these expenditures into our forecast. The majority of that program's spend falls outside our forecast period; however, there is approximately $100 million of cumulative capital spending and an associated rate base increase of approximately $80 million through 2020.","Offsetting most of the near-term transportation electrification spending are adjustments to our FERC spending profile. During the quarter, we received a final decision on the Alberhill System Project. This decision holds the proceeding open and directs SCE to submit supplemental information on the project, including details of demand and load forecasts, and possible alternatives to the proposed project. We continue to believe the project as proposed is needed to serve forecasted local area demand and to increase reliability and operating flexibility. Given the ongoing analysis, we have deferred spending on the Alberhill System Project outside our forecast period.","Other projects that are not in our capital forecast include the proposed $760 million Charge Ready II application of which approximately $560 million is capital spending and our recently proposed $582 million Grid Safety and Resiliency application of which approximately $400 million is capital spending. We continue to work with the CPUC on these two proceedings and will update our forecast as necessary. Last, we expect to update our full forecast when we get a proposed decision on the 2018 GRC.","On page 6, rate base has remained largely the same except for a slight increase in 2020 related to the increase in capital spending from the medium- and heavy-duty vehicle transportation electrification education program, offset by FERC changes.","On page 7, you'll see our financial assumptions for 2018. We have laid out a few key items on this page that you should consider as you model 2018 and beyond. As a reminder, the information we provide on this slide reflects our new combined statutory tax rate of approximately 28%. Most of the information on this page has remained unchanged since last quarter. We do provide more detail regarding incremental wildfire insurance expenses, although we continue to expect our regulatory deferral to be $0.30 per share for the year.","Additionally, we no longer expect to receive energy efficiency incentives in 2018 due to a delay in the regulatory approval process. We now expect the incentives to be awarded in the first quarter 2019 and will update you further when we issue our 2019 EPS guidance.","I want to provide a few additional comments on other financial topics. At SCE, as of September 30, our average common equity component of total capitalization was 50%. During the third quarter of 2018, SCE file, and the CPUC made effective, a change to the calculation of the common equity component of SCE's capital structure moving from a 13-month to a 37-month weighted average basis. This corresponds to the standard period between cost of capital allocations. The 50% I noted reflects this change.","We continue to maintain a strong balance sheet at both the holding company and SCE. We also have the flexibility of these entities to obtain both short- and long-term debt while we continue to evaluate options as we work through uncertainty around the wildfire liability and cost recovery, await the 2018 General Rate Case decision and consider other requested capital programs such as Charge Ready II.","We continue to effectively access the capital markets to fund our rate base growth and other operational needs, while we also manage through the legislative, legal, regulatory, and operational solutions required to address the California wildfire issue. However, relative borrowing costs remain higher than we have experienced prior to the 2017 wildfires and will likely be further impacted by credit downgrades by Fitch and Moody's during the third quarter, which means increased costs to our customers.","That concludes my remarks.","Sam Ramraj - Edison International","Operator, please open the call for questions. As a reminder, we request you to limit yourself to one question and one follow-up so everyone in line has the opportunity to ask questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session of today's conference. Speakers, our first question comes from Ali Agha from SunTrust. Your line is now open.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you. Good afternoon.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Hi, Ali.","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","Hi.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hi. Pedro, first question, as you mentioned you have an ongoing internal wildfire investigation. And I just wanted to be clear, during your own internal investigation, have you found any procedural lapse or any other negligence on the part of your utility?","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","So, Ali, I think as I mentioned in my remarks this is an ongoing investigation and we're still missing crucial pieces of evidence including the equipment that CAL FIRE removed and we have not been able to access. So, we really don't have any conclusions that we can share in terms of causation of what happened. We know as we shared today that our equipment played a role in the Koenigstein Road ignition point, but that's all we've been able to conclude at this point, and we don't have any further conclusions on causation itself.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. And my second question, I also want to just clarify something from your opening remarks. You mentioned that you do anticipate to have material losses for the Thomas Fire and I want to clarify, that is before you assume any cost recovery, or is that assuming the final impact to Edison post any cost recovery, et cetera?","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Yeah. We wanted to signal to investors that we expect we will incur losses in the end; however, we just can't estimate what those might be right now. And you mentioned some of the reasons that we can't estimate them. I mean, just maybe dialing it back and going through the whole chain of things that will add up to a net exposure at the end of the day; first, we have just the final information in terms of claims, right. We're still getting claims through the legal process, so that's where exposure in a sense begins.","We also then have the information that is still being developed on what happened, right. And so today we shared one element that we now felt comfortable sharing, but we need to get into an understanding of what role \u2013 what things led to the actual cause of the event. As we go through the legal process, remember this will be litigation right? So litigation itself will create some limits in terms of what we can share as we go through the process and defend the company. But as we go through that process, what legal theories end up being found relevant by the court will matter. Is it inverse condemnation and the negligence approach, et cetera. Then we get to the fact that oftentimes these kind of cases don't end up going to final judgment but do end up settling, right. And so our exposure if we end up settling would be impacted by the balance of settlements, so the discount factor; as you often see discount factors in settlements in other cases.","And then finally, there's the question of CPUC cost recovery, which we would expect we'd be seeking cost recovery, but that would be a long process in and of itself; a process that typically happens after we've been through the bulk of the litigation or settlement progress and have a better understanding of what unrecovered amounts there may be beyond our insurance. So sorry to be a little more winded there, but I feel maybe helpful for you and for other investors on the line to understand that there's a whole sequence of events that will ultimately leave us with a final exposure. Today, we're saying, we do expect that we'd end up with a material exposure, but we're not able to estimate or provide a reasonable estimate of what that could be.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","I understand. Thank you very much.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Thanks, Ali.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Praful Mehta from Citigroup. Your line is open.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Hey, Praful.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks. Thanks so much. Hi, guys. I guess just drilling down a little bit more into this wildfire point. Is there, at this point, any view on the split of liability between the two ignition points? As in, will there be an ability to do that or do you think the fire is so blended together that in the end, the liabilities were kind of all \u2013 kind of get capped into one broader fire?","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","I think it's early to say. In some of the \u2013 maybe to echo some of the comments I made earlier. There is a lot of analysis that will take place, and then there will also be the going through the litigation process. Let me just point on one example the analysis that would be relevant here and that's fire progression, right? And what that means is, we're saying here that we are aware of at least two ignition points. We talked about two that we are aware of in Koenigstein and Anlauf Canyon. Those are somewhat removed from each other, right? So you can imagine that out of Koenigstein, there would have been some damage that ultimately would likely be attributed exclusively to Koenigstein because it happened within its near vicinity before the two fires merged, right?","Likewise, they might be damaged. It would be clearly attributable to the ignition at Anlauf Canyon because it would have been in its proximity. Fire progression that modeling that study that we're looking at right now just to point to one element here, looks at how did those two ignition points and the fires that emanated from them, how do they end up merging and to what extent is it clear, if it is, that if you then look at any point downstream as it were later on in the progression of the fire can one allocate responsibility to one or the other ignition points or whether it's exclusive (00:30:13) responsibility or whether it's a proportional responsibility based on how that fire may have progressed over time. That's a very complicated science. It's one of the things that we are looking at and that I mentioned.","But the results of that would be certainly one relevant element to answer your question of whether if ultimately there'll be a clear demarcation in terms of the responsibility for the overall fire damages between the two or more points. A little long winded there as well by just trying to illustrate how complicated this is, Praful, and that's one of the relevant factors that we and we expect plaintiffs also will be looking at in litigation.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks, Pedro, and appreciate the complexity, so helpful color. And just in that context, again, mudslides, would that also then have the same logic, you will look at the progression and see which kind of point was close or tied to the mudslides and link liability with that?","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Well, I think that's an even more fundamental question with the mudslides, which is to what extent will expert testimony establish that whether the mudslides were indeed catalyzed or influenced or impacted by the fires or whether those mudslides might have happened in any case given the torrential rains that took place in the period immediately preceding them. So we don't have conclusions there. But as you can imagine, our evaluation, our analysis is looking at the number of factors that may have preceded and potentially impacted the mudslides.","Now, to the extent that fires may be shown to be a factor, and again we \u2013 this is just an open question, at least for us, but if they were shown to be a factor, then I think that fire progression analysis could then be relevant in terms of looking all the way upstream at which ignition point may have had an impact on that or whether both ignition point had an impact but at different relative levels. Does that \u2013 I know we say question and one follow-up, but that's complex. Let me just ask any \u2013 do you have any clarification needed on that, or does that make sense?","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","It made sense to me, but I'm sure others will have follow-ups, but I'll allow for others to come back and ask questions and I'll come back in queue. Thanks so much, Pedro.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Great. Thanks, Praful.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Hi there, Julien?","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, good afternoon. Hey. So I'll take Praful up on that, perhaps, can you elaborate a little bit with respect to what's your understanding is: A, with regards to any other potential involvement on that particular Koenigstein Road, e.g. maybe cable companies and others? And then separately, can you elaborate a little bit on the precedents established around negligence when there's multiple initiation points?","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Let me take an initial shot and Adam Umanoff, our General Counsel, may want to add here. In terms of your first question, I don't think we are able to opine further beyond the disclosure we made today. I'll just stick to the point that we made in the disclosures that we are now \u2013 based on the progress we've made in our evaluation with the information that we have, we can now say with a greater degree of certainty that our equipment was involved in Koenigstein. I don't think we have commented on other underlying factors and in fact, as I said earlier, the whole cause of the fire, what may have led our equipment to end up becoming a factor is something that we're still reviewing and we need, for example, to obtain access to our equipment that's being held by CAL FIRE before we can have a final determination. So I think that's all I can say about that one, Julien, on the point of other cases of negligence, Adam, you want to pipe in here?","Adam S. Umanoff - Edison International","So, Julien, I think as you probably know and we've certainly disclosed previously, there are various theories under which a plaintiff could seek recovery for damages caused by a wildfire. In the case of inverse condemnation claims, all the plaintiff has to show is that our equipment substantially caused the damage. A negligence claim is very different. In a negligence claim, the plaintiff needs to show that we breached our standard of care, which is generally we have to operate as a reasonable and prudent operator of our equipment that we design, operate, and maintain the equipment reasonably.","A negligence case will involve a dispute. Plaintiffs will argue that we were negligent \u2013 we didn't reasonably design, operate, and maintain equipment. We will defend based upon our claims that we did. And most of these cases involve expert testimony, experts on either side, the defendant and the plaintiff arguing the case as to whether or not the conduct was or was not negligent. Does that help?","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Sure. And then with regards to \u2013 as a follow-up here on the memo account that you talked about for the $407 million of capital for the resiliency, can you talk about the timing that your expectations there? I mean, is your expectation there in filing for the memo that this could happen fairly rapidly, akin to what you've seen with the WEMA?","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","We were \u2013 Maria may have more to add here, but we \u2013 certainly, we're hoping that we can get a determination on the memo account establishment in the near term. I'm thinking we have proposed a schedule, that schedule that we proposed would have had a final decision on the final \u2013 the full program including the two-way balancing account by I believe August of next year. And I think as part of that schedule, the timing for the memo account would have been within, say, the end of this year or so. Maria, anything to add there or...?","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","No, I think that's it, Pedro.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thank you, all.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Thanks, Julien.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jonathan Arnold from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Hi, Jonathan.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good afternoon, guys. I think the \u2013 I have one question I just have \u2013 has been coming up is when you guys say that you feel you might have or you'll likely have material losses, that \u2013 you're not implying that you think that there's negligence, right? It could have occurred via inverse condemnation or negligence, doesn't really matter once you've decided your asset was the substantial cause, you probably will have a loss of one kind or another, is that...?","(00:37:31)","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Yeah. And just to simplify, what we're saying is we expect we'll have some kind of loss that will be material. However, we're not commenting on how large that could be because I said and also Adam's comments were relevant to this, we'll be going into a litigation process that will include litigating the theory under which we are found liable and then probably in a much more basic point, while we have pointed to our equipment at Koenigstein being involved, as I said earlier, we have not provided any conclusions because we don't have any conclusions yet on what the costs would have been of that equipment as leading to the ignition, right.","We don't know to what extent we \u2013 if the negligence standard applied in court or later on showing and producing (00:38:31) at the PUC, we just don't have sufficient facts at hand to determine the degree to which we acted prudently and reasonably, and we probably won't know that until we have more pieces of information including access to the equipment that CAL FIRE currently has and that we haven't been able to see.","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","And just maybe to expand a little bit, Jonathan, so the material loss that Pedro mentioned in his prepared remarks that's related to the whole host of things that I and Pedro have already talked about as around the ignition point and the fact that the association of our equipment with that ignition point. But the other part of the analysis is insurance recovery and we have $1 billion of insurance for that period, and then, separately of an analysis of probability of recovery. That's more complex than the analysis of \u2013 in the insurance, obviously. But those are the other components that are \u2013 so we have to think about them in different buckets.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Yeah.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","So does your statement and what you've just said, Maria, mean that you expect to have an exposure that exceeds your insurance and likelihood of recovery, or are you just talking about the sort of the number itself?","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","I think that we \u2013 as Pedro mentioned, we have not had access to the equipment yet that was at Koenigstein Road. There is a lot of information that we still need to obtain from third-party sources and others, things that will come up during the course of litigation. I think right now, we're still going through all of that. And as we get more information, we'll be able to develop a more specific response.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then, if you \u2013 I think that was kind of a \u2013 oh, and one other thing, you said you're going to make \u2013 you're making moderate investments in the mitigation program, I mean, can you give us any quantification of moderate?","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","Sure. That's related to what we were calling our GS&RP, our Grid Safety and Resiliency Program, so that's the filing that we made not too long ago. It covers the year 2008 \u2013 balance of the year 2018, 2019, and 2020. Overall, that's about $407 million. I believe that the 2018 spending is in the $50 million or so range that's for the balance of the year. So that's what we're saying in terms of moderate expenditure.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Just one final thing, Maria. You said you would probably give a full update of your outlook when you got the PD on the rate case, I think, in your prepared remarks. Is that, which clearly could come any day, in which case might you even have such a thing at the EEI conference, for example?","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","So obviously, probably from the last time I'm sure you recall that the proposed decision is more than 1,000 pages typically, the ALJ ruling. We will work diligently to read as fast as we can and to update the capital spending for the period as well as the rate base outlook then for the period. It will still be a proposed decision, so we might have various caveats that we might want to associate with that update.","But yeah, we will be trying, obviously, as hard as we possibly can if something were to come out between now and then. I think that might have actually happened in the previous case where we got a proposed decision right before \u2013 or final decision right before EEI.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. But I did hear you right that you would \u2013 the trigger in this case would be the PD not necessarily...?","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","Yeah. So we're going to update rate base and capital based on the proposed decision. Because it's a proposed decision, we may have commentary around things we may or may not agree with still at that point. But yes, that's what we will do.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thank you. Sorry for all the questions.","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","No, it's fine.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks, Jonathan.","Operator","Thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from Shahriar Pourreza from Guggenheim Partners. Your line is now open.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Hey. Good afternoon, guys. So let me just ask you, Pedro, just around this. I mean, when you guys made your dividend decision and you went through a pretty painstaking process and you came up with multiple scenarios and you sort of book-ended it, right? So I guess, my first question is, is what you're finding as things are progressing as data points come out, is this still sort of in line with your book-end scenario, i.e., material impact? Any thoughts around your dividend decision?","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Yeah. Hey, Shahriar, thanks for the question. And just to remind everybody, I think you captured it well, we've communicated in our \u2013 and actually not just one, right, but in all of our prior dividend decisions since the wildfire topic came up, that we and our board have looked at a very broad range of potential scenarios and have not based our dividend decision on an expected outcome; rather, we've based it on being comfortable that we could satisfy all of our obligations under a very negative outcome.","I don't want to get ahead of our next quarterly decision, dividend decision. So I never want to get ahead of that. But I think that the disclosure that we're making today is certainly in line with the kinds of scenarios that we have explored in the past and that led to the dividend decisions we made previously.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Okay, got it, so that answers that. And then, just let me just on the more technicality. What triggered the disclosure, right? I mean, what \u2013 there's obviously I'm getting questions around the timing of why you disclosed today. The process is still really unclear. There's still parallel paths happening. Why not wait a little bit because this \u2013 does this leave you open to a lot of interpretations?","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","I appreciate that question, too. And, look, this is an ongoing review by our team. Just as you expect, it's an ongoing review by the folks at CAL FIRE and the folks at Ventura County Fire and the folks at the CPUC Safety and Enforcement Division. In our case, we've been working all along. We learn more almost literally every day and we felt that based on that learning curve that we've had over the past months, we thought it was appropriate for us to make this disclosure today on this particular piece of the fire.","Not just for anything \u2013 anything else or rather other than, the analysis, I mean, it's not just the analysis of talking to eyewitnesses, and I believe there's been some eyewitness' comments that have been captured in the press previously over the past several months, but it's not just that. It's looking at the equipment that we do have. As I've said we can't look at the equipment that we don't have, but we can look at fire indicators around the area and look at fire progression modeling. And all of these things that we're looking at, just trying to give you a flavor. It's not appropriate for us to go into those boring details given that this is litigation.","But we felt that that had progressed to a point where it made sense for us to make today's disclosure.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","But I guess what I'm asking, Pedro, is why front-run CAL FIRE? Why not wait till they've finished their investigation?","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Yeah. And I'm not sure we see this as necessarily front-running. Clearly CAL FIRE has pieces of evidence that we don't, and they'll come up with conclusions that in the end we may agree with or may not agree with. We view this as a much narrower decision in that it's about this one site. At this point, we felt that the evidence was very clear. Just the evidence that we had, the analysis that we had was very clear that our equipment was involved. And so, we thought it was appropriate to make that disclosure.","We don't see anything in the CAL FIRE report that would change the fact or our assessment that our equipment was involved; hence, made sense to disclose it. We don't view it as a front-running per se of the CAL FIRE process, and we continue to be ready, willing, and able to cooperate with CAL FIRE. We've been answering their questions and jointly be very responsive in that regard.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Got it. I'll let everyone else ask questions. Thanks, guys.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Hey. Thanks. Appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Greg Gordon from Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Hi, Greg.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Thanks. Good afternoon. So when you say that you expect to incur a material loss that \u2013 just to be sure I understand the strict legal interpretation of that, that's before you start to assess whether or not your insurance would recover \u2013 would cover some or all of it before you assess whether or not there's a path for recovery through the PUC, et cetera? It's just how \u2013 it's a large enough gross number before all those other factors that you feel you have to disclose it, is that correct or incorrect?","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","That's correct. When you think about how \u2013 this is Maria, by the way, Greg. When you think about how you work through that on your financial statements, you actually do think about the liabilities separately from the asset. So that's the \u2013 I don't want to use the word progression, but that's the sequence of events on how you would think about it.","Now in some cases, insurance, I think, is a relatively straightforward bucket. I think in terms of cost recovery, we have to work through that and look at prior precedents and think through what this particular situation is and if it's \u2013 there's something here that there were similar facts and circumstances in the past before we would actually then book regulatory asset around that. So I think that you do have to go through sort of the thought process around each of those components individually.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Okay. Okay. And then to switch to a more financial topic on follow-up, looking at page 7, where you talked about financial assumptions and comparing that to what you said on the Q2 call, you on the Q2 call said you would expect incremental wildfire insurance costs $0.38 and you expect to defer $0.30. You're now saying that you expect to recover substantially all of them. So can you tell us what's changed there and then you've removed the $0.03 line item for energy efficiency, can you explain that as well?","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","Okay. So let's see maybe just to walk through, so we have here on page 7 that we continue to believe that it's $0.38 of incremental wildfire insurance. We believe that most incremental costs are probable of recovery. So if you recall the differentiating I'll call it the line in the sand, if you will, is the application date for our WEMA, so that's April 3. We did prior to filing that WEMA also filed the Z-Factor letter, which would actually cover us for more than the $0.30, but \u2013 where we cover the delta between \u2013 approximately the delta between $0.30 and $0.38, but because we didn't have precedents around the Z-Factor that we're exactly on point, we actually didn't defer the cost until we filed our WEMA, until we saw the PG&E WEMA decision. Obviously, subsequently yesterday we got our own decision. So then we said we could defer the costs.","The detail later on in that bullet is about the $0.14 that we've deferred so far in Q3. We expect to defer an additional $0.14 in Q4 and then $0.02 comes from the FERC, so that's the $0.30 versus the $0.38 with the $0.08 delta.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","And then the energy efficiency?","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","Sorry. And then the energy efficiency, that's a \u2013 I would say that's a procedural issue, the Energy Division has not yet issued \u2013 they basically go through I'll call it all the math on energy efficiency and determine sort of what we would actually earn on those programs. They have been delayed, frankly, in issuing the document that goes through all of that. We thought we would get it earlier in the summer. It's now been delayed given the CPUC calendar.","For the balance of the year, we don't think it's likely that they will actually issue that. And then even when they do issue that, there's a comment period that's required as well. Therefore, we're looking for that in 2019. And we wouldn't accrue for that until we get all of that done.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Thank you.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Thanks, Greg.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Lapides from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Hello, Michael.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hey, guys. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. How do you think about how much balance sheet capacity you have, whether it's to fund the incremental rate base growth or to fund potential liabilities or related to wildfires or some combination thereof? How do you think about how much incremental balance sheet either at the SCE level or at the HoldCo investing in SCE, do you think you have over the kind of the life of your kind of rate base and CapEx forecast?","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","Let me start with a real high level answer and turn over to Maria. But I think you've heard this message consistently from us. We have a strong balance sheet. We have strong capacity there. Maria mentioned in her comments continuing access to the short and longer term debt markets. We also acknowledge though that the wildfire liability being a key uncertainty, right, it will be helpful to understand over the long run what that final exposure really is because then we can think about how we best optimize the use of our balance sheet to cover that. We're confident that we have the balance sheets to cover that. How specifically we end up dealing with that specific liability, when we get to that point we can optimize around that; but, Maria, I'll just turn over to you.","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","Sure. So, Michael, I think we think about a number of different things in terms of it. So first, just maybe touch on a page or thing, we do have a number of things that we're balancing and thinking about. So it's the wildfire, the potential overall exposure there as well as any recovery that would be associated with that. There is the GRC \u2013 2018 GRC decision and we're gearing up for the 2021 GRC at this point. So there is that, there are the capital requests and capital requirements that are happening outside of our GRC requests. So it's Charge Ready II, but it's the Grid Resiliency plan that we just filed. So there's a lot of things, I'll say on the investment side of the ledger and\/or potentially the wildfire issue.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it.","(00:54:20)","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","...on the other side, I mean, what we're looking at is sort of debt capacity, it's both short-term and long-term debt capacity. We're looking at SCEs, equity capitalization rate, which right now is about \u2013 at the end of the quarter I think was 50%, so a little bit higher than what is required by the CPUC. And then we balance across a whole lot of different issues, what's the cost, where is the best place to finance. We will think about how the rating agencies will react to all of that and how do we stay aligned so that there's no undue impact between the holding company decisions and operating company decision.","So it's a lot of factors, Michael, and we will continue to assess them as we get more and more information around some of these other elements like the wildfire liability, GRC decision, capital investment requirements.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Can you remind us, what's your target when we think, I mean, FFO to debt level, meaning how do you think about what your goal is? And I don't mean in any necessarily one specific year, but I mean kind of on an ongoing basis, what your target credit metric is?","Maria C. Rigatti - Edison International","Yeah. So we don't typically talk about specific target number, I mean, obviously, a lot of that has to do with how the rating agencies view us. Obviously, how do they view California. There's been a little bit of stress around that recently.","We have been comfortable at the ratings that we have been at over the past any number of years now. Obviously, we just were downgraded recently but Edison International, so for example where Moody's has us a Baa1, and Southern California Edison is an A3. We're stable there. On the other hand, S&P we're BBB+ and negative outlook at both entities.","But generally speaking, put aside some of the noise that's been created by assessments of the wildfire issues, SB 901 ongoing, we're continuing improvements in the regulatory construct. We're comfortable in that range and we're also always alert to sort of any divergences between the holding company and the offering company.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. And then one quick last regulatory one. How are you thinking about next year's cost to capital docket? I mean, is there a scenario, especially for you and your neighbor part of the north where intervenors would be willing to forgo the docket and maybe the commission would as well considering \u2013 it's hard to see the math coming out with dramatically lower authorized ROEs, especially for the neighbor to your north, but maybe you guys as well?","Pedro J. Pizarro - Edison International","I think our base assumption right now based on what the commissioner said in the last cost of capital proceeding is that they want to have the benefit of going through a full proceeding because it's a re-education process for everyone. And I don't think any of the commissioners who are sitting today were here for the last full round of cost of capital discussions. So with that base scenario, you never say never, right? People can change minds or whatever. But I think at this point, the base scenario would be if we go to a full proceeding. And when we do, we will be very ready for that. The arguments that have ruled the day in the past in terms of the need for a California premium are even more acute today.","It's all frankly, all the good risks, right? The important risk that we will have to take to make sure that we're helping California do more renewables and more energy efficiency and the like. And now, add on to that, doing it with more electrification, different uses of the grid, more need to look at cybersecurity. And then of course, let's not forget, the large risk that still we have to deal with the wildfires. So all of those will, I think, add to the argument for a premium ROE.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. Thank you, guys. Much appreciated.","Operator","Thank you. That was the last question, and now we'll return the call back to Mr. Sam Ramraj.","Sam Ramraj - Edison International","Thank you for joining us today, and please call us if you have any follow-up questions.

Craver, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Allie, and good afternoon, everyone. Our first quarter core earnings were $0.82 per share, $0.08 per share lower than last year's first quarter. Most of this decline was due to timing differences at SCE during 2015, which were caused by the delay in receiving the 2015 to 2017 General Rate Case. The underlying earnings in the first quarter of 2016 are consistent with the profile we expect for the year. Therefore, today we are reaffirming our 2016 core earnings guidance of $3.81 to $4.01 per share. Jim will elaborate on all of this in his remarks.","I will focus most of my comments today on SCE's long-term growth potential. This is particularly relevant as we prepare for our 2018 to 2020 General Rate Case filing in September, and as the dialogue continues before the CPUC on the Distribution Resources Plan and related proceedings.","We believe that there is good visibility to long-term sustained investment of at least $4 billion annually. They should in turn yield rate base growth of approximately $2 billion a year. We have confidence in these levels of investment for several complementary reasons. First, our strategy is very much aligned with California's goals of creating a low carbon economy and providing customers with energy technology choices.","Second, we see several different infrastructure areas that require years of continued investment, all of which can be expanded further from today's levels and can be flexibly substituted for each other.","Third, we have been steadily improving our ability to control overheads and fuel and purchased power costs in order to keep customer rate increases low, even with higher capital expenditures.","And finally, as our rate base continues to grow, higher levels of investment can be more easily digested without stressing equity levels or our ability to execute the work. I will expand on each of these points further.","As we look at the potential investments on the horizon, they support, and are supported by, several critical public policy initiatives. The overarching policy support comes from California's desire to create a vibrant low carbon economy. This is not solely a goal of policymakers, but rooted in strong public support across income and ethnic divides.","It is well understood that the state's low carbon goals cannot be met without substantially greater electrification of stationary and mobile sources of energy use. Decarbonization is supported by California's existing carbon cap-and-trade system, which does not rely on U.S. EPA's new carbon rules to be implemented. There is also strong support for clean energy technology development in the state, driven in part by the importance of Silicon Valley to the state's economy and its political influence.","Importantly, Edison supplies the critical electric infrastructure investment needed to meet the state's low carbon goals and facilitate customer choice of new clean energy technology. Let me discuss the areas of infrastructure investment needed to meet the goals of providing safe, reliable and low-emitting power to our customers.","Starting with the basics, reliability of the core electric infrastructure requires routine replacement of ageing poles, transformers, underground cable and so on. Our system grew rapidly after World War II through the 1970s. Therefore, many components are reaching their mean time to failure and must be replaced. SCE's infrastructure replacement program alone represents more than half of our total distribution system capital expenditures. To give you an idea of the size of this task, each year we replace on average 24,000 distribution poles, 4,000 transmission poles, 500 miles of underground cable, and 225 substation circuit breakers.","Complementing basic infrastructure replacement is the need to adapt our power grid to changing customer preferences and to new technologies. This evolution to a technologically advanced electric delivery system was outlined in the Distribution Resources Plan, or DRP, that SCE filed last summer. Many of these potential investments are incremental to the investments that make up our current $4 billion annual CapEx. This vision for modernizing the grid will be an important principle as SCE develops its upcoming General Rate Case filing.","The CPUC's regulatory proceedings on distributed energy resources are still in the early stages. Initial insights from the proceeding appear to endorse some of the approaches we recommended in our DRP filing, while suggesting different approaches in other areas.","SCE's General Rate Case filing will be made well before the CPUC has made its full recommendations in the DRP and related proceedings. As a result, SCE will be making its best judgments on the scope and approach to grid modernization in its GRC filing. During the general rate case proceeding, SCE's views will be synchronized with those of other stakeholders, informed by the discussions taking place in the CPUC's broader Distribution Resources Plan proceedings.","The GRC will be the cornerstone proceeding for determining SCE's distribution system investment program. However, there are several complementary initiatives that represent additional investment in the power grid of the future, and that are not part of the current $4 billion annual CapEx.","The first is electric vehicle charging. Last month, the CPUC officially authorized SCE to commence spending under the Charge Ready pilot program they previously approved. The pilot covers the first 1,500 stations of an eventual plan for 30,000 charging systems. The total program is estimated to provide roughly one-third of the charging infrastructure needed in SCE's service territory for autos and light-duty vehicles at multi-family dwellings and public locations. While the rate base opportunity for the full program is approximately $225 million over several years, it is possible that the CPUC will consider higher levels of utility investment in charging infrastructure.","Longer term, we think it is likely that additional opportunities for vehicle charging and other infrastructure may result from the transportation electrification initiative included in Senate Bill 350, signed into law last year. The bill is better known for establishing the mandate for electric utilities to deliver 50% of their customer load from renewable resources by 2030. But it also expanded the potential scope and scale of transportation electrification, which could support investments beyond SCE's current Charge Ready light-duty vehicle initiative.","The objective is to support California meeting its long-term carbon reduction targets and federal Clean Air Act standards. The electric sector in California, especially the three investor-owned utilities, have become very low carbon-emitting, while the transportation sector has not. The result is that today nearly 40% of total carbon emissions in the state comes from the transportation sector, compared to less than 20% for the electric sector.","As part of the implementation of SB 350, this fall the CPUC is expected to order investor-owned electric power companies to submit proposals for investments and programs that will accelerate widespread adoption of transportation electrification. This would include potentially higher levels of light-duty vehicle charging infrastructure than SCE's current target of providing 30,000 chargers. It could also include charging infrastructure for medium-duty and heavy-duty vehicles such as electric buses, trucks and tractors, which are especially important in meeting increasingly stringent air quality requirements in the LA Basin. These early concepts were part of the agenda at a CPUC workshop in San Francisco last Friday, hosted by assigned Commissioner Peterman.","Another potential investment class not included in our $4 billion annual CapEx is the CPUC's energy storage initiative. SCE has the opportunity to build half of its required 580 megawatts of energy storage and place it in its rate base by 2024. We have yet to attempt to estimate the potential capital spending, rate base or timing of this investment. However, storage is a mandated program and could be significant. The DRP process may spell out a greater role for storage solutions located in the distribution systems as the economics improve and the carbon-reduction attributes of storage relative to gas-fired generation become more apparent.","Transmission investments remain an important complement to SCE's distribution system investment program, though the planning process and scale are quite different. SCE continues to implement three major California ISO-approved investments. These projects are needed for transmission reliability and support the State's renewable portfolio mandate.","On April 11, SCE received a proposed decision to approve the $1.1 billion West of Devers project recommended by SCE and the California ISO. You may recall that we informed you last November of delays in the regulatory approvals of this project due to consideration of an alternative, staged-project. The proposed decision largely adopts the project as we originally proposed. It could be approved as early as May 12.","Assuming the PD is adopted by the Commission, and once the required federal approvals are received, the project will be ready to begin construction. The West of Devers project will help California meet its 50% renewables portfolio standard.","California ISO is in the early stages of planning for the transmission infrastructure to meet the expanded renewables requirement. This will be integrated with efforts underway to extend the span of the ISO to include adjacent electric power companies in other states. There is likely to be a continuing debate about whether the future resource mix should favor more utility-scale renewables with expanded transmission capacity or distributed resources enabled by an advanced distribution system. I expect it will be a mix of the two models. SCE is positioned to participate in both models. We expect either approach will expand the investment opportunity at SCE beyond the current $4 billion annual level.","While it is difficult to predict the exact trajectory of investment levels required to support California's policy objectives, our general belief is that investment levels could potentially grow beyond current CapEx levels. A critical objective that we and the CPUC share is to avoid causing customer rates from becoming unaffordable due to this expanded infrastructure investment.","Our objective has been to keep customer rate increases at or below the rate of inflation in our service territory. To date, our record of accomplishing this goal is quite good. The compound annual growth rate of SCE's System Average Rate has consistently stayed below that of the Consumer Price Index for our service territory.","This is true, whether you look at the last five years, 10 years, 15 years or even the last 20 years. It is especially notable that this has occurred when kilowatt hour usage since 2007 has been flat to declining. Indeed, our System Average Rate in 2016 has dropped 8% from 2015 levels. Importantly, customers react mostly to their monthly bill, not kilowatt hour rates. And our average monthly residential electric bill last year was $94, meaningfully below the national average of $127 a month.","We have accomplished this through a sharp focus on reducing overhead costs, creating efficiencies, and due to the benefits of the SONGS Settlement as well as declines in fuel costs.","A concluding thought on keeping rates affordable longer term; I believe the growing percentage of the renewables in our generation mix is creating an excellent hedge against the potential future spikes in natural gas prices. Although I don't expect much upward pressure on natural gas prices in the near to intermediate term, it is difficult to imagine much room for prices to go lower. SCE's generation mix will move up from the current level of roughly 25% renewables to 50%.","The cost of renewables new-build is increasingly becoming equal to or better than natural gas new-build. Also, since renewables have no fuel cost, customer rates are increasingly less exposed to future natural gas price spikes. All of this helps to keep our rate increases modest and electricity affordable, while we increase our investment in building an advanced electric delivery system.","As I've discussed, SCE has several potential areas of incremental investment, which gives us flexibility to ramp up one program if another starts to lag. This, along with the steadily expanding rate base, earnings and cash flow, allows us to maintain a reasonable and growing total investment program without creating pressure to issue equity or having customer rates rise beyond inflation rates. A balanced program like this should also allow us to continue to provide higher-than-industry-average growth in earnings and dividends.","I'd like to conclude with a brief discussion of power grid reliability this summer in the wake of the Aliso Canyon shutdown. SCE is working closely with California regulators and Sempra's Southern California Gas Company on impacts from potential delays in returning the Aliso Canyon gas storage facility to use. Aliso Canyon provides pipeline pressure balancing to the Los Angeles Basin year-round. It also provides additional supplies in the winter when heating needs increase demand beyond the capability of interstate pipeline deliveries. SCE is one of SoCal Gas' largest customers and very focused on this issue. Because of the shutdown, the risk to electric reliability has increased, which presents its own public safety implications.","As we see it, the best scenario for electric reliability is to expeditiously complete inspections of a few of the more important wells to determine if they could be safely returned to service in time for summer peak power use.","SCE is also working on contingency plans to reduce demand and maximize generation flexibility. At the CPUC's direction, SCE has requested a memorandum account to track any unusual costs related to Aliso Canyon. These include costs related to demand response, energy efficiency, power contracts, et cetera. These costs are not expected to be sizeable. Any extra customer costs related to inefficient power plant dispatch will be captured as part of the ERRA balancing account mechanism. Although this situation shouldn't create financial risks for SCE, it is a potential reliability issue for our customers.","Okay. That's it for me. I'll now turn it over to Jim for his financial report.","Jim Scilacci - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Okay. Thanks, Ted. Please turn to page two of the presentation. As Ted indicated, today we are reaffirming our core earnings guidance. I want to emphasize the quarterly earnings profile will be difficult to model given two primary factors; SCE's delay in receiving its 2015 GRC decision and because revenues are generally weighted towards the third quarter of the year.","As discussed when we introduced our 2016 earnings guidance, the simplified rate base approach is the best way to think about SCE's earnings power on an annual basis. SCE's rate base is growing, and this implies increasing earnings. However, anticipated revenue increases from both the CPUC and FERC were masked by the timing of revenues recognized in 2015. You will recall that until SCE received its 2015 GRC proposed decision, revenues were largely based on 2014 authorized levels. SCE recorded a significant year-to-date revenue adjustment in the third quarter of 2015 and a large regulatory asset write-off in the fourth quarter in connection with the final decision.","With that in mind, let's look at SCE's earnings drivers. To simplify the earnings explanation, we removed the impact of San Onofre and tax repair and pole loading deductions. On a GAAP basis, as shown in the 10-Q, revenues are down $41 million, which is equivalent to $0.08 per share. As explained in footnote four, the 2016 revenue reduction relates to incremental tax repair and cost of removal deductions for the pole loading program in excess of levels authorized in the 2015 GRC.","As we have previously explained, the GRC decision established balancing accounts to track forecast differences compared to actuals. Importantly, with these balancing accounts, there is no impact on earnings. Lastly, this is also the main driver for the low effective income tax rate for the quarter.","After the adjustments, revenues are a net $0.04 per share positive contribution on a quarter-over-quarter basis. Breaking revenues down, there is an $0.08 per share GRC attrition mechanism increase. This mechanism provides for increases in revenues after the 2015 test year. Largely, offsetting this is a $0.06 per share timing issue on the GRC decision.","As I mentioned earlier, reductions in authorized revenues from the GRC decisions are not reflected in the first quarter or second quarter 2015 results and were adjusted in the third quarter with the proposed decision and then again in the fourth quarter with the final GRC decision.","Finish up on revenues, FERC revenues are $0.02 per share higher, largely for higher depreciation expense. This nets to a positive $0.04 per share earnings contribution from revenues.","Moving to O&M, costs are $0.04 per share higher than last year. A significant factor in this was planned El Ni\u00f1o preparation costs, where SCE staged equipment such as portable generators in areas that could be sensitive to storm-related outages, as well as costs associated with responses to storms. While the Southern California El Ni\u00f1o phenomenon did not materialize at the level that had been predicted by many, we did see more significant storm activity than we experienced in 2015.","Other important items include planned higher costs for distribution system inspections as well as higher severance costs resulting from ongoing efforts to drive increased productivity and efficiency. Higher depreciation of $0.02 per share reflects the normal trend supporting SCE's wires-focused capital spending program.","Income taxes, excluding the tax balancing account related items I've already discussed, are $0.02 per share higher than last year. The effective tax rate in the quarter is 14% compared to 24% last year. As I said previously, the lower rate largely reflects the incremental tax benefits above authorized levels. Excluding the $0.13 per share incremental tax benefits, the effective tax rate would have been 34%.","Turning to Edison International earnings drivers, overall costs are higher by $0.03 per share. Holding company costs are comparable to last year. We had no affordable housing earnings this year, since the portfolio was sold last December, while in Q1 of 2015 we recorded $0.01 per share of earnings.","Edison Energy's net loss is $0.02 per share higher than last year. This reflects expected development and operating costs of Edison Energy's businesses and timing of revenues from the newly acquired businesses.","Revenues are $6 million in the first quarter of 2016. Our reported sales from last year were $3 million and only included SoCore Energy and not the recently acquired companies. I'd also like to remind investors that our financing strategy for SoCore Energy's commercial solar program primarily uses third-party tax equity and project financing. As a result, a portion of project economics go to the tax equity investors.","Holding company results on a core basis exclude earnings related to the hypothetical liquidation at book value accounting method for SoCore Energy's tax equity financings. This is $0.01 per share this year versus $0.02 per share last year.","So overall, Edison International core earnings are down $0.08 per share.","Please turn to page three. SCE's capital spending forecast is unchanged from our last call. First quarter and actual SCE's spending of $1 billion is consistent with 2016 authorized levels. Keep in mind that this forecast does not include any DRP-related spending. SCE will continue to evaluate whether to pursue any early stage work this year. Page four shows SCE's rate base forecast, which is also unchanged.","Please turn to page five. The West of Devers project Ted mentioned is one of the two large transmission projects where most of the investment will be on the current rate base guidance period. Some of you may have followed this proceeding, and there's one unique aspect to the project. Some of the West of Devers route transits the Morongo Indian reservation in the Coachella Valley. As discussed in our 10-K, a Morongo transmission entity has an option to invest $400 million or up to one half of the $1.1 billion project at commercial operation, which SCE expects to be in 2021. For internal planning purposes, SCE assumes that the option will be exercised. The 2018 GRC will include capital expenditures through 2020. With the option exercise date falling just outside of the period of time we will be providing more visibility on, we thought it was important to bring this option to the attention of investors and analysts.","Please turn to page six. We have reaffirmed our core earnings guidance for the full year at $3.81 per share to $4.01 per share and updated our GAAP guidance for first-quarter non-core items. Our key assumptions are also unchanged.","That's it for me. Operator, let's get started with the Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question is coming from Michael Weinstein of UBS. Your line is now open.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Hey, it's Julien here.","Jim Scilacci - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hi, Julien. It's Jim.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Hey, Jim. So, first question, you talked about SB 350 on the call just now. Can you elaborate how the regulatory schedule would jibe with what you've already underway on the 30,000 EV deployment? And kind of when you think about the scale of deployment contemplated and the ability to own it, I mean what kind of opportunity is that relative to even just the $225 million (30:37) elaborated?","Jim Scilacci - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So, Julien, I'm going to turn that over to Pedro Pizarro.","Pedro J. Pizarro - President & Director, Southern California Edison Co.","Hi, there. So, starting with the charge rating piece, I think Jim and Ted had mentioned already we now have approval for the pilot phase, that's the first 1,500 chargers' worth. And as soon as we get to the pilot phase, we'll go back to the PUC with a report and have that proceeded and seek authorization to take on the balance of the up to 30,000 chargers covered by the Charge Ready program.","And I think we'll have visibility into that, and in terms of the regulatory timeline for that, I think it's envisioned that the pilot might take up to 12 months, we will go to the PUC as soon as we have enough data from the pilot. And tough to forecast how long it might take the PUC to provide approval for the balance of the Charge Ready Program, but we will be going back as soon as we have pilot data.","Separate from that, in terms of additional opportunities, I think in Ted's remarks he commented how it is possible that the PUC might envision a further role for us; I think, a couple directions for that. One could be that with the Charge Ready program, we've estimated those 30,000 chargers would cover about a third of the need for charging infrastructure to meet the state's objectives for electric vehicle deployment. So one potential thrust would be whether the PUC might support us going even further than the Charge Ready program. They want to \u2013 don't have any forecast or anything like that there but that is one potential direction.","The other one is SB 350, there is talk about support for a broader utility role in transportation electrification and that could go beyond light-duty vehicles, that could go to other forms of transportation. Again tough to put our arms around what that could be, it will intersect with the integrated resource plan proceeding that's also called for by SB 350 that's just undergoing, scoping at the PUC now. So while we can't point precisely to a specific program or specific number side of it, I think the theme is that there is a general recognition in the state that transportation electrification, whether light-duty vehicles or heavier transport, it's going to be a big part of achieving greenhouse gas targets and it's likely there's some possibility for further utility roles there.","Theodore F. Craver, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Julien, this is Ted, maybe just one other thing to add in there is as I mentioned, this fall, the PUC is expected order the investor-owned utilities to submit proposals for investments and programs related to the transportation electrification initiative in SB 350. So I think we'll have a little bit more visibility late this year as to at least what the initial thinking is from the PUC.","Jim Scilacci - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hey, Julien, this is Jim. Just to finalize the point, when we file the General Rate Case later this year, we'll include in our forecast of capital expenditures an estimate of spending for electric vehicles and we are developing that now based on what we are seeing in the pilot. We'll have to come up with an estimate that covers beyond \u2013 through all the way through 2020. And we will include that as part of our normal expenditures.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Including the 350 piece, the SB 350 piece?","Jim Scilacci - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. And then, Jim, just actually a quick subsequent follow-up from our prior conversations, MHI arbitration, just timing expectations, if you can just give us the latest.","Jim Scilacci - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, we'll let Adam Umanoff, our General Counsel, have that fun one.","Adam S. Umanoff - Executive Vice President & General Counsel","Thank you, Jim. As you know, we operate under a confidentiality order issued by the International Arbitration Tribunal. What we can tell you is that we've conducted a hearing, the hearing has ended at the end of last week, April 29, and we are expecting a ruling from the tribunal by the end of this year. It's possible it could go over into early 2017, but our current expectation is by the end of this year.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Is there something beyond the current hearing that needs to happen and to get a ruling?","Adam S. Umanoff - Executive Vice President & General Counsel","There is the usual post-hearing exchange of briefs and then consideration by the tribunal. We're not expecting any further testimony or any further proceedings in the hearing itself.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thank you, guys.","Jim Scilacci - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Julien.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Greg Gordon of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC","Thanks, guys. Just a simple question. When you quote that $2 billion notional sort of rate base growth number, obviously that's before some of the other things you discussed. Does that contemplate bonus depreciation, is that pre bonus deprecation? Is that sort of in the range of what you get with or without \u2013 can you be a little more specific?","Jim Scilacci - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Greg, it's Jim. I think it's just meant to be a general guideline that, if you're going to spend $4 billion in capital, the way our depreciation works and roughly the way the closings work out that you get to a rough order of magnitude of the $2 billion in growth in rate base a year.","And if you look back in time, rate base, it bounces around from year to year, it could be \u2013 if you have a large transmission closing or something that can make that growth be somewhat different, but as we kind of look at the numbers and look at it over a period of time, it seems to work.","Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC","And you've had bonus depreciation in one form or another through most of that period, so...","Jim Scilacci - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","We have, we have.","Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC","So, that would presume that it's kind of in there.","Jim Scilacci - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. And again, it may change a little bit as we go forward in time, because bonus will start ramping down as we get beyond the next couple of years.","Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC","Well, supposedly.","Jim Scilacci - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. Agreed.","Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC","Okay. Thank you, guys.","Jim Scilacci - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Okay.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Jonathan Arnold of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Well, good afternoon, guys.","Jim Scilacci - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hi, Jonathan.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","A quick question on the parent EIX level drag and the $0.06 in the quarter. I think some of your description as to variance versus last year was helpful, so thanks for that but is $0.06 kind of the current run rate, and if so how do we bridge to the $0.18 for the full year? Is there other things going on or is that just kind of ramp up of the revenues in some of the acquired businesses that get you there and some front ending of costs, so just curious.","Jim Scilacci - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. So, John \u2013 and we've reaffirmed the annual guidance numbers. And so we're going to stick with that, and you could see some variation quarter-to-quarter, it's really hard to predict especially when you buy some new businesses and costs that float into the first quarter, but we're going to hold on to what we've indicated the \u2013 in guidance, the full year impact's going to be.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. So, but those, you can't kind of talk us through how you \u2013 how the $0.06 in the first quarter kind of becomes $0.18 for the year, or is that just seasonality?","Jim Scilacci - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I think that's our best plan right now from what we're seeing. And I don't have any further commentary in terms of how it's going to change quarter-to-quarter, but we think the level we indicated at the beginning of the year was appropriate.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Okay. And then just on the Morongo issue that you highlighted, Jim, can you explain the numbers, it's a $1.1 billion project and you said that they could invest $400 million for up to half of it?","Jim Scilacci - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","How does that make sense?","Jim Scilacci - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, that's the way the agreement reads.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay.","Jim Scilacci - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So, I think it was \u2013 as over time the size of the project is going up, but that's the way the agreement reads and we've assumed that they would exercise for the 50%, but that's for planning purposes, that's an option on their side.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","They would end up with 50% of the project and you would receive $400 million, is that...","Jim Scilacci - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No. No. So, if it's $1 billion, say if it's $1 billion and a 50% then they could take up to $0.5 billion. So if it's $1.1 billion then you've got the $550 million.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. So it's the amount would be dependent on what the cost actually is?","Jim Scilacci - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. So, they have the option. So that's why we're trying to describe the full amount. They may only take $400 million for whatever reason. But if it's a good project, you would expect them to take more.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Jim Scilacci - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","All right.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Praful Mehta of Citigroup. Your line is now open.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thank you. Hi, guys.","Jim Scilacci - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hi.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Quick question on the vehicle charging. As that program gets built out, how do you see that impacting load and do you have resources right now or what kind of generation mix do you think kind of supports that build-out, given it's going to be sizeable over time?","Pedro J. Pizarro - President & Director, Southern California Edison Co.","On electric vehicle charging.","Jim Scilacci - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Okay, I missed the first part.","Pedro J. Pizarro - President & Director, Southern California Edison Co.","I can...","Jim Scilacci - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Pedro, go right ahead.","Pedro J. Pizarro - President & Director, Southern California Edison Co.","Sure. I think if you look at electric vehicle charging, to date, it has \u2013 we've been able to accommodate the number of vehicles that have come on the grid without any undue impact on the system. I think this is one of these items where we'd expect to have planning visibility into what the needs are as the market continues to grow. So, I don't think it's one that lends itself to a dramatic spike.","I'd also point out that from a system perspective, the Californian system overall still enjoys some pretty healthy resource margins. And then \u2013 so I'd expect that certainly over the next several years should be the ability to accommodate that.","And then the final point I'd make is that, as the load from electric vehicles increases, that is happening in the context still of the net load for the system, which we continue to see moving in a generally flat to even potential decline as we have other offsetting factors, increased energy efficiency, increased demand response. So, we'll have to continue to watch this from a planning perspective, as the market develops. But today we're not seeing any undue impact that would be difficult to manage. Maybe one last little coda on that is that as we get more vehicles on the system, we're going to be working with the regulators to have the right sort of signals and incentives to encourage charging when it helps from an overall system perspective.","So, you guys are all pretty familiar with the concept of the duck curve, the fact that we have a lot more solar on the system today, and the ISO expects that to grow so the extent to which we can accommodate electric vehicles with current resources will be assisted by having charging align better with time periods during the day when we have more energy flowing out of solar panels.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you. And then finally just to link with that, the focus on keeping rates at inflation, going at inflation or below, how does this charging stations, where people are charging at homes, do you ever see that becoming a problem in terms of rate, especially if you say, bonus depreciation, reverses in stocks adding to rate base, start having these kind of charging stations at home as well. Do you ever see rates becoming a challenge, going out in the future?","Jim Scilacci - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","That's always a \u2013 great question. There is a lot of factors that affect our rates and capital expenditures, we're watching any number of items, you're watching what's happening with fuel and purchase power. I mean, we're watching our sales, obviously that's where you're getting at, I mean obviously electric vehicle charging helps others detract from it. That would be solar roof panel for potentially energy efficiency.","So, we're trying to balance all those factors, and the goal is to try to keep that, the rates in or around the inflation level. And so, I think Ted's points were real clear that over longer periods of time we've had acceleration in capital expenditures and we've had lower gas prices and all these different factors over quite a long period of time, and more importantly in the shorter term, the cost focus, the reduction in costs, because O&M obviously reduces rates dollar per dollar where capital is at a smaller percentage. So we'll continue to monitor it; obviously from year to year you probably \u2013 we may exceed it or go underneath it, like this last year was 8% reduction. But over time, I think as the general trend we'd like to see it come in around that inflation level.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Got you. Thanks so much, guys.","Jim Scilacci - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Okay.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Steve Fleishman of Wolfe. Your line is now open.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Yeah, hi. Ted, can you hear me?","Theodore F. Craver, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, Steve.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","All right. Just, I wanted to maybe just try and summarize your prepared remarks comments on the capital spending. So, you talk about the $4 billion a year of CapEx, and $2 billion of rate base growth, but then when you go through the different segments, a lot of them including some of that the DRP, electric vehicle storage could be kind of upside to that $4 billion a year. And then at the end you talk about maybe some programs could lag over time and the like. And so I'm just overall \u2013 are you kind of sending the message that we're likely to see higher capital spend over this future period than we've had in the past, given these variety of new programs?","Theodore F. Craver, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Just, cutting right to the quick, the short answer is yes.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay.","Theodore F. Craver, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So, the point we're really trying to make is there are many levers. There is also a balancing act. So, under the many levers part of the equation, if for some reason one or more of these potential capital spends lags or we need to pull it back, there are substitute capital spending that can be pushed into its place. So I think we feel confident about the \u2013 certainly feel confident about the $4 billion and believe that there is upside.","I'd say the second part is the balancing act element where \u2013 you've heard me on this a lot of times before \u2013 that if you get this thing growing too fast, you end up putting pressure first on customer rates and secondly on the ability of the underlying business to support the equity requirement of the new investment.","So it's a matter of trying to get it in the sweet spot where you're getting kind of the maximum benefit from the growth but not so fast that it puts pressure on the need to issue equity or on customer rates. And that was the second kind of main point that I was trying to get across here is \u2013 as the rate base grows, earnings, cash grow along with it. We feel comfortable about being able to support a greater than $4 billion number without having to issue equity, and secondly, as we tried to spend quite a bit of time on here in the remarks, we actually have a really good track record of keeping customer rates below the rate of inflation in our service territory. And that coupled with the fact our average residential bill is considerably lower than the national average and that's what customers really see, we feel we've kind of got the cost side under control and that it will support the ability to have this expanded investment opportunity. So those are kind of all the main points that I was really trying to make.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","No, that's helpful. And just in terms of the visibility on these longer-term numbers, I know we should hopefully get a lot of that with the GRC filing. And we'll have the \u2013 the DRP spend will likely be within the GRC ...","Theodore F. Craver, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","... filing. But things like the storage and the electric vehicles will kind of continue on their own pace separate from that?","Theodore F. Craver, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Likely yes. Just a word on the General Rate Case and some of these other proceedings that will be going on at the same time. I think this one is going to be a little different for us in that what we put into the General Rate Case will try to anticipate, at least our best thinking on how we see some of this grid modernization activity taking place. Even though that will be in the process of being discussed coincident with the rate case filing, so that will be in the DRP proceedings.","So this is going to be a little bit of \u2013 couple of things happening at the same time. We will do our best to articulate those in the General Rate Case. And there are other things, kind of the third point, there are other things above and beyond strictly what's in the DRP or what you would find in the General Rate Case, and that's what we are alluding to with some of the transportation electrification initiatives embedded in SB 350 and things of that sort. Storage and other pieces (48:54) would probably largely be outside of that.","And of course, as more things develop with the transmission spending, as we look towards moving to 50% renewables and an expanded ISO, California ISO scope, there may very well be other investment opportunities embedded in that that also are not going to be in the GRC or some of these other proceedings. So, I think the general point here is there is, we feel, a robust opportunity, but of course, we want to make sure we're doing that in a good, balanced way, so, it doesn't put pressure on equity and doesn't put pressure on customer rates.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Great. Thank you very much.","Theodore F. Craver, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","You're welcome.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey guys. I'll follow on to Steve's question a little bit, but maybe a slightly different angle. Ted, it seems like you're hinting that somewhere in the post 2017, you're going to have CapEx above the $4 billion range. The when and where and how is still to be determined, but you seem pretty confident in that. I guess my question comes to the dividend, which is how are you thinking about the dividend growth trajectory, given the fact that kind of the risk reward to CapEx in the out years is higher rather than lower?","Theodore F. Craver, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think that's kind of embedded in our stated target, which is as you know, lower than what the industry average is. So, we have a 45% to 55% payout ratio target on SCE's earnings. If I remember it right, the average utility payout ratio is somewhere between 60% and 65%, probably closer to 65%.","So, and again, you've heard on me on this before, I believe given the growth prospects, the long-term growth prospects at SCE and Edison, that we probably should have a somewhat lower stated target. We're mindful of the fact that that is lower than the industry average. I've probably used the phrase so many times, you guys are sick of hearing about it. But we still believe there is good room to come forward over the next few years here with dividend increases that are above the industry average, as we move up into this 45% to 55% payout ratio. There could potentially be opportunities above that, but we'll worry about that when we get there.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. And one follow-up, unrelated, what's the latest process or procedure wise, at the CPUC, when it comes to the request for re-hearing on the SONGS decisions?","Adam S. Umanoff - Executive Vice President & General Counsel","This is Adam Umanoff. There really is no additional news we have to share, the challenges to the SONGS OII settlement remain pending at the CPUC and we are awaiting a decision.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And the CPUC can you just kind of rule any day TBD?","Adam S. Umanoff - Executive Vice President & General Counsel","Yeah, there is no fixed timeframe for them to rule. It could happen tomorrow, it could happen in six months. We don't have any guarantees of timing.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Thank you, Adam. Much appreciated.","Theodore F.

Chin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Good morning. Can you hear me?","Theodore F. Craver, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Brian.","Brian J. Chin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Just a general question about net metering policy in California. We've seen some interesting developments in New York and it seems like the tone in Arizona has marginally shifted towards a little bit more reconciliation, as opposed to outright conflict. Is there any sort of read-through to the different parties in California in terms of what's going on in other states, as to how things might play out and might tip the scales in one direction or another in California, just more general thoughts there, if you would.","Theodore F. Craver, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Want to take that, Pedro?","Pedro J. Pizarro - President & Director, Southern California Edison Co.","Yeah sure. Hey, Brian. It's Pedro, how are you?","Brian J. Chin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good, Pedro.","Pedro J. Pizarro - President & Director, Southern California Edison Co.","So yeah, we've seen with interest the agreement in New York among the utilities and some of the solar parties, and read about the Arizona piece as well. Just stay at a high level here and say that we've had constructive discussions with a number of the parties on all sides here in California as well. Obviously we proceeded through the NEM portion, NEM 2.0 proceeding here earlier this year. We did file a limited application for re-hearing on the topic, don't have a timeline at this point in terms of when the PUC might consider that.","But I think at the core \u2013 certainly from the utility perspective, we have a strong interest in seeing the market for solar be supported, and we're doing our part, we want to make sure that our grid is getting continuously worked on to be a more and more of a two-way plug and play grid that can support solar resources. And we've done things like work on our own internal processes to shorten the timeframe for customers who want to interconnect on to our system. Used to take us about a month to process applications; we've got that down to a day and a half now.","So, we're doing a lot of things that we believe are constructive and supportive, bringing solar online. I think the NEM debate in California and other states has been more about what's the cost responsibility and the level of subsidy. And so to the extent that parties can come together, and have creative approaches towards resolving some of those differences that's great. I don't think we're there in California today, but we'll continue to engage constructively with parties, and listen to ideas.","Brian J. Chin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks for the update, Pedro. That's all I got.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Ali Agha of SunTrust. Your line is now open.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you. Ted or Jim, for the last several years now, you guys have done an excellent job of managing your costs and in fact that has allowed you to, in the off years, earn returns above your authorized levels as well. Just wondering how much more is left on that cost reduction side and when you benchmark yourself to where you need to be, are you halfway there, almost there just in the first quartile, can you give us some sense of where you are on that cost reduction plan?","Jim Scilacci - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hi, Ali, it's Jim. I'll straight it out and let Maria and Pedro chime in if I miss anything. There is more work to be done. We started this journey probably four years ago, and we saw at that point in time that, especially in our staffing, our A&G areas that we were considerably above benchmarks. And as you know, we benchmark our costs every single year and we break it down in significant detail in terms of some of the studies that we participate in, and there is more to be done. And it gets harder over time, as you take care of the things that we had -as I said the overstaffing areas that we were able to reduce and we've taken care of lot of that but there is more to be done.","And for example, we revised our costs in our programs for our healthcare for the employees, and that takes it \u2013 over time, it builds up the advantage of that savings and it's really a cost avoidance for customers, that will then reap that benefit over time. And there is a number of other initiatives there going on.","I can't peg, what you're asking me, well, how far, you're halfway, you're a third of the way, you've got two-thirds to go, it's really hard to say, because it's really organization-by-organization that we're looking at theses and some organizations may be in the first quartile, others may be in the fourth quartile. So, you really have to break it down and look at it that way.","I'll pause here and look if Pedro and Maria to add anything.","Maria C. Rigatti - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President, Southern California Edison Co.","Yeah, we're going to continue to look at also what our peer group does, because as they get better we'll find ways to also trying keep pace with what they are doing.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. And then, second question, I wondered just kind of at your comments on the balancing act that you're looking at, keeping customer rates at or below inflation. Within that context, equity issuance, just wanted to understand, are you adamant that you're going to fund all your CapEx going forward, without needing to issue equity, if those \u2013 some of those new plans come in and the CapEx goes above $4 billion, but that requires equity issuance. Would you be open to that, or just wanted to understand, is no equity completely necessary for you, over the next several years?","Theodore F. Craver, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. It's \u2013 I mean it's fair question, but I think without trying to be wibble wobbly about it, the way we see it is we have a significant investment opportunity, we actually think it's an expanding investment opportunity. Because the rate base is expanding, which means cash production is expanding. But this, as we see it, allows us to keep the growth rate in balance with our retained earnings and existing equity so that we would not need to issue additional equity.","Obviously, if the commission or somehow we're ordered to do something really dramatic, we're going to maintain our required equity ratio but I think that's such a remote risk that I feel comfortable saying it the way we've said it, that the key here is to keep the growth rate in balance with keeping customer rate increases at or below the rate of inflation. And as we've evidenced here, we've done, I think, a really great job of that, and we intend to continue to do that. And such that we don't have to issue equity and I think we can keep that balance. We've done it even when we had 12% annual rates of growth in CapEx and earnings; yet, we were able to \u2013 so pulling a lot of rabbits out of the hat, we were able to avoid any equity issuance and that was a very strong commitment that Jim and I had all through that period of time. So I feel comfortable making a statement, we'll keep it in balance.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","And what is the regulatory equity ratio right now for you guys?","Theodore F. Craver, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I missed that. What was the what?","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","At the end of this quarter what is the equity ratio at the utility (1:00:15)?","Jim Scilacci - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","It's 50.2%.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Versus 48% authorized?","Jim Scilacci - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay.

Mr. Cunningham, you may begin your conference.","Scott Cunningham","Thanks, Jaclyn and good afternoon, everyone. Our principal speakers today will be Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Ted Craver and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Jim Scilacci. Also here are other members of the management team. The presentation that accompanies Jim's comments, the earnings press release and our Form 10-Q are available on our website at www.Edisoninvestor.com. Consistent with last quarter, we posted Ted's and Jim's prepared remarks so that you can follow their comments. Tomorrow afternoon we will distribute our regular business of the presentation for use in upcoming investor meetings.","During this call we will make forward-looking statements about the future outlook for Edison International and its subsidiaries. Actual results could differ materially from current expectations. Important factors that could cause different results are set forth in our SEC filings. Please read these carefully. The presentation includes certain outlook assumptions as well as reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the nearest GAAP measures.","During Q&A please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. I will now turn the call over to Ted.","Ted Craver","Thank you, Scott and good afternoon, everyone. Second quarter earnings were $1.16 per share, up $0.08 per share from last year. However, until SCE receives a decision on its 2015 general rate case, comparisons of year-over-year results will not be that meaningful. Jim will have the details in his comments.","Today I will touch on several policy and growth topics but first a comment on a comment on SONGS. We were disappointed about the renewed uncertainty surrounding the SONGS settlement. Most of the recent procedural moves and various motions have come from individuals and organizations that have consistently opposed the settlement since it was first announced over a year ago.","It was more troubling to have one of the six signatories of the settlement, The Utility Reform Network, advise the CPUC in late June that it no longer supported the settlement. Interestingly, in TURN's announcement, it about which acknowledged that the terms of the settlement were good for customers and that the outcome of any litigated reconsideration process may not differ substantially from the terms of the settlement.","TURN is an important voice on consumer matters before the CPUC so we must hope that its failure to adhere to its obligations under the SONGS settlement represents an aberration. We have now responded to all requests for information from the CPUC's administrative law judges regarding the challenges to the SONGS settlement. We're hopeful they will rule on the outstanding issues soon. Prolonging this period of uncertainty is not good for anyone.","We continue to believe strongly that the settlement met all of the required standards for last November's unanimous commission approval. We believe that the SONGS settlement was the product of good faith arm's-length negotiations that resulted in a fair and reasonable outcome for our customers.","Let me turn to some regular toward policy developments. The CPUC recently ruled on a residential rate design reform as required by Assembly Bill 327. Their recent unanimous decision was the product of significant debates and compromise among the commissioners. We didn't get everything we advocated for. We would've liked to have seen more progress in increasing the proportion of revenues collected through fixed charges which would better match our actual cost of residential customers but the minimum bill will be raised from $1.80 to $10 a month. Also, we preserve the opportunity to revisit a more meaningful fixed charge in the future.","We achieved rate reform that places approximately 96% of our retail customers' kilowatt hours into a two-tiered rate section structure, very similar to what we recommended. About 4% of our retail customers' kilowatt hours will be subject to a surcharge for high usage. The commissioners invested a tremendous amount of time and effort in this phase of the proceeding and we appreciated the unanimous agreement that getting residential rates closer to the true cost of service was an important tenant in producing fairness amongst customers.","Attention will now turn to the portion of the CPUC proceeding on net energy metering which relates to how customers who opt for rooftop solar are credited for their own generation. Parties will be filing their net energy metering proposals next week.","Turning to a different subject, we have received broad support for SCE's Charge Ready program. This is the program we announced last October to invest infrastructure to support transportation electrification. On July 9, a settlement with most of the parties was filed with the CPUC on the $22 million pilot phase of the program. Importantly, both TURN and the Office of Ratepayer Advocates are parties to the settlement, as are environmental organizations and electric vehicle charger equipment companies.","The principal change to our original application in the settlement is to expense rather than capitalize the rebates that SCE would provide customers for the vehicle chargers installed. While it didn't change the amount recommended for the pilot program, we expect that if this provision is adopted for the full program the rate base opportunity will now be $225 million of the total $342 million estimate for the program. We look forward to commission action on the pilot and subsequently on the full program.","The final topic I want to cover is SCE's distribution resources plan or DRP filed with the CPUC on July 1. We consider this plan to be one of our most important filings this year and probably in several years. We endeavored to not simply answer the commission's initial questions about integration of distributed energy resources but also to lay out our vision for how the grid of the future will facilitate customer choice of new technologies and support California's policies to move to a low-carbon economy.","The goal of the distribution resources plan is to facilitate the integration of distributed energy resources at optimal locations within the distribution grid and to upgrade the distribution grid to better enable a plug-and-play approach for adding distributed energy resources and new technologies more broadly across our system. These resources include distributed renewable generation such as rooftop and ground mount solar, electric vehicle charging, energy storage, energy efficiency, demand response.","California have used these resources as enablers in achieving its low-carbon objectives over the next several decades. At the expected adoption rate for these distributed resources, the electric grid will require substantial investment in modernization and upgrades. As part of its filing, SCE provided an initial view of the range of possible capital investments to achieve the goals of the DRP. Assuming the CPUC support this provides some indication of our view of the investment required for the long-term program which will likely go well into the next decade. Jim will talk about some of the financial details and how we see this working with the GRC process.","As I've just indicated, significant capital investment will be required to modernize and upgrade SCE's distribution grid consistent with the DRP recommendations. This is in addition to continued distribution system reliability investment, anticipated electric vehicle charging and storage investments, continued transmission and generation maintenance capital investment and potential improvements in capital spending productivity. All of this is consistent with our lower risk wires-focused investment strategy.","Taken together, we expect overall SCE capital spending to be at least $4 billion annually for the foreseeable future. Depending on the state's preferences on the pace of adoption and on approval of DRP-related work in future general rate cases, capital spending could be higher.","I will now turn it over to Jim for the financial update.","Jim Scilacci","Thanks, Ted. This afternoon I will cover second quarter and year-to-date results and several other topics. Please turn to Page 2 of the presentation. I will lead off my comments for the general statement about attempting to compare 2015 to 2014 earnings. Because SCE has yet to receive a 2015 general rate case decision, the utility is recording revenues largely based upon 2014 authorized levels.","In the quarter SCE receives a final GRC decision, we will record a cumulative adjustment retroactive to January 1, 2015. Earnings comparisons will not be useful until we report full-year 2015 earnings. In the meantime, we believe the simplified rate base approach is the best starting point to model full-year earnings.","As Ted said, second quarter core earnings are $1.16 per share. Consistent with our first-quarter approach, we did defer revenues to offset incremental repair deductions, pending the outcome of the 2015 GRC. The amount of deferred revenue this quarter was $0.09 per share with the offsetting benefit in taxes. You can see this in the summary of SCE's driver on this slide. On a year-to-date basis SCE has now deferred your dollar $0.16 of revenue from incremental repair deductions, because of the large delta between expected and forecast repair deductions for 2015, last May SCE made a filing with the CPUC to update its repair deductions for the 2015 through 2017 GRC period. With the May filing, SCE's updated 2015 revenue request would result in a $120 million revenue decrease from authorized revenues. For the two post-test years, the year-over-year revenue change would be an increase of $236 million and $320 million for the 2016 and 2017, respectively.","We have no insight as to the timing of the proposed GRC decision. On July 24, SCE did respond to certain questions raised by the ALJ concerning they May filing regarding repair deductions. The questions related to the coordination of ratemaking between CPUC and FERC.","The major items impacting second quarter results is a $0.31 per share tax benefit from reducing liabilities from uncertain tax positions. During the quarter, we received an IRS report for tax shares 2010 through 2012. Based on this report, we updated our estimated liabilities for uncertain tax positions which flow directly through to earnings. We had a similar benefit of $0.09 last year related to updating uncertain tax positions for other tax benefit years. Both of these are highlighted in the SCE key earnings drivers.","Historically we have classified the change in an estimate of an uncertain tax position both positive and negative as part of core earnings and highlight significant changes that affect period-over-period comparisons. These items are not part of the simplified earnings model that we have discussed in the past and are subject to future revisions based on audits, new information and other developments related to our tax positions.","Excluding the $0.31 share per share benefit second quarter core earnings are $0.85 per share with SCE contributing $0.87, offset by $0.02 loss at the EIX holding company. In the core EPS drivers table we netted out SONGS related impact on revenues, O&M and depreciation. On this basis, revenues are lower by $0.03 per share due to the $0.09 per share deferred revenue I mentioned earlier and partially offset by a $0.06 per share benefit from higher FERC-related and other revenues.","Looking at costs, O&M has $0.01 per share positive variance which we continue our cost management focus. SCE's second quarter results included $0.02 per share in severance costs this year and $0.01 per share last year. On a year-over-year basis the difference is minimal because of rounding.","Depreciation expense increased by $0.06 per share, reflecting SCE's ongoing wires investment. SCE benefited by lower financing costs by $0.03 per share. This relates primarily to higher AFUDC equity earnings.","Turning to taxes, I've already discussed most of the major items. These include the uncertain tax positions this year and last year as well as the $0.09 per share of incremental repair deductions, that is the offset to the $0.09 of revenue, so no net earnings impact. The balance is lower tax benefits year over year of $0.12 per share, mainly related to lower flow-through tax benefits than last year, revisions to estimated liabilities of our net operating losses, interest and state income taxes.","Remaining $0.07 per share negative variance includes benefit from last year that did not recur in 2015 such as generator settlements and a San Onofre property tax refund. For the EIX holding company losses were $0.01 lower than last year due to lower corporate expenses and higher income from affordable housing projects. We continue to wind down the Edison capital low-income housing portfolio.","Please turn to Page 3. I don't plan to review the year to date result -- financial results in detail, but the earnings analysis is consistent with the second quarter results. As I have said previously, comparisons pending a 2015 GRC decision are not meaningful.","Please turn to Page 4. You will see that the uptick in interest rates is reflected in the trend of the Moody's Utility Bond Index shown at the green line. The 12-month moving average line shown in blue is moving back towards the 5% base rate. Given the short time period remaining on the 12-month measurement period, it is likely that SCE's CPUC return on common equity will remain at 10.45% during 2016. At FERC, the moratorium on filing and ROE change expired on July 1.","I would also like to touch on a few other SCE-related financial matters that are not shown on the slide. First, SEC's weighted average equity component, for regulatory purposes, was 48.9% at June 30 compared to 48.4% at the end of the first quarter. SCE is required to maintain a 48% common equity layer on a rolling 13-month basis.","Second, SCE continues to make good progress on reducing its fuel and purchase power under collection. As of June 30 of last year, SCE's ERRA balancing account was under collected by $1.6 billion. As of June 30 this year, the ERRA under collection was $543 million. The billion-dollar reduction was from three primary reasons, SONGS settlement refund credits against the ERRA balancing account, the 2014 ERRA rate increase and lower-than-expected power and natural gas prices.","As of July 23 commission conference, the CPUC approved SCE's access to the SONGS 2 and 3 nuclear decommissioning trusts for costs incurred from the June 2013 plant shut down through the end of 2014. These costs amounted $343 million and the amount will be refunded to customers via a credit to the ERRA under collections pursuant to the SONGS settlement.","This morning SCE file the settlement agreement and the 2015 ERRA proceeding. As part of this settlement SCE has agreed to forgo any 2015 ERRA rate increase adjustment. We now expect that the ERRA under collection will be fully recovered before year end.","Lastly, earlier this month both SCE and EIX extended the terms of their respective credit agreement by a year to July 2020 for $2.6 billion at SCE and $1.18 billion at EIX. The remainder $150 million for SCE and $68 million for EIX will mature in July 2019. There are no material changes to the terms and conditions.","Please turn to Page 5. SCE's capital spending forecast is unchanged from the first quarter. Ted has already discussed the long-term growth opportunity around the distribution resources plan, but I want to add a couple of financial specifics.","Please turn to Page 6. SCE preliminarily estimated up to $560 million in potential DRP capital expenditures during the 2015 through 2017 forecast period. These proposed expenditures are largely weighted towards 2017. SCE has requested a memorandum account for the 2015 through 2017 revenue requirement of these investments to avoid any retroactive ratemaking issues.","DRP investment that are made within authorized levels for the 2015 through 2017 GRC period will not have any incremental earnings impact. If our total investment exceeds the amount authorized due to the DRP spending and if a memorandum account is authorized then we will seek to recover associated revenue requirements as part of SCE's 2018 general rate case.","Please turn to Page 7. The rate base forecast for the 2015 through 2017 GRC period is unchanged from the first quarter. Please turn to Page 8. This chart provides 2015 financial assumptions and has been updated for year-to-date results and amounts related to revenue recognition on repair deductions that I covered earlier.","Please turn to Page 9. I would like to finish with a recap of our investment thesis. The DRP filing and ongoing grid investments that Ted discussed strengthens the long-term growth thesis for SCE. Future capital spending at the $4 billion level implies, very roughly, a $2 billion per-year increase in rate base. We're planning to grow our dividend meaningfully as we move back to our target payout ratio of 45% to 55% of SCE earnings in steps over time. Lastly, we will prudently manage our capital structure and have no plans for external common equity.","Thank you and I will turn to call over to the operator to moderate the Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Michael Weinstein of UBS. Your line is open.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","It's Julien here. I suppose first question out of the gate, in terms of the GRC, can you elaborate on the settlement opportunity? And also perhaps just in terms of the potential for a longer than a three-year resolution, is there an opportunity for a fourth year?","Jim Scilacci","I guess it's very difficult for us to speculate on something like that and if there were settlement discussions we would not normally comment on that Julien, so I will just have to if I can duck that question. Three to four years -- we've only filed for three, it makes it challenging to do a fourth unless you had some kind of special arrangement. So as much as we would like to get these things done more quickly and get online and get them approved, it would be a challenge to do something like that.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Got it. But in terms of confidence in the timeline here, perhaps if you can elaborate?","Jim Scilacci","As I said in my prepared remarks, we just don't have a view. We're waiting for a proposed decision and that's all we can say right now.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Fair enough. And then perhaps just terms of the wider CapEx program, obviously you provided it pretty meaningful update intra-quarter here. How are you thinking in the long-term? Is there going to be eventually coming out of this process incremental CapEx? Should we ultimately be continuing to think about 4 to 4.5 throughout the process of having these proposals, ultimately, I suppose ratified or adopted or what have you?","Jim Scilacci","That's what we've been indicating. We've said in fact it was in my remarks and probably in Ted's, too, that we see that 4 to 4.5 range being sustained based on all the things we're seeing now and with the DRP but, again, some of it is subject to a lot of commission approval. Obviously that they are going to go through and review this and give us some indication as far as a time frame and so that's still a lot in their court in terms of how they work through it. But our current view is somewhere in that $4 billion to $4.5 billion range.","Operator","And yes we did get the question come back through and it's from Hugh Wynne of Bernstein Research. Your line is open.","Hugh Wynne","I know you can't call the outcome but I was wondering if you might provide a little bit of clarity on the procedural steps that have to be taken by the commission to consider the potential reopening of the SONGS settlement and if so, the steps that you would expect after that.","Jim Scilacci","Hugh, it's Jim. We're going to have to Adam Umanoff, our General Counsel, provide some answers there.","Adam Umanoff","Good afternoon, Hugh. As you know, there is a potential petition for a modification from before the public utility commission. We really can't give you any certainty on the timing of the commission's consideration of that petition. Motions have been filed, responses have been made.","There is no specific time period under which the commission is obligated to respond. We're certainly hopeful, as Ted mentioned, that this will be resolved quickly, but we can't give you any definitive timeline for that resolution. There is a companion motion for sanctions before the public utility commission in connection with ex parte communications or allegations of improper ex parte communications. We would hope that that would be resolved concurrently if not in advance of the consideration of the petition for modification.","Hugh Wynne","And if the filing is -- the petition for modification is accepted and the San Onofre rate case is reopened, can you give us any general feel as to what the process for litigation would be and the timeline for that?","Adam Umanoff","Again, first and foremost, we don't believe that the existing commission precedent would support reopening of the SONGS settlement. But we certainly can't advise you with any certainty that it can't happen. If the proceeding is reopened we would return to litigation and litigation of the San Onofre OII would likely take considerable period of time. It would not happen in a matter of weeks or months.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Lapides from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Michael Lapides","On SONGS, can you give an update in terms of where you are in the process with NEIL? And also there were lots of headlines over the last couple of days about the arbitration with MHI. Can you just give an update on that as well?","Adam Umanoff","Sure. I would be happy to. Hello, Michael. With respect to NEIL we continue to pursue recovery of our losses from NEIL but really can't speculate as to the timing of concluding that effort. With respect to MHI, I think it's important as a preface to remind everyone that we're subject to a confidentiality order from the arbitration panel who is hearing the MHI claims. ","We're not in a position to comment on any of the substantive or procedural activity in the MHI arbitration. I can tell you that we believe we're still on track for a spring 2016 hearing and I hope for resolution to that hearing and final order later in 2016.","Michael Lapides","Can I ask just a procedural question, if any of the parties has issues with the final order that comes out of an ICC arbitration, if they want to litigate, can they? And if so, where?","Adam Umanoff","Generally the arbitral order is expected to be final. There are very limited grounds for appeal. It remains to be seen if a frustrated party chose to appeal where they would take that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Fleishman from Wolfe Research. Your line is open.","Steve Fleishman","Could you may be spend a little time going through what the DRP process is from here and what the commission is actually going to decide on the DRP?","Pedro Pizarro","Sure. Steve, this is Pedro Pizarro. We filed -- we and the other utilities filed our plans on July 1. From here, the commission is going to go through a traditional process to review the filings and ultimately comment and approve on them. As Jim mentioned in his comments, in addition to the element that the PUC asked for in the filing, they asked for things like an analysis of the capacity of our system to integrate distributed resources, approach that we will follow to provide transparency to the market in terms of what the capacity is and how we will update it. There was also a number of demonstration projects that we propose to do per the PUC order. ","So they will plan on all of that and ultimately approve a final approach. We also asked for the memorandum account treatment that Jim mentioned. So at this point I don't think we can speculate on final timing but we would expect under a typical timeline -- this is a new process but in a typical PUC timeline we would expect approval sometime in the next year.","Steve Fleishman","And is this a case where there is intervention and people can have their own view on your proposal? Is this something then where maybe there could be a chance to try and settle this case? How does this case proceed from that aspect?","Pedro Pizarro","So it is a litigated proceeding so there will be opportunities for interveners to file comments and for different views to be aired at the PUC. Really too early to comment on whether there is a prospect for settlement among parties or the like.","Steve Fleishman","Okay. And then just a question on the memo account treatment. So you wouldn't keep seek recovery of the investment through 2017 until the GRC. But under the memo account would you effectively be able to recover that investment on like a non-cash basis with a return in the meantime?","Jim Scilacci","That's a good question. There's still some speculation in terms of how it actually operates. The memorandum account, as I said, was really just to preserve the opportunity to recover the revenue requirement associated with the expenditure. So you can go back and essentially attempt to justify the reasonableness of the expenditure. Then through the general rate case in 2018, we would hope to seek recovery if in fact all the conditions were met. I wouldn't expect -- I think you are trying to go for some additional earnings in the 2015 through 2017 time frame associated with it.","I think it's too early to project that we would, in fact, get anything. I think it's going to be more weighted towards 2018 anyway. And if you look at the charts that show the level of expenditure for the DRP, it's heavily weighted toward 2017 anyway, if the commission will allow us to spend that kind of dough.","Operator","Our next question comes from Daniel Eggers from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Daniel Eggers","on the long-term CapEx discussion, if you think about kind of the buckets -- the 2015 to 2017 period of CapEx, soft phase-out of transmission, more distribution and maintenance work. If you think about that 2018 and on, what CapEx is getting substituted out? So think about the changing mix of your capital, how do you see it evolving as the DRP money comes in more significantly?","Jim Scilacci","Transmission, we will have to see what happens ultimately with some of the legislation that is pending too. We've been seeing that it's gone up as we have built the renewable lines. Now it's been coming down as we're finishing Tehachapi and a few other renewable projects we've got in the pipeline.","We've been saying all along there's not much generation. It's about $100 million of maintenance capital we have for the legacy generation fleet. The rest -- we've been saying as transmissions come down we've been stepping up distribution because we're trying to get our replacement rates up to where they need to be so they support what we're trying to do from an overall reliability perspective.","So we're trying to balance us all within the $4 billion range and that's the goal. That's what we're trying to work for and hopefully we can fit all of this in with the DRP accordingly. So I'll look at Maria or Pedro -- anything else to add?","Pedro Pizarro","Maybe what I would add Jim, is think about one of the base spending areas is that infrastructure replacement for distribution system that will continue. In the DRP filing we outlined a number of categories of DRP-related investments. I would expect that as we go through future rate case cycles that line between what's called quote-unquote new DRP spending and what's core distribution spending will start to emerge as these technologies of the future really become part of the core mainstream of core distribution system.","One other piece there is that some of the DRP spending -- the grid reinforcement piece that we have outlined for both 2015, 2017 and then beyond time frames, some of that is accelerating work that might normally see as distribution infrastructure replacement. It's hardening circuits that might be some of our lower voltage circuits that need to be brought up to more modern higher voltage circuit so they can accommodate greater number of distributed resources.","So that's, again, an area where we're taking investments that may have been part of a longer-term infrastructure replacement plan but because of the need to integrate distributed resources it needs to get accelerated forward in order to harden the grill and allow faster adoption of the new technology. So again that's a place where you see that line over the years ahead blurring a little bit between infrastructure replacement and the DRP bucket.","Daniel Eggers","And just on transmission with the Delaney line going away from your Group, how do you guys think about the ability to win bigger transmission projects in California in the future? Is this going to become just a lowest-cost bid type of environment that makes it harder to get the most optimal project on?","Pedro Pizarro","So you know the ISO is running their competitive process in the under FERC Order 1000. We had did with partners in the Delaney-Colorado River process. We expect that as other opportunities come up in our service area we will continue to bid on those and put out competitive proposals.","I think as we go through this and, frankly, not only ourselves with the entire market continues to learn in terms of what the competitive practices are in terms of designing lines, constructing them, etc. I think we want to be part of the learning process and make sure we're making our proposals more competitive in the future.","So, we're still capturing the lessons learned out of the Delaney-Colorado River experience but certainly support the process of the ISO's going through and evaluating proposals and accepting bids based on the parameters they are evaluating.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jonathan Arnold from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Jonathan Arnold","Firstly, just on the deferral -- the revenue deferral, should we think of that as basically lining your actual expense up with where the revenues are going to be so there's really no earnings impact of this as we get -- once the GRC is done?","Jim Scilacci","Roughly that's what we're trying to do.","Jonathan Arnold","So maybe a bit less noise in the numbers? At least from that source.","Jim Scilacci","Well the goal here in the May filing is really what you need to go back to, is that the misalignment between the actual expenditures and the deductions we're taking and the forecast and the reserves are creating first and second quarter, what we're trying to do is get this stuff put together and we recognized that they were misaligned. And that's why we went back in for the supplemental filing. And if they adopt that supplemental filing, obviously that would not flow to earnings. So if that's your initial question, the answer would be yes.","Jonathan Arnold","And then just on to this question of the overlap between DRP projects and spending fact that you might otherwise -- things you might otherwise have done. You have a 2017 -- you said it lot of the bulk of the initial DRP is in 2017. You have a rate case filing in. Is there overlap as you see it today or is this just things may evolve as you work through the next year or two?","Jim Scilacci","So it's not in the current GRC forecast. The only way we have contemplated spending some money is if you don't spend all that is authorized, for example, if you have fewer service connections that we have forecast, that creates some delta, some room to spend additional dollars. Now what I said in my prepared remarks, if we spend all this authorized based on our forecast and we would like to make DRP expenditures above that, that's where the memorandum account comes in, why it's important. So you don't get into any retroactive ratemaking issues.","Jonathan Arnold","But it would require some other line item to come in below the forecast for this to have to apply in the current rate case period?","Jim Scilacci","In that scenario, yes or a memorandum account and spending above.","Jonathan Arnold","Okay. And can I just -- MHI -- it was pretty publicly reported that your claims had increased very substantially versus prior disclosures. Can you shed any light on that in the context of talking about confidentiality, etc.?","Adam Umanoff","Jonathan, I appreciate the question -- would love to tell you more, but in accordance with our confidentially obligations we can't comment.","Operator","Our next question comes from Travis Miller from Morningstar. Your line is open.","Travis Miller","I was wondering if we can go back to the DRP here, yet again. The 2018, 2020 numbers -- I wonder if you could just qualitatively give us an idea of the difference in how the environment looks at the $1.4 billion low end and the $2.6 million high end. It's obviously a large -- what difference happens there?","Pedro Pizarro","This is Pedro again. And I'll keep it at a pretty high level -- one of the reasons that we have the range there is that especially as we start getting out into the 2018 to 2020 time frame a lot of our view on the DRP is colored by our internal forecasting of the pace of adoption of technologies and how that pace of adoption varies across different parts of our system. For example, the capital spending forecast that we included in the DRP filing really focused on urban areas.","We're assuming that rural areas would not have as quick a pace of adoption and it might happen in later years. We've taken a stab at what circuits might have a faster level of adoption versus a slower level of adoption. But I think that range in there really is coupled back to where do customers end up choosing to deploy these technologies? How quickly do they do it? And what things do we need to do to ensure that our grid is ready to plug-and-play their choices?","I think that's really the range as opposed to more a determinative decision on our part to invest here or there. Some of this we're really changing the mindset here to make sure that we're supporting having a grid that's robust and that can keep pace and be ready for customer choices. But we're taking a bit of a stab at this point as to what those customer choices will be.","Jim Scilacci","Travis, you can see on Page 6 of the investor deck the breakout of the spending. $0.5 billion of it alone is the grid reinforcement. That's what Pedro alluded to, is taking the lower voltage circus circuits and taking up to higher voltage levels to prepare for more distributed generation. And that's just pace. How fast do you want to make those changes? That's a choice that we will have to make and the commission will have to make together.","Pedro Pizarro","One other variable that we cited in filing is -- again, we're making forecasts based on our current view and the market's current view of technologies available. For example, communications systems. We know we will need to broaden -- expand the capabilities of our field area network. We're building these capital numbers based on the view of what those technologies will cost today, but we all know that computing communications technologies are on a very fast development curve and so the actual prices, the actual cost for those technologies can vary significantly as we head out a few years out.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ali Agha from SunTrust. Your line is open.","Ali Agha","Coming back to SONGS for a second and just looking at the key gating items we should be keeping an eye on. You've got that re-hearing request out there and then you've got the ALJ trying to close the OII proceeding that continue to get pushed back and now has that September 27 deadline recently approved. How significant is that in the scheme of things? And if they stick to this final deadline and close the books, does that imply some final resolution on this matter or is that irrelevant to this?","Adam Umanoff","We certainly hope that the CPUC will now conclude its consideration of the application for re-hearing motion for sanctions and the petition for modification of the settlement, all by that September 27 date. But, frankly, there's no guarantee. That deadline for extension of the OII proceeding has been extended previously and it can be extended again.","Ali Agha","Okay. But that proceeding is the one sort of gating items to keep an eye on. If they stick to that that could be the resolution date, if you will, of these matters?","Adam Umanoff","It could conceivably be.","Ali Agha","Okay. And separate question, Ted, to you, as you think about your dividend plans going through the December period, as you normally do, are those going to be completely independent of these regulatory issues out there? For example, if the GRC decision hasn't come out, if SONGS settlement hasn't yet happened or closed, would you still stick to your dividend plans based on your CapEx and cash flow programs or do these things influence how you are thinking about the dividend?","Ted Craver","I think I would probably want to leave investors with the emphasis being on we've stated numerous times what our objective is. We've also stated numerous times -- and that's the return to the 45% to 55% payout ratio for SCE earnings. And we've also stated that it will take -- it's not going to happen all in one shot. We've made a very large kind of move last year. We want to continue to make solid moves in order to get back to that payout ratio. So that's where I would want to put the emphasis.","To say that we will do that come hell or high water -- you never can say that. You have to take into consideration capital requirements, take into consideration all of these other proceedings. But at least as we see it today they all look like they are manageable within the context of continuing to make progress and deliver on one of our core objectives of getting back to the payout ratio of 45% to 55%.","Operator","Our last question comes from Paul Patterson of Glenrock Associates. Your line is open.","Paul Patterson","Just a follow-up on Dan Eggers's question on the Delaney transmission project. I guess what I'm sort of wondering is can you give us a feeling as to what -- you guys had the rights-of-way advantage, you're local. And Abengoa and Starwood come in and win, not only over you guys but others. What was their cost? What was their revenue requirement advantage that you think was instrumental in them getting the deal?","Pedro Pizarro","I don't believe that the Cal ISO has published the cost estimate, their revenue requirement for that project. The goal we have at this point is a statement from the ISO that in their view the proposed cost for that Abengoa team were significantly less than those of the next competitor and I don't think the ISO has publicized to the next competitor was. So it's tough to speculate on what some of the key drivers would have been.","But when you think about around cost of transmission project, key elements would include everything from the upstream design of the project, what kind of powers, what kind of conductors to rights-of-way, as you suggested, to environmental impact and mitigating those impacts depending on what route you choose to the cost of the actual construction labor you are using to build. Very difficult for us to speculate on what it would have been, but, again, we note that the ISO said that the choice was based on the lower revenue requirement and also binding caps on capital costs and as well as the return on equity.","Paul Patterson","Okay. Do you know when they are going to provide more information? Cal ISO, I mean","Pedro Pizarro","I don't think we're aware of that.","Paul Patterson","Okay. And then just finally you mentioned the cost of capital in 2016. When do you guys think that that might be revisited? It's been deferred in the past in terms of -- you guys had that separate cost of capital proceedings. What's your expectation or what should we be thinking in terms of when the CPUC may go for this? And is there any potential that they may delay it?","Jim Scilacci","Okay. Paul, this is Jim. Right now, procedurally we would file in April 2016 for cost of capital effective 1\/1\/2017. And that's cost of capital, that would be return on common equity, capital structure and the like. That wouldn't preclude an extension like we've done before, but the current policy or the current procedural path would be filing in April.","Paul Patterson","Okay. Is there any thought that there -- or any discussion -- maybe it's early -- it's July, I guess. But is there any preliminary idea as to whether or not you might be able to defer that?","Jim Scilacci","It's a possibility. We've deferred it once already. This is the first time -- we've done it in the past and so generally the California utilities when I have talked with my compatriots at PG&E and Sempro, we like the procedure. We like the trigger mechanism. It's transparent. You can see it, you can see what's happening with it. So there's a strong desire on our part to continue to use it. If we can get an extension that would be great. If we had to go there in litigated process, we will just have to see where interest rates are. And it seems like it's coming right back to where we started three years ago -- well now four, if we get further on here. So the mechanism has worked well, given what we're trying to do.","Paul Patterson","Okay. But do you get the feeling that your counterparties on the other side might be willing to do that as well?","Jim Scilacci","We've done it once already so we will have to see if they'd do it again.","Paul Patterson","Okay. And just finally, there is these legislative initiatives regarding the CPUC and other things, but regarding the CPUC and perhaps reforms. And there's been some changes and there are competing bills. Anything in particular -- any particular legislative initiative we think we should focus on or anything in terms of that area that might be coming up? I know there are a few of them. I was just wondering if there's one in particular that you think is more significant than others.","Adam Umanoff","There is a hearing coming up in the middle of August directly related to ex parte governance issues at the CPUC. There have been a number of independent reports that have been prepared for the CPUC. There is a draft of the commissioner code of conduct that's been prepared and we welcome a transparent exercise considering reform to the ex parte and other governance rules of the commission. That might be worthwhile listening in on. Again, I think it's in the middle of August, so in a couple of weeks from now.","Operator","That was the last question. I will now turn the call back to Mr. Cunningham.","Scott Cunningham","Thanks for very much, everyone, for participating and please do call us if you have any follow-up questions. Thanks again and have a safe day. Bye, bye.","Operator","Thank you for your participation in today's conference. I will now disconnect the lines at this time.

My name is Kelly, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Edison International Second Quarter 2013 Financial Teleconference. [Operator Instructions] Today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Scott Cunningham, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. Mr. Cunningham, you may begin your conference.","Scott S. Cunningham","Thanks, Kelly, and good afternoon, everyone. Our principal speakers today will be Chairman and CEO, Ted Craver; and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Jim Scilacci. Also with us are other members of the management team.","The presentation that accompanies Jim's comments, the earnings press release and our Form 10-Q are available on our website at www.edisoninvestor.com. We will be using the slide materials in our regular quarterly business update presentation that will be posted tomorrow on the website to support our ongoing investor discussions.","During this call, we will make forward-looking statements about the financial outlook for Edison International and its subsidiaries and about other future events. Actual results could differ materially from current expectations. Important factors that could cause different results are set forth in our SEC filings. We encourage you to read these carefully.","The presentation includes certain outlook assumptions, as well as reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the nearest GAAP measure. [Operator Instructions] With that, I'll turn the call over to Ted Craver.","Theodore F. Craver","Thank you, Scott, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, Edison International reported second quarter core earnings of $0.79 per share, up from $0.56 per share last year.","As Jim will comment more fully, quarterly comparisons to 2012 will not be that meaningful given the delay in receiving SCE's General Rate Case decision last year. That said, second quarter core earnings reflect strong operating results from higher authorized investment in our electric grid infrastructure, good cost management and favorable tax benefits. These results are consistent with the Edison International core earnings guidance of $3.25 to $3.45 per share that we updated in June and are reaffirming today.","GAAP results include a $575 million pretax or $1.12 per share estimated impairment charge related to the shutdown of the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station, which we announced June 7. Much of my commentary this afternoon will be on San Onofre.","Having made the shutdown decision, SCE's focus for San Onofre has shifted to 3 key areas: First, maintain our focus on safety as we transition the plant from operations to decommissioning it; second, work with California regulators to plan for a reliable electric system without SONGS; and third, resolve the issues of cost recovery raised in the CPUC Order Instituting Investigation, or OII process, consistent with our belief that our actions were prudent and reasonable.","As part of the cost recovery effort, we are highly focused on securing recovery from Mitsubishi Heavy Industries for its failure to provide functioning replacement steam generators that met their 20-year warranty and technical specifications. Pursuing our insurance claim from NEIL will also be a major focus.","We are moving quickly to transition the work at SONGS, including reducing staffing levels, to reflect the shutdown decision. On June 12, SCE filed with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission formal certification of permanent cessation of power operations at San Onofre.","On June 22, SCE filed its formal certification of permanent fuel removal from the reactors. These are the first 2 steps in the long decommissioning process, which is governed by Nuclear Regulatory Commission rules. With the removal of fuel from the units, we are transitioning from an operating license to a nuclear fuel possession license.","SCE is currently evaluating alternatives for accelerating the start of decommissioning. We expect to complete the necessary site-specific cost study next year, which will refine the current cost estimates and required timelines.","Until this detailed study is complete, we have requested that the current funding levels for the decommissioning trust be maintained. Limited funding for early stage decommissioning planning is available through the trust. SCE intends to initiate the process shortly with the California Public Utilities Commission to access the trust for some decommissioning-related costs.","SCE continues to work with the California Independent System Operator, the California Public Utilities Commission, California Energy Commission and other stakeholders on the planning process for adequate and reliable resources of electricity post SONGS. We are doing so against a backdrop of several state policies, including shutting down or repowering coastal natural gas-fired generation due to once-through cooling requirements, a 33% renewables mandate and the state's ambitious greenhouse gas reduction targets under Assembly Bill 32.","There are a number of forums that have generated considerable discussion on generation, transmission, demand response and demand reduction and the role of new technologies in meeting future grid needs. SCE will play an active role in shaping an informed set of policies and principles for continued grid reliability in Southern California.","Our plans remain focused on the wires-related investments while encouraging the use of competitive markets for new generations.","I'd like to elaborate on how we are aggressively pursuing third-party recovery of costs on behalf of our customers. On July 18, SCE provided Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, or MHI, a formal notice of dispute. This begins the process for initiating claims against MHI, resulting from its supplying faulty replacement steam generators.","In the notice of dispute, SCE alleges that MHI totally and fundamentally failed to deliver what it promised, and that it was guilty of gross negligence. We also alleged that the liability limitations in the contract do not apply. We have chosen not to specify dollar amounts of damages at this time. We will pursue recoveries aggressively on behalf of customers if our disputes with MHI cannot be resolved otherwise.","MHI has already publicly expressed its objections to these claims as would be expected. Consistent with the contract terms, we are now in a 90-day period for SCE and MHI to try to resolve these claims. If MHI and SCE are unable to resolve their differences regarding liability, SCE expects to initiate binding arbitration under the auspices of the International Chamber of Commerce rules in San Francisco. This dispute resolution forum is also specified in the contract. We expect MHI to step up to meet its obligations.","Pursuant to our rights under the outage insurance policy written by the Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited, or NEIL, SCE is pursuing claims for energy purchases from the market. SCE expects the total claims under the NEIL outage policy will be $388 million in total, with SCE's share, $304 million, although not all claims have yet been filed.","With the decision to shut down San Onofre, SCE's claims under the policy are reduced. We don't expect any decision from NEIL until late in the fourth quarter or sometime next year. If the claims are denied in whole or in part, SCE has recourse, including nonbinding mediation and binding arbitration.","SCE continues to work with the California Public Utilities Commission comprehensive OII process to determine the appropriate cost recovery treatment for San Onofre. The CPUC is in the process of scoping out the additional phases in the proceeding. In fact, a scoping memo was issued yesterday for Phase II, which Jim will discuss more in his comments.","We will not be able to comment on the likelihood of any potential settlement, which CPUC President Peevey urged parties to seek after our shutdown decision was announced.","I'd like to now turn to the drivers of long-term growth. On July 15, we initiated the first phase of SCE's next rate case by delivering the Notice of Intent to the division of ratepayer advocates for our 2015 test year GRC. The actual General Rate Case application is expected to be filed in the fourth quarter of this year.","The GRC strategy is consistent with what we've outlined for you previously. We have proposed a modest increase of $120 million for 2015, representing a 1.2% increase over base rates and a 0.6% increase in total rates. We have also proposed increases of $368 million in 2016 and $331 million in 2017. Our request in this GRC cycle will emphasize the need to build on previous infrastructure improvement efforts.","Funding the needed increase in infrastructure investment while mitigating rate impacts requires striking the correct balance between reliability, policy goals and affordable customer rates. This means continuing our efforts to achieve efficiencies in our operating and maintenance costs.","Operational excellence is the framework we have established to deliver on our mission of providing safe, reliable and affordable power to customers. It is supported by one of our core values, continuous improvement, something in which our employees across the company are fully engaged.","For example, we have significantly reduced our support staff to approximately 2006 levels. We are reducing overhead spending in virtually every area. While most of these reductions have been implemented in 2013 and are reflected in our 2013 earnings guidance, we expect to continue cost improvements.","These improvements are included in our 2015 rate case, allowing additional capacity for infrastructure investments without significantly impacting customer rates.","Our proposed capital spending plans, together with updated forecasts for required FERC transmission investments, steps up our expected rate base growth to a 7% to 9% compound annual growth rate from 2013 through 2017. Jim will review the details in his comments.","What I want to do is reiterate our intention to meet our capital spending needs without issuing equity and to moving our dividend back into the target payout range in steps over time. These remain cornerstones of our investor value proposition for Edison International.","GRC cycle provides a transition path for SONGS costs as well. For example, to support ongoing O&M costs at San Onofre, we will transition to funding from our decommissioning trust and ramp down revenues collected from customers through the GRC. This will need to be synchronized with the progress of the SONGS OII. We expect to fine-tune requested levels next year, as detailed analysis of operating and capital expenses in the shutdown period are completed.","We made a filing with the CPUC last week, for example, to move any O&M savings resulting from shutdown into the ERRA balancing account we used to track purchase power costs. If approved, this will create customer bill offsets from the reductions in costs as we transition to the lower staffing levels appropriate for decommissioning.","This proposed treatment will allow us to reduce impacts on customer rates sooner and would not impact earnings. These costs are subject to refund after review in the OII process.","I'd like to touch on one other topic related to capital investment. The CPUC's recent decision to require undergrounding of a 3.5-mile, 500 kV segment of the Tehachapi renewable transmission project through the city of Chino Hills. We remain concerned about the potential precedent for future transmission line costs, though we respect the commission's decision and we'll move forward to implement it expeditiously.","Next steps are to finalize some technical and scope questions with the PUC, finalize the construction plans and file for rate recovery with FERC based on our estimated capital cost for the project completion. Our estimate is higher than the estimate referenced in the CPUC decision.","Important to our ability to develop electric infrastructure while limiting rate impacts is rate design reform. A better rate design remains an important long-term priority to ensure that costs for maintaining grid reliability and availability are fairly borne by all customers using the grid.","Especially important is the ability to recover fixed costs through a charge carried by all residential customers. This is important because California policies encouraging residential rooftop solar are subsidizing those who install rooftop solar and shifting fixed costs to those who do not.","Assembly Bill 327 has bipartisan support and provides the CPUC the authority to reduce current subsidies between upper and lower-tier residential rates and allow overtime for a more meaningful monthly fixed charge of up to $10 per month.","Recovering fixed costs for the grid and the rates of all residential customers is important, as the state moves towards a more distributed and smart grid model. This is especially true since the grid facilitates and enables distributed energy resources and will require significant utility investment.","I'll finish with a brief comment on Edison Mission Energy. As a result of last week's termination of the original settlement agreement we reached with EME and a majority of its noteholders, we will now participate in the bankruptcy process, seeking recovery of our claims as a creditor and could be a target of claims as well.","Our philosophy in the original agreement was to use tax benefits to address EME's liabilities to us and facilitate its reorganization, if possible. We do not believe we can justify doing more nor are we obligated to do so.","We have become aware of one of the many legal filings in the case made in the middle of last night on behalf of creditors, which contains a number of allegations against us. We believe these to be completely without merit. There seems to be a contest for control in the bankruptcy and that we have been thrust into the middle of it. Frankly, it will be a shame if this kind of behavior is allowed to interfere with the principal purpose of the bankruptcy, which is to successfully reorganize EME.","As a result of the bankruptcy process, the investment in EME was written off last year and is no longer included in our operating results. EME was and remains structurally separate from Edison International with all that implies. We won't change that.","I'll now turn the call over to Jim Scilacci. Jim?","William James Scilacci","Thanks, Ted, and good afternoon, everyone. My comments will focus on the following topics: Second quarter earnings, SCE's Notice of Intent or NOI filing for the 2015 General Rate Case, updated capital expenditures and rate base forecast for 2013 through 2017, SONGS and earnings guidance.","Turning to Page 2 of the presentation. Second quarter 2013 core earnings are $0.79 per share, up $0.23 from last year. SCE contributed $0.25 of their earnings growth. The key drivers are shown on the right side of the slide.","As with the first quarter, the largest earnings driver is the delay in the 2012 General Rate Case decision. This timing item affected SCE's quarter-over-quarter comparisons by $0.16 per share. You will recall that during 2012, before a final GRC decision was received, we recorded revenues at 2011 authorized levels.","We also benefited $0.08 per share from higher revenues authorized for 2013. As I mentioned last quarter, the earnings benefit of rate base growth was offset by lower CPUC ROE of 10.45% in 2013 versus 11.5% last year.","On the cost side, there are a number of items to mention. The first is severance. Severance accounting for employees who worked at SONGS is rather complicated. Here's my plain English explanation. During the second quarter of 2013, we accrued $56 million of severance. Of this amount, $24 million or $0.05 per share was offset by authorized SONGS revenue. For the balance, or $32 million, we established a regulatory asset and we expect that this amount will be offset during the third quarter as we ramp down other expenses at the plant.","Because we believe the full amount of the $56 million will be recovered in rates, this cost did not impact earnings. Additionally, for the quarter-over-quarter variance analysis, we see the $0.05 of severance showing up this quarter, and the balance will run through expense next quarter.","The severance for employees that indirectly support SONGS is accounted for differently. Severance for the estimated 175 positions was accrued during the second quarter or $0.03 per share and will reduce earnings, but will yield savings once these employees depart later this year. As a reminder, this severance was included as transition cost in our June guidance update.","The balance of severance or $0.03 a share relates to the operational excellence initiative Ted discussed, and we'll have similar future benefits through 2014. SONGS inspection and repair costs are $0.04 per share lower in the second quarter. In addition, we did not receive any warranty payments from MHI during the second quarter.","One last point on SONGS. We are not showing any variance for removing SONGS rate base from earnings or from AFUDC on CWIP. For the partial month of June, these amounts were relatively small and offset by other items. However, these variances will show up next quarter.","The completed SmartConnect project had O&M costs recorded in the balancing account in the second quarter of 2012 of about $0.04, resulting in a positive variance this quarter. Depreciation is $0.03 per share higher from rate base growth.","Incremental tax benefits from repair deductions added $0.05 per share. Year-over-year, we continue to expect incremental tax benefits from Transmission & Distribution repair deductions consistent with earnings guidance.","Income tax and other items netted to $0.02 per share benefit. Edison International parent and other costs were $0.02 per share higher than last year, as you can see on the left side of the chart. This relates principally to quarter-over-quarter change in our consolidated income taxes.","In noncore items, as Ted mentioned, the SONGS impairment charge of $1.12 per share was within the disclosed range. We also recorded a positive $0.04 per share in discontinued items as we continue to refine the estimated income tax impacts of the expected future separation of EME. As Ted mentioned, EME is in discontinued operations and is no longer consolidated as part of our results.","Together, the core earnings, non-core charge and discontinued operations tie to the basic and diluted EPS loss of $0.29 per share in the quarter.","Page 3 summarizes the year-to-date results and core earnings drivers. I will not go into full reconciliation of year-to-date results because the explanation is very similar to the quarter.","Looking ahead to the third quarter, the timing of the 2012 CPUC GRC decision will continue to result in positive variances over the last year and there will be a negative variances from the removal of SONGS from rate base and the elimination of AFUDC earnings from CWIP.","Page 4 summarizes many of the key points Ted has already made about the policy direction we're taking in the 2015 General Rate Case. The Notice of Intent will go through a detailed review by the CPUC Division of Rate Payor Advocates. Once the area is satisfied, the filing is complete and deficiencies are cleared, we will finalize a filing and update for any necessary changes. We will file the application in the fourth quarter, commence evidentiary hearings in the spring and target a decision for the fourth quarter of next year. As we have previously mentioned, the workforce reductions and other efficiency improvements will flow back to customers beginning January 1, 2015.","Turning to Page 5, we've updated our capital investment forecast to show the profile we anticipate over the next 5 years. The forecast shows the increase in distribution spending in 2015, consistent with our infrastructure reliability focus. The chart shows that we expect to spend between $18 billion to $20 billion from 2013 through 2017. It also reflects the expected moderation of FERC spending, with 2 of our 3 major transmission projects nearing completion.","The forecast reflects a modest shift to the right, with 2013 CapEx down about $200 million from our prior forecast. This mainly reflects cost overruns on the 2 transmission projects going into service this year, as well as timing of expenditures -- underruns, sorry.","Over the 5-year period, CPUC spending is 78% of the total -- the CPUC spending is 78% of the total, and FERC is 22%. Please note that we also have continued to provide a range case with 12% variability. This is the average variability experienced between forecast and actual capital spending over the last 3 years.","Included in FERC capital spending is $360 million estimate for the undergrounding of the portion of the Tehachapi project that Ted discussed. This is the estimate SCE provided to the CPUC and updated Tehachapi testimony earlier this year. SCE assumes that this line is in service in 2016, and we expect the cost estimates and timing will be refined over time. Additional updates on our 3 major transmission projects are in the presentation appendix.","On Page 6, we show the detail on the resulting rate base through 2017. The forecast excludes SONGS rate base. Ultimately, Phase II of the OII process will determine what, if any, rate base will be used and useful. We currently estimate about $400 million of SONGS property, plant and equipment, plus construction work in process would continue to support ongoing activities at the site.","On August 12, we will make an additional filing to the CPUC and it will contain rate base figures. The capital expenditures provided on Page 5 yield a compound annual growth rate of 7% to 9% for the 2013 through 2017 period. These numbers also reflect bonus depreciation in 2013, which is trued up in the 2015 GRC NOI.","Page 7 is an update of our FERC formula rate case proceeding. As many of you are aware, the FERC judge announced a settlement among the parties and that the settlement will be filed on or before August 16. The terms of the settlement are confidential and will not be made public until this is filed with the FERC. We will file an 8-K concurrent with the filing of the settlement so we can discuss the key terms with the market.","Please turn to Page 8. We continue to provide updated summaries of key SONGS data and the details supporting our net investment. Note that we have added a new category of SONGS severance cost related to shutdown decision. These are the direct costs that I mentioned earlier, and we expect to recover and not impact earnings.","In addition, in the OII proceeding, we have recommended that any excess of SONGS authorized O&M over actual O&M be returned to customers through the credit to our fuel and purchase power balancing account, as Ted mentioned previously. We do not anticipate that O&M spending will decline meaning -- excuse me, we do anticipate that O&M spending will decline meaningfully over time as we transition to decommissioning and downsize staffing.","The fuel and purchase power balancing account is running and increasing under collection, primarily from higher-than-forecast natural gas prices and replacement power for SONGS.","We are still working on a plan on how to -- we will transition from funding SONGS from base rates to decommissioning. At a minimum, we will need approvals from the CPUC and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to withdraw funds from a decommissioning trust.","On Page 9, we've updated one of the slides we used in the June 7 SONGS call to better reflect the items we considered in recording the impairment. At the bottom of the slide, we summarized the accounting treatment, which moves the net investment into a regulatory asset less the pretax impairment charge of $575 million. This charge is based on the required accounting determination. As we have previously said, we may take different positions in the SONGS OII process based on our view that our actions have been prudent and reasonable.","Based on our conversation with investors, we have summarized the current status of the various OII phases on Page 10. Note that this time, the judge has not targeted a specific date for a proposed decision for Phase I, but we expect it in the third quarter. This includes the schedule for Phase II published yesterday by the CPUC. The schedule calls for hearings in October and a final decision in February of next year.","One of the key points we made in the June 7 SONGS call was that the recovery precedent allowed return of capital in early shutdown scenarios, but mixed results will return on capital. We have tabulated those precedents for reference, Pages 12 and 13, summarized for reference on Page 11.","Pages 12 and 13 summarized the key points that Ted made regarding potential recoveries from MHI for direct and consequential damages and from NEIL for replacement power. Almost all of the potential NEIL replacement coverage falls within the 52-week period of maximum coverage. The tail portion after 52 weeks is covered at 20%. Also, a coverage of 10% of costs may be available after permanent shutdown.","Page 14 provides a brief update on the decommissioning process that Ted also covered. Given the permanent shutdown of SONGS, we are now developing a detailed site-specific plan and cost estimates. This detailed plan will not be completed until next year. As a result, we have asked the commission to continue the current decommissioning funding of $23 million a year until we can incorporate the detailed plan.","As shown on Page 15, we have reaffirmed our updated core earnings guidance from the June 7 SONGS update call. We have updated our basic earnings per share guidance to reflect the second quarter noncore items. Other than the amount we recorded for the impairment charge for SONGS versus the prior range we provided, all of the guidance elements remain unchanged.","Page 16 also reaffirms our dividend policy, which is to return to our targeted dividend range over time to 45% to 55% of SCE's earnings. Ted and I have met with a number of investors over the last few months. We have heard the importance you place on progress with the dividend, as management and the board remain committed to delivering significant shareholder value from both attractive rate base and earnings growth and above-average dividend growth.","Thanks, and I'd like to turn the call over for Q&A to the operator.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] First question is from Jonathan Arnold of Deutsche Bank.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Firstly, Ted, in your prepared remarks, you said about the dividend that the plan was to increase it to the range that you said in steps and over time. Can you give us any flavor as to how many steps and how long -- and how much time is the right way to think about this, given the SONGS' sort of ongoing deliberations?","Theodore F. Craver","So, Jonathan, it's obviously a question I understand people would like more specificity on, as I think actually you and I talked about before as well. The tricky part about either saying we're going to be at 50% by x year, is it implied in any kind of a commitment along that line, is you might find yourself having to either issue debt to increase the dividend or possibly even issue equity in order to maintain that target. And we just feel that's imprudent, that's not the right way to manage capital. So that's why we say in steps over time. And I think the intent, obviously, is to get back into the range, get back into that range as soon as it is prudent. We obviously have a few things bubbling on the stove here, and we've got to figure out the most appropriate way to get back into that range. So I can't be more clear at this point, but we certainly don't expect it to be in one big jump and we don't expect to spend an excessive amount of time getting there.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And can I just start another topic? The -- obviously, the CPUC approved Tehachapi, but they think it's going to cost less than you're saying it's going to cost. Can you -- I'm sorry if you covered this, but I was cut off for a bit. What -- how will it work? How will you resolve that difference? Are there risks associated with not recovering the actual costs?","Theodore F. Craver","So, Jonathan, we're going to have Ron Litzinger cover that.","Ronald L. Litzinger","Yes, Jonathan, cost recovery is at FERC. We will make our filings at FERC, and we have to demonstrate prudency, whatever it costs. The public California PUC does like to put cost caps in their decisions, but it's ultimately decided by FERC.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So that there is -- it doesn't matter essentially what the commission decided on costs, that'll be determined by FERC based on your future filing?","Ronald L. Litzinger","I think people look at the cost caps that the PUC has, and it certainly begs questions. So if we feel we need to file an advice letter with regards to the cost cap at an appropriate time after we get a little further along with the construction risk we face at Tehachapi, we would file an advice letter just to clear up that question.","Operator","Next question is from Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I'm just curious in terms of thinking about the risk reward around the settlement and the transmission, the TO case. I know that you haven't disclosed any of the information regarding what's in the detail of the formal settlement. But just curious, are you looking at a process where you could be coming back in every year, where you're reviewing potential ROEs on FERC-regulated transmission? Are you looking to try and get more of some long-term certainty around that?","Theodore F. Craver","Michael, I'm sorry right now. We -- I'd love to be able to get into the settlement, but since it's subject to confidentiality, I can't peel off a piece and give you a feel for how that was treated in the settlement process. When we actually file the settlement, which is expected around August 16, the full settlement will be in the public domain and we'll be happy to talk to you then. So I got to beg off until we get that into the public domain.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. Follow-on question related to EME, if I go back in time and if I go back and recall whether it was NRG, whether it was Mirant, whether it was some of the bankruptcies on the merchant side that we've seen, there wound up being significant cash payments made, whether it was by Xcel or other companies, to bondholder or creditor committees. How do you think or how should investors think about the potential ramifications or impact of that for Edison International in the EME process?","Theodore F. Craver","Well, Michael, you're going to get Jim's response redux. I'll just say, I chose my words carefully in my prepared remarks, and those are really probably where we need to leave it at this point. Lots -- it's the nature of the animal, lots of these claims and counterclaims and all kinds of interesting tactics get used. But at the end of the day, as I said, we think the claims or the allegations that were made in this latest filing are without merit, and we intend to vigorously defend our approach. I have to leave it there.","Operator","Hugh Wynne of Sanford Bernstein.","Hugh Wynne - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","You all mentioned that the scoping memo for Phase II of the OII called for a decision in February of next year. And if I remember correctly, that's only the second phase of a 4-phase process. What are the prospects for settlement with interveners in the OII to be reached on an accelerated basis so that we don't have to wait through the end of '14 for a resolution?","Theodore F. Craver","Yes, Hugh, this will be Ted again. I guess, I get to make all the responses where we don't respond. But that's why I said in my script that although, we're obviously aware that President Peevey and others have urged the parties to get together and consider settlement and bring that to the commission, we really can't go into any discussion about that. So there is an interest in it obviously on the part of the commission, but that's about all we can really say on that point. Otherwise, meanwhile, back at the ranch, there is a schedule that is under the OII and that's what we're focused on, at least publicly.","Hugh Wynne - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. My follow-up question is kind of a nitty-gritty question on NEIL insurance. You seem to be making substantial claims under the outage policy, but I believe you say here that you've not made claims under the property damage policy. And I guess, I just wanted to verify that. And is there an ability to collect under the outage policy even if the loss to property is excluded from coverage under the property policy?","Robert L. Adler","Hugh, it's Bob Adler. We have delayed making a judgment about submissions under the property policy to this point in time. It's not correct to say that we've decided not to make a submission. So we have not yet determined that, but we have been able to submit claims under the outage policy.","Hugh Wynne - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","That contention on the claim on the property policy, because that's the point I wanted to clear up. You can claim under the outage without claiming the property or is that...","Robert L. Adler","Correct. They are independent policies. They're triggered by independent coverages and they have independent exclusions and inclusions.","Operator","Dan Eggers of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just changing pace a little bit, if you look at the CapEx plan from the GRC, there's a lot more distribution spending than you've had in the past. Can you maybe share a little more color on where those monies are going and how much of that is tangibly visible today for explicit needs in the sense of in the past transmission investment had very clear projects associated with it?","William James Scilacci","So, Dan, I'll give you a quick update, and Ron will give you lots of detail because he is the policy witness for the company for the 2015 GRC. To say it's tangible, I think it would be very tangible to spending a lot of it and we can break it down for you. When you get into the back part of the deck, there'll be a pie chart that shows the distribution of capital spending in the various categories. So we can get into a little bit more probably outside of this call. But a lot of it, a significant amount, I can't quote you a percentage right off the top of my head, is for what we call infrastructure replacement. Those are poles, transformers, conduits, you name it. It's just we're stepping up the replacement level of our facilities given the age to get it closer to where we think we need to be, so we can get on top of any kind of potential down-the-road reliability issues. I'll pause there and look to Ron to fill in around it.","Ronald L. Litzinger","I think Jim has really captured the key point. Our focus on the distribution system is on infrastructure replacement. We need on almost all asset classes to get at or near, what we call, the equilibrium replacement rate, which is sort of the population divided by the mean time to failure. As our system ages, we need to get to that rate to keep the system at the average age of the system less than that mean time to failure for reliability. So we're making some significant step-ups in this particular rate case, especially on poles, as we go forward. And that's what's driving it up primarily.","William James Scilacci","Yes, it's on Page 23 of the deck when you have a chance to look at it, Dan. So infrastructure replacement is more than 50%. It's almost 60% of the total distribution spending during the 5-year period. The service connections represents about 10% to 15%, load growth is about the same amount; general plan, so that'll be facilities and IT-related activities. So it's -- going back to the main point, infrastructure replacement, that's our way of saying maintain the reliability of the system, that will be very tangible.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And I guess, I don't know, it's hard to talk to what the OII is going to look like. But with such big claims outstanding both from your perspective of the MHI and then NEIL, is there a way to work an agreement or, looking at past precedent, to work an agreement where the recovery number would be determined from the customer and then you'd net back proceeds? Or do you need to know -- have a better handle on what you're going to get from these other parties before you can figure out what the customers are going to pay for?","William James Scilacci","Yes, it's hard to speculate at this point in time. I think what's going to happen, we're going to go through a process and the commission is going to determine what's use and useful in this next phase, in Phase II. Phase III is the important one, that's the prudence of our decision in and around the steam [ph] generator project and all the activities that supported that. So I think that's the process that we will be going down and they'll determine in each one of those phases a decision leading up to the third phase, which I think is the key because that's what will determine reasonableness. But to speculate beyond that, it's really hard to do it at this point in time.","Operator","The next question is from Steven Fleishman of Wolfe Research.","Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC","Just a question on the -- first on the rate base forecast. You mentioned the bonus depreciation is in there and then the true-up for that. Could you give a little more color on how that plays out through these numbers?","William James Scilacci","I don't know if I have more color to give you besides we gave you the amount in our script in terms of what the bonus depreciation amount is reflected in the 2015 number. So these numbers are reflective of it, and I'll stop and pause and look at Linda Sullivan for further detail.","Linda G. Sullivan","Right. It's included in our Notice of Intent filing bonus depreciation, and that is in the rate base numbers that are on this page.","Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC","Can you give us that number, though?","William James Scilacci","Well, we said $700 million.","Linda G. Sullivan","$700 million is included in the NOI and about 85% of that was associated with the extension into 2013.","Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC","Okay. So just in terms of the way that flows through, that's the bonus depreciation in '13, '14 or that's the true-up for that in '15 essentially?","Linda G. Sullivan","That's the true-up in '15.","William James Scilacci","Yes, it wasn't reflected in '13, '14. We didn't know about it, so it can't be in rate. So it's now picked up at 2015, Steve.","Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC","Okay. And then just on these -- the Edison Mission issues, which I know you can't comment on in detail, but just can you give us a sense on the process of this case and just when you would be in the process be responding?","Theodore F. Craver","So Steve, we'll have Bob Adler, our General Counsel, comment.","Robert L. Adler","Well, right now, Steve, the -- there has been a motion filed before the court for a -- for the creditors to take control of the potential claims against EIX. That motion will be heard some time later in August. And, of course, I wouldn't speculate about outcomes. Currently, I believe that Edison Mission has the exclusive reorganization rights into November, as I recall. And so that would be, presuming the next up in the bankruptcy process itself, after a resolution of this particular motion. Does that answer your question?","Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC","Yes. Will you be responding to what was filed last night as part of this motion?","Robert L. Adler","We have made a decision whether to respond to the motion. But I want to make clear, there's been no complaint filed against us. There is a motion pending in court.","Operator","Paul Fremont of Jefferies.","Paul B. Fremont - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","I guess my first question, looking at Page 9 of your slide presentation, the authorized revenues and the replacement power don't seem to be part of the regulatory asset. Is that because you're asking for recovery of that through the balancing accounts? Or what would be the venue to recover those?","William James Scilacci","Okay. So it's a good question, Paul. Thank you for picking it up. The authorized revenue, the $804 million here that we reflect on the Page 9, that has been previously recovered from customers, and it's subject to refund as part of the OII process. The replacement power, so here, you can see the $670 million that's been in a -- that sits in our ERRA or our fuel and purchase power balancing account, and it would be subject to review in prudency by the Public Utilities Commission. Thirdly is the net investment, as you slide over to the right. And we said back on June 7 when we announced that we were going to shut SONGS that the net investment is approximately $2.1 billion. And what we did was we took the impairment that we announced today, the $575 million pretax, and reduced the original net investment by that amount, the $575 million, to come up with a regulatory asset of $1.5 million to $1 million [ph]. So there are 3 separate pieces, to be clear, and the commission will review each of these as part of the investigation process. So I'll pause there and make sure we've got clarity here. And if you have a follow-up, please ask it.","Paul B. Fremont - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Yes, the follow-up question that I have is does the schedule in the scoping memo for Phase II imply that SONGS rate adjustments would occur commensurate with the final order in February of 2014? Or is that not clear based on what's out right now?","Theodore F. Craver","Yes, Phase II, for clarity, is looking at the question of what should continue as rate base, what will be used and useful. And that was in my script. I commented, at least based on the initial filing that we made last week, that we will update on August 12 that we believe that there's about $400 million of net plant. Not rate base, net plant that would continue to be used and useful. And so the commission is going to need to look at that and decide. And so it affects ultimately the net investment number that we're talking about here and the regulatory asset that resides at the bottom of the page. And ultimately, remember, for earnings purposes, we pulled out the entire earnings on the entire $1.2 billion of rate base associated with SONGS. So there's a lot of pieces it affects. And Phase II should be recovered by February. And again, this is for interim rate treatment in Phase II. Phase III, if there's prudency issues, it could come back and affect what happens in Phase II.","Paul B. Fremont - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","I'm still not clear, I mean are any rate adjustments then contemplated as part of Phase II or not?","Theodore F. Craver","So they'll look at rate adjustments on an interim basis. So Phase I takes a look at 2012 and could have an interim decision, but then that could be affected by ultimately what they decide in Phase III. So -- and just like with rates, you could pull certain costs out of rates and it will not be -- would no longer be used and useful, and certain portions of our rate base would continue. And they could adjust rates on an interim basis until they get to Phase III and they look at everything again. I know it's confusing. We're still working through the details as we understand it, too.","Paul B. Fremont - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay. So it would be like subject to refund. In other words, if you were -- if the costs were deemed to be prudent, then you would essentially get that back?","Theodore F. Craver","Yes, I think that's a good way to think about it because per candles [ph], if that would -- put it in rates, and they reserve the right to adjust it as part of Phase III.","Operator","The last question is from Julien Dumoulin-Smith.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So first question here. Obviously, pretty successful on cost cutting here, and it seems like moving forward on that front. How do you feel now on executing on '14 cost cuts as you guys previously described on the SONGS update call a few weeks back?","William James Scilacci","Well, that's a good question. And frankly, we haven't put anything out there for discussion purposes yet. I think we implied through our comments that with the workforce reductions that we've indicated and from things we previously said that there will be some tax benefits that flow into '14 that there will be earnings above the standard rate base model that we've talked about previously. So you'll have growing O&M savings from the workforce reductions where you don't have severance, and you'll have what's not -- and just want to emphasize to you, and thank you, Scott, for pointing that out, the benefits we see from SONGS, reductions and costs will not flow to earnings, those are being captured. Whatever benefit of -- arise from the difference between authorized rates and actual expenditures will flow to reduce fuel and purchase power under collections that we're experiencing right now. And then I have to stop there. And obviously rate base, we expect to grow based on the numbers we gave you today.","Linda G. Sullivan","That is what we have proposed with the CPUC.","Theodore F. Craver","Right.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Right. But there is this separate and distinct cost cutting initiative underway, at least from the last time you guys updated it, it seemed like that would at least in part offset the reduction of rate base, correct? I mean the -- and no change at least from that base [ph]?","Theodore F. Craver","Yes, there's no change, so there's multiple different pieces here and you've got non-SONGS reductions in workforce, you have SONGS reduction in workforce, but that should not affect earnings on the SONGS piece. And you have rate base growth and you tax benefits. So those are the primary elements of -- as you're trying to look forward into '14.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Can you give us a flavor, at least as to the tax element that you're alluding to, what that could contribute potentially?","Theodore F. Craver","We have not said -- we'll catch you in the first part of next year what that amount will be. I think we had $50 million after tax for 2013. We have not said what it's going to be in '14.","Scott S. Cunningham","Operator?","Operator","Okay, sir. I'll turn it back over to you now.","Scott S. Cunningham","Great. Thanks very much.

My name is Tony and I\u2019ll be operator for today. [Operator Instructions] Today\u2019s call is being recorded.","I would now turn the call over to Mr. Scott Cunningham, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Cunningham, you may begin your conference.","Scott Cunningham","Thanks, Tony. Welcome, everyone. Our principal speakers today will be Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Ted Craver and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Jim Scilacci. Also here are other members of the management team.","Materials supporting today\u2019s call are available at www.edisoninvestor.com. These include our form 10-Q, Ted\u2019s and Jim\u2019s prepared remarks and the presentation that accompanies Jim\u2019s comments. Tomorrow afternoon, we will distribute our regular business update presentation","During this call, we will make forward-looking statements about the future outlook for Edison International and its subsidiaries. Actual results could differ materially from current expectations. Important factors that could cause different results are set forth in our SEC filings. Please read these carefully.","The presentation includes certain outlook assumptions as well as reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP measures.","During Q&A, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. We will be finishing our Q&A just a few minutes early today for some final comments.","With that, I will turn the call over to Ted.","Ted Craver","Think you, Scott, and good afternoon, everyone. Second-quarter results were below last year\u2019s results as we expected. You will recall that we told investors in our first-quarter earnings call that quarterly year-over-year comparisons would not be all that meaningful. This is primarily due to timing mismatches including impacts from the delayed decision on SCE\u2019s 2015 to 2017 rate case, the significant SCE tax benefits recorded last year but not repeated this year, no Edison capital asset sales this year versus last year and the timing of Edison energy costs versus revenues.","The larger point that I want to leave with you is that core earnings are on track for the full-year. That is why, today, we reaffirmed our full-year core earnings guidance range of $3.81 to $4.01 earnings per share.","In fact, based on second-quarter results, although there are various puts and takes amongst the businesses, our current outlook indicates that consolidated results for the full-year are in the top half of our guidance range. However, consistent with what we have done in several of the past years, we will hold off until our third quarter results are in to decide if we should adjust our core earnings guidance.","We are in the final half of our 2015 to 2017 CPUC rate case period. We have communicated to investors that based on CPUC approved capital spending and expected spending on FERC jurisdictional transmission projects, we expect rate-based growth \u2013 rate base to grow approximately 7% in the 2016 to 2017 period. This still seems appropriate.","We have communicated several times in the past that there is relatively little variance expected in the timing of CPUC jurisdictional spending for the 2016 to 2017 period, but more variability is possible in the timing, but less likely in the ultimate amount of our FERC jurisdictional transmission spending.","Remember, SCE\u2019s transmission investment is to improve system reliability and bring online utility scale wind and solar resources to meet California\u2019s aggressive renewable energy targets.","Most of the transmission CapEx spending variability occurs due to delays in routing decisions and permitting approvals at the state and federal levels. A recent example was the $1.1 billion West of Devers project which has been something of a moving target with CPUC staff, even with CAISO support, but appears ready for final CPUC approval with a supportive alternate proposed decision pending.","We see schedule challenges of this sort for other lesser transmission projects as well. Net-net, we don\u2019t expect meaningful impacts to our total transmission spend expectations over the medium term three to five-year period but likely some shifting between the years. Said differently, our current view is that 2016 rate base will not, materially different than forecasted. 2017 could be slightly lower but recovered in the 2018 to 2020 period.","On the last earnings call, most of my comments were devoted to outlining the future SCE growth opportunity. I would like to provide some additional comments today keeping in mind that we will be able to elaborate more on this when SCE makes its General Rate Case filing on September 1.","In the broadest sense, the capital spending request in our 2018 to 2020 General Rate Case is designed to help California achieve its low carbon policy objectives and to enable customer choice while continuing to focus on reliable and affordable service for all customers.","Keeping it simple, the requested investment can be lumped into two buckets. The first bucket is comprised of grid investments we have traditionally requested in past rate cases. The second bucket is made up of new grid modernization investments. Let me expand further on these two areas.","The traditional investments we will propose in the first bucket represent the vast majority of our total rate case capital spending request. The areas of spending encompass five basic elements: replacement of aging infrastructure, new customer connections and demand growth on certain circuits, investments in information technology to improve customer service and cost efficiency, maintenance capital spending on SCE\u2019s generation fleet and other core investments such as in our operations facilities.","This first bucket of requested spending, together with other non-GRC spending, such as SCEs electric vehicle charging program, and FERC transmission spending is expected to total more than $4 billion in CapEx per year. It is difficult to handicap how much of our requested investment in this first bucket of capital spending will ultimately be approved. However, investors have some history to observe in this regard. SCE received 81% of its requested capital spending in the 2009 to 2011 General Rate Case, 89% of its 2012 to 2014 General Rate Case request and 92% of its 2015 to 2017 request.","The smaller, second bucket of spending we will request is new. It is for modernization of the distribution system and is part of SCE\u2019s strategy to facilitate the growth of distributed energy resources.","Governor Brown and the California legislature have stated their strong desire for California to lead the nation in developing policies to create a low carbon economy while creating jobs and prosperity for its citizens. SB 350, signed into law last year, stated the goal of making the electric grid a key enabler of California\u2019s low carbon policy ambitions including by electrifying transportation.","The CPUC has two active proceedings underway, which together, will help shape the long-term planning for this vision. From a capital investment perspective, the most important is the distribution resources plan proceeding. In this proceeding, the CPUC\u2019s stated goal is to modernize the distribution system during the next decade, but it provided only some early direction on preferred technologies and required investments.","SCE, through its 2018 to 2020 General Rate Case will be the first electric utility to provide specificity for how this technology evolution should unfold. This will be the new element of our September 1 filing. We need to wait until the filing to be specific about the amount and details of our investment request, but you should expect that the overall level of the request will be roughly consistent with our DRP filing last summer.","At this time, based on the pace of grid modernization that SCE will describe in its 2018 GRC filing, it is expected that grid modernization capital expenditures and rate-based growth will continue beyond 2025.","Some of the requested grid modernization investment would be better characterized as reinforcing the existing system, such as upgrading low-voltage circuits in order to accommodate higher penetration of distributive energy resources. But other parts really have no precedent, and therefore, we do not know how to handicap how much of our request might finally be approved.","Like any technology evolution, there are certain initial investments that need to be made to create the foundational infrastructure that will support systemwide grid modernization. SCE has identified the critical path that it believes needs to get started sooner rather than later.","That is what led SCE to file on July 13 for a memorandum account requesting authority from the CPUC to track certain early-stage investment costs ahead of its 2018 General Rate Case filing. The July 13 request points out that the process of modernizing the distribution grid requires some near-term planning, engineering procurement and installation of certain distribution system upgrades before the 2018 SCE GRC period.","SCE\u2019s July 13 filing requests authority to track the revenue requirement of approximately $100 million of capital spending to be placed in service in 2017 that is critical to meeting the CPUC\u2019s overall timeline for grid modernization. If the memorandum account is approved and expenditures are deemed prudent, the associated rate base will be included in either the 2018 or perhaps the 2021 General Rate Case filing.","I will finish with comments on two other matters.","The first is SONGS. Last week we, and other parties, completed briefings requested by the CPUC. The core question was whether the SONGS settlement, unanimously approved by the CPUC, was still reasonable given the various disclosures about ex-parte communications made last year.","There were six signatories to the SONGS settlement. Four of the six settling parties, San Diego Gas and Electric, Friends of the Earth, the Coalition of California Utility Employees, and SCE, submitted filings that made clear why these communications had no impact on the settlement process and why the settlement remains reasonable, lawful and in the public interest. Two of the settling parties, TURN and ORA, are seeking in their filings to impose additional penalties on SCE. We strongly believe this is opportunistic and inappropriate.","We also note that before approving the settlement, the commission asked the settling parties to amend the settlement in meaningful ways, all of which were more favorable for customers, which the parties ultimately did. The commission then unanimously approved that amended settlement.","While there remains no timeline for further action, we are hopeful that the commission will see the record as demonstrating the validity and appropriateness of the settlement by reaffirming the settlement and dismissing the pending appeals.","The final item is the important CPUC reforms announced in late June by the governor and key legislatures and subsequently endorsed by the CPUC. These reforms largely address a series of principles the governor has advocated while balancing sensitivities over the role of the executive and legislative branches in designing and implementing these reforms. While there are many details yet to be finalized, the overall approach appears responsive.","If implemented as described, it should continue to provide broad public access to the decision-making process, accelerate timely decision-making, address important CPUC staffing and recruiting issues and allow CPUC commissioners more leeway to discuss important topics amongst themselves.","This concludes my remarks. Jim will now provide his financial update.","Jim Scilacci","Thanks, Ted. Hello everyone. My comments today will cover second quarter and year-to-date results, earnings guidance and our updated capital expenditures and rate base forecasts.","Please turn to page 2 of the presentation. As a brief reminder, comparisons to 2015 will not be meaningful primarily because of the timing of the 2015 GRC decision and the impact of taxes. I also explained last quarter how we removed in the variance analysis the impact of repair deductions, pole loading, and San Onofre tax items because these revenue items have offsets within the income statement.","EIX\u2019s basic and core earnings per share are $0.85 for the second quarter or $0.31 per share less than the same quarter last year. SCE\u2019s second-quarter basic and core earnings are $0.21 per share lower and EIX parent other are $0.10 per share lower. The lower earnings are primarily due to $0.31 per share of income tax benefits recorded in the second quarter of last year.","Focusing on the SCE key EPS drivers column, the utilities revenue is $0.10 per share higher quarter-over-quarter. This increase includes $0.09 per share from the GRC attrition mechanism which automatically adjusts authorized revenue following the 2015 test year. This is largely offset by a $0.06 per share timing issue with the 2015 GRC decision.","As I discussed last quarter, authorized revenue reductions from the 2015 GRC decision are not reflected in results for the first or second quarter of this year. You will see this reverse in the third and fourth quarters of this year. The results are a $0.03 per share positive variance from the pole loading balancing account. This balancing account was created with a final 2015 GRC decision, so the $0.08 of pole loading earnings we had last year was all recorded in the fourth quarter.","FERC revenues are $0.03 per share higher. This is largely related to revenues associated with the higher operating costs and abandoned plant recoveries for the canceled Coolwater Lugo transmission project. The recovery of Coolwater Lugo costs will continue through 2016 and has no impact on earnings. Together, these revenue items net to a positive $0.10 per share.","O&M was not a major driver in the second quarter as lower legal and labor costs due to workforce reductions are mostly offset by a planned outage and upgrades at the Mountain View generation plant and higher pole loading costs. Results included $0.02 per share of severance costs comparable to what was recorded last year. $0.03 of the $0.04 of higher depreciation are amortization of the Coolwater Lugo costs discussed above.","Net financing costs are $0.02 per share higher due primarily to an increase in the amount of preferred stock outstanding. The CPUC and FERC ratemaking mechanisms include funding for new debt and preferred stock to finance rate base growth.","As indicated above, there was a $0.31 per share benefit from a change in an uncertain tax positions in 2015. There is no comparable change in the second quarter of this year. Partially offsetting this item is a $0.04 per share benefit this year from tax depreciation and balancing accounts bringing the net impact from income taxes to a negative $0.27.","The second quarter effective tax rate for SCE is a negative 9% due primarily to a $133 million flow-through tax refund to customers for repair benefits from 2012 through 2014. The refund of tax repair benefits has no earnings impact.","Higher insurance benefits primarily drive the $0.02 per share contribution from other income and expenses. This gets us to the $0.21 per share decline in the second quarter SCE earnings.","I will turn next to EIX parent and other. Losses increased by $0.10 per share, overall, from last quarter of last year. A key driver is a $0.04 per share buyout of an earnout provision with former shareholders and current employees of a company acquired by Edison Energy at the end of 2015. The buyout was completed, along with modification of employment contracts, to align Edison Energy\u2019s incentive compensation with EIX\u2019s.","There is also a penny per share of higher business development and operating costs. Comparisons are also affected by a $0.03 per share gain on the sale of a portion of Edison Capital\u2019s affordable housing portfolio during the second quarter of last year.","Parent holding company costs increased by $0.02 per share due to higher interest expense as we termed out $400 million of holding company commercial paper debt and the impact of strong stock price performance on compensation expense.","Core earnings exclude a penny per share of tax related losses in discontinued operations related to the Edison Mission Energy, getting to the net $0.10 per share of holding company losses. That, with the SCE variance, gets you to the $0.31 per share reduction in EIX earnings.","Please turn to Page 3. I won\u2019t go into detail on the year-to-date results other than to remind everyone that SCE\u2019s performance for the first half of 2016 is consistent with our full-year SCE Outlook which looks stronger than our original guidance levels. At the same time, holding company costs are already at full-year guidance levels or $0.18 per share. We have built both factors into our reaffirmed full-year guidance.","Please turn to Page 4. On the top of the slide, it shows our reaffirmed GAAP and quarter earnings guidance. However, our internal SCE earnings outlook will be above its $4.09 per share guidance midpoint and holding company costs outlook will be higher than its guidance midpoint.","We are comfortable reaffirming overall EIX earnings guidance for the full-year based on this internal view. However, we have not updated our SCE and holding company guidance elements other than to indicate their directional trends. We are mindful that the third quarter is typically SCE\u2019s strongest of the year, and we will continue our practice of looking to update guidance when we report third-quarter results on November 1.","As I previously mentioned, holding company year-to-date costs, including Edison Energy Group, are at a full-year guidance level of $0.18, adjusting for an earnout agreement which was not part of the original guidance with lower year-to-date costs to $0.14. The important thing is that we do anticipate an increase in revenue during the second half of 2016 based on booked deals and expected sales.","I also want to point out that our guidance does not include any recoveries from the MHI arbitration. As a reminder, we are expensing all costs related to the arbitration as incurred through core earnings. For 2016 alone, we incurred $23 million of costs and a total of $76 million including prior periods. As part of the SONGS settlement, we can recover our reasonable arbitration costs from MHI recoveries before sharing.","I will next touch on SCEs balance sheet strength. On June 30, SCEs weighted average common equity ratio was 50.3% versus the authorized level of 48%. This helps provide financial flexibility as the utility continues to fund growth with operating cash flow and retain earnings and without the need of new common equity.","Please turn to Page 5. SCE has updated its capital spending forecast. We expect that 2016 will be lower by $300 million and 2017 will be $100 million higher. The biggest factor change, forecast change, is $375 million of transmission spending, mostly due to licensing delays of projects like Albert Hill, Mason, and the city of Riverside projects. As Ted has highlighted, we firmly believe these projects will ultimately move forward and the balance of their capital spending will be shifted into our 2018 through 2020 period. We have also adjusted the utilities CPUC capital expenditures to more closely align with what the commission has authorized for the three-year General Rate Case cycle. The net result of these changes is a reduction of approximately $200 million.","Please turn to Page 6. You will see that rate base has a directionally similar adjustment with a 2017 rate base forecasted to be lower by $200 million. Because of the transmission delays, the reduction in rate base will be shifted into the 2018 through 2020 period. As I mentioned earlier, we don\u2019t see this having any impact on 2016 earnings as the modest rate base reduction is more than offset in other areas based on SCEs current outlook. I would like to add a short addendum to my prepared remarks. This earnings call is my 32nd and last as CFO of EIX. It has been a great eight-year run.","There is a lot of work that goes into each one of these calls, and I would like to recognize our Edison team that makes these calls happen. Personally, I think our disclosures and investor materials are among the best. This job falls to our lawyers, accountants, corporate communications folks and IR staff. In particular, our attorneys, Adam, Russ, Barbara, Kathleen do a great job of converting accounting English into plain English. Our accountants Erin, Connie, Mark and Tricia make sure our books and SEC filings are in top shape. Our IR staff, Scott and Allie, do a fantastic job. As many of you know, Scott is a highly regarded IR professional and Ali has done a great job since joining us a year ago.","I have always enjoyed the interaction with investors and analysts over the years. Hopefully, you have earned our respect by the way we conduct our communications. Early on, Ted advised me when communicating with investors and analysts, I should strive to keep my comments down the middle of the fairway. Ted said if I pushed my comments left or right of center, you folks will sniff it out and our credibility will be called into question. I have tried to follow this solid advice and I hope Pedro and Maria do the same. As you know, Ted and I are heading out on September 30.","I don\u2019t have any plans for retirement, yet, but there are many things I want to do. The one thing I would really like to do, though is finally learn how to drive my golf balls down the middle of the fairway. Thank you, all.","Operator, it\u2019s question time.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question would come from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from UBS. Your line is now open.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Good afternoon and once more, congratulations to both of you.","Ted Craver","Okay. Thanks, Julian.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Absolutely, here is a question. Let\u2019s see if you can respond to it. MHI filed updated notice as far as the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Can you provide a little more color on why that was and what that says with respect to the arbitration case?","Scott Cunningham","We are going to toss that one out to Adam Umanoff, our General Counsel.","Adam Umanoff","Hi, Julian, thanks for the question. I really can\u2019t give you much additional detail. As MHI did last year, they felt an obligation under the Tokyo Stock Exchange rules to make a comment with respect to their view of their exposure under the arbitration. We can\u2019t comment or confirm anything they\u2019ve said in that filing. We are operating under a confidentiality order in the International Chamber of Commerce litigation that really precludes us from making any substantive comment. Sorry I can\u2019t give you any more information.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","No worries. I thought I\u2019d have to ask. And separately, related, feel compelled, I suppose it is somewhat awkward given the timing. Can you opine a little bit on the desirability of the utility and the utility jurisdictions outside of California. To what extent is there, given the media headlines, a desire to expand? Or deviate from the Edison Energy strategy you guys have previously articulated as being the go-forward plan outside of SCE?","Ted Craver","Julian, this is Ted. I will wade into that nice easy question. I think we\u2019ve been fairly open with investors over the years about our prospects, and in a weird way, the most difficult element is we have tremendous growth prospects here at Southern California, Edison.","Our organic growth and the expected CAGRs from rate base and ultimately earnings really make looking at other utilities outside of our territory as more often than not, looking dilutive either to the underlying strategic approach that we have which is, as you know, a wires based focus or a delivery of electricity focus rather than a heavy involvement in some of the other parts of the business, or dilutive from and earnings growth perspective. As a result of that, we have continued to focus primarily on where we see the best opportunities and those are really our organic growth opportunities.","I ought to keep it at the 100,000 foot level. I certainly don\u2019t want to engage in speculation on any specific thing.","Scott Cunningham","Julien, did we hit your question?","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Yes. I think that is fair. Thank you, very much, both.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question would come from Steve Fleishman from Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. ","Steve Fleishman","Okay. Thank you, a couple quick questions. Just, first, the MHI spending in terms of legal spending you\u2019ve made, is that at SCE or is that at the parent?","Jim Scilacci","It is at the utility, Steve.","Steve Fleishman","At the utility? Okay.","And one question on the parent, if you excluded the kind of one time payment that you made to the employees of the company you bought, would you be roughly on track for the year without that one-time payment?","Jim Scilacci","It would be a little higher than that.","Steve Fleishman","Higher being higher losses or lower?","Jim Scilacci","Yes, the losses are a little bit higher.","Steve Fleishman","Okay.","Jim Scilacci","After adjusting for the buyout of the earnout.","Steve Fleishman","Okay, good. And then just one other question on SONGS. Are we just basically waiting for the assigned commissioner to tell us next steps at this point?","Jim Scilacci","So everything has been filed that was required to be. Adam, I will throw back out if there is anything more that\u2019s yet to be done.","Adam Umanoff","Jim, you\u2019re exactly right. Steve, briefs were filed in July. The ball is in the court of the assigned commissioner in the ALJ to decide what to do next.","Steve Fleishman","Okay, great. Jim, you sounded like you were winning an Academy award there, best of luck to you. I\u2019m sure I will see you, but you\u2019re making me feel old. Best of luck.","Jim Scilacci","All right, thanks Steve.","Ted Craver","It\u2019s making us feel old too Steve.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question would come from Ali Agha, from SunTrust. You may go ahead sir.","Ali Agha","Thank you. Good afternoon.","Jim Scilacci","Hi, Ali.","Ali Agha","Jim, all the best to all of you, as well.","Jim Scilacci","Thanks.","Ali Agha","First question, just to be clear, just clarifying the points you were making on parent. So, if we look at that, it is running at around $0.07 negative per quarter. Obviously, higher than what you had originally thought. And I\u2019m excluding that one-time payment. Is that a good run rate to think about going forward?","Jim Scilacci","So what I think I\u2019m indicating is that we had more expenses in the first half of the year and you pulled out, we said it was $0.18 in total for the first half minus the $0.04 for the essentially the one-time item that gets you to $0.14. I am suggesting, I think I was trying to get to it in Steve\u2019s comment and question that we\u2019re going to have more revenues in the second half of the year. It\u2019s going \u2013 I have indicated it\u2019s going to be slightly above the $0.18 for the full-year, but it\u2019s not going to be that much above.","Ali Agha","Okay. And then to get to the higher end of the range for the year, given that the parent drag will be higher, again would imply that you are going to be earning above your authorized ROE for this final year in this GRC. How much capacity do you have to further cut back on costs so you can continue to do that in the three-year cycle of the GRC program? Which innings are we as far as the cost reduction cycle is concerned?","Jim Scilacci","It\u2019s an ongoing process. I think when we started this four years ago there was a lot to be done. If you just looked at our headcount there has been a lot of reductions over the last four years compliments to Ron Litzinger and the effort he started and continue with Pedro. And there\u2019s more to be done. What we keep finding when we do these benchmarking studies, those in the first quartile keep getting more competitive. They continue to reduce their costs.","So, the job for us is there even greater to keep up with them and then the close in the ranks, because our goal here is to get to first quartile. So there\u2019s more to be done, and we have indicated it in our guidance for this year and we\u2019ve indicated there will be some earnings from cost reductions next year, too. Of course, we pass that back as part of the 2018 GRC, and then we start it fresh looking for cost reductions.","Ali Agha","One last one. Ted, I just wanted to clarify from your prepared remarks, when you talked about the SONGS situation and where all the parties were coming from. Can one infer from that that the outcomes would be either that they agree that nothing needs to happen or there is an additional fine perhaps imposed on you as TURN and ORA want? Are those the two realistic scenarios given where all these parties are with their re-filings?","Jim Scilacci","So we are not going to speculate on what the outcomes might be. We think the settlement is reasonable based on all of the filings that we\u2019ve made. Adam, anything else to add on that?","Adam Umanoff","No. Thanks, Jim. You are exactly right. It really is difficult for us to speculate on what the CPUC might do.","Ali Agha","Got it, thank you.","Jim Scilacci","Thank you, Ali.","Operator","Thank you. Our next would come from Brian Chin from Bank of America.","Brian Chin","Hi, good afternoon. On the MHI, can we just get a sense of what the calendar of next events looks like?","Adam Umanoff","Brian, it\u2019s Adam Umanoff. Again, we are operating under a confidentiality agreement. What we can tell you is that the hearing ended at the end of April of this year, and we are expecting a decision as soon as the end of the year although it could be later. Other than that I can\u2019t give you any specifics about the process or the substance.","Brian Chin","Okay. And then just to be clear, going back to Slide 6, you indicated that you will provide a forecast through 2020 after the next GRC application is filed on September 1. So we should expect that these rate-based numbers might be adjusted to some extent in the next, on the third quarter call or perhaps EEI? Is that the right way to think about this for 2018 and beyond or is there any other adjustments that might be made?","Jim Scilacci","So what will happen on September 1, we will file our application with the Public Utilities Commission. In concurrent with that, Brian, we will put out an 8K providing additional information. We will probably pick up the capital expenditure forecast and the SCE rate base forecast, and it will cover the periods 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020. So you have the full view in terms of, and 2015, obviously, was authorized. It\u2019s just a base to start from. So you will have the full five-year forecast, and we will probably provide some additional detail in terms of some of the major components and the potential impact on bonus depreciation. So we are still developing that, but the current plan is to provide it concurrently with the GRC.","Brian Chin","That is great. Thank you, very much.","Jim Scilacci","Okay, Brian.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question would come from Shar Pourreza from Guggenheim Partners. Your line is now open","Shar Pourreza","Hey, everyone.","Jim Scilacci","Hi Shar.","Shar Pourreza","Just on a shifting of the transmission spend, can you just confirm that this licensing delay is really sort of like that, it\u2019s administrative and not a function of something like renewables having a counterattack where it pushes off in the weeds the near term?","Jim Scilacci","Yes, it has nothing to do with renewables. It has everything to do with the process of getting approvals through the regulatory processes we have to jump through. And this is all in the public domain. It is hard to track every single one of these projects that are working their way through. But we are working through it, and as Ted said and I said, we firmly believe that these projects are going to get built. It is just hard pinning down the exact time frame given the regulatory hoops we jump through.","Shar Pourreza","Got it, got it. Lastly, on the upcoming GRC, I know we\u2019ll get an update, but can you confirm sot of the top end of the DRP portion is around $2 billion to $2.5 billion from the 2018, 2020 timeframe. And then maybe some leverage that we can think about that can mitigate the retail rate impact assuming you\u2019re still kind of thinking it\u2019s going to be inflationary at best?","Jim Scilacci","So the best thing we can guide you to is, if you go to the business update, there is a document in there that\u2019s the DRP capital expenditures estimates. There is an 2018 through 2020 period expenditures. What Ted\u2019s comments were, we will roughly, there will be some changes, obviously, but the magnitude will generally be in the dollars that you are seeing in this chart on Page 18 of the investor update.","Ted Craver","Like $1.4 billion or $2.7 billion roughly, $2.6 billion.","Shar Pourreza","Okay, great. Jim and Ted, congrats on the stage two of your career and I am going to miss the steak dinners. ","Jim Scilacci","Okay.","Ted Craver","You can buy as a steak dinner anytime. ","Jim Scilacci","All right no problem.","Shar Pourreza","Thanks guys.","Ted Craver","Okay, sure.","Operator","Our next question would come from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Michael Lapides","Hey, guys. I just wanted to ask a little bit of a question kind of thinking about long-term capital spending levels. I mean, Ted, in your prepared remarks, are you implying that you think the capital spending levels will remain in the low $4 billion a year range, or do you think it\u2019s when you make your 2018 rate case filing and get into the DRP filing and docket that we are talking about something that is materially different from that level?","Ted Craver","Yes, I will maybe use some slightly different words but capture the same themes. What I was really trying to do in the prepared remarks is keeping this thing simple. You should expect in our 2018 General Rate Case to see expenses kind of in two very broad buckets. One bucket is what I will call pretty much the traditional meat and potato type investment request that we make every General Rate Case. That covers kind of standard stuff, infrastructure replacement, expected demand increases on certain of our circuits, new connections, so on and so forth.","When you take that chunk, together with the things that aren\u2019t in the GRC, such as the Charge Ready program and FERC jurisdictional transmission spend, you should expect to see a number, generally in the neighborhood, maybe a little bit higher than what we have traditionally kind of talked about. I will just call that broadly the $4 billion plus type of base number.","Then, there is a second, smaller bucket that you will see in the 2018 General Rate Case request which will really be the first attempt to try to put some specificity around what is required to really modernize the distribution system such that it can facilitate the states carbon reduction goals and customer choice on technology, so distributed energy resources.","That is a lot harder for us at this early juncture to be able to handicap what of that would ultimately be approved. There is kind of the standard stuff which, when you lump it together with transmission spending and the like, it is going to look pretty similar to what you have seen in the past from us, maybe a little bit higher. Then there is a new layer of stuff that really this rate case will kind of start that conversation about, what that might look like and that would be additive to that kind of base level.","So this is what I signaled last earnings call and what we have elaborated on a little bit more in this earnings call.","Michael Lapides","When you talk to customer groups and when you meet with some of the big parties, how flexible are they in terms of the balanced need to modernize the distribution system versus the impact of what that does on rates and therefore their own economics?","Ted Craver","I did not go into that again, here, on this call, but last earnings call, I made a fairly involved discussion about what has been the pace of electric rate increases relative to the pace of underlying consumer price index increases.","A lot of this depends on what year you are starting with and what year you\u2019re ending with. But as I said in the last call, whether you looked at the 1 year, the 5 year, the 10, the 20, the rate of increase in customer rates, the system average rate has actually been at or below the rate of inflation, the Southern California area CPI.","I remember the 20 year number because that is probably the most relevant one. Over the long-term, that CPI increase from 1995 to 2015 was 2.4% Compound Annual Growth Rate. The rate of Increase in electric rates over that same 1995 to 2015 period was 2.0% Compound Annual Growth Rate.","As it demonstrates, over the long haul, we have been able to manage the price of electricity at or below the rate of inflation and that continues to be kind of our overall goal.","You will have periods where you get more of a surge. You get other periods where you end up consolidating some of those increases, but the key, I think, over the long haul is to have the price of electricity stay at or below the rate of inflation. That is our overall goal. That remains our goal.","Michael Lapides","Got it. Thank you, Ted. Much appreciated.","Ted Craver","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Anthony Crowdell from Jefferies.","Anthony Crowdell","Good afternoon. I just have a quick question on the MHI.","I know you can\u2019t talk about it or a decision has yet to be rendered, but any thought on the use of proceeds from the shareholder portion of a decision?","Jim Scilacci","Not at this time.","Obviously, if there were recoveries, it would be excess equity based on the sharing arrangements associated with the settlement, and then we will have to decide if we\u2019re fortunate enough to get in that position what to do with the cash.","Anthony Crowdell","Does that excess equity go to the utility, the parent or does it matter?","Jim Scilacci","I am sorry. I should have been clearer. It definitely goes to the utility.","Anthony Crowdell","Great. Thanks for taking my question, guys and good luck in retirement.","Jim Scilacci","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Next we will move on to Praful Mehta from Citigroup. You may go ahead with your questions.","Praful Mehta","Thanks, very much. Hi, guys.","Jim Scilacci","How are you doing, Praful? Sorry. ","Praful Mehta","[Indiscernible]","Jim Scilacci","Prahul, hold on a second. You have to get closer. The mic is really breaking up.","Praful Mehta","Is this any better?","Jim Scilacci","A little bit. Go ahead.","Praful Mehta","On Edison Energy, I just wanted to understand a quick update on how the different businesses are doing and if there is any update on size or scale of that business [indiscernible]?","Ted Craver","This is Ted. I will do something really quick here.","I think most of the focus most recently has been on SoCore, so that is our solar distributive solar generation company, and Edison Energy which is the new venture that is focused on providing energy services to commercial and industrial customers.","I think at this juncture, we may have made some comment about this in the last earnings call, but I think we feel encouraged based on customer reaction to the launch of Edison Energy, the CNI energy services business. This is not one of those things where it is going to get built overnight. This is going to take some time.","There really isn\u2019t, as we see it, at least, there isn\u2019t a category out there that addresses the market that we are trying to create, so it is going to take a little bit of time, but we are encouraged based on customer reaction, and we are encouraged based on some deals that have been coming in the door the last few months.","I will just leave it there. I don\u2019t think you should expect we will be providing something every quarter on this. It\u2019s probably more likely to be maybe a couple times a year as this thing progresses.","Praful Mehta","Okay. [Indiscernible]","Ted Craver","I\u2019m really sorry, but for some reason your microphone is kind of really breaking up. I did not catch much of the question.","Praful Mehta","Pardon me. I was trying to understand, so you were saying the scale and revenues from the businesses should not change [indiscernible].","Jim Scilacci","Praful, the connection is very bad. I have a call with you after the conclusion of this, and we will just follow-up with that question so we can get it clearer for you.","Praful Mehta","Thanks, guys.","Ted Craver","Thanks.","Operator","Next question is from the line of Michael Weinstein, from Credit Suisse.","Michael Weinstein","Congratulations, Ted and Jim.","Jim Scilacci","Thanks, Mike.","Michael Weinstein","It sounds like you intend to address the bulk of DRP planned spending through 2020 in the GRC filing. Is that intended to supersede the current outstanding DRP review docket, or does the earlier docket still have the potential to result in changes to the GRC plan after the fact?","Jim Scilacci","Mike, we are going to have Ron Nichols from the utility answer that question. He is responsible for all our regulatory activities at the utility.","Ron Nichols","Michael, the DRP, the Distribution Resources Plan, provides for some of the policy level guidance that we\u2019re going to do. Ultimately, the recovery of costs are expected after some change which there hasn\u2019t been so far. It would be recovered through the ultimate GRC. I think that was what your question was. If I\u2019m not answering it, you might want to restate it.","Michael Weinstein","I guess I\u2019m wondering if, let\u2019s say, priorities are changed in that docket. I guess you would go back and you would have to change the approved spending plan in the GRC? The GRC approves a certain level of CapEx for Distribution Resource Planning and then certain priorities are changed in the other docket. Does that go back and wind up making reductions to the amount of spending that is planned through 2020?","Ron Nichols","First of all, the commission hasn\u2019t made clear, yet, they are actually still discussing what that interrelationship between the DRP and the General Rate Case\u2019s will be. It is a matter that is still being discussed. I certainly would not anticipate retroactive changes.","Pedro?","Pedro Pizarro","This is Pedro Pizarro. I would also add that I would expect that the kind of spending that we would see over the next few years is all going to be fairly foundational.","We will provide more detail on that in the GRC, but even in what we put out there in our DRP filing last year and the materials that Jim was referencing earlier in our business update, if you take a look at the categories of spend there.","It is fairly foundational. It is upgrading circuits, some of our older circuits that are lower voltage and need to be brought up to more modern standards in order to accommodate distributed energy resources.","It is also technology side things around our field area network, communications infrastructure to have enough bandwidth to handle the new devices out there. I think that will hopefully provide a little narrower range in terms of the direction, but you\u2019re right that priorities change through DRP or the policy filings that ultimately gets reflected in the GRC\u2019s.","Jim Scilacci","Mike, related to this, and Ted mentioned this in his comments, is the memorandum account that we just recently filed. We want to spend some capital and O&M dollars, especially next year.","It is really hard to step up in a material way to ramp up a program, and you need to do it in steps. That is what that memorandum account is really designed to do, to get us going and then give us a running start into the 2018 GRC period.","That is an important milestone. What the commission does with that will be an important thing for our GRC.","Michael Weinstein","Understood. Thank you.","Ted Craver","We probably have time for one more quick question.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.","Paul Patterson","Hi. Can you hear me?","Jim Scilacci","Yes, Paul.","Paul Patterson","Congratulations on the retirement.","Jim Scilacci","Thank you, very much.","Paul Patterson","Just really quickly, most of my questions have been answered, but what actually triggered this one-timer, or it seems like a one-timer, this incentive payment, and if you could elaborate a little bit more on that and this sentence about solar sales declining or revenues declining and calls going up? Why isn\u2019t it a one-timer? Why is it non-core?","Jim Scilacci","We are going to give Ron Litzinger, the present of Edison Energy to give you a sense of what the background was, and I will pick up the core versus non-core.","Ron Litzinger","Really, it was to make sure that all of the acquired companies are incentivized around the earnings or the EBITDA for the entire Edison Energy enterprise, and when we did the acquisitions, we did not have a long-term incentive plan established.","We now have that based on Edison energy earnings in total, and we felt it was best where there were individual earnout\u2019s that were aligned around goals of the earnings for that entity only. It did not line up with our broader integrated and cross-selling model. We felt it best to transition everyone to the Edison Energy long-term incentive program and get out of the earnout.","Jim Scilacci","Thanks, Ron.","On the broader question of core versus non-core, given the size of this, there is a number of items that we have during any year where there are questions whether if it is recurring or non-recurring. We would just rather keep it in core and identify it. If it is large, discrete, or if you sell a business or when we shut down SONGS, those things are clearly in our view, non-core. These ones are, we just prefer to keep them in core and identify them as such.","Paul Patterson","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Jim Scilacci","Okay, Paul.","Operator","Thank you. That was the last question. I will now turn the call back to Edison International.","Ted Craver","This is Ted and I am going to pick up from here. Obviously, you know this is my last earnings call with Edison, and I just ask you to indulge me while I make a few closing comments.","First, it has been a true honor to be the CEO of Edison International. This company has been an essential part of the economic fabric of this region for 130 years during which we provided the most essential of goods for modern society to function and prosper that is electricity. To have been a part of this great company is truly humbling.","I am exceptionally proud of what this management team and our employees have accomplished these last years. I am sincerely grateful for the wisdom, advice, counsel of our Board of Directors that they have provided. I particularly want to single out Jim Scilacci just because it is so much fun. For a huge thank you.","He, above all, will tell me like it is. He will tell me what I must hear, not what I might like to hear. He does it with such glee. He has been a great friend and a great colleague so thank you, Jim. I believe we have crafted a strong strategy for success and value creation here at Edison. We have overcome many obstacles. You might say we are still getting our trailing leg over a couple of hurdles yet. We have repositioned SCE to be a wires-focused electric utility in sync with and essential to California\u2019s low carbon policy objectives.","Edison energy has the potential to create a new business model, concentrating mostly on commercial and industrial customers and grit edge customer focused energy services. We continue to gain confidence that both Edison Energy and SCE are pioneers in their respective business. We may even look back one day and conclude that both were disruptors of a sort.","I am unabashedly bullish on this company\u2019s strategy and its prospects. But a good strategy does not stand alone. It must have exceptional execution and leadership to be successful. That is why I am so excited by the new leadership team who will be taking the reins in a couple of months. In my opinion, Pedro is an exceptional leader. He understands our business and our industry well and has the skills, the attitude, and the discipline to navigate our complex environment.","I look forward to Pedro, along with Kevin Payne and Ron Nichols at SCE, Ron Litzinger at Edison Energy, Maria Rigatti as the CFO and the rest of the senior leadership team taking this great company to the next level of performance. I am confident that they can.","Finally, it has been a real pleasure working with many of you as investors in Edison International. We have many stakeholders in this business, but investors are certainly one of the most important.","We provide society with an essential service, but none of our investment in critical infrastructure is possible without the capital that you provide. I hope you feel we have rewarded your faith and confidence in us with superior performance and attractive returns.","I will speak for Jim and myself here by saying we look forward to participating in future earnings calls as interested parties and investors, but in listen-only mode. Many thanks to all of you both around this table here as well as you on the phone.

My name is Ted and I will be your operator today. [Operator Instructions]. Today's call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Sam Ramraj, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Ramraj, you may begin your conference.","Sam Ramraj","Thank you, Ted. And welcome, everyone. Our speakers today are President and Chief Executive Officer, Pedro Pizarro, and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Maria Rigatti. Also here are other members of the management team.","Materials supporting today's call are available at www.edisoninvestor.com. These include our Form 10-Q, prepared remarks from Pedro and Maria and the teleconference presentation. Tomorrow, we will distribute our regular business update presentation.","During this call, we will make forward-looking statements about the outlook for Edison International and its subsidiaries. Actual results could differ materially from current expectations. Important factors that could cause different results are set forth in our SEC filings. Please read these carefully.","The presentation includes certain outlook assumptions as well as reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the nearest GAAP measure.","During the question-and-answer session, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up.","I will now turn the call over to Pedro.","Pedro Pizarro","Thank you, Sam, and good afternoon, everyone. Let me start with a sentiment that we are sadly feeling all too often here in California. Our hearts go out to our customers and community members, and our fellow Californians across the rest of our state, who have lost loved ones, homes, and property, have been evacuated, and have otherwise been impacted by devastating wildfires.","I will once again dedicate a significant part of my comments to how we are managing wildfire risks after I touch on our financial performance.","Today, Edison International reported third quarter core earnings of $1.50 per share, which was $0.06 below the same period last year. The decrease in core earnings was primarily due to higher O&M expense and share count dilution. These were partially offset by higher revenue from FERC as a result of the pending settlement of the 2018 formula rate case.","As I have mentioned before, year-over-year comparisons are not particularly meaningful due to the timing of the adoption of the 2018 general rate case final decision. Maria will discuss our financial performance in more detail during her remarks.","Since we last spoke to you on our second quarter earnings call, SCE filed its 2021 GRC application in late August, the 2019 California legislative session ended in September, and California's peak wildfire season has begun.","Much of the State has experienced \"red flag\" conditions \u2013 high heat, very low humidity, and strong winds \u2013 requiring proactive de-energization using public safety power shutoffs, or PSPS.","On state legislative matters, a number of wildfire-related bills were enacted into law in addition to AB 1054, that improve California's prevention, mitigation, and response efforts. These bills span a wide range of issues including vegetation management, community resiliency, and CPUC safety regulation, reflecting California's comprehensive approach to wildfire risk prevention and management.","At the same time, Edison has been implementing elements of AB 1054. On our last earnings call, we noted that SCE received its initial safety certification from the CPUC. ","Since then, SCE made our initial wildfire fund contribution of $2.4 billion on September 9th. SCE will contribute approximately $95 million to the fund on January 1 of each year for 10 years.","Last week, the CPUC approved continuation of a Department of Water Resources non-bypassable charge, which will be used to fund customer contributions to the wildfire fund. These actions have satisfied several important legislative conditions to establish the statewide wildfire fund created by AB 1054.","We are in the peak fire season, and the backdrop for SCE's operational efforts continues to be severe weather conditions. This follows a wet winter that led to a build-up of fuels. Such conditions elevate the wildfire threat in the state's high fire risk areas. Our number one priority continues to be the safety of the public, our customers, employees, and first responders.","Since July and increasingly in the last several weeks, we have exercised our PSPS protocols to reduce the possibility that our system will be the cause of an ignition.","We recognize that PSPS is a disruptive hardship, and we strive to minimize the impact on our customers and communities. We do not take this action lightly, but it is necessary to protect Californians from catastrophic wildfires. ","In fact, patrols conducted after PSPS events have found several instances of equipment damage and tree branches contacting power lines which could have ignited a fire. ","We will continue to harden our system to minimize the need for these safety power shutoffs, but expect to utilize PSPS as we continue to enhance our system against wildfire threats. ","We have invested over the past several years in sectionalizing many of our distribution circuits in HFRAs using switches and reclosers to increase the number of isolation points. SCE has an average of 4 remotely operated sectionalizing switches for each HFRA circuit. ","This, along with our work on weather stations, weather modeling, and more granular risk models at a circuit and sub-circuit level, have all enabled us to be more targeted in the application of PSPS.","We monitor each threatened circuit so that we can make the ultimate decision to deenergize individual sections \u2013 or not \u2013 based on a combination of real-time conditions and short-term forecasts. We will continue to invest in more isolation points, further situational awareness, and more advanced computing power to provide even more granular analysis of our HFRAs, which will have the twin benefits of continuing to reduce the number of customers impacted during PSPS events and sharpening our risk-informed deployment of grid-hardening investments.","We follow the CPUC's PSPS protocol, which requires investor-owned utilities to notify customers in advance of a potential de-energization. Our PSPS process follows this protocol with 72-hour notifications to California's Office of Emergency Services, or Cal OES, the CPUC, affected county governments, and essential service providers.","We then provide 48-hour, 24-hour, and imminent de-energization notifications to customers and communities whenever possible.","Unfortunately, there are certain occasions when rapidly changing and volatile weather conditions pose an immediate threat to public safety and do not allow us to provide sufficient advance notification.","I want to acknowledge the comments made by Governor Newsom and his concerns that customer impacts, particularly impacts to the state's vulnerable populations, be considered when PSPS events are necessary.","We are engaged with the governor's Office, Cal OES and the CPUC on further improvements to the PSPS process, with the goal of limiting impacts to customers and providing effective, timely notifications.","SCE remains focused on implementing the mitigation activities outlined in its Wildfire Mitigation Plan and the Grid Safety and Resiliency Program. We continue to improve our situational awareness through the deployment of approximately 470 weather stations to monitor temperature, wind speeds, and humidity levels, and more than 130 high-definition cameras to more quickly detect fire ignitions.","Our sophisticated weather modeling and fire potential forecasting capabilities are also advancing to better assess fire threat. These, along with our prior work to sectionalize distribution circuits, have enabled us to limit the scope of de-energizations to minimize the number of customers affected.","Our work also includes having installed approximately 300 circuit miles of covered conductor, and fast acting fuses at more than 10,000 new locations. We understand the importance of hardening our grid today and in the future as electrification of the economy continues and customers rely even more on the grid.","A number of recent wildfires in Southern California have garnered attention and, while evaluations are continuing, I would like to briefly comment on a few of these fires.","First, we filed an Electric Safety Incident Report, or ESIR, related to the Saddle Ridge fire. We filed this in an abundance of caution because SCE had an event on its system close in time to the start of the fire. We will file a more detailed report \u2013 a 315 report \u2013 next week that will also be posted to our investor website.","We did not file an ESIR related to the Tick fire. Fire authorities have identified an incident location, but not yet a point of origin. An SCE distribution line near the incident location had been de-energized several hours prior to the reported start of the fire.","SCE's PSPS protocols did not trigger de-energization of an SCE transmission line about a quarter mile from the incident location, and this line did not register any events prior to the reported start of the fire.","Finally, yesterday, a fire began in the vicinity of the Getty Museum in Los Angeles. Local media has reported that fire authorities have identified a point of origin. This is not an official determination by the Los Angeles Fire Department, but this is in the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power's service territory and the closest SCE facilities are over 3 miles away.","I would like to give an update on the Woolsey Fire. Parties to the Woolsey litigation, including SCE, received a non-final redacted draft of an investigation report from the Ventura County Fire Department stating that electrical equipment owned and operated by SCE was the cause of the Woolsey Fire.","The report is subject to the court's protective order and, other than what we are disclosing to you today, we are not authorized to release the report, or its contents, to the public at this time.","Absent additional evidence, SCE believes it is likely that its equipment was associated with the ignition of the Woolsey Fire. Final determination of legal causation and liability would only be made during lengthy and complex litigation.","You will recall that in the fourth quarter of 2018, we accrued an after-tax charge to earnings of $1.8 billion in connection with the 2017 and 2018 wildfire and mudslide events. This corresponds to the lower end of the reasonably estimated range of expected potential losses. We have determined that no change to the reserve is needed at this time, although it is subject to change as additional information becomes available.","EIX and SCE are also aware of separate ongoing investigations of the Thomas Fire and the Woolsey Fire by the California Attorney General's Office for the purpose of determining whether any criminal violations have occurred. SCE is not aware of any basis for felony liability with regard to these fires.","Moving now to SCE's next GRC, the application we filed on August 30th for the three-year period 2021 to 2023 requests a test-year revenue requirement of $7.6 billion, an increase of approximately 13% above presently authorized rates.","We do not take the size of this request lightly, following a three-decade period over which SCE kept its average rate growth below local inflation. This funding request strikes a balance across SCE's core work of improving the reliability and security of electric service, helping California meet its clean energy goals, and reducing the risk of catastrophic wildfires.","Regarding the 2020 Cost of Capital Application, SCE currently expects a proposed decision in late November. Maria will discuss more on SCE's GRC and cost of capital filings later in her remarks.","Turning briefly to Edison Energy and our outlook for this business, two years ago, we set targets for a breakeven earnings run rate by the end of this year, as well as customer capture goals. The business has succeeded in capturing sales while managing costs and will be close to its year-end breakeven target.","Edison Energy has a number of high-quality clients, including 12 of the Fortune 50, several of whom have used its broader managed portfolio solutions to reduce the client's overall energy risk, although not as many clients as we originally targeted.","However, we continue to see strong and growing client interest, and we are gaining insights from our work for these customers that we see as increasingly relevant to our clean energy, electrification and sustainability efforts, and that will help inform our core strategies.","While we do not anticipate making significant investments in Edison Energy, we will be providing limited support for this business to fund growth in key areas such as technology, renewables, and fleet and building electrification.","We expect the ongoing financial impact of this business to be immaterial for the foreseeable future. The business has a strong leadership team within it, requiring very limited focus from the EIX holding company team.","Turning back to California, it is clear that our state is experiencing more extreme weather days, accompanied by a significant risk of PSPS events and wildfires, and that is due to a large degree to climate change.","While SCE is primarily focused on its near-term actions to keep our customers and communities safe, we must also engage with state policymakers on needed longer-term solutions.","Adaptation to climate change must begin in earnest, which SCE is doing in part with our grid hardening, situational awareness and operational changes, but we must act on longer-term solutions as well.","California has an urgent need for immediate actions to mitigate further climate change damage. The state has established clear greenhouse gas reduction targets, but much detail and hard work remain needed to ensure successful implementation.","To support California's efforts, SCE released our Clean Power and Electrification Pathway white paper two years ago, which focused on the clean energy transition to 2030.","We have continued this important work with a longer-term view to 2045, and SCE will release soon a new white paper, which we call Pathway 2045, outlining our blueprint for how California can meet its ambitious goals for reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 2045.","Pathway 2045 analyzes the implications of California's long-term goal of achieving carbon neutrality through three pillars. These include deep decarbonization of the electric sector; significant electrification of transportation and buildings, along with a continued focus on energy efficiency; and use of low carbon fuels for sectors that are hard to electrify.","We believe that the changes required across California's economy will be profound. Three quarters of light-duty vehicles, two-thirds of medium-duty vehicles and one-third of heavy-duty vehicles will need to be electric by 2045. In addition, nearly 70% of building, space and water heating will need to be electric by 2045.","This greater reliance on electricity will result in a 60% increase in grid-served electricity load and will require approximately 110 gigawatts of additional clean generation and storage by 2045.","Significant grid investment will be required to integrate this new renewable generation and storage capacity, and serve the substantial load growth associated with transportation and building electrification.","While electricity bills will increase over time, the overall cost across all types of energy for an average household should decrease by one-third by 2045, due to the inherently greater efficiency of electric technologies over fossil fuel combustion machines.","The increased dependence on electricity underscores the need for the state to ensure the grid is resilient and its utilities are financially healthy. While the state's goals and, therefore, our approach look 25 years in the future, we intend for our paper to support near-term actions in policy areas including clean power supply, reliable and resilient systems, customer technology adoption, technology development, and affordability.","In closing, I would like to reiterate that we continue to make progress on our long-term strategy, while at the same time addressing the immediate wildfire challenge.","We will move forward with our vision for a sustainable and clean energy future, transportation electrification and digital transformation, while continuing to focus on operational excellence and maintaining the recent, hard-earned gains we have achieved in reliability and customer satisfaction.","With that, let me turn it over to Maria for her financial report.","Maria Rigatti","Thank you, Pedro. And good afternoon, everyone. My comments today will cover third quarter results for 2019 compared to the same period a year ago, plus comments on our 2021 general rate case and other financial updates for SCE and EIX. ","As we have said, year-over-year comparisons are less meaningful given the timing of the 2018 GRC decision.","Please turn to page 3. For the third quarter 2019, Edison International reported core earnings of $1.50 per share, which was $0.06 lower than the same period last year.","From the table on the right-hand side, you will see that SCE had a core EPS variance of negative $0.03 year-over-year. This was primarily due to a negative impact of $0.10 from dilution from the equity offering in July 2019. This was partially offset by $0.07 of higher EPS from SCE core activities.","There are a few items that accounted for the majority of this impact. Higher revenues had a positive variance of $0.12. This was primarily driven by $0.10 of higher FERC revenues related to the settlement of SCE's 2018 formula rate proceeding. The settlement, which is pending approval, results in an all-in ROE of 11.2%.","Other FERC revenues were $0.04 higher due to higher operating expenses under the FERC formula rate mechanism. CPUC revenues had a negative impact of $0.02 which was largely due to an increase in flow-through tax benefits, which were partially offset by higher GRC revenue.","Higher O&M expenses impacted year-over-year EPS by negative $0.21 and were largely driven by higher wildfire mitigation expenses. O&M costs related to wildfire mitigation in high fire risk areas are being tracked in memo accounts and deferred, pending completion of various regulatory proceedings.","We are also experiencing higher costs due to contractor scarcity and an increased inspection and preventative maintenance program in areas adjacent to designated high fire risk areas.","We will continue to track the cost impacts to support recovery requests in the future, although we have not established a regulatory asset for certain of these costs.","Lower income taxes of $0.19 primarily reflect benefits that are passed back to customers and are offset in revenues, as I mentioned. Higher net financing costs due to increased borrowings had a negative EPS impact of $0.04.","For the quarter, EIX Parent and Other had a negative $.03 core earnings variance. This was mainly due to the impact of $0.05 from higher interest expense related to increased borrowings, partially offset by better operating performance at Edison Energy.","Following our election to join the Wildfire Fund, we analyzed the appropriate accounting treatment for our initial and subsequent annual contributions. As we've discussed in the past, there are multiple aspects of AB 1054 that provide support and value.","These include the changes to the application of the prudency and cost recovery standards, as well as access to the fund for amounts above commercial insurance and the liability cap.","Although there is no specific authoritative guidance on how to account for this, our conclusion is that contributions will be treated in a manner similar to pre-paid insurance. This means that we have recorded an asset to reflect the initial and ongoing contributions to the fund and we will expense it ratably over the course of an estimated fund life.","Based on a number of assumptions, including recent wildfire activity, we estimate the life to be 10 years. We will periodically assess that 10-year life based on future utilization of the fund, as well as the impact of the extensive wildfire mitigation activity that is currently underway.","Since our wildfire fund contributions relate to a change in law and are not tied to our ongoing operational decisions, we are classifying this expense as a non-core item. As a result, during the quarter, SCE's non-core earnings were impacted by $48 million after tax, or $0.16 per share, for amortization of SCE's contributions to the wildfire fund.","Please turn to page 4. For the first nine months of the year, Edison International core earnings per share increased $0.52 to $3.73 per share. This includes an increase of $0.54 in core earnings at SCE, offset by a decrease of $0.02 at EIX Parent and Other.","SCE's year-to-date earnings analysis is largely consistent with third quarter results, except for two items which had an impact in the second quarter.","You will recall that when the 2018 GRC final decision was received, SCE recorded the retroactive 2018 impact of $0. 20. Further, higher 2019 revenues had a positive impact of $0.55, which includes $0.32 resulting from the GRC decision and $0.13 at FERC from higher operating expenses and rate base.","Before we turn to a discussion of our 2021 general rate case, capital spending and rate base, I'd like to note two pending applications seeking cost recovery of wildfire-related expenses.","The Catastrophic Event Memo Account application seeks cost recovery of $139 million for system restoration following declared emergencies related to the 2017 wildfires and 2017 and 2018 drought impacts.","The Wildfire Expense Memo Account application seeks recovery of approximately $505 million for incremental wildfire insurance costs covering the period April 2018 to July 2020.","We also are waiting for CPUC approval of the Grid Safety and Resiliency Program settlement that was filed on July 31st to establish a capital and cost recovery framework for the 2018 to 2020 wildfire risk improvements.","Please turn to page 5. On August 30th, SCE filed its 2021 general rate case application for the three-year period 2021 through 2023. The critical drivers of SCE's 2021 GRC request include the infrastructure and programs necessary to implement California's ambitious public policy goals, including wildfire mitigation, de-carbonization of the economy through electrification and integration of distributed energy resources across a rapidly modernizing grid. We will do this while continuing to provide safe, reliable, and affordable service to our customers.","We acknowledge that the revenue requirement increase in the 2021 GRC application is larger than it has been in the past. This is due in large part to the pressing need for SCE to undertake extraordinary measures to reduce wildfire risk.","The proposed increase is also driven by spending previously authorized in SCE's 2018 GRC and placed into service in 2019 and 2020, and SCE's 2021 GRC depreciation study proposal.","SCE is requesting the CPUC authorize the test year 2021 revenue requirement of $7.601 billion. This is an increase of $1.155 billion over the 2020 revenue requirement authorized in the 2018 GRC, as that isn't updated for anticipated post-test-year ratemaking changes. This represents a 12.7% increase over presently authorized 2020 total rates. SCE's 2021 GRC request also includes proposed revenue requirement increases of $400 million in 2022 and $531 million in 2023.","SCE is requesting that the CPUC issue a final decision by the end of 2020. A pre-hearing conference for the GRC proceeding is scheduled for tomorrow. A scoping memo, including a schedule for the proceeding, will be issued after that.","On page 6, SCE is forecasting a $23.8 billion to $25.6 billion total capital program from 2019 through 2023. This includes CPUC jurisdictional GRC capital expenditures, certain non-GRC CPUC capital spending and FERC capital spending.","Please turn to page 7 for SCE's rate base forecast. At the capital expenditure levels requested in the 2021 GRC, total weighted-average CPUC and FERC jurisdictional rate base will increase to $40.8 billion by 2023. This represents a six-year compound annual growth rate of 7.7%.","The low end of the range of 6.9% reflects a 10% reduction in the 2021 through 2023 total capital forecast, based on management judgement incorporating historical experience of previously authorized amounts, potential for permitting delays and other operational considerations.","For 2020, the low end of the range reflects a 10% reduction applied to FERC capital spending and non-GRC programs. The rate base forecast excludes approximately $1.6 billion of wildfire risk mitigation capital spend that will not earn an equity return as detailed in AB 1054.","Page 8 highlights total wildfire related capital spend between 2019 and 2023.","On page 9, you will see our key financial assumptions and EIX core EPS guidance for 2019. Our revised EPS guidance range for 2019 is $4.70 to $4.90 per share with a midpoint of $4.80. This is $0.09 higher than our previous midpoint guidance of $4.71. The change in guidance is largely driven by the 2018 FERC settlement, offset by increased share dilution.","You may recall that, in our second quarter guidance, we made some simplifying assumptions regarding the timing of the various elements of the 2019 financing plan and we have now adjusted those assumptions to incorporate the actual debt and equity issuances during the third quarter.","There are a few highlights on this page to point out. The pending settlement of SCE's 2018 FERC formula rate proceeding has a positive EPS impact of $0.15 in 2019. There are two components to this. The prior year true-up is $0.09 of the $0.15 and is called out in the center of the chart. The balance, or $0.06 cents, that relates to 2019, is included in the bar that captures rate base earnings for the current year.","For EIX Parent and Other, we expect an earnings drag of $0.30 to $0.35 per share. This includes approximately $0.01 per share per month related to EIX operating expenses.","Our guidance includes Edison Energy achieving close to its year-end breakeven earnings run rate target as Pedro noted.","Additionally, we expect a total of $0.24 of EPS dilution from the 2019 financing plan which I mentioned previously.","Let me provide an update on our 2019 FERC formula rate case which we filed in April of this year. In September, SCE modified its request with the FERC for its 2019 transmission rate case to reflect a reduction in the base ROE from 17.12% to 11.97%. ","This reflects a reduction in our estimate of wildfire risk following the passage of AB 1054, from 600 basis points to 85 basis points. This reduction is consistent with a similar decrease filed in our CPUC Cost of Capital proceeding. The settlement effectively modifies our base ROE request, but no other aspect of the proceeding is impacted. We are still in settlement discussions.","I would now like to give you an update on our 2019 financing plan. On our last earnings call, we outlined EIX's 2019 equity and debt needs. Overall, the plan included $1 billion of holding company debt and $1.5 billion of common equity to fund SCE's requirement related to the requested increase in the CPUC-authorized equity layer and additional growth investment at the utility.","We identified an additional $1.2 billion equity need which would be contributed to SCE to finance 50% of its initial contribution to the wildfire fund established by AB 1054. SCE planned on issuing operating company debt to finance the remaining 50% of the initial contribution.","Through the end of the third quarter, we completed a substantial portion of this plan. We raised $2.2 billion in EIX equity through the issuance of 32.2 million shares in July, relative to a total identified need of $2.7 billion. We will opportunistically use our ATM program to supplement our internal equity programs over the rest of the year.","Under the holding company debt financing plan, we issued $600 million of the planned $1 billion debt need. We plan to issue the remaining $400 million in the fourth quarter and will continue to assess opportunities given the low interest rate environment.","As we look into funding needs beyond 2019 to support SCE's operations, we remain focused on a balanced financing approach that maintains a healthy balance sheet and promotes investment grade ratings at both SCE and EIX. Our balanced approach provides us the flexibility to use a combination of debt and equity.","We believe this is the most effective way to support operations and capital investments in the near future as we resolve the business risks driven by the wildfire challenges we face.","That concludes our remarks. ","Sam Ramraj","Ted, please open the call for questions. As a reminder, we request you to limit yourself to one question and one follow-up, so that everyone in line has the opportunity to ask questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. The first question in the queue is from Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","Pedro Pizarro","Hello, Greg.","Gregory Gordon","Thanks. Good afternoon and best of luck to you and the communities you serve in getting through the fire season without any further hardship.","Pedro Pizarro","Thank you, Greg.","Maria Rigatti","Thanks, Greg.","Gregory Gordon","Can you remind us where we stand in terms of your position on the cause or causes or ignition points and disputes around ignition points as it relates to the Thomas Fire, please?","Maria Rigatti","Sure. Greg. If you recall, it's actually [indiscernible] CAL FIRE have issued a report on that fire. At one point, there's two ignition points they've identified as have we. The Koenigstein Road point is the ignition point that we had said in the third quarter. Our equipment was involved in that, and the report that came out from the fire authorities is consistent with that position. ","In the second report, which was a second ignition point, they've also identified or have alleged that our equipment was involved in that second ignition point. We do not agree with that. There is publicly available radar evidence that shows smoke at least 10 minutes or 12 minutes before there were any anomalies on our system, and so that's an ongoing point of \u2013 or discrepancy between our position and theirs.","Pedro Pizarro","And, Greg, and I might just add, and I think we pointed this out in the Q, no metal fragments were found in the investigation report. So, some of the evidence you would typically look for just seems to be absent. There is no appeals process or anything like that for CAL FIRE reports, and so really ultimate liability will be sorted out through the litigation process.","Gregory Gordon","Right. And then, now that we're \u2013 I know you gave us the information that you're able to on the Woolsey Fire. Can you just update us on the process for going through settlement or \u2013 litigation and\/or potential settlement, so that we can get a sense of whether the charge that you have taken will wind up being a reasonable estimate of potential liability. What's the sort of critical path to resolution of this?","Pedro Pizarro","So, let me give you a really broad-brush answer and our General Counsel could always fill in more details on process as needed, although there might be more detail than you want. But I think the headline on this, it's a very complex process. Many plaintiffs, many individual lawsuits, different classes of plaintiffs across subrogation, individual parties, governmental entities, et cetera.","The cases have been consolidated under a judge, and there is a process for the formal court steps around discovery and the initial handling of what are called bellwether cases that start to lay out the facts of the case.","In parallel, there is always the possibility for discussions among parties across all these different classes of plaintiffs for potentially settlement sort of approaches. We're not in a position today to comment on those, but that is certainly a pathway that you've seen happen in a number of other cases.","As we proceed with the case, we'll continue to do checkpoints on what information are we getting, is there additional discovery, is there other information that changes our view on the low end of the estimable range and that could lead to adjustments to the reserve we've taken already.","As I noted, with the redacted reports that we received that have been sealed on Woolsey in particular, after viewing what we could view \u2013 obviously, we couldn't view the redacted parts \u2013 but there was nothing that we saw there that led us to determine that we needed to make a change to the reserve at this point.","Greg, is that enough or do you need more detail on process steps, that kind of thing?","Gregory Gordon","Yeah. I think investors, if you could, would just like to know \u2013 like, remind us what the timing is if we go down the litigation path to getting a resolution in lieu of a settlement.","Pedro Pizarro","So, Adam, can give you some \u2013 Adam Umanoff, our General Counsel, can give you some dates in terms of dates set by the court for the litigation process. I don't think that we can give you anything concrete in terms of the possibility of what timing will be for settlement, but, Adam, let me turn it to you.","Adam Umanoff","Thanks, Pedro. In Woolsey, the court has set a July 2020 date for what's known as a bellwether trial. And these are sample jury trials that are conducted to see how the jurors will respond to evidence and the arguments in the case. So, that obviously is months from now. Between now and then, we continue to be engaged in discovery, both us and the plaintiffs.","As far as settlement is concerned, as Pedro noted, we really can't comment on prospects. But in complex litigation like this, it's not uncommon, of course, for parties to enter into settlement negotiations.","Gregory Gordon","Got you. Thank you. A lot more questions, but other people I'm sure behind me. So, thank you. I'll hop off. Bye.","Pedro Pizarro","Okay. Thanks a lot, Greg.","Operator","Next question is from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.","Pedro Pizarro","Hello, Steve.","Steven Fleishman","Hi. Just one other question on Woolsey. Were there any violations found in the report at least that's un-redacted?","Pedro Pizarro","We can't comment on what's in the report beyond what we said already because of the court seal on it. So, sorry, we just can't give any more insight. However, we continue to state, as I did in my script remarks, that we see no basis for felony liability.","Steven Fleishman","Okay. And, I guess to the degree you found something in there, you just can't comment, in theory, you could have changed your reserve based on it?","Pedro Pizarro","Yeah. That's correct, Steve. Let me put it maybe more affirmatively. If we had seen something that we thought was a significant, compelling information that we didn't have before and that we thought changed the low end of the estimable range, we would have done that.","Steven Fleishman","Okay. And then, just on managing your system through these difficult periods, you mentioned some of the things you've done to be able to more surgically deal with power shutoffs. The one question I have is that it appears, possibly in Saddleridge and also in Kincade up north, that the issue came from a transmission line, not a distribution line. So, could you maybe talk a little bit about just the difficulty of managing this process with transmission lines?","Pedro Pizarro","Sure. Let me start by saying that we managed this for both transmission and distribution lines. I think the history we've seen of ignitions in the past is that the vast majority of ignitions, connected to utility equipment, have been on the distribution system.","In terms of the process we follow, the overall process, I think, is similar. We have a mapping of our high fire risk areas. We have risk models around the potential for impacts in those areas. We have a mapping of our distribution and transmission circuits and then we have criteria around things like wind speed and humidity and fuel content, right? How much vegetation is around the ground that could turn into fuel, for example. So, those all form baseline criteria.","As we then apply those to distribution versus transmission equipment, the difference is that typically transmission towers and that equipment is just a lot more robust, typically has broader clearances around it, and so you will typically see, for example, higher wind speed thresholds applied to transmission lines than you will see to distribution line just because there is a lot more mass to move up there and it's just a lot more robust in that sense.","Beyond that, obviously, if you take out a transmission section through PSPS, there is a likelihood that that will have a greater impact in terms of number of customers that are de-energized. Fortunately, I think with our system and with our topology, the area that we serve, we have seen much more PSPS activity on the distribution system than transmission, although we've seen some on transmission. And then, with the distribution system, as I mentioned in my earlier remarks, one of the benefits there is that because we had been investing for a few years now in dividing up circuits, adding switches and reclosers to sectionalize them \u2013 I think I mentioned an average of four isolation points per circuit in our HFRA, or high fire risk areas \u2013 that allows us to more finely tune what portions could be energized as we get closer to the event.","So, rather than just do a broad-brush of the distribution circuit level, we can actually \u2013 if we determine that it's safe to leave part A of a circuit up, but we need to take parts B through D off, then we'll do that.","The final thing I'll mention that \u2013 maybe a little more detail than I said in my remarks, when we set our forecast, so I mentioned the 72-hour notification to agencies, followed by the 48-hour notification to customers, et cetera, that's all based on forecast. We do not de-energize based on that 48-hour forecast, right, because if we did that, I think there will be a much broader set of customers likely who will be de-energized. We continue to monitor conditions through our telemetry, our instruments as well as observations on the ground, all the way down to the moment when we de-energize and that allows us to be a little more tailored in our ability to manage the risks here. If we see a need to de-energize, you can be fully confident that we will de-energize. But if we see that there isn't a need, then it's good when we can relieve those customers of that impact.","Steven Fleishman","Okay. Thank you very much. I'll let other people ask questions. Appreciate it.","Operator","Next question is from Praful Mehta. Your line is now open. From Citigroup.","Pedro Pizarro","Hi, Praful.","Praful Mehta","Hi, Pedro. Again, hope everybody is coming through this relatively well, given it's a tough season. But just wanted to touch first on the charge itself, the $1.8 billion charge. So, that is a combination to confirm both of the Woolsey and the Thomas, correct?","Pedro Pizarro","I think the words I used were 2017 and 2018 fires, which is Woolsey and Thomas as well as the mud slides.","Praful Mehta","I got you. Okay. So, now just stepping back to more big picture question, given what's happening right now in California and the fact that PSPS itself isn't working as well as people had hoped, at least some had hoped, do you think AB 1054 right now works? Is it sufficient? Is the wildfire fund sufficient? Or do you think more needs to be done on the legislative side or the operational side to kind of deal with all of this that's happening right now in California?","Pedro Pizarro","Yeah. That's a great question. I think my snap answer with a little more detail to come, as usual for me, is that the AB 1054 framework is a solid framework, right? I mentioned in a prior call, it probably doesn't have everything we would have desired, but it was a compromise and, on balance, we think it was a good workable compromise.","So, our focus now is primarily on the implementation of AB 1054, a lot of pieces that have to fall into place. As I mentioned in my remarks, we've seen a number of those already take place that have activated the wildfire fund. But there's more work ahead, including fully staffing out the wildfire safety division and wildfire advisory board and some of the other bodies that were specified in AB 1054.","In terms of the size of the fund, I think investors and analysts and we have all identified all along that one of the features of the fund or the legislation was it did not set up a replenishment mechanism. And I know that's been a big focus for everyone. Assuming the PG&E is able to successfully emerge from bankruptcy by June 30th of next year, the size of the fund will be $21 billion, which the analysis from some of the state entities involved with the legislation suggested that that had something like a 94% confidence of surviving for a 10-year period. And in kind of rough numbers, it would cover something like $45 billion worth of gross damages.","So, that means that there is durability for some period which \u2013 but if you go by that analysis, then probabilistically speaking, the high confidence that would last for at least 10 years, and then that would provide time for all of us to continue to harden our systems. ","Clearly, if there were catastrophic fires that depleted the fund, then I think the state would need to do more work legislatively to figure out how to replenish the fund. Beyond that, I think we've acknowledged there might be additional modifications needed to AB 1054. We don't have any to point out at this point. Just going to leave that open as a possibility as we get deeper into implementation steps and how well the mechanics work.","Praful Mehta","That's super helpful. Thanks for that, Pedro. And then, just a quick follow-up on the answer, which is PG&E's exit in time and its participation in the fund, obviously, now is a little bit at risk given everything that's happening from a wildfire and the bankruptcy process perspective. ","Pedro Pizarro","Right.","Praful Mehta","So, from your view, if PG&E wasn't able to exit in time and not able to participate in the fund, does that worry you in terms of the size of the fund or do you think it is still a sustainable solution?","Pedro Pizarro","I think the broad-brush answer is that if PG&E were not to participate, then, clearly, the fund would not have that portion of the contributions, but it also would not have the risk of a 70,000 square mile utility with a lot of high fire risk territory.","So, I'm not sure I have enough of a crystal ball to tell you whether the math ends up being a little positive or a little negative on that, but I think it's important to acknowledge that with the lack of participation also comes decrease amount of risk being covered by the fund.","Praful Mehta","All right. Well, thank you so much. I'll go back in queue.","Pedro Pizarro","You bet, Praful.","Operator","Next question is from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Pedro Pizarro","Hi, Julien.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Hey. Good afternoon. Hope everyone is hanging in there. Just wanted to follow-up a little bit on some of the questions or rather some of the commentary from the Governor's office around wildfire mitigation efforts. Obviously, you guys are doing a lot already. Sounds as if the state is really willing to kick it up in terms of efforts and commitment. How do you think about further acceleration in both OpEx and CapEx and infrastructure and especially some of the technology in undergrounding, specifically, that the Governor has mentioned off late?","Pedro Pizarro","Yeah. There's a lot there. But I'll start by saying that, as you heard from both Maria and my remarks, we're doing a lot. We're doing a lot right now in terms of our hardening. We've also proposed a lot, and that in part is driving the size of the general rate case request that SCE submitted.","We also continue to learn all along here, right? And so, I would expect that, a year from now, two years from now, three years from now, there will be new ideas that arise that might allow us to either accelerate what tools we're using or, more importantly, accelerate the pace of risk reduction as we do both capital investment and operational measures.","Picking one part of your question maybe a little more finely, on PSPS and the governor's comments, this is a tough thing for everybody, right? And you have particularly Northern California, such large swaths of customers being de-energized given the conditions up there and the ability of the system in PG&E's territory, that it's tough for customers to work through that. And I think government officials are sorting through the risk balance that would benefit versus \u2013 benefit versus costs and impacts of PSPS.","For our part, one of the things we've really stressed is making sure that we have continued to work on our protocols and invest in training our incident management teams. So, we have a very consistent application of the process, point one.","And as you heard in my detailed remarks, our ability to be more granular at how we assess the potential scope of PSPS, all the way through to, in real-time, who really needs to be de-energized and who doesn't, that's allowed us to be a bit more targeted with that.","Again, make no mistake, if we think that we need to de-energize the circuit for public safety, we will. So, this is not about avoiding public backlash, but it's about only impacting customers who really need to be impacted.","I do expect that, through our discussions with the Governor's office, with Cal OES, with the CPUC, with the new proceeding that the CPUC announced a day or two ago, we will continue to see continuous improvement in learning on how we apply PSPS and some of the other measures.","Did I get everything in your question or did I miss some important part, Julien?","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","No, no, no. That's good enough. Thank you. And then separately, if I could quickly ask, and I just want to kind of broadly affirm this concept, right, now that we have a 20% criteria over three years in terms of eligibility to participate in this fund, I just want to be extra clear about dividend confidence here, right? Because we've had a few seasons already where there has been an open question when you affirm your dividend, there has been some pause in the investment community. I just want to be extra clear-cut with respect to knowing what the downside is today, if you will, in terms of what the deductible is into this fund that, at least as best you see it, to the extent which you were to trigger that threshold, certainly not thus far, but to the extent prospectively, just confidence in being able to continue to pay out the dividend at that point. And maybe that's too much of a statement, but I'm curious how you would take a stab at answering that?","Pedro Pizarro","Sure. Thanks, Julien. Let me answer this way. Maria may have more to add here. First, just to make sure everybody's level set. AB 1054 was very clear about limiting our liability over a three-year period to 20% of their T&D equity rate base. So, for us, it's around $2.6 billion or so. And so, we have high confidence that that \u2013 the law reads very clearly and they will be implemented by the state, so that's that.","And by the way, just remind you that that is attaching above insurance levels. The wildfire fund attaches above our commercial insurance levels, and so we continue to use commercial insurance as the first layer in the event of having unfortunate wildfires.","Beyond that, we continue to work hard to have a strong balance sheet. Frankly, the success of our equity raise earlier this year and our financing activities that Maria covered are all meant to continue to re-strengthen our balance sheet over time.","I can't comment sitting here about future dividends. We always say we never get ahead of our ski tips, but I think we've communicated to investors our overall commitment over the long run to \u2013 we understand the role that dividends play for utility equity investors\/shareholders, and I think maintaining a strengthened balance sheet is a way to give us the flexibility to weather any other issues that we may have with wildfires or other capital needs.","Maria, would you add to that or\u2026?","Maria Rigatti","Julien, I'd just say, you know the dividends here in California, in addition to the retained earnings test, it's an ability \u2013 or likely to meet obligations as they come due after paying the dividend. And I think Pedro is exactly right. Our work\u2026","Pedro Pizarro","She doesn't often say that, by the way. I love this one.","Maria Rigatti","Our ability to maintain a strong balance sheet has helped us in the past to maintain our dividend. We don't get ahead of the board on this, but certainly that strength is something that allows us to continue to say that our dividend payout policy and 45% to 55% payout ratio is one that we know is important to investors and we're keeping that front and center.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Excellent. Thank you, guys.","Pedro Pizarro","Thanks, Julien.","Operator","Next question is from Ali Agha with SunTrust. Your line is now open.","Pedro Pizarro","Hello, Ali.","Ali Agha","Hey. Good afternoon. First question, Pedro, Maria, just again, bigger picture, just on the fire stuff, to be very clear, so far as we know, both for the Thomas, Woolsey fires, there's been no allegation of any violation by Edison. And as a result, is it fair to say that that does put you in a position for cost recovery whenever we reach that stage? Is that clear?","Pedro Pizarro","Yeah. Let me parse it very precisely because this stuff is important. As I recall, these fire investigation reports, the ones you've seen in public typically will have a list of potential section of code that could involve violations, that kind of thing, right? But I think it's fairly standard that they said less in the reports. ","We've also acknowledged that \u2013 our understanding that the Attorney General's Office [indiscernible] for the investigations in both of those fires, Thomas and Woolsey. But as we look at the facts, we continue to see no basis for criminal felony liability. And so, that's not a statement we take lightly and we just don't see a basis for that.","The fine parsing I make is that there is a difference between \u2013 certainly, there is the space of criminal violations, the space of determining legal liability and the space of PUC's determination of prudency. They're related, but they're not the same.","We continue to do our investigations on both of the fires. I don't think we've commented on prudency yet. We have commented on the fact that, prior to AB 1054, there is some question about the \u2013 or uncertainty about CPUC determination of prudency as we saw in the San Diego Gas & Electric case. And so, that's why when we took the $1.8 billion net charge, we did assume recovery from FERC for the FERC jurisdictional portion, but we did not assume recoveries from the CPUC.","That's not to say that we have a basis to say we were imprudent or we were not, we haven't commented on that, we're still doing the homework on that, but it was more about the fact pattern that we saw in the San Diego case up until the point where AB 1054, importantly, reformed the cost recovery standard.","And frankly, I know there's been a lot of focus on the wildfire fund and the liability cap, but, in our view, that redefinition of what prudency is and how the PUC needs to look at that in the context of cost recovery is a very important part of AB 1054.","Ali Agha","Yeah. And in that context, given the kind of reaction your stock took when the recent fire season has started, again, are you confident given the prudency definition and other terms in AB 1054 that knowing what you know about the fire season so far that, on a going forward basis, certainly for the 19 fires, you're not seeing really any big financial implications for your company?","Pedro Pizarro","Again, let me answer it this way, be very thoughtful here. We have not put up on our own any estimates of what the damages might be for the 19 events. I think, as you look through at the overall scale of that and you compare it to our $1 billion net of commercial insurance, $1.2 billion minus around a couple of hundred million of deductibles and co-insurance, certainly, it seems that the scale of the insurance programs we have appears to be larger than the scale of the events we have seen in our area. And so, that's what we see at this point.","Ali Agha","Got you. And one unrelated point, just to be clear. Maria, you talked about the need potentially for both equity and debt funding as you're looking at your 2021 through 2023 cycle of CapEx. Given that there should be some equity presumably there, the old notion that you would lay for us that, 'hey, rate base CAGR is a good proxy for EPS CAGR,' is that no longer to the case? We should assume some dilution between rate base CAGR and EPS CAGR going forward?","Maria Rigatti","Maybe I'll focus on the first part of your question, first. We do see, in the near term, a need to make sure that our balance sheet is as resilient as possible. In the near term, as we work through some of these wildfire issues because, as you know, I think the rating agencies have responded well to AB 1054, but I'm sure they are still looking at implementation questions and speed and et cetera. So, it's not always going to be just purely a metrics issue for us. And so, that's why we have the philosophy that we put forward for everyone that we're going to take a balanced approach, which means the combination of debt and equity.","I think we're always going to be trying to manage that, Ali, as we understand sort of the impacts of doing that. On the one hand, keeping the balance sheet strong; on the other hand, kind of maybe creating a little bit more of a disconnect for folks. But we're going to keep all that in mind as we make our decisions and we'll have more on the financing plan as we go into next year.","Ali Agha","Thank you.","Pedro Pizarro","Okay. Thanks a lot, Ali.","Operator","That was the last question. I will now turn the call back over to Mr. Sam Ramraj.","Sam Ramraj","Thank you, everyone, for joining us today and please call us if you have any follow-up questions. This concludes the conference call.

[Operator Instructions] Today's call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] And I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Scott Cunningham, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. Mr. Cunningham, you may begin your conference.","Scott Cunningham","Thanks, Gabrielle, and good afternoon, everyone. Our principal speakers today will be Chairman and CEO, Ted Craver; and Chief Financial Officer, Jim Scilacci. Also with us are other members of the management team.","The presentation that accompanies Jim's comments, the earnings press release and our 10-Q filings are available on our website at www.edisoninvestor.com. Tomorrow afternoon, we'll issue our regular quarterly business update presentation that will use these and other slides for ongoing investor discussions.","During this call, we will make forward-looking statements about the financial outlook for Edison International and its subsidiaries and about other future events. Actual results could differ materially from current expectations. Important factors that could cause different results are set forth in our SEC filings. We encourage you to read these carefully.","The presentation includes certain outlook assumptions, as well as reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the nearest GAAP measure. When we get to Q&A, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. If you have further questions, please return to the queue.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Ted Craver.","Theodore F. Craver","Thank you, Scott, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, Edison International reported second quarter GAAP earnings of $0.23 per share and core earnings of $0.32 per share. As expected, this was below last year's $0.54 per share in GAAP earnings and $0.56 per share in core earnings.","Second quarter results reflect unrecovered cost at Southern California Edison due to the delayed General Rate Case decision. In addition, we have continued inspection and repair costs related to the outage at the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station. SCE will look to recover these costs in the future.","We also saw additional losses at EMG this quarter, primarily reflecting low power prices. This further underscores the need to restructure and stabilize our competitive generation business, as I'll talk about in a few minutes.","There are several important developments at Southern California Edison this quarter. I'll spend most of my time on the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station or SONGS as we call it.","Both units at SONGS remained safely shut down for inspections, analysis and testing, following the January 31 Unit 3 steam generator tube leak.","SCE has retained several outside industry experts, consultants and steam generator manufacturers in addition to heavy -- Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, which designed and manufactured our steam generators, to analyze the causes of the unique tube-to-tube wear and potential remedial actions.","On July 19, the NRC released its detailed findings from its augmented inspection team. It summarized its finding by saying that faulty computer modeling, inadequately predicted conditions in the steam generators and manufacturing issues contributed to excessive wear of the components. The report states that the excessive wear arose from tube-to-tube contact caused by vibration in the tubes in certain areas of the steam generators. The excessive vibration is due to a phenomenon called fluid elastic instability, which is discussed in detail in the report. The NRC has identified a number of outstanding issues that it still is reviewing.","To date, the inspection and repair effort is focused on a substantial amount of technical analysis work and preventative plugging of tubes where appropriate based on indications of prior or potential future wear, both in areas where there was tube-to-tube contact and tube-to-support contact. Each of the 4 steam generators has over 9,700 heat-transfer tubes and is designed to include sufficient tubes to accommodate a need to remove some from service for a variety of reasons, and the tubes at SCE has preventively removed from service are all well within this margin.","SONGS will not be restarted until SEC determines that it is safe to do so. And when startup has been approved by the NRC, pursuant to the terms of a Confirmatory Action Letter.","Any remedial action that will permit restart of one or both of the units will need to ensure that the fluid elastic instability phenomenon does not reoccur.","Because Unit 2 experienced considerably less tube-to-tube wear, it could restart months in advance of Unit 3. Any restart of Unit 2 would likely operate at reduced power levels and with mid-cycle scheduled outages to provide for additional inspection and testing to assure safe operation.","Inasmuch as Unit 3 had more tube-to-tube wear than Unit 2, it is not at this time whether Unit 3 will be able to restart without extensive additional repairs. SCE is also looking longer term at what repairs, if any, could allow the steam generators to operate safely at full power as originally specified. At this time, SCE has not determined what those repairs might be or whether the generators will need to be replaced for the units to operate at full output. In the interim, SCE is reviewing its O&M and capital expenditures at SONGS with a view to reducing expenditures to mitigate the added cost pressures from both units being out of service.","I'd like to clear up some confusion that has arisen in the past regarding potential dates for submitting our response to the Confirmatory Action Letter. We have never released a specific date for our submittal. Under the California Independent System Operator rules, we are required to post an estimated restart date on their website whenever we have a generating unit down for an outage. But these are only rough estimates and not formal forecast timelines. We will not be forecasting specific timelines for a Confirmatory Action Letter submittal or potential startup dates. As we have said many times, there is no timeline for safety. And to forecast dates is inconsistent with prudent decision-making.","Turning to the regulatory review at the state level, there are several mechanisms in place for the California Public Utilities Commission to provide oversight and review the reasonableness of expenditures related to the outage. First, the steam generator project cost remains subject to a CPUC reasonableness review once SCE submits final cost for the project. As of June 30, SCE has spent $593 million on the project compared to the inflation-adjusted authorized spend of $665 million, or SCE's 78% ownership share.","Second, our purchase to replace SONGS generation is recoverable through the ERRA, E-R-R-A, balancing account, which is also subject to an annual reasonableness review.","Third, the California Public Utilities Code has rules governing outages. Once either of the units has been out of service for 9 consecutive months, which should be November 2012 for Unit 3 and December 2012 for Unit 2, SCE is required to notify the CPUC. Within 45 days, the CPUC is required to initiate a review to determine whether to remove from customer rates all or part of the revenue requirement associated with what's out of service. Any rate adjustment is made after hearings conducted as part of future General Rate Cases.","In addition, the CPUC's pending proposal to initiate an order instituting an investigation regarding the impact of the extended outage is scheduled for consideration at their Thursday meeting. Jim will cover the financial impacts and recovery of costs incurred in his comments.","My remaining SEC comments will be brief. We still have no indication of the timeline for receiving a General Rate Case proposed decision, but are hopeful this can be concluded in the third quarter. We recognize the significant workload on the commission and staff at this time, but remain hopeful that we can soon gain the clarity we need to run the utility efficiently.","Turning to Edison Mission Energy, we remain focused on developing clarity on the best approach for financially stabilizing EME. There has been continued progress this year across several self-help initiatives to improve liquidity and operating cash flow. One was to accelerate the closing of uneconomic plants and transferring Homer City to the owner-lessors. Another has been to reduce operating and overhead costs to the extent possible, including another workforce reduction to be completed by the end of 2012. A third is minimizing capital spending on environmental retrofits while complying with all state and federal emissions loss.","However, our greatest focus has been on the need to restructure the $3.7 billion of unsecured debt. This is because despite EME's efforts at managing liquidity, our internal forecast anticipate that EME's liquidity will rapidly decline in future quarters, and absent a restructuring of its obligations, EME will not have sufficient liquidity to repay the $500 million in unsecured debt due in June 2013.","For EME to be viable, it must have a clear path to adequate liquidity, particularly over the near-term when it will have the cash cost of retrofits and the tightest operating cash flows. A successful restructuring will require at least 2 things. First, it will require a reduction of debts sufficient to obtain credit metrics that will enable EME to access capital markets to refinance remaining debt well in advance of future maturities based on a reasonable set of assumptions.","Second, it will require conserving cash wherever possible, especially over the next couple of years during the retrofit period and the severe trough and capacity payments to provide a margin of safety in a continuing uncertain market. Given the fact that EME and Midwest Generation are intertwined, this may result in the need for revisions in Midwest generation's Powerton and Joliet leverage lease financings as well.","EME and Edison International are engaging on a confidential basis with advisors representing certain of EME's unsecured bondholders to discuss EME's financial condition. Should we be unsuccessful in negotiating a debt restructuring adequate to stabilize EME as part of Edison International, and in accordance with the requirements I just outlined, then EME would need to be reorganized under new ownership.","Our objectives remain the same: eliminate the overhang of uncertainty about EME, restore EME to a healthy financial condition that would position it for future success and act with a purpose and a sense of urgency. While the exact path forward to success is not clear at this point, we are engaged with bondholders and we plan on moving our discussions along as rapidly as we can.","Despite some of the challenges that I've touched on, when I step back, the investment thesis in Edison International is very much intact. I'm optimistic that we can resolve some important issues this year. At SCE, we continue to have a sustained need for capital investment and system reliability and meeting public policy mandates with the potential for sustained mid to high single-digit rate base growth.","Finally, as we move beyond SCE's 2012 capital spending peak and get the rate case and cost of capital decisions, we will seek to return our dividend in steps over the subsequent years to our target payout ratio range of 45% to 55% of SCE's earnings. The earnings power at SCE, along with gaining clarity on EME, provide the key value drivers for Edison International shareholders.","I'll now turn the call over to Jim Scilacci.","W. James Scilacci","Thanks, Ted. Good afternoon, everyone. Please turn to Page 2, which summarizes the quarter's results that Ted just touched on. I will not duplicate Ted's comments but will add one note that EIX parent company costs were unchanged quarter-over-quarter.","Page 3 highlights the key drivers of SCE's earnings. As in the first quarter, CPUC revenues were largely based on 2011 authorized revenues. As a result, higher costs are now currently being recovered including higher depreciation and new debt and preferred stock costs. This impact totaled $0.09 per share.","When SCE receives its final General Rate Case decision, it will record the authorized revenues retroactively to January 1.","During the second quarter, inspection and repair costs related to the San Onofre outage reduced earnings by $0.05 per share. These costs were offset by timing differences and other cost savings, which amounted to $0.08 per share.","As many of you are aware, on June 15, the CPUC set the schedule and the approach for the 2013 cost of capital proceeding for SCE and the other major California utilities. The commission has separated the case into 2 phases, the first addressing the allowed returns and capital structure, which will be decided in December, and a second phase to review the cost of capital trigger mechanism that has been in place since 2007. SCE did not propose any changes to the existing trigger mechanism except to reset the starting point of the index to the period ending September 2012. We would expect the Moody's BAA Utility Bond Index to continue to be the appropriate index for SCE based on its current credit ratings.","Please turn to Page 4. I'd like to pick up on Ted's discussion on SONGS with some more color on cost in our current investment. Year-to-date, SCE's share of the pretax cost of SONGS-related inspection and repairs totaled $48 million. It was $20 million during Q1 and $28 million during Q2. As a reminder, we continue to flow these costs through core earnings. You may recall that last quarter, we estimated that SCE's share of the total incremental inspection and repair cost associated with returning both units to service was then projected to be in the range of $55 million to $65 million pretax, we now believe that SCE's share of incremental costs to commence startup of just Unit 2 at the reduced power levels that Ted outlined previously is expected to be approximately $25 million pretax. Of course, this estimate remains subject to NRC review and any new development that result from further analysis and testing.","Based on additional knowledge gained regarding Unit 3 over the past 3 months, we've concluded it's premature to estimate the incremental repair costs associated with returning this unit to service. We are also evaluating the cost while returning both units to full capacity.","The market cost for substitute energy and capacity net of avoided nuclear fuel for SONGS are being recorded in the fuel and purchased power balancing account with no impact on earnings. As of June 30, these costs, which were subject to CPUC reasonableness review, totaled $117 million. Because of the uncertainties associated with when and at what levels the units will or may return to service, total potential substitute power cost cannot be estimated at this time.","The slide on Page 4 also summarizes key financial metrics related to SONGS. SCE requested annual revenue requirement of approximately $650 million in its 2012 General Rate Case to cover direct, operation and maintenance cost, depreciation and return on investment. SONGS rate base at the end of the second quarter was $1.2 billion.","Please turn to Page 5. As Ted indicated, at this time, our focus remains on the technical analysis to return the units to service safely although we are assessing all available remedies for cost recovery. Steam generators are warranted for an initial period of 20 years from acceptance. The manufacturer is contractually obligated to repair or replace defective items and to pay specified damages for certain repairs with stated liability under the purchase agreement limited to $137 million. These limitations are subject to applicable exceptions. There may also be potential recoveries under insurance issued by Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited, known as NEIL, and we have placed NEIL on notice of potential claims, although insurance recoveries remain uncertain.","I'd like to come back to the rate case decision timing and the impacts on SCE's capital spending plan. Please turn to Page 6. SCE has not changed its capital spending forecast pending a final rate case decision. However, the GRC delay will likely change the 3-year forecast of actual spending, which, depending upon the final timing, could bring 2012 capital spending at or below the low end of the forecast range. Actual capital spending will likely catch up with CPUC authorized spending in the later years of the 3-year rate case cycle. This timing mismatch will primarily affect distribution and generation CapEx.","Please turn to Page 7, which covers EMG's results. Keep in mind these results almost entirely reflect the activities of EME. We continue to wind down Edison Capital, and its ongoing earnings are immaterial. As we told you last quarter, Homer City is reported in non-core earnings in both periods. Midwest Generation continues to face weak power markets and higher delivered coal cost, resulting in $0.08 per share higher loss. EMMT's trading results were down $0.02 per share. Results also reflect a $0.02 per share decrease related to certain wind projects that are consolidated in EMG's results.  This relates largely to the Capistrano Wind Partners transaction completed in February. While the transaction provided an important source of liquidity to EME, it effectively lowered EME's ownership interest and, therefore, share of earnings.","Comparisons were also impacted by lower distributions from the Doga project, which largely cost $0.03 per share reduction from the natural gas power fleet. EMG's EBITDA was $9 million in the quarter and $50 million year-to-date.","Our usual supplemental information on EMG's EBITDA, capital spending and operating hedge summaries, as well as year-to-date financial results are included in the presentation appendix.","Please turn to Page 8 and we'll review liquidity. As of June 30, EME and its subsidiaries had slightly over $1 billion of cash and short-term investments. Cash and cash equivalents not subject to contractual dividend restrictions were $879 million, which includes $177 million of Midwest Gen cash. With the June 29 expiration of the Midwest Generation credit facility, the contractual dividend restriction on movement of cash under this agreement is now eliminated.","As a side note, EME's environmental retrofit plan is essentially unchanged from last quarter, although EME continues to look for opportunities to optimize spending while remaining in compliance with applicable state and federal rules. EME's deferred tax asset remains an important source of future liquidity under an intercompany tax allocation agreement. These tax assets increased modestly to $961 million as of June 30 from $908 million in the first quarter.","Future payments under the tax allocation agreement are only available to EME if it remains part of the consolidated Edison International tax filing entity, which requires EIX ownership of at least 80% of EME.  A final point on liquidity is that SCE and EIX replaced their credit facilities during the second quarter. More details are included in our disclosures.","Page 9 is a summary of EME's financial status, which Ted has substantially addressed and is included in EME and EIX disclosures.","Lastly, Page 10 of the presentation highlights some of the key operating variables consistent with what we have introduced last quarter. As we have said previously, we will not provide earnings guidance until after we receive a final rate case decision.","With that, I'd like to turn it over to the operator to begin the Q&A portion of the call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question does come from Dan Eggers with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Ted, I was wondering if you could just share a little more thought on the EME situation. Clearly the case is being made for liquidity and survivability of the business, but how do you put this decision in context of your preserving equity value for shareholders, demonstrators, ongoing equity value above just kind of going entity concern?","Theodore F. Craver","Yes, it's a great question. And I think at this point, like most decisions of the sort, it's going to be a matter of relative value. Generically, there going to be 2 choices. Either EME will make sense as a continuing part of the EIX family, and I've tried to be clear over the last few earnings calls about kind of the markers that we have in mind that would really provide us and our equity investors sufficient clarity around the viability of EME as part of EIX. If we're unable to really gain that clarity or unable to really see a viable entity that ultimately can return to providing value to EIX, delivering on its underlying mission, then it really won't make sense to be part of Edison International and will need to be owned by others. So at this point, it's too early to tell really what's the art of the possible, where, as I mentioned, we're beginning the process of engaging with bondholders to determine that. And we get sufficient clarity, get sufficient certainty, and we can really see a path for EME to be a value-adding part of EIX, then that's the way we'll go. If not, then it's not going to be part of EIX.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And I know it's -- the negotiations are starting now, but is there a time line that you guys have set kind of as to how quickly you want to have this resolved or how long it will take to get to clarity?","Theodore F. Craver","Yes, I mean, we chose the words carefully in my opening comments, trying to indicate that the time is now. I mean, we need to engage, we need to get these conversations going. We're doing it with a sense of purpose and a sense of urgency, and we want to resolve this. The uncertainty I don't think is doing anybody any good. I don't think it's doing EIX equity holders any good, I don't think it's doing EME any good. We've got important operations. We have safety that we have to have in mind. All of these things, I think, really say we need to reach a conclusion here with dispatch.","Operator","And our next question does come from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Yes, couple of questions. First on Mission, I know you've talked about not having liquidity to meet the $500 million maturity next year. But you've got some decent-sized bond payments coming toward the back end of this year, I think, late in the fall. Just curious, are those bond payments kind of the trigger date we should think about? Meaning, that you kind of want to make a decision before those payment date show up or is it something that could go into next year?","Theodore F. Craver","Mike, it's Ted. Short answer is yes. I think those interest payments are very important and even waiting out until November, when those interest payments are dues, in my mind, not moving with dispatch.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And you've talked a number of times over the last 6 to 12 months about wanting EIX to have competitive generation, meaning not wanting solely to be a regulated utility holding company. Just curious, if it comes to that, how -- and that merchant generation company is not Edison Mission, how would you get it off the ground? How would you get started?","Theodore F. Craver","Yes, maybe I'll -- sorry, this is Ted again. Maybe, I'll just reshape your words a little bit here. I think what we've stated in the past is we believe that it's important to have both a regulated and competitive business platform. Competitive generation, in my mind, is a subset of a competitive business platform, so just one clarification on that point. I think in general, we'd have to admit that it seems like the potential for distributed generation or more retail-related services or even other competitive business activities that would be outside of our regulated footprint at Southern California Edison, but those are more futuristic. We think there's some important opportunities that we want to continue to track and continue to focus some attention on. But it would be better, I think, to make use of some existing skills and an existing platform than to create those from scratch, from whole cloth. But that's probably an advantage on the margin, and I don't think it's one that really drives our thinking at this point.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I had a quick question on -- so the $48 million that you incurred so far at SONGS, can you give us an idea of how much of that was Unit 2 and how much was Unit 3 versus, I guess, the $25 million future spend that you've marked for getting Unit 2 back for reduced power?","W. James Scilacci","No, I don't have a breakdown here. We haven't disclosed the breakout between the 2 separate units, Jonathan.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. Is there anything else you can do for us to sort of try and frame what your -- the terminology, I think you used extensive as the possible additional repair work that might be needed on Unit 3 could mean at this exit of multiples of Unit 2 or just moderately more. Anything you can -- any additional framing you can put on that?","Theodore F. Craver","Jonathan, this is Ted. Just a quick part on that. I think the main thing we're really trying to signal there is you -- we probably can't address entirely the issue of keeping this phenomena, this fluid elastic instability phenomenon from reocurring by simply operating at reduced power in the case of Unit 3. So what we're really trying to signal is it needs more than reduced power types of operations. So that's really what we're referring to. We haven't gone far enough down the road at this point with Unit 3 to really come up with anything more definitive than that in terms of exactly what would be required to restore it.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. Can I just try one other thing on this topic, Ted, is there any, when you -- as you analyze these scenarios around what's the best deal for customers or the costs you're looking at, is there any question that fixing it is the right option?","Theodore F. Craver","Well, I think at this stage, you'd expect us to have all the options on the table. At this juncture, we're just trying to do this in the most disciplined, systematic kind of step-by-step approach. And these are complex technical issues. It's a first-of-a-kind type of issue that we're dealing with, meaning this tube-to-tube wear. So we're just taking it one step at a time without trying to get too far ahead of ourselves. But yes, at this point, of course, all options are on the table. We're focused mostly on getting Unit 2 restored if we believe we can do it safely. And as we said, it's pretty clear to us initially that would be at reduced power with relatively short operating windows that we take it down and go through reinspections, and all of that will help inform us in terms of our future actions as well.","Operator","And our next question comes from Paul Fremont with Jefferies.","Paul B. Fremont - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I guess, 2 questions. One, you talked about a targeted payout of 45% to 55% if Mission were no longer -- if Mission were to file for bankruptcy. Should we assume that you'd be targeting the same level of payout or would that potentially change?","W. James Scilacci","Paul, it's Jim. We based the dividend for EIX on the earnings of the utility. That's the way we've always done it. So I don't foresee that any action in and around EME would affect our payout policy.","Paul B. Fremont - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then the second question that I have is, if EMG were to file, could you give us a sense of how we should think about the $961 million of tax benefit that sits there? Is there any precedent in other filings as to what would happen? Would EIX be forced to repurchase that or how should we think about it?","W. James Scilacci","I think -- this is Jim again, Paul. I think that's a complicated issue and it would be, certainly, embroiled in any kind of negotiation with bondholders or during the bankruptcy process. I don't think we can predict at this point in time what ultimately would occur. It's clear that as long as EME is part of a consolidated family, and that might be during the period of a bankruptcy, then we'd have to monetize tax benefits. But ultimately, where it plays out in the end, that's harder to say. So there would be a point in time when ultimately, the clock could stop ticking and you would cut off ultimately the monetization of tax benefits. But that will take a lot to get resolved, and it could take a period of time. I couldn't predict at this point in time how long.","Paul B. Fremont - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","And are there any precedents that we could look at in terms of other companies where this has been ruled on?","W. James Scilacci","Yes, I think the only one that comes to mind from when we previously saw this, and it's going to be dated. So there was some discussion around the PG&E bankruptcy when they -- when their competitive generation business went into bankruptcy. But again, remember, that was back in 2001, 2002, so I'd be careful looking at that precedent and given the passage of time.","Operator","And our next question comes from Steve Fleishman with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Steven I. Fleishman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","A couple just logistical questions on the SONGS. Is there a way to break out the rate base between Units 2 and Unit 3?","W. James Scilacci","At this point in time, it's not -- we haven't provided it. And so again, in future filings, we may have to do that. But at this point in time, I think that's something for the future, Steve.","Steven I. Fleishman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then also on the comments you made on the rate base related to the GRC and that -- for '12, you'll probably be at the low end or below on your CapEx.","W. James Scilacci","The CapEx, yes.","Steven I. Fleishman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Yes. But then just to clarify, you expect to make up for most of that in '13, '14, so that imply that the '13, '14 could be toward the upper or above the upper end, so that it's kind of equal over the 3 years?","W. James Scilacci","Well, yes. And -- so that's exactly what would occur. We've had this pattern before when you get a late GRC that your actual capital expenditures will differ than authorized. And so actual capital expenditures will lag, and they'll go above. But remember, on a rate making basis, we get paid. And our revenues are based on authorized. So we're just trying to draw attention to that phenomena.","Steven I. Fleishman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And I guess one last question on the Edison Mission situation. I think at times it's been talked about the potential that if you do, and if it does end up going under different ownership, that there could be this worthless stock deduction. Could you just comment on whether that would be likely and at what point in time would that potentially be deducted so to speak?","W. James Scilacci","We haven't put in a public domain what if any worthless stock deduction there'd be. And it's always taken at the conclusion of a bankruptcy process. And the fact that there is a worthless stock deduction could get dragged into the negotiations in some type of bankruptcy proceeding. So I couldn't even begin to tell you what the bread basket is. And there's a number that changes constantly each quarter based on the earnings or losses and the monetization of tax benefits can change the worthless stock deduction. So it's constantly changing, so we've been taking a position not to put it into the domain until we actually get further down the road.","Operator","And our next question does come from Ali Agha with SunTrust.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Ted, coming back to your thoughts on EMG and what you've seen as the viable entity, stable entity going forward. Assuming it doesn't file for bankruptcy and you get what you're looking for through this restructuring, how should we be thinking about the underlying earnings or positive earnings power of that entity? Should we think that coming out of bankruptcy, this is a profitable entity from an earnings perspective or should we think that this is really driven by these capacity payments and forward curves, maybe profitability is a couple of years out? How should we think about that as part of the equity value proposition if you do stick with EMG?","Theodore F. Craver","That's a good -- great question. Unfortunately, I don't have a great answer. Certainly, it will depend on what power prices and capacity prices will be. We've got a little more clarity on the capacity price side than we do on the power price side as we go forward. But that's really going to be the determinant. I would have to say based on kind of current pricing and that type of stuff, I don't know that we would expect to see anything close to robust earnings in the subsequent years. But frankly, kind of throwing darts here at this point, it will depend on what comes out of any negotiation and it'll certainly depend heavily on what the actual prices are once it come out of the restructuring process.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","And second question, just coming back to SONGS again. Bigger picture issue there, I mean, the first quarter when you guys laid out your -- what is going on there, the expectation at least was that the cost that you were incurring, you were very confident you would basically recoup those either through warranty payments or regulatory process. And I just want to be clear, is that still your view right now and how should we think about the points you make about the amount that are in your current GRC, the rate base, I mean, is that a scenario unfolding that the commission takes out SONGS from rate base and from customer rates and has that could be bad negative earnings implications to think about from our end?","Theodore F. Craver","Again, 2 for 2, 2 great questions and I'm going to be 2 for 2, not 2 great answers. I don't think we really know at this point. What we try to do in the discussion here is outline what the proceedings were, what we can anticipate roughly in terms of the timing of those proceedings and what -- which costs or what cost will be part of those proceedings. That's about as definitive as we can be at this point in time. Not the least of which, we don't yet really know ourselves what the potential fixes or outcomes are for the 2 units. So I'd say at this point, there's more that we don't know than we do around what those specific numbers would look like.","Operator","And our next question comes from Greg Gordon with ISI Group.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Two questions. One, just on Jim, on the comments you made relative to capital expenditures relative to projected rate base growth. So presuming that you get a General Rate Case decision that validates the CapEx plan and the rate base growth profile that you project in these slides, what you're basically telling us is that you would book your revenue requirement as if you were spending on plan but the cash flow profile actual be slightly more middle to back-end loaded on the actual expenditures, so that on a GAAP basis, we might actually see slightly higher earned ROE in the front and then it smooths out towards the end, is that right?","W. James Scilacci","I think you hit it completely on -- nail in the head.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. Second question, am I correct that this is the first time that you talked with investors explicitly about making a NEIL filing for insurance recovery? And can we talk about the process there and what you think you're covered for?","W. James Scilacci","It is the first time. We've always had insurance from NEIL. That's something that all the facilities, it's a mutual. And in terms of the process, we haven't provided any additional information on what that will be. That will unfold over time, and as we actually make the claims and we'll include it in future disclosures around San Onofre.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","But are you expecting to file for outage insurance as well as for the cost of repair?","W. James Scilacci","The -- just when I go back -- the way it works to just -- for further clarification, for -- there's a period of time, there's a deductible and the disclosures get into more detail on this. You have to read it carefully, Greg. There's a period of time when we cannot recover replacement power then it kicks in, and there are certain limitations associated with it. And there are certain limitations on it, there's 1 or 2 units out. So read that carefully, and I think it's pretty clear in there, limits on a total amount of insurance that we could ultimately recover from an outage. And I'm going to go back and pause again and let you reask your question because I wanted to fill in that GAAP piece.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Right. Well, just about here on Page 5 of your deck that you have the 12-week deductible period?","W. James Scilacci","Yes.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","And then after that, you could file for outage from damage. So -- and then you also have accidental property damage. I guess my question is whether you're going to file for accidental property damage, outage or both?","W. James Scilacci","I could -- yes is the answer.","Operator","And our next question comes from Kit Konolige with BGC Financial.","Kit Konolige","Ted, question back to your discussion of the dividend. I wrote down the notes here that we have some challenges, but we're optimistic, I guess, to the effect of after we resolve the challenges then we'll look to grow the dividend again. Can you be more specific about what has to be overcome before the dividend starts to grow at this more robust rate?","Theodore F. Craver","More specific. Well, maybe just to reiterate what I said is we see 2012 as basically being around the peak of the capital spending at SCE. We've talked a little bit in some of the comments that Jim made, as well as the Q&A up to this point that the exact shape of that is a little tricky to completely predict. But I still think the basic point stands that we're probably close to the peak in capital spending in 2012. So while rate base will continue to grow in subsequent years, it's growing at a decreasing rate. And that phenomenon in utility rate-making causes a kind of a, kind of a -- I'd refer to it as a bow wave of cash that builds up. So I think that certainly starts to set up the conditions for being able to look at moving our dividend back into the targeted payout ratio range, which is based on SCE earnings entirely. So we've fallen out the bottom of that range. And so in a kind of a step-by-step manner, we would expect to try to address that to move it back up towards the targeted payout ratio range. We have indicated that we have some important regulatory decisions right in front of us here this year, namely a rate case and the cost to capital decision. I mean, both of those remain outstanding. So we certainly would need to get decisions on those 2 things to really know what we're looking at in the near term around the dividend. But I think the direction is the way we've stated it here in the last several earnings calls that we see the day where we can start tuning up the dividend payout and move it back towards our payout target ratio.","Kit Konolige","And just to follow on that, are you at a stage now with SONGS where you'd feel that, that needs more clarity or some kind of resolution before the next stage of the dividend is addressed? Or would that just be taken in stride?","Theodore F. Craver","Well, I think it would be a consideration, but the types of things I'm talking about here are fairly long-term and directional. So it'll be -- like other issues, it'll be things that you certainly taken into account when you're trying to set a responsible dividend and follow our financial disciplines. But I think it's -- take it in stride, I guess, is more in the neighborhood.","Operator","And our next question comes from Hugh Wynne with Sanford Bernstein.","Hugh Wynne - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I know that you can't predict how the CPUC is going to respond to the SONGS outage. But I was hoping you might be able to reiterate the schedule on which the CPUC would make its determination and perhaps give us a little bit of guidance as to the degree of discretion that they have in making their decisions. So you had mentioned that after 9 months of outage, you have to notify them. Can you take us from there as to what the steps are on the regulatory counter?","Theodore F. Craver","Yes, I'm actually going to probably turn it over to the folks who are a little closer to all those specifics, but we've tried to identify the 3 main proceedings that will have some impact on cost recovery around San Onofre. But Ron, you want to pick that up?","Ronald L. Litzinger","Yes. Hugh, this is Ron. With regards to PUC Section 455.5 when we've been out of service for 9 months, we would have to notify the commission on Unit 3 in November. They have 45 days to respond, that will look at our revenue requirements and focus on the O&M costs. The reasonableness review, if the commission elects to do it on the steam generator replacement project, that would be initiated when we complete the project. We currently estimate that we'll complete the disposal later this year of the units, and that would be the trigger for that. And then the ERRA proceeding, that will be April of next year.","Hugh Wynne - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. So on the first proceeding, the Section 455.5, what is being reviewed there is simply the direct O&M or the recovery of depreciation and return on investment, as well on the unit.","Ronald L. Litzinger","The rate base -- the depreciation and recovery, it's basically a review of the rate base, which would include your O&M and then your depreciation and return.","Hugh Wynne - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Right. So we're basically looking at possibly half of the $650 million that you estimate here as the annual revenue requirement?","Ronald L. Litzinger","They would review the whole revenue requirement based on the conditions that we have at the time.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jay Dobson with Wunderlich Securities.","James L. Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","Maybe just finishing on that last one with Ron. If they do elect to start an OII this Thursday, would that section 455.5 proceeding be sort of set into that or are these just would be 2 separate proceedings?","Theodore F. Craver","I think the short answer is, at this point, we don't know. I think there's some benefit -- I'm stating an opinion here. I think there'd be some benefit to have some of these things consolidated instead of having multiple proceedings. But anyway, presumably that's what the commission will consider later this week. But we really can't predict how all that would flow out at this point.","W. James Scilacci","And just for clarification purposes, if you get into a 455.5 situation, it's on a unit-by-unit basis. So they're looking at the revenue requirement for each unit. So if SONGS 2 were to come back up, SONGS 3 stays down, then you could actually have a separate proceeding for Unit 3.","James L. Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","Got you, okay. No, that's great. And then Ted, maybe going back to EMG, and I apologize in advance for doing this to you, I think I heard you respond in a earlier question that you sort of sounded like November was too late to respond. And I think at earlier conference calls, you had, maybe the word committed is too strong, but suggested that an answer might or should be given by September. Just using the clock, the 6 to 12-months clock you started a year ago in September. Is September too aggressive to assume that we'd have an answer by then given the complexities of the situation and where we stand now on July 31?","Theodore F. Craver","Again, I really don't know. Now we're kind of getting into the fine cutting on the days. But from my perspective, you can make these things drag on forever and ever and complicate the heck out of them. I think it's actually, you're going to end up being reasonably straightforward about what will be sufficient to have a viable entity on a go-forward basis. And if we can't reach that, then we go to other options. So from my standpoint, sooner is better. I think the data is being made available. We ought to be able to sit down and work through the same, figure out if we've got a good mutual approach that works for all parties.","James L. Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","Got you. So something like November is probably the right sort of time frame to think about understanding it's rough, and sort of mirroring your response to another question.","Theodore F. Craver","Well, since I'll probably only get in trouble by trying to predict dates, I'll just let you -- I'll let you work with your dates. But we're focused on it right now.","Operator","And our next question comes from Angie Storozynski with Macquarie.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Research","Two questions. First, when you cut your parent cost, how much of the parent cost is being now covered by EMG? So in other words, if EMG were to cease to exist, how much of an incremental expense should I account for when I look at the parent and utility earnings?","W. James Scilacci","Angie, that's an excellent question. We haven't put anything out in the public domain. There would certainly be some amount of cost that we allocate to that side that would not be potentially recoverable if we went down the road that way. But that would be -- we'll incorporate it in some kind of future disclosures. But we don't have anything now.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Research","But can you give us any sense? Is this $0.50 or this a de minimis amount?","W. James Scilacci","I think it's a relatively small amount. Because we've said already that the holding company cost is about a $0.01 a month or 12 -- we've as -- generally, we've indicated it's about $0.12 a year. So it's not a large amount of money when it's all said and done.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Research","Okay. And the second question is about the NEIL recovery. It seems like there's so many companies seeking recovery from NEIL. Should we worry that NEIL is going to run out of its capacity to actually provide the insurance coverage?","W. James Scilacci","I don't know if I can answer that. NEIL's been around for quite a bit -- long period of time. It's a mutual, there are quite a bit of reserves associated with it. There's mechanisms for them to get out and get additional funds, should you exceed certain calls in their capital. So I think that's a question you can direct to NEIL, but I don't think it's their concern at this point in time.","Operator","And we have reached the end of our question-and-answer session.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Edison International Fourth Quarter 2011 Financial Teleconference. [Operator Instructions] Today's call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Scott Cunningham, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. Mr. Cunningham, you may begin your conference.","Scott Cunningham","Thanks, Sharon, and good afternoon, everyone. Our principal speakers today will be Chairman and CEO, Ted Craver; and Chief Financial Officer, Jim Scilacci. Also with us are other members of the management team. Ted's prepared remarks, presentation that accompanies Jim's comments, earnings press release and our Edison International 10-K are available on our website at www.edisoninvestor.com. Tomorrow, we will issue our regular quarterly business update presentation that will use these and other slides for ongoing investor discussions.","During this call, we will make forward-looking statements about the financial outlook for Edison International and its subsidiaries and about other future events. Actual results could differ materially from current expectations. Important factors that could cause different results are set forth in our SEC filings. We encourage you to read them carefully. Presentation includes certain outlook assumptions, as well as reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the nearest GAAP measure.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Ted Craver.","Theodore F. Craver","Thank you, Scott, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, Edison International reported fourth quarter earnings of $0.75 per share and full year core earnings of $3.22 per share. We are pleased that our fourth quarter results have allowed us to deliver 2011 core earnings well above the high end of our guidance range.","Southern California Edison, Edison Mission Group and the parent, all contributed to outperforming the earnings guidance. Of particular note, Southern California Edison's core earnings increased $0.20 in the quarter and $0.32 for the full year due to rate base growth and a favorable tax adjustment that Jim will discuss a little later.","Typically, at this time of the year, we provide earnings guidance for the coming year. However, we will not be providing 2012 guidance until we receive a final decision in Southern California Edison's General Rate Case, which we hope will be in the first half of 2012.","In the absence of specific earnings guidance, Jim will discuss some of the key drivers to our 2012 earnings in his remarks.","On a reported basis, we showed a loss for the full year of $0.11 per share, due primarily to impairment charges at EMG. These impairment charges are largely the result of a sharp decline in power prices, combined with the need for substantial investment in retrofits for our coal fleet to comply with environmental regulations. I'll say more about those charges later during my remarks about EMG.","Let me begin by covering some recent developments at Southern California Edison. First, let me provide a brief update on the timing of the Southern California Edison's 2012 General Rate Case. As of now, we don't have a timeline for when we will get a final decision, although we hope it'll be in the first half of the year. Commission is aware of the need for a timely GRC decision, and we expect a proposed decision will be forthcoming shortly. But it is also important to remember that the final decision will be retroactive to January 1.","Our value proposition at Southern California Edison is driven by growth in capital investment, which is expected to result in average annual growth in rate base of 7% to 9% through 2014. This growth is largely driven by California policy mandates, as well as infrastructure replacement to ensure public safety and reliability.","Over the last 5 years, Southern California Edison has delivered compound annual growth in rate base of 11%, and its core earnings have increased at a 12% compound annual growth rate.","One large component of SCE's capital program is investment in transmission to connect renewable generators such as the Tehachapi and Devers-Colorado River projects. At these projects, we are seeing higher costs to mitigate various environmental impacts and from permitting delays. These additional costs are included in SCE's updated capital spending forecast.","I would also like to provide an update on the outage work taking place at our San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station, or at we refer to as SONGS. Unit 2 is offline for a planned outage -- planned refueling outage and we took Unit 3 offline on January 31 to inspect a water leak in its steam generator. Steam generators in Unit 2 were replaced in 2010, and Unit 3's were replaced in 2011.","Planned inspections of the steam generators in Unit 2 found isolated areas of wear in some of the heat transfer tubes. We are in the process of preventively removing tubes from service as prescribed by industry guidelines and well within design margins for this kind of repair activity. ","We are still conducting a battery of tests and performing a root cause evaluation on the Unit 3 tube water leak. SCE is committed to the safe operation of SONGS and of course, will not return the plant's generating units to service until we are entirely satisfied it is completely safe to do so.","Final update I will provide on SCE is that this year, it will complete the installation of 5 million smart meters in a $1.2 billion infrastructure capital investment. There were 3.8 million meters installed by the end of last year, and the program is on schedule and on budget. As the system is rolled out, SCE is developing programs that provide customers with enhanced information and services on their energy usage, while providing us with new tools to better manage outages.","We continue to see opportunities for this investment to enhance our customer service platform by facilitating energy efficiency and providing the ability to integrate customers' smart appliances and devices within the home.","Let me now turn to Edison Mission Group. We continue to believe that a dual platform of regulated and competitive businesses best positions our company for the transformative change, we believe, will sweep across the electric power industry.","The last 18 months, we have been focused on unlocking the option value at EMG by reducing and extending the timeline for required capital investments and creating new liquidity to provide additional time for our recovery in power and capacity prices. However, power prices have not recovered. Indeed, their deterioration accelerated late last year and early this year.","Additionally, EMG's liquidity has been reduced in the near-term by losing its ability to monetize its tax losses until at least 2013, primarily because the federal stimulus program and especially the enactment of 50% and then 100% deductibility of bonus depreciation, has created net operating losses in the consolidated EIX tax group. These 2 factors have added to EMG's stressed condition.","Efforts to stabilize EMG continue, focusing on cost effectively meeting its environmental requirements, reducing its unsecured debt and diversifying its generation portfolio with additional natural gas and renewable generation.","Ultimately, the test will be the ability to generate sufficient cash flows such that it can refinance a sustainable portion of its unsecured debt. If current power market conditions persist, EMG expects to incur further reductions in cash flow and earnings losses in 2012 and beyond.","Current conditions, coupled with pending debt maturities and retrofit investments, will strain EMG's liquidity such that it may need to divest assets and restructure or reorganize its capital structure to get through this period, to see if option value is indeed there.","We have repeatedly said that EIX will be financially disciplined and not invest new funds into EMG unless we can see a clear and compelling path to obtaining both a return of and on any investment. In the face of deteriorating financial conditions at EMG, we reaffirm that pledge.","EMG will likewise maintain its financial discipline, and the impairments being announced today demonstrate this, as they reflect the decision not to invest or the reduced likelihood of investing in retrofits at certain coal plants.","$623 million after-tax impairment charge at Homer City reflects the assessment that EMG is not going to control this investment going forward. This conclusion was reached when Homer City was unable to attract outside capital for its environmental retrofits under its current financial structure and current market conditions.","We are working with the owner-lessors to transition control of Homer City to them subject to their discussions with their bondholders.","Today, we also announced a $386 million after-tax impairment charge on 3 of our Midwest Generation plants: Fisk, Crawford and Waukegan. We have also reached the conclusion that it is not economic to continue operating Fisk beyond 2012 or Crawford beyond 2014. We retain flexibility on the decision whether to retrofit Waukegan, since we don't have to make major capital commitments there for a while.","With the challenging market environment facing EMG, primary focus is to preserve and enhance liquidity and seek a sustainable capital structure. While the impairments reflect deteriorating conditions, they also reflect this focus. Reductions in spending at Fisk and Crawford and potentially Waukegan will help liquidity. They also facilitate extending the timeline for deciding on retrofitting the remaining Midwest generation plants while maintaining full environmental compliance by burning ultra-low sulfur coal.","While EME terminated it's largely undrawn revolver in February, termination of the revolver has the benefit of freeing up collateral for future debt financing.","Actions in our wind business reflect the focus on preserving and enhancing liquidity as well. First, EMG reduced development spending on its existing wind pipeline and rationalized development and support staff. Second, it continues to project-finance its existing wind portfolio. This end, during December of last year, EMG closed a $242 million portfolio financing of 3 contracted wind projects representing 204 megawatts. Third and perhaps most significantly, a sizable equity financing was completed for EMG's wind developments.","On February 13, EMG received a $460 million commitment to facilitate the development of wind projects. This unique structure involves the transfer of 3 operating EMG wind projects, totaling 291 megawatts, to a new venture with outside investors. Also, 2 projects in construction, totaling 120 megawatts, will be sold to the venture upon their completion.","This transaction will net EMG approximately $235 million as the 5 projects are transferred. It also allows EMG to do additional development of wind projects without consuming its equity capital, while retaining project upside after the investors achieved their targeted return.","Completing these strategic actions results in a more focused EMG, better positioned to weather it's challenges. Last summer, I began saying that the next 6 to 12 months would likely be determinative for EMG and that during that time frame, a number of important issues would need to get resolved. That remains the case. We have important steps that we will be addressing with investors in the coming months as we continue to focus on seeking shareholder value.","Those are the major topics I wanted to cover. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Jim Scilacci.","W. James Scilacci","Thank you, Ted, and good afternoon, everyone. Page 2 of the presentation summarizes the quarterly earnings comparison that Ted's already touched on.","Starting with Edison International Holding Company results for 2011. As you can see, they are a positive $0.02 per share due to some consolidated income tax benefits and a true-up -- through tax true-ups. ","Turning to Page 3, SCE's fourth quarter core earnings increased to $0.76 per share, up $0.20 from last year. Higher earnings in the quarter were driven by rate-based growth and a cumulative adjustment to deferred income taxes related to nuclear fuel.","Although not in our guidance, we did recognize $0.03 of energy efficiency earnings. Ted has already walked through -- talked about the 2012 GRC for SCE. Pending the final decision, Southern California Edison is managing its current O&M and capital spending at a run rate similar to 2011 levels.","Turning to Page 4, EMG lost $0.03 per share on the core basis compared to a positive $0.10 per share last year. The merchant coal fleet has suffered from lower average realized energy and capacity prices and lower levels of generation.","Improved results from our renewable energy projects were partially offset by higher net interest from an increase in total amount of project, finance debt and a reduction in capitalized interest.","Detailed operating metrics for the coal fleet are included in the presentation appendix.","Now I'd like to review the non-core charges at EMG on Page 5, starting with Homer City. As previously reported, during the second half of 2011, we conducted a bidding process to obtain capital funding for the Homer City scrubbers from third parties. The processes failed to obtain sufficient interest.","As Ted mentioned, Homer City is now working cooperatively with the owner-lessors to resolve funding for the scrubbers and transition control of the station over to them. This process is moving on an accelerated basis in order to allow scrubber construction to begin.","As a result of the expectation that EMG's interest will be substantially or entirely diluted through that process, EMG recorded a pretax impairment charge -- excuse me, an impairment charge of $1.91 per share for EIX share. In the event of a final decision to dispose of the interest, EMG will record an additional charge and likely classify Homer City as a discontinued operations.","Homer City has a rent payment due on April 1 of this year. Homer City believes it will not meet the covenant requirements, and therefore, be unable to make the required equity rent payment, and there is no assurance that Homer City will be able to make other rent payments in the future.","In order to pay equity rent, Homer City must meet historical and projected senior rent service coverage ratios of 1.7:1. At year end 2011, Homer City's historical ratio was 1.18:1. We have provided additional detail regarding Homer City in the EME and EIX 10-Ks. Homer City's failure to make the April 1 equity rent payment will not result in cross defaults or trigger other covenant trips for EME or EIX.","Turning to Midwest Generation, the substantial downward movement of power prices since the third quarter of last year and the need to preserve liquidity in light of the pending decisions on environmental retrofits, EMG recorded $1.19 per share impairment charge related to Midwest Generation's Fisk, Crawford and Waukegan stations. EMG determined the fair value of these stations to be 0.","Other non-core charges in the quarter related to the reduction in EME's wind development program, of $0.13; a write-down of Edison Capital investment and 3 aircraft leased to American Airlines, $0.05; and a final payment from the sale of the March Point project that occurred in 2010, a positive $0.02. As a result of the impairment-related non-core charges, Edison International parent company recorded a $0.06 per share charge related to adjustments in deferred taxes.","I won't go into our full year results in the interest of time. These results are summarized on Pages 6 through 8 of the presentation, and they are consistent with our ongoing message that rate-based growth will increase SCE's earnings while lower gross margins for the merchant coal fleet, have and will adversely impact EME's earnings.","To emphasize the utility's value proposition, Page 9 provides the historical compound annual growth rates for both rate base and core earnings since 2006. As the chart demonstrates, SCE has delivered 12% core earnings growth and 11% rate base growth over the last 5 years.","Page 10 provides an updated capital expenditure forecast. The 3-year forecast yields $11.8 billion to $13.2 billion of capital expenditures through 2014.","The major changes to the forecast include upward revisions to the expected cost of transmission projects, most notably the Tehachapi and Devers-Colorado River renewable transmission projects. These cost increases have been partially offset by other transmission reliability projects, which were deferred.","On Page 11, is the resulting forecast of rate base through the end of 2014, which ties to SCE's 3-year rate case cycle. During this 3-year period, compound average rate base growth is forecasted to be 7% to 9%. The updated rate base growth reflects the expected gradual decline in forecast capital expenditures.","Page 12 provides the current hedge positions for energy and coal for Homer City and Midwest Generation. Homer City is in a state of transition so we have purposely not entered into new hedges and have closed out other positions.","The substantial reduction in power prices and some limited coal to gas switching in ComEd, we would expect that the historical generation and related coal consumption at Midwest Generation will not be indicative in the current environment.","I'd also like to touch a little bit on the new rail contract with Union Pacific for the Midwest Generation fleet. Midwest Gen entered into a new multiyear rail contract in the fourth quarter effective January 1, 2012. Under this agreement, the estimated transportation cost is $386 million for 2012. The cost may also increase based on a number of factors provided under the terms of the contract. Under the new contract, Midwest Gen may reduce its minimum requirements in the event of a plant shutdown, under certain circumstances.","Overall, we see roughly a 1\/3 increase in Midwest Gen's delivered coal cost. EMG has decided to pursue an ultra-low sulfur strategy for its Midwest Gen fleet, which will permit deferral of environmental capital expenditures. Based on 2011 data, Midwest Generation's fleet was meeting the 2013 EPS requirements of 0.44 pounds per MMBtu for SO2 emissions through the use of low sulfur coal.","On Page 13 is the revised capital expenditure forecast. This new forecast reflects changes in timing for environmental retrofits and the Midwest Gen stations, previously provided a cost estimate to install environmental upgrades of $1.2 billion for all Midwest Generation stations.","The updated forecast of up to $628 million is to retrofit just the larger Midwest Gen units or Powerton 5 and 6, Joliet 7 and 8 and Will County 3 and 4. Although it is less likely that we will do so, the estimated cost to retrofit the smaller stations, Waukegan 7 and 8 and Joliet 6 is about $235 million. The remaining capital expenditures are mostly for the construction of the Walnut Creek natural gas-fired plant, and the Crofton Bluffs and Broken Bow wind projects.","Page 14 is the updated wind development chart. We have updated this chart to reflect the February closing of our wind capital raise, which Ted has already discussed.","In addition to this strategic value for remaining active in development markets, the liquidity benefits for EMG are significant. As a result of the Capistrano Wind Partners equity raise and the recent Tapestry debt raise in December, EME now has 1,406 megawatts of projects that are financed. Of the remaining 575 megawatts that are not financed, 387 megawatts are contracted.","Lastly, as a result of capital resource constraints and limited market opportunities, the development pipeline of potential wind projects has been reduced to 1,300 megawatts from 3,800 megawatts.","Turning to Page 15, EME's corporate cash position is mainly cash at EME and EMMT, improved in the fourth quarter to $951 million, a $217 million increase over last quarter.","Overall in 2011, EME improved its liquidity to the receipt of $388 million of U.S. Treasury grants, $167 million from wind financings -- wind financing distributions and $213 million of tax sharing agreement payments from Edison International.","Deferral of payments under the tax-sharing agreements impacts EMG's liquidity, although it does not have an impact on earnings. As of December 31, EMG recognized $520 million in future tax benefits related to net operating losses and PTC carryforwards under tax-sharing agreements.","The right of EMG to receive in the amount of and timing of tax allocation payments are dependent upon EIX's consolidated tax position. Based on current tax law, EMG is not expected to monetize tax benefits until at least 2013. Also, EMG expects to return tax allocation payments to EIX during 2012 of approximately $185 million. Lastly, permanent closure of merchant coal plants would add to EMG's tax loss position.","One important item to note, on February 27, EME terminated its $600 million revolving credit facility to save fees, primarily because Homer City was part of the collateral package, and the line therefore became effectively not usable. This termination will also release other collateral, as Ted said.","EME facility was due to mature on June 15 of this year and the facility was largely unutilized. The Midwest Gen, credit facility still remains outstanding and expires on June 29 of this year.","Page 16 replaces our usual guidance slide in an effort to provide our investors with some of the operating assumptions for 2012.","That concludes my comments. Operator, let's move to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jonathan Arnold of Deutsche Bank.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I have one question and briefly, perusing the 10-K, you talked about in the event that you transfer the ownership of Homer -- if you cease to become the controller of Homer City, that there would potentially be both ongoing contingencies? Could you speak to what that might refer to?","W. James Scilacci","Okay, just briefly, there's a lot of detail in the Ks that I think you can sort through once you have a little bit of time to look at it. So we impaired investment of Homer City at EME, and there are some additional assets that reside that have not been impaired yet. And so when you actually get to the completion, when we actually transfer the asset, there's approximately, I think the disclosure say, about $170 million of net remaining investments that we would need to write off. The timing from that is uncertain. We're still working through that. I can't give you an expected time frame right yet. It depends upon how it goes with the owner-lessors. There may be some additional items that come up during the course of the discussions and we're trying to define exactly what the liabilities are on either side. But the principle liabilities have been disclosed in our 10-K.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","It's not some sort of ongoing exposure? It's more write off of an existing asset that just hasn't yet been written down?","W. James Scilacci","We would take it to -- there would be no ongoing exposure. We'd take it 0.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And secondly, Ted talked about, it still being the case, that there are important issues that need to get resolved in the 6- to 12-month time frame contrary from the summer, was still valid. Can you just sort of give us some roadmap as to now that this -- with where you are here on Homer, presumably, final resolution of that is one of those items, but just talk us through some of the other points on the road, Ted?","Theodore F. Craver","Jonathan, it's Ted. I think kind of the principle ones are EPA rules need to be finalized. I think we've got a pretty good sense of what those look like. But as you know, there are a couple of important elements still yet to be fully finalized. That in turn would give us a better read on timing and amount of expenditures for retrofits. Second, kind of key one is some of the additional liquidity activities. We still have some parts of our wind portfolio that have the ability for additional financing. So continuing to look at those things. We also talked a little bit about the new equity capital program that we have for the wind development. But in order to realize all of the cash from that, we've got work to get completed. And then I think another important milestone from our perspective is what happens in the capacity market auction in May. That certainly will speak to this kind of byplay between very depressed power prices, making many of the existing generation facilities uneconomic in the PJM marketplace. We're seeing a lot of announced retirements, not just stars, but others. So what impact will that have on the capacity market? I think those are some of the key milestones. There's other stuff that the folks at EMG keep working on to improve liquidity and pull some additional rabbits out of the hat. But the big ones are the ones I mentioned.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And can I just follow up on capacity auction on Homer City and the timing here during the previous auctions, EMMT has been placing that capacity into the auction, I guess. What should we anticipate would happen going into this coming auction with you -- assuming that, say, the ownership still sort of is somewhat in limbo?","W. James Scilacci","Jonathan, it's Jim. I think you just should assume Homer City would fit in to auction. We anticipate the units being available in the future. We'll have to work that out between ourselves and the owner-lessors.","Operator","The next question comes from Dan Eggers of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I guess, just on the Midwestern impairments this quarter, what was the threshold, Jim, made you to decide that these assets will be impaired and other assets would not be impaired? And where would the next decision point be if other assets were to be impaired along the way?","W. James Scilacci","I think every quarter, you have to go through the impairment analysis. It's a standard accounting approach. And what happened between last quarter and this quarter is really the drop in power prices changed the economics. I think the reality of that and given the problems that we've been facing, especially with the in-city, the Fisk and Crawford stations, I think the economics came through that it was clear that it was time to impair those stations. Now we also impaired the Waukegan station. But we haven't made a final determination yet in terms of what we're going to do there. But the reality was that the economics were clear that we needed to take an action. Now we'll continue to look at the other, what you're implying, the other smaller stations, but we haven't made any conclusions. And the current plan is then to retrofit the larger stations, and we're proceeding down that path.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And I guess, Ted, if I could just read your script and maybe this is the hard part about putting out your script, but toward the end when you talk about the financially discipline, not invest new funds in EMG unless we can see a clear and compelling path, can you help us understand what a clear and compelling path would be relative to not putting capital into the business, as you guys have avoided that for so long?","Theodore F. Craver","Yes, I don't think you should expect any change in our viewpoint on it. In fact, that's why the next sentence is in this script, too. In the face of deteriorating financial conditions, which have clearly deteriorated, you can expect we will not be putting any funds in EMG.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I guess, the primary season is coming out -- too many sound bites, I just want to make sure I had that right. And then I guess, the last question is Homer City will be taken out of recurring earnings going forward, so in '12, that will have no bearing on your results from an operating perspective?","W. James Scilacci","Most likely. Yes. As We move it into discontinued operations, that would be the case, you'd have to pluck it out.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","One short-term question, one long-term question. On the shutdown of some of the Midwest Gen units, how should we think about the O&M savings that comes with that?","W. James Scilacci","Okay. Michael, this is Jim. We'll incorporate that into our operating assumptions. The problem here, we haven't given you guidance in terms of what we expect EBITDA or earnings would be for the facilities. And we'll do that as we get the SCE's General Rate Case. But there will be operating savings, capital reductions, that go along with the shutdowns.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And thinking longer term, if there's a scenario where EME has to go through some kind of restructuring, not just asset sales but literally restructuring of the debt, how does the NOL at EME get treated in a situation like that? And is EIX -- I don't want to use the word -- I guess use the words on-the-hook for ensuring that EME in a restructured environment gets access to the cash flow it would have gotten had it stayed within the broader EIX umbrella?","W. James Scilacci","Okay, that's a complicated question. I think just go back to the most simplest form. EIX, the way it works under the tax-sharing agreement, it uses a consolidated approach. So therefore, if the consolidated return has available capacity to monetize tax benefits, then the dollars flow either to SCE or EMG based on the actual situation. Now if an entity were deconsolidated from the parent, it could then no longer monetize tax losses that reside within that entity. And so I think that's the simplest way that you can think about it.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","But could that entity, if deconsolidated, would be deconsolidated and would effectively be able to, over its own time and course, assuming financial conditions permit, be able to monetize that NOL on its own?","W. James Scilacci","The NOL would reside with that entity if it were deconsolidated. And then whatever happens going forward, it would depend upon the earnings and losses of that entity. It would not affect the consolidated entity of EIX.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jay Dobson of Wunderlich Securities.","James L. Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","Jim, just to follow up on the last question, and maybe I'm reading too much into your comments. Discontinued operations, is this going to happen, not going to happen? I just try and understand what would be the determining factors. Since you wrote it down, it appears you're transferring it to the owner-lessor. Would seem like that sort of a no-brainer, but maybe I'm misunderstanding that.","W. James Scilacci","I think you got right. So once we've finalized this transition, and we don't know when it's going to be over, we would likely, at that point, move it to discontinued operations.","James L. Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","So there's no question, it's going there. It's just more your sort of hesitancy there was when it's going to happen, not if it's going to happen?","W. James Scilacci","It's the likely outcome.","James L. Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","What would make it not the outcome?","W. James Scilacci","It's going to go down a transition path. I guess, I don't want to go through every possible avenue here, but we expect it at some point in time to go to discontinued operations.","James L. Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","So you've written off your entire equity interest so the way it wouldn't go to discontinued operation is if you thought there was still some value there? Is that the fairest way to think or maybe not the fairest, the simplest way to think about it?","W. James Scilacci","No, the way it is, just for clarification, we believe the fair value of Homer City is 0. The way have to go through it, the accounting is complicated and it's very clear, if I model it here in the disclosures in terms of how it's treated. So we take in the first step, it essentially wrote off the majority of the investment. There's a portion of the investment that's at fair value, and that's the remaining piece that will, once we transition it to discontinued operations, will have to be written off.","James L. Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","That's the $170 million you were speaking of earlier?","W. James Scilacci","Yes.","James L. Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","And then, Ted, back to the 6 to 12 months, I think as you said in the script, there were certainly those of us who've been listening, have heard it since round about last summer. So roughly June or about the time we'll have results for the PGM capacity auction would be sort of that line in the sand. Should we continue to think about it? I mean, I guess, some of us still struggle with this at a firm 6 to 12 months or is it a rolling 6 to 12 months. And understand the variables continue to change, not all of which are helpful, but maybe just sort of reaffirm your sort of message on that, if you would?","Theodore F. Craver","Yes, I'll reaffirm it and clarify it to some degree. It was last summer that I started talking about 6 to 12 months, which is basically trying to suggest between the EPA rules that we knew were going to end up having to be promulgated by the end of the year, which would be the 6 months to all the way around to the auction, which would take place in May, which is getting pretty close to 12 months, we figured that by summer of 2012, we would have most of the factors that we needed to come to conclusions about which units would be retrofitted, therefore, what the capital cost would be. If we were to not retrofit certain units and close them down, what would be the savings that would come from that? And how would we kind of refocus EMG as a result of those decisions, which would fill in one of the big blanks, that is what's the capital requirement for retrofits of the coal fleet. The second part is we were going to start facing some retirements in the revolver, the maturity of the revolver. And then fairly soon after that, we'd be into the $500 million of the 2013s and so on. And our keen desire is to kind of take all those factors, as well as our outlook for where power prices would be, and conclude whether we could really stabilize EMG or not. And the stabilization is meeting the capital requirements, as well as trying to pay down a healthy chunk of debt, particularly the debt maturing in 2013, 2016, such that we would have sufficient credit metrics for EMG to be self-sustaining or that said differently, refinance its 2017 and beyond on the basis of its own credit metrics. That, to us, was the definition of stabilization. We felt we would have most of the information we would need, coupled with some outlooks on power prices to conclude whether we, in fact, could stabilize EMG. And we still are on that path, as I said in my prepared remarks. But still, our intention is some time in the summer of this year being able to have those discussions with investors. Obviously, main part of the plan that has not worked is power prices recovery. They have not recovered, they've only gotten worse. So that constrains cash, it constrains our liquidity, that makes the ability to stabilize EMG much more difficult.","James L. Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","And I guess, the last follow-up on that, and I'm sure you don't want to get into your proprietary view of power prices, but would it be fair to say if power prices remain on about the forward curve where they are right now, we need to pursue some sort of restructuring?","Theodore F. Craver","As we said in the script, we would need to -- if these conditions persist, we would need to consider divesting assets to raise liquidity and consider restructuring or reorganizing the capital structure. So we won't make any predictions as to where all of that goes at this point, but if we have a prolonged period of low power prices, it constrains the liquidity sufficiently that we'd have to consider those other actions.","W. James Scilacci","Jay, I'll just add to that, too, I know you're listening, that I think we've had our view and we've heard -- you've heard it from us any number of times, as we've entered into the agreement with Illinois EPA, that we believe strongly that coal plants would be shutting down and we're seeing that now, and that would lead to an improvement in capacity values. I think the question that Ted was addressing, you were raising, had to do with energy values. But we still hold the view, capacity values re-rising in the PJM market.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Fleishman of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Steven I. Fleishman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just to maybe follow-on with Jay's question. We still have pretty liquid or good debt markets and loan markets. And let's say, those allow you to deal with a lot of the near-term maturities, the 2013s, and that gives you, at this point, maybe another 3-year time line, is that enough? Or do you need to be able to prove that there's value out till 2016, '17 ? Because, as you know, there'll be a lot of assumptions that need to have made to deal with that?","W. James Scilacci","Steve, this is Ted. It's going to be difficult to foresee all of the different possibilities here. But let me try to give you a general steer of the way we're thinking about it. If all we're doing is kind of limping from one quarter to the next, we don't really see how we reach a stabilization of EME. And that's not a very appealing prospect from our perspective. So we are, to some degree, seeking to force the question, will we be able to stabilize EMG? And as I said, I think that fundamentally means we have to be able to meet the capital requirements for the retrofits of the plants that we do believe are economic and should continue to run. Number two, we have to take out some debt. And we have to be able to see somewhere over this next 3 to 4 years that we'll be able to generate sufficient liquidity to meet those CapEx requirements and reduce debt such that by the time we get to the '17s, we can see that this is going to actually generate sufficient credit metrics for refinancing. If we can't see how that looks possible, then I don't think we have a stabilized entity and we'll just be lurching from quarter-to-quarter. So our goal here, and again, come back to the 6- to 12-month kind of concept is, by the summer, that we have a sharp idea of whether or not we'll be able to stabilize EMG.","Steven I. Fleishman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And just to clarify, in the event that you determine that you won't be able to stabilize it, what exactly do you do? I mean, you're already not committing any new money to it. So what are the exact things you would actually then do if you make that determination?","Theodore F. Craver","I think at that point, you're looking at restructuring, reorganizing the capital structure. I don't think there's any other outcome.","Steven I. Fleishman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I'm going to go so far as actually asking a utility question...","Theodore F. Craver","It's entirely acceptable.","Steven I. Fleishman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Since it's probably more than 100% of the value of the company. The one thing you didn't mention that occurred, I think, since your last call, was these windstorms that you had and seem like you had a decent amount of reaction to that. Could you just give us some sense of kind of what happened there? And is there anything operationally you're changing in reaction to that and how you're thinking about that?","W. James Scilacci","Steve, we'll have Ron Litzinger address that.","Ronald L. Litzinger","Yes, Steve, clearly, there's been the report by the consumer protection and safety division, the public participation hearing that occurred on the regulatory front. From our perspective, we have done a thorough root cause evaluation of our response in the windstorm. We will be coming out with that report shortly, and we've agreed to share that with the commission. And in addition to that, we have engaged an independent consulting firm to do an independent evaluation of our performance as well, which we will take note of and make our corrections to our practices and our procedures going forward.","Operator","The next question comes from Jon Cohen of ISI Group.","Jonathan Cohen - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","I just had a question about your interim environmental compliance strategy using ultra-low sulfur coal. How many years do you think that will allow you to sort of scape by under the CPS-mandated emissions limits? And will that get you out to the '15, '16 time frame or is that going to be earlier than that?","W. James Scilacci","I think just -- we're not going to give you amounts or how much we're buying and what the price and whatnot. I think just bear in mind that we're going to do a combination of things. It's going to be low sulfur coal and we'll be installing removal technology. And we have very steep reductions that are required because low sulfur coal will only get you so far. And as you look at the CPS numbers out beyond '14, there are steep drop-offs. So that's where you really require capital expenditures for the dry sorbent injection systems to get you to those lower levels.","Jonathan Cohen - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","I think that answered the question. So 2014 is where the sort of threshold is.","W. James Scilacci","I wouldn't stop there. You would continue using it and in combination of the equipment that's how much dry sorbent you need to inject. So there's a combination of things you do here to get to the numbers that are -- that's part of the agreement.","Jonathan Cohen - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","And then one other question on your coal contract. You mentioned that if you shutdown plants, the volumes under the contract reduce. Are there minimum volumes that are allocated to the plant level? In other words, are there minimum volumes for Powerton, Joliet and Will County?","W. James Scilacci","I can't get into the specifics of the contract, but there's a mechanism we have in place that we can adjust accordingly based on the plant that's taken out of service.","Operator","The next question comes from Travis Miller of Morningstar.","Travis Miller - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","I wanted to follow-up real quick on that last point on the transportation. That $386 million a year that you mentioned, does that already contemplate the potential closures, the Homer City withdrawal and then just kind of a mark-to-market dispatch at current market conditions? Or is there a downside potential for that $386 million?","W. James Scilacci","I think based on the disclosures we had to go through and expected amounts reflects that. To the extent that we shutdown plants in the future, because we're looking at the plant shutdowns don't occur until '13 and beyond. So I wouldn't expect to affect the '12.","Travis Miller - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","And then on the potential legal challenges, do you think there's anything there for HAPs MACT like you guys went through with Casper? And how could some kind of legal developments that you're involved in relate to your decisions around what to do with Homer City or anything at the Midwest Gen?","W. James Scilacci","We'll have Pedro Pizarro address that.","Pedro J. Pizarro","Yes. Just briefly, on HAPs MACT, I can't speculate on whether others may file legal challenges or how the courts will view that. I will say that we have been generally supportive of the final form of HAPs MACT or MATS as it's now called. So we're certainly, at this point, not contemplating a challenge. On Casper, we did file the challenge there or Homer City actually filed the legal challenge there. And those -- they're not of Homer City given the impacts on the Homer City project, we've disclosed that we don't foresee significant impacts from Casper as written the Midwest Gen fleet. So the Homer City will continue to pursue its legal path as the court now has granted the motion for stay and we'll be going into our hearings later this year.","Travis Miller - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","And then one quick. Is the oil peaker at Fisk included in the shutdown?","Theodore F. Craver","No.","Travis Miller - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","That will continue running?","Theodore F. Craver","It's not part of the shutdown.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Fremont of Jefferies.","Paul B. Fremont - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I guess, first question would be, it looks like -- or if I understood you correctly, the write-off of the 3 EMG units resulted in a $0.06 tax benefit to the -- on a consolidated basis to the holding company. What would -- are you able to quantify what the associated tax benefit would be if the rest of EMG were written-off?","W. James Scilacci","Paul, I think you got the -- there's different things that are going on here, so let me step back for a second. If you look at Page 5 of our investor deck, the write-off, all the write-offs that occurred, the impairment charges that were taken in the fourth quarter, resulted in a non-core charge at the holding company of $0.06. There is also, in core earnings, a deferred tax adjustment that was a positive. So one's in non-core, one's in core. I just wanted to make sure I clarify what was going on there. And it is hard to keep track of both these things. But I can tell you, if we're to write-off the whole thing what the deferred tax adjustment would be for the holding company, the reason for the non-core $0.06 adjustment that occurred at the holding company in the fourth quarter has to do with how state income taxes, the apportioned state income taxes, that is a very complicated and detailed discussion, and I just don't have any information that I can get into you on any kind of relevant degree. But periodically, and I think you'll remember last year, every once in a while, based on the way income is a apportioned through our various companies, we will either take a benefit or take a loss depending upon how we foresee the apportionment changing.","Paul B. Fremont - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","So I guess what I'm trying to get at is, is there a way to determine what the worthless tax deductions would be associated with an EMG write-down?","W. James Scilacci","Unfortunately, we have not put that information in the public domain. You can see the book value of the remaining Midwest Gen assets, that is now clearly spelled out in the disclosures. We've previously showed that to you in a prior quarter. And you can see what's happening with Homer City. So a lot of the information, as far as the book value perspective, is in the public domain. We just don't have the tax basis in there.","Paul B. Fremont - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","And then moving on to the utility. It seems every -- it seems if you basically just take the rate base, equity ratio and the ROE, the company keeps coming in sort of at levels that are above what would be implied. So is there something that we need to think about from a modeling perspective, either efficiency, adders or other incentives when we model SCE on a going-forward basis?","W. James Scilacci","I think we're going to continue to provide information using what we'll call the simplified methodology, the one you started with. There are things that occur year-to-year, and I think we had some tax benefits that flowed through in the fourth quarter, that's why you're seeing some of the outperformance. At times, embedded cost of debt provides a benefit, but you can have other parts of the business where you're overspending. So that covers -- so we have outperformance in one area can cover underperformance in others. So we're going to keep coming back to that simplified approach.","Paul B. Fremont - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","And then just following up on Steve's question on the OII. You have another OII that's outstanding, relating to the Santa Barbara fires and that seems to be taking forever in terms of getting through that proceeding? Is there anything in terms of the claims arising from Santa Barbara that would allow us to make an assessment on sort of the monetary exposure in the windstorms?","W. James Scilacci","Yes. Let me just clarify on that and we'll turn it over to Ron to give you some additional details. So that's the Malibu fire situation, and there's additional disclosures that's updated in the 10-K when you have an opportunity to take a look at that. But I'll turn it over to Ron now.","Ronald L. Litzinger","Yes, the Malibu Fire OII is continuing. That proceeding continues. It has been a long one. Just to be clear, with regard to the OII from the San Gabriel Valley windstorm, there has not been an OII announced at this point.","Operator","This concludes the question-and-answer session. At this time, I will turn the call back to Mr. Cunningham.","Scott Cunningham","Thanks very much, everyone. Please don't hesitate to follow-up this evening, I know for a lot of you, and certainly tomorrow for any follow-up questions. Thanks very much.","Operator","This concludes today's conference.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Edison International Fourth Quarter 2013 Financial Teleconference. [Operator Instructions].","Today's call is being recorded and I would now like to turn call over to Mr. Scott Cunningham, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. Mr. Cunningham, you may begin.","Scott Cunningham","Thanks, Shirley, and good afternoon everyone. We apologize for the short delay on the start of the call. Our principal speakers today will be Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Ted Craver; Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Jim Scilacci. Also with us are other members of the management team.","The presentation that accompanies Jim's comments, the earnings press release and our Form 10-K are available on our website at www.edisoninvestor.com. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements about the financial outlook for Edison International and its subsidiaries and about other future events. Actual results could differ materially from current expectations. Important factors that could cause different results are set forth in our SEC filings. We encourage you to read these carefully. The presentation includes certain outlook assumptions, as well as reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the nearest GAAP measure. When we get to Q&A, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. If you have further questions, please return to the queue.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Ted Craver.","Theodore (Ted) Craver Jr.","Thank you, Scott, and good afternoon everyone. Today Edison International reported full year quarter earnings of $3.80, $0.10 above the high end of our earnings guidance range. Core earnings for 2013 were down slightly from last year's $3.92 per share, reflecting in part, the impact of closing the San Onofre nuclear plant.","We also introduced 2014 earnings guidance, core earnings guidance of $3.60 to $3.80 per share. Jim will provide additional information on all of this shortly.","In the last several investor calls, my remarks have centered on our three key strategic priorities; delivering long term growth in earnings and dividends, resolving the uncertainties of EME and SONGS and positioning our company to capitalize on transformative change in our industry.","Today, I will mostly touch on the subjects of our growth prospects and resolving uncertainties, where there have been several developments.","For the last several years, at Southern California Edison, we have had the twin objectives of stepping up our infrastructure investments to maintain reliability and modernize the grid, and providing cost benefits to rate payers through operational efficiencies. This continued focus on keeping rates affordable and fair for all of our customers, while investing in the grid, has also provided strong earnings power for our investors. This is demonstrated by our stronger than forecast core earnings in 2013, and by our decision last December to increase the common stock dividend for the 10th year in a row, to an annual rate of $1.42 per share.","SCE continues to target high levels of infrastructure replacement and reliability investments, while meeting public policy requirements. In our 2015 general rate case application pending before the CPUC, our testimony reflects a significant increase in infrastructure replacement activity for the 2015 to 2017 rate cycle. This investment is primarily aimed at our distribution system. The rate case application, also forecast a need for sustained investment at these levels, out through 2020 and beyond.","Therefore, we continue to anticipate significant rate base growth for the foreseeable future. Our updated forecast has not changed materially, and SCE continues to forecast a rate base of between $27 billion and $29 billion by 2017, and a growth rate of 7% to 9% annually through this period. Not yet knowing the outcome of the CPUC proceeding on SONGS, this forecast continues to exclude any rate base contribution from our investment, this forecast continues to exclude any rate base contribution from our investment in SONGS.","As for the DRC proceeding itself, the CPUC is in the early procedural stages and we continue to respond to information requests from interveners. We expect evidentiary hearings to be scheduled for the summer. But the CPUC has yet to set the exact schedule.","A key initiative in 2013 involved in the coal reform and customer rate design, which was meaningfully advanced with the passage of California's assembly bill 327. This law returned authority to the CPUC to adjust rate design, including a fixed charge and simplifying the tiered residential rate structure.","We are in the early stages, but this law provides an opportunity to reduce subsidies and costs shifting amongst residential rate payers, along with simplifying the rate structures.","All of these actions help provide the regulatory underpinning to support long term earnings growth, while maintaining the impact of higher rates, while managing the impact of higher rates on our customers; and in turn, they help support our dividend policy, which is a targeted pay out ratio of 45% to 55% of FCE earnings.","We continue to see the opportunity and steps over time to return the dividend pay out back to this target ratio. While we are mindful of pending regulatory uncertainties, we believe the opportunity for meaningful dividend growth remains an important element of the Edison International investment pieces.","Let me now turn to our efforts to resolve uncertainties; last week of course, we announced a settlement agreement, which we believe will provide the resolution to a key uncertainty for investors, the EME bankruptcy. As you heard during last week's call, the agreement will settle all outstanding matters with EME and its creditors. The agreement provides the opportunity for a cash flow positive outcome, and honors our commitment to not put new capital into EME.","On February 19, EME sought approval of the bankruptcy to amend its plan of reorganization to include the settlement and to give notice to the creditors regarding the plan change. The court approved giving notice to the creditors and rescheduled its conformation hearing on the plan to March 11. Subject to approval of the bankruptcy court, implementation of the plan of reorganization will allow EME to proceed with the sale to substantiate all of its assets to NRG and close on our settlement agreement.","This leaves one major uncertainty to resolve, the recovery of our costs related to SONGS. We continue to express to the CPUC, our strong interest in having it complete its four phase regulatory review this year. We are hopeful that our concerns with the phase one proposed decision, will be addressed such that the commission can complete action on this stage and move on to the remaining phases in the not too distant future. We anticipate in the first quarter, a proposed decision on the second phase, which addresses recovery of investment in SONGS. We also anticipate a proposed schedule for the third phase, which will cover the broad questions of reasonableness and prudency around our actions, and those of the supplier of the faulty steam generators, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries.","We continue to assert that the steam generator tube leak that occurred after only 11 months of operating time and the resulting damages, represent a total and fundamental failure of performance by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. We must insist that MHI be held accountable for its failure to provide properly functioning steam generators, and for the damage it has inflicted on our customers and our company. Simply put, they should stand behind their product.","Southern California Edison has filed for significant claims against MHI for damages in the International Chamber of Commerce Arbitration process. We will also continue to push aggressively to seek a federal will [ph] determination from NEIL, the nuclear industry insurer, for our outage related power purchase claims.","Recent conversations with NEIL lead us to expect their initial determination after their board meets in mid-June. Along with the resolution of the SONGS OII, we are planning for the replacement resources required to ensure grid's reliability without SONGS and for the safe and efficient decommissioning of SONGS.","With the assistance of third party experts, we are developing an updated site-specific decommissioning plan. This plan is expected to be completed by midyear. Also, we are creating appropriate channels for public participation, to ensure an open and transparent decommissioning planning process.","Although it wasn't one of our two critical uncertainties, we are pleased SCE was able to complete the sale of its interest in the Four Corners coal-fired generation facility in late December to Arizona Public Service for $181 million.","The transaction benefits our customers and meets an important California requirement to discontinue investments in generation not meeting stringent greenhouse gas emission performance standards. It has no earnings impact on Southern California Edison.","So with that, let me now turn the call over to Jim Scilacci.","William Scilacci","Thanks Ted and good afternoon everyone. My comments focus on the following topics; financial results, updates on capital spending, rate base on fuel and purchase power, and 2014 earnings guidance.","Please turn to page 2; for the fourth quarter of 2013, core earnings are $0.81 per share. The comparison to the fourth quarter last year is not particularly helpful, because SCE's 2012 CPUC general rate case decision was recorded in the fourth quarter of last year. The quarter-over-quarter comparison is summarized at the right of the slide. The earnings drivers are the same things we have been discussing all year. For SCE< the year-over-year comparison is more informative.","Before I go there, I want to comment on fourth quarter results at the holding company. EIX recorded $0.02 per share of earnings, $0.08 better than last year, largely due to $0.06 per share of higher earnings from Edison Capital. As we had previously mentioned, Edison Capital has a small investment portfolio, including affordable housing investments. This portfolio con to wind down and periodically, we will record income from sales or distributions. It is difficult to predict the timing and amount of income from the remaining portfolio and we have not and will not include any income in our guidance numbers. As a reminder, holding company costs generally run a bit more than $0.01 per month.","In addition to the Edison Capital income, the holding company also had $0.02 per share of lower cost in taxes. A non-core item of $0.11 per share in discontinued operations is from Edison Mission Energy, for ongoing adjustments to income taxes. As a result, we moved the accounting for EME to discontinued operations following its bankruptcy, filed in the fourth quarter of 2012. For the end of 2013, we now have recorded $70 million from adjustments related to the outcome of the EME bankruptcy, including estimated retained tax benefits from the deconsolidation of EME for tax purposes.","As we have reported last week in our EME Settlement conference call, we expect to record an additional $130 million during the first quarter of 2014, assuming the bankruptcy court approves EME's amended Plan of Reorganization. Together, this adds up to the estimated $200 million of income EME settlement is expected to produce.","I'd also like to note, that based on our updated disclosures, we have recorded $290 million of joint tax and $35 million of joint pension liabilities, for a total of $325 million as of December 31, 2013. Under the settlement agreement, we would also assume certain executive retirement obligations. In total, we have estimated these liabilities would be approximately $315 million as of the closing.","Please turn to page 3; as Ted has already mentioned, EIX's 2013 core earnings are $3.80 per share. On a year-over-year basis, this is slightly behind last year, SONGS accounts for most of the difference, because we stopped recording a full return on investment and related AFUDC earnings since the shutdown decision was made. The other major reason for the decline, is a reduction in income tax benefits in 2013 compared to 2012. The increased earnings from rate base growth in 2013 were offset by the lower CPUC authorized return on common equity. To make it helpful in comparing full year results with our updated guidance from the third quarter call, we have added a slide on page 4, to highlight the changes.","On full year core results came in -- our full year core results came in $0.15 per share above the midpoint of the guidance that we last updated on October 29. $0.08 per share improvement is largely cost savings at SCE. Holding Company results are better by $0.07 per share, largely from Edison Capital earnings, that were not included in our guidance and were booked in the fourth quarter. One last point I'd like to emphasize is the track record of rate base and earnings growth that SCE has achieved over the last several years.","Please turn to page 5 of the deck; since 2008, the compound annual growth rates of rate base and core earnings are 10% and 12% respectively. This is a rather remarkable achievement for our industry.","Looking forward, next I will provide updates on capital spending and rate base, please turn to page 6. From our prior forecast, the 2014 through 2017 capital forecast increased $400 million. The increase reflects the catch-up of 2013 GRC capital expenditures into 2014, together with updated transmission cost estimates, including FAA requirements for the Tehachapi project.","During 2014, a major focus for us, is to ensure that we invest the capital dollars authorized by the CPUC for infrastructure replacement and reliability related projects.","For 2013, SCE's actual capital spending was $3.5 billion or $300 million below our forecast. This was largely due to transmission delays and lower cost on two completed renewable transmission projects in 2013, as well as a slower than planned ramp-up of an infrastructure replacement spending, even though we were able to increase reliability infrastructure investments, $300 million over 2012. Historical capital expenditures are shown in the appendix to this deck.","Please note, that our current capital forecast does not including spending for storage projects, preferred resources to replace San Onofre or transmission projects that are currently included in the Cal ISOs resource plan. Potential expenditures for projects like these are currently under consideration.","Please turn to page 7; as Ted mentioned, our rate base forecast reflects only minor changes, with a net $100 million decrease by 2017. The growth rate remains at 7% to 9% per year through 2017. Once we get a phase two decision and a SONGS OII, which is considering if some portion of SONGS is still used and useful, we will then update our forecast accordingly.","On page 8, we have updated the status of our fuel and purchase power, of what we refer to as ERRA. We look to get a CPUC approval this spring of our 2014 forecast proceeding. You may recall from last year, that the CPUC had deferred consideration of a portion of the ERRA costs that relate to SONGS shutdown decision, until the overall SONGS regulatory review is completed. We have provided an updated estimated of the 2013 net SONGS costs of $467 million, and have agreed to defer collection until consideration of the OII, if we receive a timely decision of our 2014 forecast proceeding.","Overall, SCE has under collected -- was under collected by just over $1 billion in this account by year end 2013. While the ERRA situation was important from a near term liquidity perspective, we believe that SONGS OII will be the key driver for recovering SONGS replacement power costs.","I should also mention that, while we focused investor attention on the ERRA under collection, we have added to our disclosures and noted at the bottom of the slide, that for all regulatory balancing accounts, SCE had a net over collection of $554 million at year end 2013. At the same time, SCE had availability of $2.46 billion under its $2.75 billion credit facility.","On page 9, I have noted a couple of procedural updates on our 2015 general rate case. First, the two assigned ALJs hosted a pre-hearing conference on February of 11, where the schedule for public participation meetings and details on the timeline for hearings and motions were discussed. We anticipate the ALJs will publish a schedule shortly. We continue to press for a timely decision by the end of 2014. However, over the last few years, the investor on utilities in California have experienced delays in receiving their final GOC decisions. Also with the sale of Four Corners, we are updating our GRC request to remove SCE share of cost related to this coal-fired plant. This will lower the requested revenue requirement modestly in each year. The revenue requirement numbers on page 9 incorporate the sale of Four Corners.","Next, I'd like to provide some perspective on key assumptions behind our 2014 earnings guidance, please turn to page 10. You will recall that, when we first gave 2013 earnings guidance, [indiscernible] that we would expect both 2013 and 2014 earnings would exceed the simplified rate base earnings model that we have discussed for some time. This was because cost savings and income tax benefits were expected to be realized. We also indicated that these benefits will be trued-up in the 2015 general rate case, and would not apply to earnings in 2015 and beyond. We still believe this to be the case.","For 2014, the simplified rate base model would yield earnings per share of $3.40 for SCE. To be clear, we are using a 2014 rate base forecast of $22.1 billion from page 6. This rate base number is the midpoint between the request and range cases. We have excluded SONGS rate base pending the decision in phase two of the songs OII proceeding. The authorized return on common equity for both CPUC and FERC is 10.45%. Our assumptions also include a 48% common equity ratio and a flat share count. We then see a net upside of $0.45 per share at SCE. We deduct $0.07 per share to account for the remaining 52% of the capital structure related to SONGS, cost of debt, and preferred stock. There are $0.52 of positive items primarily related to O&M, additional income tax benefits and energy efficiency.","The 2014 guidance also assumes $0.15 per share in holding company costs. We'd assume no non-core impacts in our guidance. We plan to update our non-core guidance based on the outcome of the EME bankruptcy. The Bankruptcy Court, as Ted said, is scheduled to consider the EME Plan of Reorganization on March 11. This gets us to the midpoint of $3.70 per share for both core and basic EPS, with a range of $3.60 to $3.80 per share. We have noted the major assumptions on the right side of the slide.","In conclusion of my remarks, I will make a few additional points, please turn to page 11. As Ted said, our main goal is about creating shareholder value. From a financial perspective, that means delivering on rate base and earnings growth objectives, while generating sufficient cash flow to support both our capital plans and common dividend growth objectives, without the need for additional common equity.","That concludes my comments. I'd like to turn the call over to the operator for Q&A now.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from Mr. Dan Eggers.","Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse","Good afternoon guys.","Theodore (Ted) Craver Jr.","Hi Dan.","Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse","I guess question number one, just as it relates to the GRC with all the ERRA balance announcement over cost of [ph] revenues that you guys have put out there in projections for higher gas prices and renewables. What sort of bill inflation are you guys projecting for kind of 2014, 2015, 2016 for customers based on plan?","William Scilacci","Good question. Generally, when we talk with investors, its our goal to target somewhere between 3% and 5% annual increases in the total bill. So you have to take -- you got different pieces, you got fuel and purchase power, base rates, transmission and the like. But 3% to 5% is the internal objective that we try to target. Now, for 2014, I am not sure exactly where that comes in, maybe slightly higher, but we will be working that as we go through the regulatory process.","Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse","Okay, got it. And then I guess just on the OII process, with OII-3, kind of each 1 and 2 seeming to kind of try to long, are there still expectations that three can have some visibility in the second quarter, and so it can just kind of drift later into the summer, before there is kind of visibilities to where the commission's haven't?","William Scilacci","I think the key thing, Dan, is where do you put the scoping memo to come out, and based on Ted's comments, we anticipate that somewhere before the end of the first quarter, maybe slightly later, we should see something from the Commission and that will be really a good indicator of what's the timeframe for all this to be.","Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse","Okay. Thank you guys.","William Scilacci","Okay.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mr. Julien Smith. Your line is now open.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS","Good afternoon.","Theodore (Ted) Craver Jr.","Hi Julien.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS","Hey, could you follow-up on the last question, just given balancing accounts and all that. From a cash flow perspective how do you think about this year, and the use of short term debt, just given prior comments on prior calls?","William Scilacci","It's a good question. Right now we have very limited amount that's been used on our lines, that was in my script, was about $175 million of commercial paper that was outstanding at the end of the year. And that will ebb and flow, as we go through the course of the year, and it really sort of dictated -- that was dictated by our capital expenditures and the timeliness of decision making around the ERRA decision, and just normal fuel and purchase power fluctuations that occur at an important time. So its really hard to predict at the end of the year, where we will be, because you have so many unknowns that have to be decided here. So I will pause here and let Linda or Ron to see if you want to add anything else to the answer?","Ronald Litzinger","Okay. As we go through the course of the year, we will watch that and slide. The key things are, the decisions that need to come from the commission, which will affect in our liquidity.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS","Got you. Are there any chunky items outside of that, that affects cash flow that might not be otherwise intuitive?","William Scilacci","The only other thing I did mention, it could be one -- at the holding company, if you see the approval of the settlement, we could use commercial paper volumes or drawings on our bank lines at the holding company, to make the initial payment to the creditors, that's $225 million at the close. Then we have -- you monetize tax benefits during the course of the year. September is when we typically file our tax return. So we will just have to look to see what happens, in terms of what we actually receive and what we are able to monetize, based on the tax positions of the utility and the consolidated entity. And then at the utility, I think I covered this. There is nothing really that jumps out.","With these financings [indiscernible] thing that occurs at the utility. We typically build up some short term borrowings, and then go out and issue $300 million, $400 million, $500 million of long term debt, and then that will be used to repay commercial paper borrowings. So that's the normal trend. Ron?","Ronald Litzinger","The greenhouse gas revenues and costs, those can be chunky as well.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS","Got you. And just a quick clarifications on the slides, on the transmission spending, I know you guys revised that upwards. Anything pending there again, just leftover? Is that all taken care of at this point?","William Scilacci","There is lot of things going on in that area in terms of what's pending. We still have some more work to do on Tehachapi, in terms of getting cost approvals. We just recently got one -- Ron, why don't you go ahead and fill in the details around what the recent cost increases were approved for one of the projects, and for Tehachapi?","Ronald Litzinger","We submitted an advice letter on our Devers-Colorado project to raise the cost cap that was approved by the commission. We now appeal. That project will come within that cost cap, and that positions us well for the ultimate cost recovery at FERC.","Tehachapi, we will submit our revised costs by probably the end of this year, to reflect Chino Hills, the FAA and then cost increases that we have experienced over time; that's likely to be an application and a little lengthier process. But again, ultimate cost recovery is at FERC.","The other items that has come in on our transmission projects, is the commission did approve our petition to modify and put the voltage control equipment back into the project which they had previously taken out, which from a schedule perspective, was helpful for us.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS","Right. In aggregate, what is that in total dollars if you could kind of summarize what the pending is, if there is an event there?","Ronald Litzinger","On voltage control?","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS","Or credit in aggregate, but specifically.","William Scilacci","It's shown in the chart, everything is in there.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS","Great. Thank you very much.","William Scilacci","Okay Julien.","Operator","Our next call comes from Mr. Michael Lapides from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs","Hey guys. Thank you for taking my questions today. Quickly, in the prepared remarks, you talked about some of the incremental capital opportunities that actually weren't in the capital spending guidance levels, and one of the things you touched on, with the Cal-ISO potential incremental transmission. Can you give a little more color around that, both in terms of process for the uncertainty about what that could be, if anything, and just size and scale?","Theodore (Ted) Craver Jr.","Yeah, we wanted to give you a sense further -- some things that are on the, I'd say, the periphery of our capital expenditures forecast; because those are a little bit further out in time. And Ron is going to pick up the detail in what we are actually -- there is a particular project, an economic project that we are looking at right now.","Ronald Litzinger","Yeah, from a reliability perspective, I believe the plan does include our [indiscernible], but as Jim pointed out, that's down the track, way later in the decade. The Delaney-Colorado river line was also included in the plants, since that is a economic line, that would be subject to competition and determinates in our territory, we have every intention of participating.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs","Meaning, that project is in your current CapEx guidance, or in the plan submitted by Cal-ISO but not necessarily, included in your outlook?","Ronald Litzinger","Its in the plan, just come out by the Cal-ISO, it was not incorporated into our capital spending plans yet.","William Scilacci","Michael, [indiscernible] go back, that was the old Devers DPV2 line, Arizona portion. So it has come back as an economic line.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs","And how big of a -- what are we talking in terms of capital and in terms of years to build?","William Scilacci","We are still working on it, but that's still yet to be determined.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs","Got it. Okay, thanks guys. Much appreciated.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gregg Orrill. Your line is now open.","Gregg Orrill - Barclays Capital","Thank you.","Theodore (Ted) Craver Jr.","Hi Gregg.","Gregg Orrill - Barclays Capital","Just was wondering if there was an update on San Onofre settlement talks, that there is still a path for that regarding the OIIs?","Theodore (Ted) Craver Jr.","We really don't have anything that we can talk about on that one. Sorry.","Gregg Orrill - Barclays Capital","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Stephen Byrd from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley","Good afternoon.","Theodore (Ted) Craver Jr.","Hi Stephen.","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley","I wanted to talk actually about the longer term point you raised about transformative sector change, and you mentioned legislative advocacy AB 327 implementation. I wondered if you could just talk broadly to -- as you see the [indiscernible] debate and the key change that needs to be made, to make sure that as renewables are brought on to the grid, they are done so in a thoughtful way.","Theodore (Ted) Craver Jr.","Well I kind of touched on it in my remarks. Basically AB 327 reinstated the California Public Utilities Authority to do rate design, and give them some general parameters around fixed charge, reducing the number of tiers, deciding what the grandfather in period would be to our existing distributed generation projects using that metering, that energy metering and what the new net energy metering tariff will be, few other things in there as well. But those are the main parts.","So that's now going to be -- decide to give a number of proceedings before the California Public Utilities Commission. I think our general point of view was, the legislator clearly made their intentions around this clear, both the Senate and the Assembly passed the legislation with super majorities, signed by the governor. So there is pretty clear indication of what the overall direction should be. The details are going to unfold over the next few years here.","I think we feel that broadly speaking, the value of that legislation in the upcoming activity by the PUS is that, it should meaningfully address what we see as subsidies, and more importantly cost shifting among sectors within the retail residential rates; and that should be, I think a net benefit for fairness for all customers.","The other part that we see that's beneficial is, it's a good move towards establishing some level of fixed charge. We have large fixed costs associated with maintaining the reliability of the grid, and this just recognizes some of that. So those are kind of the broad policy points that we expect to see, implemented through AB 327 and the PUC actions related to that.","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley","Understood. Is there any sense of the time table over which that deliberation process will take place?","Theodore (Ted) Craver Jr.","Well it will probably be over the course of some years. It won't be all this year, but there will be some important moves, even as early as here in 2014.","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley","Great. Thank you very much.","Theodore (Ted) Craver Jr.","You're welcome.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mr. Ali Agha. Your line is now open.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Thank you. Good afternoon.","Theodore (Ted) Craver Jr.","Hey Ali.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Hey. Jim, you mentioned in your remarks, that your rate base numbers obviously exclude SONGS, but once the phase two decision comes out, you will relook at those rate base numbers. Would that also be a time for you to relook at your guidance for 2014, depending on what you do with that SONGS rate base?","William Scilacci","I think clearly if the commission came out and allowed some portion of SONGS to be considered useful and actually receive the return on common equity as the important piece, and for that matter, because we have excluded $0.07, you can see in the guidance for 2014 for debt and preferred stock, surely we would go ahead and adjust guidance for that purpose.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Okay. And second question, can you remind us at the end of the year, what was the equity ratio at Edison, that's used for rate making purposes?","William Scilacci","The weighted average, 30 month average was 49.2%, Linda? She is saying yes.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","49.2%. Got it. Thank you.","William Scilacci","You're welcome.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ashar Khan. Your line is now open.","Unidentified Analyst","Jim, I was just trying to understand, if I did my math right. Just that though we have a negative on the purchase power, but overall, if we take everything together, we have over collected by an amount, that's what you mentioned in the slides?","William Scilacci","I think I said it was approximately $500 million over collected in all our balancing accounts.","Unidentified Analyst","So that means if the commission came in and -- if they found some portion of it used or useful on all that, the over collection would be much higher, right, if we get credit from somewhere or the other, right? Am I correct or wrong?","William Scilacci","Its more complicated on that answer. So let's separate fuel and purchase power out from base rates and decommissioning. That's why this thing has gotten so confusing. Its hard to track each piece. So you may know, we are continuing to collect end rates at the whole authorized base rates for SONGS, as if we are continuing to operate, and we are not recognizing earnings, [indiscernible] the depreciation, and so, we are collecting all those dollars, waiting for an ultimate determination, as part of the rate making process through the investigation of the OII.","So these are all separate buckets, and frankly, I think it was yesterday or the day before, we sent a letter to the commission to say, that you have all these different proceedings going on simultaneously. Here is our roadmap, how we want all these things to come together, so you can determine what the rate adjustments need to be; because you are over collected in some areas, under collected in others. You also have decommissioning that's going on separately. They haven't authorized us to tap into the decommissioning trust. But in theory, since June 6, we have been decommissioning San Onofre.","So the dollars that need to come in and in our disclosures, whenever we have a chance to look at them, there is at least a couple of hundred million dollars of decommissioning funds for 2013 alone, and then we are going to look to 2014 for additional dollars, that need to be taken into consideration. So the net-net-net of all this has to be worked out, and its going to take us some time to get there.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. And if I can just end up with one thing, Ted mentioned that we should hear from NEIL after their June board meeting. So is that the first time we can hear, how much money they would give us. Is that what we should expect to hear some kind of a figure from them, and that would assume that we would get something in the second half of the year?","Theodore (Ted) Craver Jr.","Well that's when we are going to hear from NEIL, that will be our first opportunity to hear from them, after our board meeting. So all they are really signaling there, is that's the timeframe for getting the first reaction from NEIL.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. But Ted, usually, once they come with a decision, when do they pay out? Is it pretty soon, or is there some historic? I forgot it.","Theodore (Ted) Craver Jr.","I don't think we'd want to signal a speedy resolution here. It is just the nature of the beast that tends to be slow.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mr. Jonathan Arnold from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank","Good evening guys.","Theodore (Ted) Craver Jr.","Hey Jonathan.","Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank","Quick one, just on the SONGS decommissioning, slide 24. I am not entirely sure if this is new, but you have a bullet that's saying estimated decommissioning period may be accelerated? Could you just explain what would be the turbulence, as to whether that would happen, and what are you referring to?","William Scilacci","Yeah, remember the original plan, and I will throw it out to Linda and Ron to give some more details, whereas to [ph] decommission the plant after we shut it down in 2022. That's what plants had incorporated to begin with. And so we are now looking at various things that we could do to accelerate the timeframe, and that really has to do with, getting the spend through a lot of the pools as quickly as possible and into dry gas storage. So I will pause there, and Linda or Ron, would you like to fill in some more details?","Linda Sullivan","I will just add to that, that we are going through a very detailed decommissioning cost estimate and part of that process, we are looking at optimizing the dollars around decommissioning.","William Scilacci","So Jonathan, I think you should take from us that, once we finish that detailed review, we will come out with a new time frame, a new dollar amount. We expect the contributions would be depleted going forward. $423 million in total annual contributions right now are in rate recovery from the commission, and so we will be looking at that. But there is a lot of moving parts here, and the timeframe of the removal of the spent fuel, the rate of return, there is a whole bunch of issues we are looking, and there is probably eight or nine key assumptions here, escalation of costs going forward. So this number is going to change, as we go forward here, and the last time we talked about it, we had over $3 billion interest for San Onofre currently, and the cost estimate was slightly over that amount. So we were nearly fully funded, and the final cost studies will give us a better picture of where we are.","Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank","Okay. Then Jim, maybe on a higher level, but you took these extra potential capital spending items you talked about. You talked about some of the transmission, I think they are no longer storage, that was part of that too?","William Scilacci","Yes.","Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank","And when you -- can you talk maybe a little bit on that piece, and then, as you aggregate all of that together, is this something we should think of sort of sustaining you in the 7% to 9% rate base drag over the longer period? Is this something that could be incremental over the sort of latter part of the decade? Just how should we think about how we mold that into everything else you're doing, if some of it goes ahead?","William Scilacci","It\u2019s a good question. I think we need to back up and look at our capital spending in total. What has been happening, and you can see it through the charts, the level of distribution spending is stepping up to meet the replacement rates that we need to be at. So that's just holes in wires, underground cables, holes, so that's why that's going up. In transmission, it has been coming off, as we have been furnishing some of the large renewable lines, and we just have a little bit of legacy generation that's ongoing.","So these other things we are looking at and considering, we haven't made any decisions. So there is the potential to may be add a little bit to the total level of capital expenditures, but its going to take us a little while to work through these things, the preferred resources and the storage are the first ones on the horizon that we need to decide what we want to do.","On some of the storage related items, they are in the distribution system, which we feel that we are well suited for, because that's really down to the basic wires of the business that we want to control, generally going forward. So I can't give you a number, but we are certainly thinking hard about it, and we are launching that growth rate. We are trying to balance all the things here too, in terms of the ultimate level of growth, and we want to grow the dividends, so all this plays in together.","Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank","Could I just ask one other, might be a third question, but just one the -- as you see the distributed solar movement gathering pace. And obviously still, relatively small versus the overall base. But I know you have made some investments outside of California. Is there a structure or a sort of market design, destination, where you could see yourselves competing in that business?","Theodore (Ted) Craver Jr.","May be I will break it into two parts. One, whether its distributed solar, or let's call it more broadly, distributed energy resources, that would include solar, include efficiency programs, include storage, all of those things. We see, actually, a significant investment that needs to be made in the distribution system here in California, to really prepare the system for integrating an increase in distributing energy resources. Jim alluded a little bit in his comments, we are clearly in the best position to do that, given our ownership of the distribution system.","So that's part one, we see a pretty significant investment opportunity on that side. Its very much in-sync with public policy here in California, and very much in-sync with our own strategy.","The second part is, whether we'd be able to participate in distributed energy resources, again, using a broader definition of that, might just -- things like we have rooftop solar, but broader distributed energy resources outside of the territory. At this point, we are certainly working on that. We have, what we think are some interesting beginnings in that area. I have kind of taken pains in the past to say, we are doing this kind of one step at a time, its not bet the ranch type of deal. But I think we do see some interesting opportunities there primarily be aimed at commercial and industrial customers, and would be not just in our territory, but outside.","Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank","So you could be inside the territory; because initially, you sounded like you are talking outside territory?","Theodore (Ted) Craver Jr.","It could be either one, of course, our primary interest initially is, understanding what the opportunities are on a broader scale, outside of just our constraints of the 2000 square mile territory.","Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank","Thank you.","Theodore (Ted) Craver Jr.","You're welcome.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Cohen. Your line is now open.","John Cohen - Morgan Stanley","Hey good afternoon. I was just wondering if you can give us an update as to what the process is for SONGS replacement capacity procurement? Is there a level that's going to come from a nascent generation versus transmission. What's the timing around all that?","William Scilacci","Ron's going to handle that.","Ronald Litzinger","The commission has been approving through our long term procurement plan proceeding the amount of generation that we are going to go out to bid for, both ourselves and San Diego, those numbers are all public and available. I don't remember them quite off the top of my head. They did fold into the Cal-ISOs transmission plan. So it is being coordinated in that fashion. Our procurement teams are getting ready to do that, and then we have also taking on, as Ted alluded to, the preferred resources, pilot in South Orange County, where we will put together a package of replacement options with preferred resources, such as demand response, solar, storage, and the like, and pilot our team is aggressively putting together, to fold in and that will reduce the amount of generation that we ultimately will have to buy through the market.","John Cohen - Morgan Stanley","Okay great. Thanks very much.","Operator","Our last question comes from Travis Miller. Your line is now open.","Travis Miller - Morningstar","Good afternoon.","Theodore (Ted) Craver Jr.","Hey Travis.","Travis Miller - Morningstar","A follow-up on a couple of these questions on all distributed generation, etcetera, etcetera. What do you think is the timing element for that, and if you guys do move slowly as you characterized it. Are we talking about five years before its material, 10 years before its material, when does this become an earnings, material earnings driver, all this other stuff?","Theodore (Ted) Craver Jr.","This is Ted. We are definitely interested in the answer of that question as well. I think the honest answer is, its really hard to tell at this early stage. So we are -- we think it would be foolish to kind of turn a blind eye to it, and not focus on it. This is one of those things that could potentially change how the industry is structured. So its something we are involved in. We intend to remain involved in it. But the pace with which that could happen, whether really proves itself out, that's very much an open question. That's why again, we are going to take pains to make the statement. The core value proposition of the company remains very much centered on the exceptionally strong growth story that we see within Southern California Edison, particularly ensuring that the distribution system is resilient and reliable, and we see a significant investment required there to do that, and we think there are ways to continue to address the cost side of the equation, so that we don't have a big impact on rates for customers. That's the core value proposition.","These other activities, they remain things that we are actively involved in, and we will continue to be actively involved in, but its really hard to predict at this early stage, what the pace will be and whether they will be meaningful, or when they will be meaningful.","Travis Miller - Morningstar","Got it. Okay. Thanks so much.","Theodore (Ted) Craver Jr.","You're welcome.","Operator","Okay. Our last question comes from Mr. Michael Lapides again. Your line is open.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs","Hey. I was just curious what the resolution of [indiscernible], an opportunity to reduce the costs at the parent. Kind of that $0.15 level, it is kind of in that range for a number of years. But now you don't have the non-regulated subsidiary?","Theodore (Ted) Craver Jr.","Actually we have been addressing that. I don't remember the exact numbers, but we had something in the neighborhood of 80 people within the Holding Company from senior officers to clerical folks. So it has always been a very modest sized group. With the EME difficulties, we started addressing that, and have brought that down, actually basically about in line, percentage wise with the reduction in staff that we had occurred at Southern California Edison over the last couple of years. So it has been something we have addressed. These just aren't particularly big numbers. But most of the costs there relate to financing, and stuff other than what I will call overhead costs.","It\u2019s a great question, but its actually not a particularly meaningful number. I think Jim actually mentioned, we are averaging somewhere, including financing and all the rest of the stuff, we are averaging somewhere around a penny a month, so $0.12 currently.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs","Got it. Okay. Thank you, Ted, much appreciated.","Theodore (Ted) Craver Jr.","You're welcome Michael.","Operator","With the last question, I would now like to turn the call back to Mr. Cunningham.","Scott Cunningham","Thanks very much for joining and please don't hesitate to call, if you any other questions.","Theodore (Ted) Craver Jr.","Thank you.","Operator","This now concludes today's conference. All lines may disconnect at this time."]}}
