Following those prepared remarks, we\u2019ll open up the call for questions, and we\u2019re scheduled to end at the top of the hour.","Before I begin, I\u2019d like to refer you to our full forward-looking statement disclosure that\u2019s in the news release and also in the slide deck, and remind you that today\u2019s comments will include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual results to be materially different from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.

Johnson Controls disclaims any obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this presentation.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Alex.","Alex Molinaroli","Good morning, everyone. So I\u2019m pretty pleased to speak about the earnings today because I just see it as a continuation of the success that the team has been having over the past four to six quarters, particularly when we have all of the distractions going on. I\u2019ll go through some of the highlights, but you\u2019re going to get some details from the rest of the team. And one thing that I\u2019d like you to remind yourself of is as we continue down this path of transforming the company, we\u2019ve been able to meet or exceed the expectations that we set for ourselves, not only from a company perspective but across the board. Each one of our businesses really had a fantastic quarter. I\u2019ll give you the headlines then I\u2019ll move into some of the highlights and we\u2019ll turn it over to Bruce.","At $9.2 billion of revenues it is down 3%, but if you take out currency we\u2019re up 4% for the quarter. And we\u2019ll talk about where that comes from in a few minutes, and how we see the outlook moving forward. One of the things and I\u2019ll go ahead and hit it early is that we\u2019re pretty pleased with order intake. That\u2019s going be a highlight of the conversation here today. When you look at Building Efficiency back in the summer we talked about the fact that we\u2019re seeing some potential for sales secured in this quarter. And it came through and it\u2019s coming through in a big way. So we\u2019re pretty pleased and it\u2019s happening in our institutional markets.","Look at our segment income, up 18%. Once again, great improvement from a margin perspective across the board. A big part of what we\u2019re trying to accomplish in this time period along with changing our portfolio and mix of businesses is the margins that we have within our businesses. And the teams have responded and continue to respond at a very positive way.","As $0.73 per share, up $0.20 versus last year. When Brian gets into the discontinued operations, and we\u2019ll help unpack some of that for you but I think if you look across the board, with the exception of currency, it\u2019s the one thing that none of us predicted. I think the things are happening pretty much as we expected.","If you move to the next page, we start talking about what\u2019s happening in the businesses. I\u2019ll talk about each one of our businesses, some of the things we\u2019re seeing. The commercial orders in BE, I\u2019ll unpack that in a little bit. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll have some questions later but what we saw is the institutional market. I wouldn\u2019t say its roaring back but what we\u2019re seeing is a significant improvement in order intake and in our pipeline.","So later on when we have a chance to talk more about the pipelines we\u2019ll see that not only we had a good quarter but we think that it\u2019s sustainable at least over next couple quarters where we have visibility.","In the Automotive production, North America continues to be strong. Europe, we we\u2019re uncertain. It\u2019s staying level. At 6% growth in China, you\u2019ll see later on that our sales are much higher than that.","It has to do with our mix. It has to do with our share in China. And then I was really pleased to talk about our Battery business. We\u2019re enjoying strong OE growth but more importantly, the aftermarket seems to be stable. We\u2019ve gained share. And in Europe, what we\u2019ve seen is over a 30% increase in battery sales in the aftermarket. If you recall, last year was pretty rough year for us because of the mild winter. And we were concerned that maybe there was something structural that\u2019s changed but it looks like the battery market is back in Europe at least for us. And the team is seeing the benefits from that.","I think that later on we may talk about it but we\u2019re also seeing our start-stop sales increase tremendously. With a 34% increase I think in the quarter. Of AGM batteries for start-stop. So we\u2019re bumping up against our capacity and we\u2019re adding more capacity as we speak. In fact, I\u2019ll talk about that when you get to slide five. I\u2019ll just jump to talking about batteries. Some of the things that\u2019s happening in our Battery business.","As the start-stop power trains moved to China, we are expediting or pulling forward our AGM capacity installation in China. Along with our Slide battery capacities. So if you look at what\u2019s happening in China as it relates to our own capacity and I think we have this in our press release, what we\u2019re talking about moving from 12.5 million to 15.5 million units. And as we add the north plant that hopefully construction will be underway soon. AGM capacity increasing to 6.4 million. I think at this point we\u2019re a little less than 2 million units.","And we do expect in our own conversation with our customers and orders that we\u2019re seeing that in China will be very similar patterns to what we\u2019re seeing in Europe, is that 40% of the new vehicles by 2020 will be start-stop. That bodes well for our business, and in the end it will bode well for our brand in the aftermarket.","I\u2019ll jump back to the top of the page and talk about some of the strategic things that are going on. I certainly don\u2019t want this to be missed. We were very pleased with the outcome of the GWS transaction. CB Richard Ellis is going be a great fit for our GWS business and for us as we move forward for pull through business. But if you look at that total transaction, the 1.475 for the remaining part of GWS plus the 200 million that we got from Brookfield, at one point \u2013 a little bit less than $1.7 billion is a real home run for us. And based on the response from CB Richard Ellis and from our joint customers and from the marketplace, it\u2019s a home run for them also.","Also pleased to announce that the SAIC joint venture around interiors with Yanfeng, we signed the agreement. I think there\u2019s a picture right here of us in Shanghai signing the agreement last month. And that is strategically one of the imperatives that we had over the last couple years that actually is happening at a pace that I\u2019m not even sure we anticipated it could happen so quickly if you go back in time. So we\u2019re pretty pleased with that. And then a couple new products that we have in place in BE, both in our commercial business and also \u2013 or our applied business, excuse me, around chillers, and our light commercial business for our UPG business that are launching now which will bode well particularly for this time of year. We expect to see some increased sales there. The Johnson Controls operating system, Brian will talk more about some of the benefits that we\u2019re seeing from that. It is something that we\u2019ve always been operationally capable and excellent, but I think we\u2019ll be able to take this to a new level. And where we\u2019re seeing the early benefits is in our manufacturing systems, our network optimization and our purchasing activities. Brian will talk about what we\u2019re seeing, but I would say those benefits we\u2019re pulling forward even quicker than I expected.","And then I\u2019ve been very busy. If you look on the right, I\u2019ve had an opportunity on behalf of the company to receive a whole bunch of awards, whether it be with General Motors or Toyota, and then some of the recognition that we\u2019ve gotten as a company over the last quarter. So it\u2019s been a busy quarter, but it\u2019s been a great quarter. Our teams have really responded in a period of potential distraction. And I think as we go through the numbers, you\u2019ll see the details. It\u2019s pretty hard to find where our team has not, in any part of the business, has not really responded well.","With that I\u2019ll turn it over to Bruce.","Robert Bruce McDonald","Thanks Alex, and good morning, everyone. So I\u2019ll start on slide six with Building Efficiency. And I just remind folks that we have reported GWS in the discontinued operations, so I\u2019m going to talk about sort of Building Efficiency ex-GWS on this slide here. So overall we were pretty pleased with Building Efficiency\u2019s\u2019 results for the second quarter here. You can see sales of $2.4 billion were up about 4%. If we back out the impact of foreign exchange, sales grew by 9%. If you look at that geographically, North America revenues for us were up 17%, though that was primarily attributable to the ADT acquisition. Again, stripping out foreign exchange, we saw a little bit of growth in Europe, so it was up 1%. Our Middle East business was up 9%. Asia was flat, and Latin America was down about 18%.","In terms of our backlog, you can see here at $4.6 billion was comparable to the prior year, again making the adjustment for FX and divestitures. In terms of geographically if you look at our backlog, North America was up about 3%. In the Middle East we saw a good strong growth up about 21%. Asia was flat, and we see still some downward trends in Europe which was down 6%, and Latin America which was down 16%. I think the most important number here on this page for us, because it really sort of speaks to the business on a go-forward basis, is really our order intake for the quarter. So if you just look at our Q2 orders, they are 2.5 billion and up 14% year-over-year. If you strip out FX and the impact of the ADT acquisition, our order intake was 8% higher. So that\u2019s quite a turnaround from the 4% reduction that we talked about on our last earnings call. Real pleased with North America in particular. There we saw our orders up on a consolidated basis were up 11%. And where we really saw the strong growth was in the education, the local, state and federal government markets. Those were the strong verticals for us. Outside of North America and again adjusting for foreign exchange, we were up 8% in Asia. 14% in the Middle East. And down 3% and 9% in Europe and Latin America respectively. And again even though we had a good strong order intake in the month, if we looked at our quoting activity, the pipelines, we feel pretty good about what we\u2019re sort of seeing here for the next couple quarters. Just turning to profitability. A great result here. You can see our earnings were up 36% to $173 million.","And you can see our margin expansion pretty impressed at 170 point points to 7.3%. Here we\u2019re really seeing the benefit of improved results in North America, Europe and the Middle East as well as the beneficial impact of the ADT acquisition flowing through our numbers here. And also the benefit of some of the SG&A reductions that we announced in the fourth Q4 of last year. So good strong performance from Building Efficiency and we feel good about that.","In terms of Power Solutions for the second quarter our sales were up 2%. And if you back out the impact of foreign exchange, they\u2019re up 8%. If you look at unit shipments overall we are up 7%, with the Americas up 2%, Asia up 10%, and Europe up 21%. Really driven by the aftermarket where in aggregate our European aftermarket business was up 30%.","In terms of OE volumes we split it by OE and aftermarket. Our global volumes for OE were up 3%, aftermarket up 9%. So saw good strong growth in AGM, Alex referred to, up 34% to just over 2.6 million. As Alex mentioned in his remarks, we are adding nearly another five million units of AGM capacity in China. Really to capitalize on what is kind of a surge in recent demand from our OE customers.","Turning to our profitability here, you\u2019ll see we\u2019re up 13% to 264 million. I guess we\u2019re benefiting primarily from higher volumes and an improved product mix as the profit of AGM sort of pulls through to the bottom line. And from a segment margin point of view, up 160 basis point points to 16.6%.","In terms of Automotive on slide eight, strong results in the quarter. Sales again up about 1% if you adjust for foreign currency. And this is our business that\u2019s probably the most heavily impacted from a dollar perspective from the euro. If you look at our geographic exposure here where revenues in North America were down 5% versus the industry being up 2%. That\u2019s really due to some of the business that we I\u2019d say commercially walked away from. So we\u2019re seeing that rolling off against us.","In Europe, our revenues were up 4%. Again, comparing favorably to industry production which was flat. And in China inclusive of our non-consolidated joint ventures our revenues were up 17% to 1.9 billion which is a substantial improvement versus the 6% production growth.","Just looking ahead, on the revenue side, I think we feel pretty good about what we\u2019re seeing in auto. North America, the inventories are in good shape and our production schedules look good for the balance of the year. We\u2019ve been real encouraged with the recent improvement in vehicle registrations in Europe. Which really accelerated every month into the second quarter here and that\u2019s driving higher production schedules than we had thought here in the coming into our third quarter.","Look at segment income overall we\u2019re up 90 basis points. And our profitability improved to 261 million, where here we\u2019re really benefiting from operational improvements. Primarily in our South America operations and in interiors which has really had a nice turnaround here. We\u2019re also seeing the benefits in Automotive primarily some of the Johnson Controls\u2019s operating system initiatives. And Brian will talk to those more in his comments.","So before I turn it over to Brian I think sort of the takeaway from our business perspective is they\u2019re all performing exceedingly well. We feel good about some of our leading indicators, the BE orders and the beginnings of strength in the Automotive production in here and Europe. It\u2019s nice to see Power Solutions volume sort of back to normal.","With that Brian I\u2019ll turn it over to you.","Brian Stief","Okay, thanks, Bruce. Good morning, everyone. On page nine as you saw in our press release, with the March 2015 announcement of the sale of our GWS business to CBRE as well as the closing of two GWS joint ventures to Brookfield, we will, beginning this quarter, start reporting GWS as a discontinued operation. And that requires all prior period financial statements to be restated or revised for comparative purposes. So my comments this morning will focus just on continuing operations financial results.","So our Q2 as reported of $0.68 had two items in it that were nonrecurring in nature. There was $0.03 associated with a noncash tax charge in Japan, and there was $0.02 associated with transaction integration costs related to our portfolio activities, so an adjusted EPS for Q2 of $0.73. As I talk through our continuing operations financial results, these two items will be excluded. If you look at top line revenues, as Alex indicated, they\u2019re down 3% to $9.2 million, but the underlying revenues in Building Efficiencies are up due to the inclusion of ADT. And auto experience is down by \u2013 has lower revenues as the foreign exchange more than offset the stronger volumes that we saw in the quarter. If you take out foreign exchange, all three of our businesses report a very strong results in the top line, 4% across the board.","Gross margin for the quarter of 17.1% was up 160 basis points from last year. And as Alex mentioned, we are starting to see the benefits of the Johnson Controls operating system initiatives as well as just some improved operational execution across the business. SG&A expenses are essentially flat versus last year, and I think we continue to do a really good job of controlling our overall cost structure.","Equity income is up $9 million versus a year ago. And that continues to reflect the improved profitability primarily of our automotive joint ventures in China. So, on an overall basis, segment income margins were 7.6% in the quarter, which were up 130 basis points versus Q2 last year. And on a year-to-date basis, our segment income margins are up 110 basis points, so a very strong performance from an operational standpoint.","On page 10, if you look at the net financing charges, they\u2019ve increased $13 million year over year. That $13 million is simply the higher debt levels that we took on in June of 2014 related to the financing of the ADT acquisition. Tax rate in the second quarter of 2015 and 2014 were comparable at about 19%. So, on an overall basis, a very strong second quarter with diluted EPS of about $0.73 versus $0.61 a year ago, an increase of 20%. And if you assume total diluted earnings per share, which would include GWS in 2015, and GWS and electronics in 2014 that comes to $0.77 again a very strong year-over-year improvement of 17% compared to $0.66 last year.","Going to page 11, as we mentioned on our first quarter earnings call, we expected to substantially offset the foreign currency headwinds that we had, which were mainly the euro at 1.15 at the time, with lower commodity prices and the benefits of our Johnson Controls operating system initiatives. Our reprised guidance reflects these additional headwinds with the euro now at 1.05, but we still, if you look on an overall annual basis, will substantially offset the euro impact at 1.05 versus our plan which had it in at 1.30. So you\u2019ll see we adjusted downward a bit our guidance for the remainder of the year to reflect the euro at 1.05.","A couple of things to mention that Alex referred to on Johnson Controls operating system initiatives, they\u2019re well underway. A couple high points that are noteworthy in the quarter, we now have about 60% of our global plants under the enterprise wide manufacturing system program that resulted in about $25 million of benefits to date in 2015. And we\u2019ve got targeted to have all of our 285 plants under this program by September 2015. Secondly we centralized our enterprise-wide indirect procurement function. To standardized process and better leverage our scale globally. And that will result in about $50 million of benefits in 2015. Those two items helped offset some of the FX headwinds I talked about earlier.","So let me turn to revised guidance for Q3 and the full year. Our previous full year guidance was 355 to 370 which included the GWS business of about $0.20 a share. For the third quarter, our revised guidance from continuing ops is $0.90 to $0.92 which would be an increase of 14% to 16% from the $0.79 in the prior year quarter. And our full year guidance from continuing ops again with the euro, now forecast at 105, is 330 to 345 per share which would be up anywhere from 10% to 15% versus the $3 a share in fiscal \u201814.","Going to page 12, whether you look at EPS on a continuing ops basis or on a total company-wide basis we\u2019re very pleased with our Q2 performance, versus prior year and consensus. And I would have to say that consensus is a bit messy with GWS but I think once we unpack that you\u2019ll see that year-over-year very strong performance.","We\u2019ve provided on page 12 the numbers for 2014 and 2015 showing continuing ops and the impact of GWS for the prior year quarters and the first quarter.","And then we\u2019ve also provided an appendix for the deck which really lays out detailed reconciliations of sales and segment income as well as the nonrecurring items. So that\u2019s a quick summary from a financial standpoint. With that Glen, we can open it up for questions.","Glen Ponczak","Great thanks, Brian. Mitch, I guess we\u2019re ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Mr. Brian Johnson. Sir, your line is now open.","Brian Arthur Johnson","Yes. Good morning.","Alex Molinaroli","Good morning.","Brian Arthur Johnson","I just want to ask a couple questions. One around autos in China and the second around segmentation within Building Efficiency. Look you grew China production significantly yet again. Can you give us some commentary coming back from Shanghai on the up contenting trend in China? How that\u2019s affecting your current Seating business, whether you\u2019re seeing it in the locals or the JV partners or both? And then also as we kind of roll forward assuming that up contenting continues to happen in interiors. How the transaction that you finalized but will close on shortly, by the way nice Twitter picture, with the cigars. [Indiscernible] kind of your exposure to the China interior segments or just JV partners up to there.","Robert Bruce McDonald","Yeah, I\u2019ll take that one, Brian. It\u2019s Bruce here. I guess a couple comments. Kind of your underlying sort of question around the seating is really, help me understand how we\u2019re substantially sort of 3x times the market here. A couple things. So first of all, you\u2019re absolutely right that we\u2019re seeing particularly from the Chinese owned brands, I\u2019m moved to improve the quality of the interior. And that is driving I\u2019d say a shift in the market away from traditional local suppliers to our businesses. So that\u2019s number one. Secondly, if you look at the production data, what you\u2019re tending to see is the luxury segment and the SUV segments \u2013 our SUV in particular \u2013 gaining a lot of share and we have a lot more content there. Third, the western brands are taking share away from some of the Chinese owned brand and we\u2019re benefiting from that. And then we just continue to gain share really as on the back of the investments that we\u2019ve made in metals. So our metals business, I think we talked about when we made the two acquisitions, Hammerstein and Keiper, we were sort of in the low single digits.","Right now I think our run rate\u2019s about 20%. And if you look at the backlog of business that we\u2019ve won, we feel pretty good about getting to that 30% to 35% target. So those would be the seating factors. Then your comment around the \u2013 your question around the interior side of things, again you sort of saw in our release we said on a 2015 basis, we\u2019re looking at revenues being around $8.5 billion, which is about a billion dollars more than we talked about last May when we announced this joint venture. There you\u2019re really seeing the impact of China growth and the C-class launch. Those would be the two factors there. And the same comment I made about quality of the interior and the luxury segment in the SUV apply equally to interiors.","Brian Arthur Johnson","Right. So is it fair to simplify it by saying when you close the interior JV you\u2019ll actually have more exposure to the positive revenue trends in interior in China.","Alex Molinaroli","Yes. Absolutely.","Brian Arthur Johnson","Second question over in the BE land, so you talked about the order strength coming from institutional. How did small and mid-commercial North America do in the quarter? Where are you on ADTI cross selling? And what\u2019s the next steps there in terms of boosting your distribution?","Alex Molinaroli","So I\u2019ll take that. Overall one of the things with ADTI, because it\u2019s more of a \u2013 it\u2019s a shorter cycle and it\u2019s more of a book-to-bill because of how we go to market there. What we really saw was revenue. So we don\u2019t have the same kind of pipeline information that we have for our company owned or our branch businesses. I would say that the business overall was flat, maybe a little bit soft versus a year ago. One of the things I\u2019m not sure of, remember when we made the transaction a year ago, I\u2019m not sure of when we look at the comps that things won\u2019t be leveled out until we get into the summer, because we were, right before we secured the transaction, and I think there was a lot of moving parts right before we closed the deal. But I think overall the market is \u2013 you remember those products aren\u2019t just mid to light commercial. They also serve the institutional market. I think overall we\u2019re seeing the market move up. I think our exposure in the commercial market is one that has been \u2013 we\u2019ve been underexposed, so we haven\u2019t benefited from it as much. But I think that part of the market is still clipping along. I think what\u2019s substantially different though is the institutional markets. We\u2019ve even seen when you talk about it, we even saw in health care we\u2019re seeing our pipeline increase, which is something we haven\u2019t been able to say, I can\u2019t remember when we we\u2019re able to say. That\u2019s been a lot of years.","Brian Arthur Johnson","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mr. Mike Wood. Sir, your line is now open.","Mike Wood","Hi. Thank you. You mentioned the Building Efficiency in Asia was flat. Curious what you\u2019re seeing there in terms of orders. And is the Hitachi portfolio you\u2019re going to be acquiring that includes some of the energy efficiency products like VRF, is that a higher organic growth portfolio than your legacy BE portfolio there?","Alex Molinaroli","Yeah. So I\u2019ll take the second part for sure. I mean what you see in the growth rate of when look at the mix of products and technologies, two things. One Hitachi is well positioned in Asia, particularly in China. And that part of the market is definitely eating into what we would consider our \u2013 the core of our market, more of the ducted equipment that we would see in North America. So it\u2019s very fast growing at 2X of the rest of the marketplace. That\u2019s why it\u2019s strategically important for us. And our position is very strong. Not only Hitachi direct but through our partner. Hitachi, our joint venture there, has a partner called Hisense, which plays in the light goods appliance space, a very strong player. And those two go to market channels along with our Europe brand is how we\u2019ll leverage the VRF. But to answer your question, at least 2X for the rest of the traditional HVAC market that we\u2019re familiar with.","Robert Bruce McDonald","And then Mike, this is Bruce. Your question about Asian orders, so in the quarter, our order intake in Asia was up 8%.","Mike Wood","Great. And then also can you just give us an update in terms of what you\u2019re seeing in the China aftermarket for Power Solutions just in terms of how that market is maturing and how your share is developing there?","Alex Molinaroli","I think that this is the numbers. I think we\u2019re seeing around 10% growth, probably a little less than what we expected, we\u2019re signing up tremendous amount of distributors. We\u2019re seeing \u2013 most of our growth is still happening in the OE space. So I think that we have more opportunity there.","Mike Wood","Thank you.","Mike Wood","I\u2019m sorry, 10% right?","Robert Bruce McDonald","Yes. Yes.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mr. Robert Barry. Sir, your line is now open.","Robert Barry","Hey, guys. Good morning.","Robert Bruce McDonald","Good morning.","Alex Molinaroli","Yeah.","Robert Barry","Yeah, it\u2019s still morning here. I wanted to ask about the margins in the Building business. It looks like they\u2019ve been tracking quite good. I think above what you guided back at the Analyst day. Maybe just comments on the sustainability of the levels that you\u2019ve seen there and what might be driving that?","Robert Bruce McDonald","Yeah. This is Bruce here, Rob. A couple of things: I think our margin improvement at BE is front-end loaded. One issue we\u2019ve got is the ADT acquisition. It was in our fourth quarter number last year. Its margin was included as we talked about when we made that deal, so we kind of have nice comps in the first three quarters of the year. You also recall last year we talked about having some contract charges in the Middle East in the first half of the year. So those are behind us. And so again I think it\u2019s really a question of the comps that we\u2019ve got here are easier in the first half than in the back half of the year.","Alex Molinaroli","And that being said I think one of the things that as we get our backlog, we\u2019re back to level. And we get our backlog stronger and stronger we\u2019ll start to get leverage off our fixed cost.","Robert Bruce McDonald","Yeah.","Alex Molinaroli","So I do think there\u2019s margin improvement but certainly the comps have not hurt us from.","Robert Barry","Yeah.","Alex Molinaroli","From a comparative standpoint.","Robert Bruce McDonald","Yeah.","Robert Barry","Fair enough. Maybe also to follow-up on that, a question about pricing. On the Ingersoll call they were talking about starting to see some pricing pressure in their Commercial HVAC business in Asia. This quarter it was Asia and also Latin America. Can you talk about what you\u2019re seeing on pricing in particular how you feel about the pricing as a backlog in Building?","Alex Molinaroli","So I think our \u2013 I\u2019ll take that. I\u2019ll have to not listen to the call. I want to make sure I don\u2019t try to make a complete comparison. I\u2019m not sure of the reference, but I can tell you from our standpoint in our backlog that there has been pressure on pricing I think for at least 24 months. And that has to do with the fact that lack of institutional work out there. We have a big focus ourselves to try to get our backlog margins up. If you track that you\u2019d see they\u2019ve been under pressure for quite some time. It\u2019s not a new phenomenon. I haven\u2019t seen any new pressure. From our standpoint if the market picks up here I\u2019d expect to see our margins and our backlog go up over time. We haven\u2019t seen that yet. I don\u2019t believe there\u2019s any extraordinary pressure but I haven\u2019t seen any relief either.","Robert Barry","Got you. And then maybe a quick one on housekeeping item on the guidance update. So it sounds like it\u2019s mostly changed due to the currency? I would think that Commodities would have also gotten better. Is it that the currency just got worse by a larger amount? Or what\u2019s the dynamic there? Thank you.","Alex Molinaroli","Let me let Brian answer the specifics. I think when we \u2013 I think we had a better understanding what Commodities were going do in the last call. And so we forward-project what we thought our Commodities benefit was going be. What we didn\u2019t have the view of is how much deterioration we\u2019d see in the currency particularly in the Euro. I think what you\u2019re probably seeing \u2013 Brian, correct me if I\u2019m wrong \u2013 is that that gap has increased much more than any kind of Commodity positives that we\u2019ve seen.","Brian Stief","Yeah. I think that\u2019s right. I think in Commodities we had a pretty good line of sight on for the rest of the year. I think when you look at the Euro our plan and original guidance, we had the Euro at 130. At the end of our first quarter call it was at 115 and I think now going down to 105. That\u2019s probably about $50 million to $60 million worth of headwind in the second half of the year that we just didn\u2019t have line of sight to. It\u2019s really \u2013 you\u2019re right it is primarily the FX piece.","Robert Bruce McDonald","And Rob I would just remind you that we do try and hedge out some of our commodity exposure so we don\u2019t get sort of the immediate benefit whereas on FX we\u2019re talking translation here not transactional. So there\u2019s a bit of a lag.","Robert Barry","Right, right. Fair enough. I think you did mention last quarter that Q2 was still going be a headwind then you\u2019d see more of the net benefit then the back half.","Robert Bruce McDonald","Yes.","Robert Barry","Yeah. Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mr. Patrick Archambault. Sir, your line is now open.","Patrick Archambault","Hi. Yes. Can you hear me?","Robert Bruce McDonald","Hi Pat, yeah.","Alex Molinaroli","Yeah.","Patrick Archambault","Just one housekeeping one. Just on the \u2013 I think on the backlog you said it was up that\u2019s, like, excluding currency right? Sorry the order book. Up 8% that\u2019s excluding currency. Can you just tell us what that is including the impact of currency? Just as we think about the revenue cadence and how that compares to last quarter. That\u2019s my first question, if I\u2019m thinking about that correctly. And then can you also remind us of the timing for quoting activity, then orders and backlog? I know you\u2019ve been through this before but I think it would just be helpful as the timing allows for these things to impact the P&L.","Alex Molinaroli","Let me start on that. I\u2019m not sure we\u2019ll have all the data that you need but let me directionally give you the information that you need. If we need to follow-up we will. First off when we talk about these orders, it\u2019s driven by North America because the size of our North American Contracting business is much larger. So the good news there is there\u2019s not a lot in translation. You\u2019re not really talking about from a booking standpoint in the U.S. anyway a lot of translation. That\u2019s where we saw the strongest order intake. In this environment that\u2019s where we wanted it. And it relates to how long kind of the cycle. I\u2019ll kind of go through the whole process for you. If we look at our pipeline, we look at six-month rolling pipeline. When we talk about what we see before we book, it\u2019s about a six-month view. That\u2019s why we talked about, we have visibility to third quarter and fourth quarter bookings. Once we get a contract in place, you\u2019re really talking about a six-month before we really see a substantial movement of the backlog. So we\u2019re still from a standpoint of being able to translate the bookings that we got this quarter, we\u2019re not going to see significant revenue on those bookings, until probably sometime in the fourth quarter. So it\u2019s a bit of a lag. The good news coming out we lag but the bad news going in we lag also but it\u2019s about six months.","Patrick Archambault","That\u2019s helpful. One other quickly, if I may. The margin improvement in Automotive was certainly very good once again. Can you just remind, how much of that, you pointed to a decent production number obviously in North America, and Europe\u2019s starting to flatten out which is good. How much of that is just better leverage? How much of that is some of the structural improvements that you guys have been making along the way?","Robert Bruce McDonald","It\u2019s Bruce here, Pat. I mean when you just sort of look at, we sort of gave the information here by seating and interior. So seating was up 40 basis points and I guess that business I would say it would be leverage. Interiors were up, went up from about 2.9% up 260 basis points. There it\u2019s really reflecting a couple things. One it\u2019s the structural ranges that we\u2019ve made to restructure the business. And then secondly, and we talked about this sort of for the last few years is the C-class, the Mercedes C-class. The biggest order that we\u2019ve ever got. It\u2019s about $500 million or $600 million in revenue. It\u2019s rolling out globally. So that\u2019s sort of turning from being a pretty heavy investment that we\u2019re making in terms of launching that product globally to net now where it\u2019s kind of enjoying the benefits of it rolling into production.","Alex Molinaroli","The only caveat I\u2019d bring to that is we are seeing year-on-year improvement in seating in South America.","Robert Bruce McDonald","That\u2019s true.","Patrick Archambault","And then just as we go forward, I mean on the leverage side for seating, to your point, the information or the registrations coming out of Europe and has been better. Is that an area where you\u2019d consider there to be a little bit of upside risk given, I can\u2019t remember what number you were using in you guidance for production but it feels like there\u2019s upside risk to what IHS has out there which I think is what you\u2019re using.","Robert Bruce McDonald","Yeah, I think when we talked to auto team early this week, and I would say looking at what we see for Q3 as being up 4%, 5% from production point of view. So that\u2019s better than the numbers that we had quoted. I would say that\u2019s despite the fact obviously a place like Russia\u2019s turned out worse. So net-net it is a tailwind for us here in the next couple quarters.","Patrick Archambault","All right, terrific. Thanks a lot, guys.","Robert Bruce McDonald","Thanks, Pat.","Alex Molinaroli","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mr. Jeff Sprague. Sir, your line is now open.","Alex Molinaroli","Hi Jeff.","Jeff Sprague","Hi. Good morning.","Alex Molinaroli","Good morning.","Robert Bruce McDonald","Good morning.","Jeff Sprague","Just a couple ones. Just first back to the institutional verticals. Long overdue obviously and maybe it\u2019s just kind of the way the cycle plays and it\u2019s kind of their time so to speak but is there something in particular that you can put your finger on that\u2019s actually driving it whether it\u2019s, I don\u2019t know, tax receipts or something that gives you some confidence that we can kind of build on beginning another turn?","Alex Molinaroli","Yeah, so I don\u2019t \u2013 we\u2019re getting into political season here shortly. So I don\u2019t know that I have any confidence to talk about that. But what I can tell you is that we\u2019ve seen the reserves build up and certainly state and local governments. We\u2019ve seen infrastructure spending go in place. And we\u2019ve been talking about that for some time. And I think now we\u2019re starting to see people pull the trigger. We\u2019re seeing the same thing with K-12. So you have bond issues, people are working on existing schools and adding to their facilities. I think we\u2019ve talked about for some time. I think that I don\u2019t think this is going be a short lived cycle. I think that the absent something that\u2019s happened outside of my ability to predict.","I think we\u2019re going be into kind of a slow cycle of improvement. What I\u2019m not sure about but I\u2019m encouraged by it is to see the healthcare pipeline is starting to increase and I don\u2019t know if I have an answer for why that is yet. But that\u2019s one encouraging thing that we haven\u2019t seen actually come through in orders but we\u2019re seeing in pipeline.","Jeff Sprague","And this may be a little touch granular but I\u2019m just wondering, do you see any negative knock-on effects in some of the oil producing states kind of second derivative impact in the construction trends or anything there?","Alex Molinaroli","It\u2019s kind of lost in the numbers to me. Because if you look at where those things are and the type of business that we\u2019re in, obviously there will be a knock-on effects of some infrastructure. We have not seen that yet. And to the extent we have, it\u2019s lost in places where it\u2019s not a significant part of our business.","Jeff Sprague","And then just a quick one on cash flow. Off to kind of a slow start year-to-date. Is there anything in particular that we should think kind of swings the other way in the back half? Any change to your year view there?","Brian Stief","Yeah. I mean cash flow\u2019s a bit of a soft spot for us. I will say that if you look at the second quarter, we did have some tax payments related to some audit settlements that was just short of $100 million. And then we also had some estimated tax payments in the current year that we didn\u2019t have last year as well. Some of them transactional related so I would say as we sit here today, we\u2019re probably about $250 million to $300 million behind where we\u2019d like to be. But half or so of that is related to tax items and the other half unfortunately is not one or two items that we can go attack. There are a number of items $10 million to $15 million here and there globally in trade working capital that we need to go after. So it\u2019s a priority for us in the second half.","Jeff Sprague","I\u2019m sorry just on the tax items, is that simply timing within the year or is that a net headwind versus what you previously expected?","Brian Stief","That would not be timing because it was an audit settlement payment that was not in our plan for fiscal 2015. And then the other item was actually an estimated tax payment that I mean some of that could be timing I guess with the second half. But I guess I wouldn\u2019t necessarily view it that way.","Jeff Sprague","Okay. Thank you for the color.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Sir Rich Kwas. Sir, your line is now open.","Richard Kwas","Hi, good morning.","Alex Molinaroli","Hi, Rich.","Robert Bruce McDonald","Good morning.","Richard Kwas","So post yesterday\u2019s announcement regarding Kathy, is Glen Ponczak the most important employee at Johnson Controls?","Alex Molinaroli","That\u2019s what we were thinking.","Robert Bruce McDonald","Well, you know what, it\u2019s interesting that you say that. Ever since Kathy\u2019s been on the team, things are going a lot better.","Alex Molinaroli","That\u2019s true. That\u2019s true.","Richard Kwas","Then I have my answer there?","Alex Molinaroli","Yes.","Richard Kwas","So Bruce, in terms of the hedging activity as we think \u2013 so there\u2019s going be benefit later in the fiscal year. How should we think about benefit in 2016 with the lag, if not much changes from here in terms of pricing?","Robert Bruce McDonald","Well, I mean, it\u2019s hard to say, I guess. We tend to hedge copper really around the quotes that we\u2019ve got like a quote of hedge in our backlog. So that insulates us from short term volatility. So I don\u2019t know if that really saves us. Sort of depend on pricing I guess. But fuels come down. And I expect that we\u2019ll see an increase in benefit as I think expected to flow through to next year. So it\u2019s kind of a tough one but I do think if you look at kind of a commodity benefit that we\u2019re going to have here in the third and fourth quarter it\u2019s probably indicative of a run rate into 2016. Do you have a different view Brian?","Brian Stief","No, I mean, our approach in hedging is really if you look at some of our key commodities we\u2019re hedging anywhere between 60% and 80% of that on an ongoing basis. So we aren\u2019t going to see a significant bottom line benefit as a result to some of the commodity prices going down. We\u2019ll see some benefit, but we\u2019ve kind of applied that range as far as a comfortable hedging position for us.","Richard Kwas","So the opportunity is really on the structural improvements regarding the operating initiatives?","Alex Molinaroli","Absolutely.","Brian Stief","That\u2019s right, yeah.","Richard Kwas","Okay. Just a follow-up on building efficiency orders in Asia. Could you give us a China number? You know UTC was reported the other day and was a little softer in terms of what they\u2019d seen in their quarter.","Brian Stief","Yeah.","Richard Kwas","So how would you characterize, what was the order rate in the quarter? And then what\u2019s the landscape right now as you see quoting activity over the balance?","Robert Bruce McDonald","Yeah. I don\u2019t have that \u2013 I don\u2019t have China bulking so maybe Glen or Kathy [ph] can follow-up on that one. But I would \u2013 what I would tell you is, is the \u2013 our order intake in China in particular, we tend to be largest in the equipment side. It\u2019s very geared towards financing. And so we\u2019re right now kind of enjoying a little bit of a breather in terms of their loosening some of the financing requirements. And the reason it\u2019s volatile for financing rich is because most of our orders have a significant prepayment.","Richard Kwas","Okay. So some...","Alex Molinaroli","Yeah.","Richard Kwas","So that may be some of the reason that \u2013 may be could help you.","Robert Bruce McDonald","Yeah.","Alex Molinaroli","And Rich, I did see numbers more \u2013 it\u2019s more of a revenue number than a secured number, a backlog number. What I did see is that we\u2019re given much more growth in our lower tonnage equipment than our high tonnage equipment. The mix seems to be shifting at least right now. So that leads you to believe around infrastructure, in the pace of infrastructure changes, versus other types of construction. So we\u2019re seeing kind of a shift in mix here a little bit.","Richard Kwas","Is that ultimately a little bit lower margin?","Robert Bruce McDonald","No. I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s lower margin. I think that overall it will be less lumpy. But I think what it is, is for us, it could be in some ways depending how we go to market, but I don\u2019t know I would say it\u2019s lower margin. I just think it\u2019s a significant shift which leads us to make sure that we have the right products. That\u2019s \u2013 when I look at it, it makes it even more important that we have products like we are getting with Hitachi because it\u2019s talking about the mix of the type of business that\u2019s actually growing in China. It goes back to one of the questions we had earlier.","Richard Kwas","Right. Okay. Thanks. I\u2019ll pass it on. Appreciate it.","Robert Bruce McDonald","Okay.","Operator","Okay. Our next question comes from Mr. Brett Hoselton. Sir, your line is now open.","Brett Hoselton","Good morning, gentlemen.","Alex Molinaroli","Good morning, Brett.","Brian Stief","Good morning.","Brett Hoselton","I wanted to ask you just a kind of a macro Europe question. You comment on the call that you\u2019re seeing pretty good growth in OE light vehicle sales, and certainly the aftermarket battery business is doing very well. So it kind of seems to suggest that you\u2019re seeing signs of life at least in those two areas. I didn\u2019t necessarily hear any particularly positive commentary on the BE business out of Europe. So I guess I\u2019m kind of generally speaking wondering what are you seeing in terms of general recovery in Europe, and secondly how do we \u2013 how do you think that might translate to if at all your BE business?","Alex Molinaroli","So this is Alex. I\u2019ll take that. I think what you look at, if you look at our overall numbers they\u2019re down in Europe. One of the things you have to look at. We have retrenched quite a bit in Europe in two ways. One is we got out of our commercial refrigeration business last year which was, it was 200 and something million dollars a year. So that business is out of our ongoing flow. The other thing is that we\u2019ve changed our go to market in some parts of Europe where we\u2019re not as much dependent on our branches. So we have less contracting work and more product mix. I think the market is probably the same. I mean, we\u2019re probably seeing that it\u2019s not any different than the rest of our businesses. Our participation in that has changed. Essentially because part of our strategy is to not overweight ourselves in Europe as it relates to exposure there. So we probably aren\u2019t the best parameters for how the market\u2019s growing because we\u2019ve actually restructured and sold some our businesses in Europe.","Brett Hoselton","All right.","Robert Bruce McDonald","Yeah. And maybe just to size that, if you, in BE we\u2019re about 2.3 billion, Europe\u2019s at 300 million of it. So it\u2019s not a significant piece.","Brett Hoselton","Excellent. That answers my final question. Thank you very much gentlemen.","Alex Molinaroli","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mr. Ravi Shanker. Sir, your line is now open.","Ravi Shanker","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I\u2019ve had a question on Europe, this time on the battery side. Alex, you said that the European Battery business is doing fairly well.","Alex Molinaroli","Yeah.","Ravi Shanker","Especially given the comp with weather. I\u2019m surprised to hear that because I believe Europe had a very warm winter this year, as well. And if you listen to some other aftermarket companies decide they seem to have had a pretty hard time dealing with that. So what made it different for you? Was it that the channel was already pretty empty just given last year and that was refilled? What explains you guys doing better than other aftermarket companies in Europe?","Alex Molinaroli","That\u2019s a good question, Ravi. I think that your observation or question is right on. Certainly the first quarter we benefited from the channel being in a different place this year than it was a year ago. I also think that batteries just won\u2019t last forever regardless of the weather is and the fact we\u2019ve had two mild winters, you had 12 more months of wear. The batteries eventually need to be replaced. I don\u2019t know there\u2019s anything structurally any different than in the past. We\u2019ve had a few wins but not the kind of wins that will drive that kind of market share growth. So the channel changes are definitely one and the second is I just think we\u2019ve had a delay and of one year and being able to replace batteries. The last part is it should make it more structurally sound is remember that Europe when it went down, it went down hard from OE perspective. Now we\u2019re starting to see the first time replacements of the vehicles that came out of after the recovery started.","Ravi Shanker","Understood, and one more question for Bruce or Brian. Given the moving parts on GWS and FX and lead prices and everything, can you give us an updated revenue guidance number for full year 2015?","Brian Stief","Yeah, we haven\u2019t updated revenue guidance, Ravi. Rule of thumb is every nickel on the euro is $300 million top line.","Ravi Shanker","Okay.","Alex Molinaroli","And Ravi, just to address, we probably should follow up and get more robust numbers but lead was a revenue headwind for us up to this point. And all of a sudden we\u2019re starting to see it recover, so I think that it\u2019s not going to, if it stays at the level it\u2019s at now, it\u2019s getting back toward our plan number and back toward last year. But we need to get some more robust numbers than what we have.","Ravi Shanker","Sure. I\u2019ll follow up with Glen. Thank you so much.","Alex Molinaroli","Thanks, Ravi. Operator, we\u2019ve got time for one more.","Operator","Our last question comes from Ryan Brinkman. Sir, your line is now open.","Ryan Brinkman","Hi. Thanks for squeezing me in. Just wondering if you could update how you\u2019re thinking about M&A? Obviously, you\u2019ve done Hitachi, yen thing, GWS electronics, home link, electronics. But are you now sort of more on hold with regard to strategic action or will you continue to be opportunistic here? And then remind us maybe the businesses, the types of businesses you\u2019d be interested in and which of your end markets?","Alex Molinaroli","Sure. So I\u2019ll take that. And other two can feel free to jump in. So I think with where we are from the standpoint of this whole entire process, I think our initial portfolio actions, I wouldn\u2019t say they\u2019re coming to a close but we\u2019ve really gotten through a lot of the things we talked about a year and a half ago at a pretty good pace and I think our ability to execute on these initiatives has been outstanding. So I\u2019m pretty pleased with where we are. As it relates to moving forward, we do want to make sure we make some investments strategically, we are looking. But we want to make sure that we\u2019re smart about it. We do see adjacencies in both our end markets around our Buildings business and our Battery business that are interesting to us, and we want to make sure if we do something it gives us a platform for growth.","And remember that from a regional perspective, what\u2019s most important to us is take advantage of the strong position we have North America and the strong position we have in China and Asia. So when we start thinking about our bias, our bias is our Buildings business, our Battery business, it\u2019s really infrastructure related and our bias is North America weighted North America weighted Asia so that we can make sure we can take advantage of our current position and growth expectations. But I don\u2019t think we\u2019re on pause. I think because of where we are and how we\u2019ve been able to execute and the ADTI integration is going \u2013 we can\u2019t really talk about that here. It\u2019s going as expected or better, and so I think our confidence is pretty high.","Ryan Brinkman","Great. Appreciate it.","Glen Ponczak","Thanks, everybody. Alex, any closing comments?","Alex Molinaroli","Yeah, so I\u2019ll just build on that. I couldn\u2019t be more pleased. We had an opportunity, actually in the last few days to meet with our new partner, CBRE, who will be providing services to us and we\u2019ll also be providing services to the commercial market through CBRE and Trammel Crow and their companies. I look \u2013 I feel fantastic about not only the transaction but strategically what CBRE\u2019s going to bring to the market with our GWS employees who are long-term employees that are quite frankly a lot of them are my friends. I\u2019ve been here 32 years and a lot of them have been too. And I feel great about that transaction. It\u2019s great for our customers. It\u2019s great for our shareholders. And it\u2019s great for our employees.","I feel the same way about our Interiors business. We\u2019ve now moved from a business, and it looks like we\u2019re early movers. The business is starting to consolidate as we predicted. We couldn\u2019t have a better partner. The strong position that we have in China along with the footprint that we bring from a global perspective to the joint venture is fantastic, once again for our customers, no doubt for our shareholders and our employees are now in a part of a business that is going to invest and grow. So both of those things strategically have been important, and I just can\u2019t thank our employees enough. The ability to go through the amount of change that we\u2019ve gone through over the last year and a half and be able to meet the commitments that we\u2019ve made year-on-year, and you look at it business-by-business; confidence is continuing to build.","And then lastly, our employees embracing the Johnson Controls operating system, and actually taking it on faster and more effectively than what I anticipated. I wouldn\u2019t trade the position we\u2019re in if I could go back a year and a half. And so I feel great about where we\u2019re at. I think the opportunities in front of us. I think the challenge for us is to make sure that we invest in the right platforms for growth. But our margins continue to improve, not only because of our portfolio actions but also because we\u2019re executing. So it was a great quarter. I want to thank employees and I appreciate the attention that you guys are paying with us.","Glen Ponczak","Great. Thanks, Alex. Thanks everybody for calling. Kathy [ph] and I will be available for any follow-up for the balance of the day and whatever you need. Good luck with the rest of earnings season.","Operator","Thank you.

(Operator Instructions). Today's call is being recorded. If you have any objection, please disconnect at this point. Now I will turn the meeting over to your host, Vice President, Glen Ponczak. Sir, you may begin.","Glen Ponczak","Thank you, Madison and welcome to the Johnson Controls Fourth Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. The slide presentation can be accessed at johnsoncontrols.com by clicking the Investors link at the top of the page, then scroll down to the Events Calendar section. This morning, Chairman and CEO Alex Molinaroli will provide some perspective on the quarter. He'll be followed by Vice Chairman and Executive Vice President Bruce McDonald for a review of business unit results. And finally, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Brian Stief will talk about the company's overall financial performance and give you a peek at our expectations for the first quarter of fiscal 2015.","Following our prepared remarks we will open the call for questions and we're scheduled to end at the top of the hour. Before we begin, I'd like to refer you to our full forward-looking statement disclosure in the news release and the slide deck and remind you that today's comments will include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual results to be materially different from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.","These factors include required regulatory approvals that are material conditions for proposed transactions to close, the strength of the U.S. or other economies; automotive vehicle production level, mix and schedules, energy and commodity prices, availability of raw materials and component products, currency exchange rates and cancellation of or changes to commercial contracts; as well as other factors discussed in Item 1A Part 1 of Johnson Controls' most recent annual report on Form-K for the year-ended September 30th.","Johnson Controls disclaims any obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this presentation. And with that, we'll get started. Alex?","Alex Molinaroli","I'm pretty excited to be here today. We've finished our first year \u2013 my first year and I'm really proud to talk about our record earnings from our continuing operations and also our earnings per share. At the beginning of the year, we talked about the way that we thought the building market would work and even the battery market. And we were surprised \u2013 I think all of us were surprised with the tough market and the slow recovery.","Of course, on the upside we were surprised, all of us, about the production levels really across the globe from an automotive perspective and all that being said, if you look at our margin improvement across the board regardless where we had great growth or not. I'm really proud of what the team has accomplished.","The effectiveness, efficiency and quality of the products that we're putting in place, the processes are in place, are coming through and the results. You look across the board; everything from automotive which is at a record net income, almost 6%. I don't think we've ever done that in our history. I'm extremely proud. In fact today I'm in Plymouth with our automotive team. So if we're a little bit clumsy today, the rest of the team is in Milwaukee.","Let's talk about some of the things we did because what makes me so proud of the team is that we were able to accomplish all of this while we had so much going on. And I don't know \u2013 I've only been with the company 30 years. So I don't know what happened before the 30 years, but I could tell you in the 30 years that I've been here. I don't know that we've tried to undertake as many things as we've done in the last year. And we've done that without skipping a beat on our operations. In fact, our operations have improved.","I would like to go through a few of the things. We've changed some of our capital allocations philosophy and we started our share repurchase program. We increased our dividend; we began implementing the Johnson Controls Operating System.","We'll talk more about that when we see you in December, but essentially that's leveraging our best-in-class manufacturing, our integrated supply chain capabilities, our purchasing scale and capabilities, commercial excellence programs, across the enterprise and we've had a tremendous amount of success and in fact, I think are further ahead than what I expected at this particular time.","So a lot of things happened in our portfolio, with the acquisition of ADT, the increase in BE's products and channels to market, it's going very well. I have the opportunity to sit in with that team and the ADT integration is going at or better than the pace that I expected from the standpoint of the team being on-boarded. Our new employees seem to be well integrated and our new customers seem to be very happy with Johnson Controls being part of their solution.","It seems like a long time ago when we divested the electronics, but it wasn't that long ago, so we were able to complete that this year. We set up the MOU with Hitachi. It's very important to us to be able to acquire some of the technologies that we need for our building efficiency business.","We announced our joint venture with the interiors, one of our partners in China and taking that global joint venture which will be the largest and most profitable interior business in the world, taking that globally and we look forward to closing that in 2015.","Recently we announced some reorganizations, particularly within the building efficiency business. We separated the field operation in North America from the products and channel business and we put Bill Jackson in charge of the building efficiency business, and I will come back to that in a few minutes.","And then recently we announced our decision to divest the global workplace solutions. I will also make sure that you understand not only did we have that distraction going on within the business, but they were able to have one of the best years in the history of that business not only on the bottom line, but they've been securing orders here in the last few months. Around our operational improvements, the metals, month-after-month, quarter-after-quarter seems to be on a path to continuous improvements, and the interiors improvement is really not \u2013 it's almost breathtaking what they have been able to accomplish.","It's a real turnaround and it makes our joint venture arrangement much easier and much more successful as we come together with our partner. And if you look at our profitability in the automotive business, I referenced that we've never seen these profitability levels. And we're not done. The team is confident and moving forward. I feel really good about what we've accomplished in our automotive business.","Let's talk about the management changes, with all this going on, I think we\u2019re at a place in our organization that we need to take advantage of the strong bench that we have. We have got great leaders and I think that our ability to take advantage of that leadership will help us keep on pace to make sure that we can transform this organization while we meet our annual budget.","Let me go through these changes. I announced that Bruce McDonald would be Vice Chairman and if I talk about what Bruce is going to do, Bruce is probably one of the best CFOs in the Fortune 500, but he's really become CFO plus and I think the folks that know him know that Bruce has always done his job and a little bit more. And so what we\u2019re trying to do is make sure we take advantage of his capacity and not only his capacity but the fact that we have good succession planning.","So Bruce will be managing our corporate development group, our M&A activities. He is consolidating our purchasing activities across the company. He will be managing our discontinued operations and he's leading our multiyear, $1 billion ERP system implementation. He will also provide additional operations support and oversight for the organization and I'm really happy to have a partner like Bruce on the team.","We couldn't do that without a great CFO. I think a lot of you know Brian Stief. Brian has been with us for four or five years, but before that he was off and on our partner with PWC. This is going to be a seamless transition and you'll get more and more exposure to Brian as we move forward. I referenced Bill Jackson. I think that Bill's resume, even just talk about what he's done since he's been at Johnson Controls.","I think he's the right guy for the job. He was very successful in turning around both our electronics and our interiors business. He was a part of the GWS transformation activities. I think that Bill is going to hit the ground running. He is more than pretty excited about the role that he has and I expect great things from Bill and the team at building efficiency.","And then last but not least, we talked earlier in the year announced about Beda Bolzenius [ph] moving to Shanghai to lead not only the automotive business which is becoming more and more centered in Shanghai, but also becoming the Vice Chairman for Asia Pacific as we put our second headquarters there allowing us to make the kind of investments in the future that we need to maintain our leadership position.","Let's talk about the fourth quarter, it's pretty obvious, I'm pretty happy with what was accomplished, 3% growth on the top line. I wish it was more, but the markets weren't helping us. But in spite of that, you can see that our segment income, up 11%, all-time record and then our EPS due to our operations and our buyback up 14% to $1.04. I'll just keep saying it; the amount of change that the organization has gone through and our ability to stay focused is something to be proud of.","I would like to spend a little bit of time on building efficiency. It's been the one thing that's been a frustration and nagging at us, at least over the last year and really for the last few years and I haven't been willing to make a whole lot of commitments about when we were seeing the turnaround in the marketplace, but I have a smile on my face just so you know. I would like to talk about what we saw in the quarter.","Our sales for the applied equipment was up 22% versus Q4 in 2013. The industry grew at 10%. So we gained some share, but the industry growth is probably the most important part of this for us.","And we've seen it across the board. It's not just in the commercial markets. Not all the institutional markets, but if you look at healthcare, local government, the federal government \u2013 we're seeing projects \u2013 not only are we securing projects, but we're also seeing projects on the Board and our pipelines are improving.","In the light commercial, I really wanted to highlight our ADT growth. We\u2019re in-line with the market and in-line with our expectations. At this point, I think that's the right message, because we just want to make sure that we are able to integrate everyone effectively and assure our new customers that they will be taken care of well. And one part of our business that didn't perform from a top line as we hoped it would was our residential business.","Our sales were flat; the market grew for the quarter. A big part of that was the fact that we've changed some distribution in some of our key markets. So as we get through that, we\u2019re going to have a period here until we come out of that change. I would like to come back about our secured, first time no matter how you slice it up, first time in a year that we've seen growth, 2% growth ex-FX \u2013 ex-FX ADT.","We're seeing the billings from Architectural Monthly AIA go up. You can see that on the chart and if you look at our pipelines which are usually looking out six months, we're seeing some significant projects on the board. So, for the first time \u2013 and you know I've been reluctant \u2013 I feel like there is some momentum in the business and unless something external happens, I think we've hit the bottom.","So let's talk about going into next year. We've got great momentum. I do think that this year will be a year of execution. We have many things going on within the businesses around improvements, around continuous improvements, around integration of activities and we also have portfolio changes and different initiatives that are happening at the enterprise level. We continue to invest in our long term, but we need to keep working on this margin expansion and when we get to talk to you in December. We will have more about that, but I'm pretty bullish that we will continue to expand our margins.","And the last thing I would like to leave you with and this is important, is that I'm not looking for any portfolio changes, significant portfolio changes particularly as it relates to divestitures. I guess that's the way to talk about it; over the near term, over the next few years.","We right now are pretty happy with the businesses that we have. We look across our portfolio, we have great businesses and we have some platforms whether it be technology or regional for growth. We do need to add value to those platforms, but we do think we have great platforms moving forward.","So with that I'm going to turn it over to Bruce and he can give you some more fourth quarter highlights.","Bruce McDonald","Okay. Thanks, Alex and good morning, everyone. So let me just start on slide 9, with automotive. Maybe just to comment, as I talk through the business results, I'm going to exclude the number of nonrecurring items that we had in this year and last year and Brian will take you through those in his comments. But just starting with automotive, I think it's probably fair to say we just couldn't be more pleased with the results that we saw for our automotive businesses both here in the fourth quarter and also for the full year.","We saw strong improvements in our metals business in our European operations, in South America and certainly last but not least, our interiors business and if you look at our margins in the fourth quarter and the full year, significant year-over-year improvement.","The other thing I would note as it relates to automotive is we did maintain a disciplined approach to quoting new business during the year. We've talked about focusing on winning customers, focusing on higher growth markets in China and we were pleased to talk to \u2013 for the full year, we booked a record amount of new and replacement business as we saw our customers really take advantage of the fact that we've got differentiated technology that we can offer. We have a global, low-cost footprint.","We've got global launch and program management capabilities and we just continue to be pleased to get the recognition from our customers with significant new business awards. And the areas where I would really point to would be metals.","We have won a number of large metals, huge contracts, huge multi-year, multibillion-dollar contracts that we thought was going to happen in the industry as customers commonize their seating metals platforms. We were really able to take advantage of that with the footprint that we have. In China, our metals business \u2013 we started a couple years ago at low single digits. Our market share now is nearly up to the 20% level. Interiors, we talked on our last call about new business wins in our interiors business as the customer is really embracing the joint venture that we're putting together with Yanfeng Automotive Trim Systems.","In North America I would note in the quarter we won our first BMW. They've been a long \u2013 this is the interiors side, our first BMW order. We've done business with BMW for a long time in Europe and in China, but this was our first award in the interior side in North America. We will talk a lot more about our backlog at the December analyst meeting, but I thought it was important just to sort of share with you the tremendous success we've had on the customer front here.","So if you just look at the numbers, you can see from an automotive perspective our sales were up 3%. Each of seating and interiors were up 3%, respectively. If you look at our geographic revenue mix, in North America we were up 6%, so a little bit below the 8% uptick in the North American market. In Europe, our revenues were down 1%, generally speaking in-line with the industry reduction. You can see here and as we noted on our slides in China, we continue to see really strong momentum in that market as we gain share.","As you know, most of our business is through nonconsolidated joint ventures and you can see in the fourth quarter here we are seeing our sales were up 17% to $1.8 billion which substantially outpaced the 8% improvement in estimated production for the region. If you look at China for the year, we really hit a milestone this year.","Our sales grew by about 25% to slightly over $7 billion, so that's a huge year-over-year increase and really reflects the share gains that we have in that region. Turning to profitability, you can see in the fourth quarter our segment income of $261 million was up 27% versus last year and our margins were up 100 basis points.","We continue to benefit from strong operational improvements in metals and interiors and our cost reduction initiatives and get the benefit from a contribution level of higher overall volumes. In terms of margins, seating was up 20 basis points to 5.2% and interiors was up significantly 360 basis points to $3.9 million. I didn't really talk about South America earlier, but a lot of industry comments and I know some of those left in the auto sector are having real difficulties down there.","We've been focused on turning around our South American operations all year. We're really pleased to be able to exit 2014 here with basically a breakeven business in North America. So we are really getting performance from the automotive team in the quarter and for the year. Turning to building efficiency, fourth quarter you can start to see the impact of ADT or Air Distribution Technologies, being in our numbers.","So with that acquisition, we have significantly increased our exposure to the light commercial sector and it's really opened up for us the independent distribution channel. As Alex mentioned in his comments, the integration is on track. Our fourth quarter numbers were right in-line with our expectations.","Importantly, I think from a sales perspective, even though its early days; we are already starting to see some of the benefits of cross selling. And in the quarter, we had about $1 million of combined, cross selling orders that came through our numbers.","So it's not a big number, but it's good to see that the thesis behind this investment was really driven on revenue growth and positioning us in higher growth markets and so it's good to see the sales synergies come through in such a quick pace. So when you put ADT into BE here, it just transforms our business. We're now seeing top line, bottom-line and margin expansion and we expect to see that accelerate here as we go forward.","If you look at the fourth quarter, you can see our revenues were up about 1% to $3.9 billion. If you take out ADT, which was about $240 million of revenue in the quarter and adjust for FX, our sales were down about 3%. If you look at that, geographically what you would see is that Asia and Europe were up 3% to 4% respectively, North America was down 5% and the Middle East and Latin America were down double digits for us.","In terms of our unexecuted backlog, you can see at $4.8 billion, we're up about 1%. This is the first increase we've seen in over a year. Again, as Alex mentioned, our backlog was up about 1%, with softness in Latin America, we're down about 30%. Europe we are down 8%. Asia was down 3% and it was offset by higher backlog in the Middle East. In North America I would just comment our backlog was up 1%.","Turning to orders and, again, if I adjust these for currency, they were up 11%. Again, taking out ADT and it was up 2%. If you looked at that geographically, we would see North American orders were up 5%. So that was the strongest area for us in terms of orders, Asia was up 4%, Europe was flat to down 1% and again, Middle East and Latin America were down double-digits.","So I think the important thing for us here is the big markets, North America and Asia, we are starting to see sequential improvement in orders and quoting. Our overall numbers though are being dragged down by pretty big declines in the Middle East and Latin America where we really have tough economies. So it was good to see those markets starting to turn positive. In terms of segment income, you can see a pretty significant increase, about 11% year-over-year to $393 million.","If you take a look at the margins ex-GWS, they were 11.8%, up 20 basis points versus last year. Here's where we are starting to see the benefit of improved results in Asia, the acquisition of ADT and the benefit of SG&A reductions. In terms of GWS, you can see here as we've noted, a huge improvement in our profitability \u2013 $61 million in the quarter more than double last year, a 290 basis points improvement.","And I would sort of like to add in to Alex's comments in terms of GWS's performance in the year. We saw significant improvement in both our profitability and our margins. On the customer side, we won an awful lot of new business particularly in the second half of the year and if we look at the backlog for GWS which is not to be confused with the backlog that we quote in BE, it's the backlog of won customer contracts over the life of the contracts. It's up 47% versus last year. So I think, just with the business improvement, the improvements we\u2019ve made in the operating model, the customers are recognizing our ability to provide a global solution.","And it has positioned the business really nicely in terms of our divestiture. We are not going to really get into the details of that. I would just comment that we're working with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. We've got a robust process in place and we've got a lot of interest, but it's very early days. We've been at it for just over a month now.","And lastly, turning to power solutions for the fourth quarter, you can see sales were up about 5% over last year. Lead levels were comparable, so sometimes we've got big adjustments because of year-over-year lead, that wasn't really a factor for us this year. In terms of unit volumes, we\u2019re up 4%. Geographically we\u2019re up 6% in North America, 10% in Asia and Europe down 3% where we're still seeing some destocking and if you were to look underneath those European numbers, you would see that the aftermarket was down 5%, whereas OE was up about 4%.","In terms of AGM, as we noted on the slide here, we\u2019re up about 23% to just over $2 million in the quarter. We've added several new customers during the year in power solutions, as we've talked about on previous calls. And if you look at our market share, what you would see is in the Americas \u2013 I'm being inclusive of South America, Central America and North America \u2013 in aggregate we improved our market share by 200 basis points to 55% this year and our European market share, despite the fact that we saw some destocking in the aftermarket side held steady at about 53%.","In terms of our segment income at $329 million, we were comparable to the level last year, although our margins were down about 100 basis points. I think the key thing to note in terms of our margin performance in power solutions was we talked about changing from LIFO to FIFO inventory accounting and that really changed the way the timing and the amount of lead that we purchased and some of our inventory stocking and destocking on a quarterly basis.","So when you adjust that out, we had a little bit of choppiness in terms of the overall quarters as it flowed through in 2014. But I think the key takeaway that I would like you to remember here is, if you look at our full year margin performance we went into this year with an expectation that power solutions would deliver a 50 basis point improvement in our margins and we came through with a 60 basis point improvement.","It could have been a little bit better had we seen the aftermarket be a bit firmer, but overall we\u2019re pleased with the performance coming out of power solutions this year and the best 60 basis point margin expansion was a little bit better than our expectations.","So with that I will turn things over to Brian.","Brian Stief","Okay. Thanks, Bruce and good morning, everyone. Page 12, fourth quarter highlights. As you'll note in our press release, our Q4 results included four nonoperational items which resulted in a net charge of $0.58 in the quarter and I would like to just touch on those. There was a restructuring and impairment charge for about $162 million related primarily to our building efficiency reorganization, about half of that charge is cash and the other half is noncash.","The second item would be there is our annual Q4 noncash mark-to-market adjustment related to our pension and OPEB plans. Given the decline in interest rates year-over-year, that charge in the current year was $290 million. The third item was transaction and integration related costs associated with the number of portfolio activities that we've got going on. It was $23 million. And in the fourth area, there were three significant tax items, discrete tax items, in the fourth quarter that netted down to $18 million. So, the aggregate of those four items is the $0.58, and as I go through my discussion of the financials here, I will exclude those items from my comments.","Overall, fourth quarter revenues were up 3% to $11 billion, driven primarily by the automotive and power solutions businesses. Gross profit for the quarter of 17.2% was in-line with last year and what you really see there is that growth in our gross margins for the automotive seating and interiors business, GWS and building efficiency in Asia that Bruce referred to were offset by declines in BD North America and declines in our power solutions business of the 100 basis points.","On a year-over-year basis, SG&A declined by about 2% which was a result of some aggressive cost reduction initiatives that we continue to implement across our businesses. Equity income of $122 million was $28 million higher than year ago levels which reflects the improved profitability from our automotive and building efficiency joint ventures in Asia.","And I would point out that about half of that gain in equity income resulted from a nonrecurring gain associated with the buyout of one of our joint venture partners. Overall, fourth quarter operating income was strong, up 11% versus last year and segment margins of 9% were 70 basis points better than 2013, so overall a very strong performance.","Moving to slide 13, net financing charges of $66 million were up $12 million versus prior year levels and these higher financing costs are simply the result of the financing of the ADT acquisition in June of 2014. As far as a tax rate, our effective rate for the quarter was 19.6%, a slight improvement from the 20.6% that we had in the fourth quarter last year. Income attributable to non-controlling interests was a charge of $37 million in the fourth quarter of this year which is slightly higher than last year which is a function of the higher profitability in the automotive and building efficiency joint ventures that we\u2019ve globally. But overall a very strong quarter with diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.04, which is up 14% versus the $0.91 a year ago, so very pleased with the performance.","I would like to spend a little bit of time on slide 14, going through some of the highlights of our balance sheet and cash flow for the year. Our fourth quarter cash flow from operations was $1.2 billion which allowed us to generate a net debt reduction in the quarter of $1.1 billion. Trade working capital as a percentage of sales was 6.1% which was a 30 basis point improvement from last year, but I would point out this area of working capital is something that we need to focus on as we move into 2015. We still aren't at a position that we would like across our businesses, so that's going to be an area of focus of mine as we move forward here.","Capital spending of $1.2 billion for the year was in-line with our expectations. Free cash flow for the year inclusive of the electronics divestiture proceeds of $265 million, approximated $1.5 billion. And in the current year, we doubled the cash return to our shareholders through our buyback programs and dividends to $1.8 billion in 2014 from $900 million in 2013.","So as we move into 2015, we are very pleased with our balance sheet position. I think we're very strong as we enter the year. Our net debt to cap ratio ended the year at 35.7% which is a 260 basis point improvement from the end of the third quarter and obviously up from last year's 26.5% level due to the share repurchase that we did in Q1 for $1.2 billion and then the $1.6 billion acquisition of ADT in Q3. As far as our pension and OPEB liabilities, we are 86% funded as of the end of this year which was a bit lower than last year which was at 88%. And the delta there is really due to the lower discount rates.","I would like to point out that during the fourth quarter we completed a lump sum buyout of certain current retirees in our U.S. pension plan which was $300 million, and as you may recall, last year in Q4, we offered a lump sum buyout to certain of our deferred vested plan participants for $450 million.","Now the funding of that $750 million in buyouts obviously comes from plant assets versus Johnson Controls. Lastly, from a weighted average debt maturity at the end of 2014, it's 14 years which is up from nine years at the end of last year and this really is reflective of the opportunity that we took in connection with the ADT acquisition in Q3 to term out some of our debt and lock in the benefits of today's low interest environment on a long term basis.","And then finally I would say that, just to point out, when you look at the balance sheet, we have taken our GWS business and our interiors business and we've now classified those as assets held for sale in our year-end balance sheet, given the pending transactions with both those businesses that we expect in fiscal 2015.","So moving to slide 15, overall our fourth quarter performance was strong and provides us confidence as we enter Q1 of 2015. We continue to expect strong volumes in the automotive business to continue.","As Alex and Bruce mentioned, our pipeline supports continued order improvement in building efficiency and some of the reorganization actions that we have taken in Q4 of this year we expect to see some early benefits as we enter fiscal 2015. Power solutions is expected to once again deliver year-over-year improvements and one other item that I had just mentioned relative to Q1 is we've got $1.2 billion in share repurchases that we are planning for all of fiscal 2015 and about $600 million of that will likely occur in our first quarter.","We continue to make progress with the previously announced portfolio activities which would be the GWS divestiture, the Hitachi JV and interiors JV. As we sit here today, our targeted completion for those is the second half of fiscal 2015. In addition, as Alex mentioned, the ADT integration activities are well underway and progressing in-line or possibly even in excess of expectations.","So as far as Q1 guidance, we expect earnings per share to be $0.74 to $0.77 which is up 12% to 17% year-over-year. And, again, that would exclude transaction and integration costs just given the level of activity that we've got in that area and that impact on a quarterly basis could range anywhere from probably $0.01 to $0.03 depending upon how things play out timing wise with those transactions.","And then lastly, I would say we will provide full year guidance at our December 2nd, Analyst Meeting in New York. So with that Glen, I will turn it over to you for questions.","Glen Ponczak","Great. Thanks, Brian. So we've got about 25 minutes until the top of the hour here and so to give as many people as possible a chance to ask a question, please limit yourselves to a question and perhaps a short follow-up and then get back in the queue if you've got more. So with that Madison, we will turn it over for questions.","Question-And-Answer Session","","Operator","(Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from the line of Mr. Colin Langan of UBS. Sir, you may now begin.","Colin Langan \u2013 UBS","Just one sort of maintenance question, Brian, I just wanted to clarify, your guidance for this year, does that include \u2013 you mentioned that the GWS and interiors are moved in discontinued ops for the balance sheet, but your guidance does include that and until it actually officially happens from an earnings perspective?","Brian Stief","That's correct.","Carol Lowe","Okay and then just one strategically, seating margins seem pretty solid here for the last couple of quarters. Obviously there is some help with equity income. What are the next steps to getting through your longer term targets for the business? What are the major drivers of getting margins higher from here?","Alex Molinaroli","A lot of this is more of the same. We\u2019ve a lot more opportunity in metals just in the program that we have today and the other thing that is important to note is, as our backlog changes in metals, in particular we are moving from 3 to 4 different product lines because of the different companies that are being integrated to one set of SKUs and product lines for each one of the components. And that's going to lower our costs on an ongoing basis, that will be further down the road, but that's an expectation we have as the metals continues to evolve.","The other thing is \u2013 and we talk about equity income and that's where a lot of our growth is going to be in the future because of the fact that the growth in China and where we're going to make the investments and with our partners. We want to maximize that as much as possible, and we just still have \u2013 because of our pricing discipline, we\u2019ve the opportunity to continue to increase margins in our mature markets.","So I think there is not one single thing. Our equity income is going to continue to increase at a fairly rapid rate, but I also think there's still improvement within our business, our core business, particularly around components and in Europe.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Robert Barry of Susquehanna. Sir, your line is now open.","Robert Barry \u2013 Susquehanna","Just to Alex, I wanted to dig in a little deeper on the increased confidence level in BE. Obviously nice to see the orders inflect and it sounds like the pipeline is full, but are you seeing more sustainable \u2013 what you think will be sustainable willingness to convert all of the pipeline activity into orders going forward and what do you think might be driving that?","Alex Molinaroli","Well, it's interesting that you asked that question. Actually I would turn what you\u2019re calling convert if you look at our pipeline to hit ratio, that is how our team would look at it and that has actually gone up. We do a fairly good job of making sure that we filter out our opportunities.","So one of the things that has happened is our hit rate has gone up and that makes me believe that the pipeline is very healthy. Also, the reason around it I think is sustainable. When you start seeing the institutional market and the larger projects start to get on the board. I think you\u2019re starting to feel some confidence that the market is going to respond. To be real specific, all the verticals institution, with the exception of the state government and I think that has to do mostly with the fact that we had this huge Hawaii project in our pipeline last year \u2013 have increased, some more than others.","In particular we\u2019re seeing a rebound in healthcare which has really hurt us over the past few years. So I guess I'm not going to \u2013 the confidence level I have is I'm making sure that everyone realizes I do see a significant change in what's happening.","We're not out of the woods yet, but the fact that we are able to see what we saw on a continual basis over the last three months and what's happened in our pipeline. I just feel a heck of a lot better about it.","Robert Barry \u2013 Susquehanna","Yes, maybe just a quick follow-up on the offset to the equipment side, sounds like the equipment sale is looking very good. Maybe you can comment a little bit on what's happening on the service and performance contracting side. Maybe your comment about state government ties into that, but just curious about the thoughts and the outlook there. Thank you.","Alex Molinaroli","Actually the one thing underneath everything is our focus on services increase, as you would guess because of the lack of capital projects. So our service business has been growing at a fairly good clip, particularly our planned services. Our retrofit business is growing, the pipeline is pretty strong. Our pipeline is about equal \u2013 just to make sure you understand, our pipeline is about equal in our energy solutions business, but you\u2019ve to remember we had the largest project ever of that we secured in December of last year with Hawaii.","And so with Hawaii and last year compared to the pipeline we\u2019ve today with no project like that, it's about at the same level. So really pretty much across the board we're seeing some strength.","Robert Barry \u2013 Susquehanna","Can you quantify the Hawaii impact?","Alex Molinaroli","Well, the Hawaii impact, it was over $100 million. I think it was around $120 million. It ended up being a $140 million project, but I think we had discounted about $120 million in our backlog. So, that's a good question, because when we see the results of our quarter, if we're able to secure similar to what we did last year in BE. I would say that the real growth in that, you'd have to take that $100 million project and discount what you see in the numbers. But the pipeline supports that we will have a continued growth throughout the year, but we won't have a $100 million project.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Brian Johnson of Barclays. Sir, your line is now open.","Brian Johnson \u2013 Barclays","So, I want to drill more into the BE segment in a few questions. You put together through a price increase my understanding in BE. Could you maybe clarify how broadly that was? Is that in the new services business or in the equipment business and will that be helpful to the margin going forward?","Alex Molinaroli","So there was a couple price increases over the year. The UPG segment had a price increase back in the spring and then we announced another price increase which was really much across the board. Now, it wasn't \u2013 every channel and every product didn't get the same price increase, but pretty much across the board we went for a price increase and what we're seeing so far for the most part, that the industry is following us. Right now we have tempered our expectation, so we've discounted a little bit of volume because of our price increase. But our expectation \u2013 and it will be in our guidance, in our plan \u2013 is we built in the net effect of the price increase.","We do think that there could be some discounting down the road, but right now things seem to be sticking.","Brian Johnson \u2013 Barclays","Okay. And are you seeing any benefits yet from splitting services and products? And maybe just talk strategically about what that was meant to accomplish and then what we're seeing on it and does it open up even in the U.S. broader distribution for what you are making beyond your traditional branches?","Alex Molinaroli","Yes and we will cover that in some detail in December, but the bottom-line for that was that we had a business that was becoming very dependent on our branches for decades. And in order for us to be able to support multiple channels, we needed to disconnect the two organizations and make sure we built a world class product and distribution company. The core of BE and that we continue to focus our branch business and being a great service and delivery organization and a channel for our BE products. So it was built to give ourselves some transparency and our ability to manage more effectively the products that we put in the portfolio and the new distribution that we are putting in place. So that's the strategic rationale.","Brian Johnson \u2013 Barclays","Okay, and any impact yet on the backlog or margins or we will have more in December?","Alex Molinaroli","Yes, I don't know that there would be any impact yet, but I can tell you from an internal perspective, people are asking questions that they've never asked before, because there is a whole different set of dependencies or lack of a codependency that there used to be in the past. So I expect really good things. I expect us to be more efficient and I expect us to be able to pick up our pace as it relates to new products and our ability to support our channels, but I can't really say that anything has happened yet, but I feel really good about the change.","Brian Johnson \u2013 Barclays","Okay and final question, just very quickly. Metals, big year-over-year dollar improvement, are you getting close to that 10% margin I believe you talked about in the past?","Alex Molinaroli","No, we're not there. Yes, we've got a ways to go which is I'll treat that as opportunity. We won't get to those levels till we get through, first, making sure that the backlog that we\u2019ve that we\u2019re as effective as we can and then as we start transitioning our product line to a single product line where we\u2019re able to get the real cost efficiencies. So that's going to take a while, but we've got that opportunity in front of us.","Bruce McDonald","Yes, I would maybe just add to that, Brian to Alex's point, we're probably in the lower 2% \u2013 3% right now from a North American and European perspective because we are working that through. But if you look at our metals business that we have right now in China which is about a $500 million or $600 million business, that business where we do have the 2B product portfolio and we have the manufacturing processes standardized. So we don't have the integration, we started it fresh, that business is at the 10% \u2013 11% margins right now. So we're confident we can get there. We're there in China, but it takes a long time for these customer programs to roll-off and for us to retool our metals facilities.","Brian Johnson \u2013 Barclays","Okay. So that's a long term margin improvement glide path?","Bruce McDonald","3 to 4 years.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Emmanuel Rosner of CLSA. Sir, your line is now open.","Emmanuel Rosner \u2013 CLSA","I wanted to ask you \u2013 so global workforce solution is now officially for sale. How is the process going so far? What sort of interest and from what type of buyers are you seeing? And then more fundamentally, I completely agree with the rationale of it not being core, but at the same time removing it will obviously will remove a little bit of earnings power. Are you saying to divest it in a way that still creates some shareholder value or is it really just more strategically it makes sense?","Bruce McDonald","Okay. Like I think I talked about earlier, it's pretty early in the process. We're working with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. We've put together you can say an offering, memorandum and we've met with a number of folks that are interested and we're coming up to the point in the process where we're going to get expressions of interest and then decide on a shorter list who are going to go forward in the process. But it's very early days and I think we are in good shape. There is a lot of interest. The business has performed well, so we got I think a lot of good things going for us.","And from a timing perspective, we are probably 3 to 6 months \u2013 it's probably late Q2, I guess I would say is when we hopefully get to be in a position where we announce something and then, depending on who the buyer is we\u2019ve to go through the normal regulatory process, but that's the timeframe.","In terms of your question then about is there any shareholder value implications, I think clearly with some of the people that are interested in the business that are already in that \u2013 the strategic players that are already in that space, what it does provide as you think about the reason we got into the facilities management business was to provide a channel for our products. And so to the extent we sell GWS to another strategic buyer it broadens the channel that we\u2019ve available to us to sell our products to.","So, as we're thinking through this divestment and particularly with the strategic buyers, then structuring an arrangement where we would have access to their expanded portfolio of real estate and customers is a key thing that we are looking at. So, we hope to get that, but we may not.","And then I think second part of that question would be how we choose to redeploy the cash and I guess we haven't really commented publicly on what we're going to do with the money. Right now I would say we're focused on getting the money.","Emmanuel Rosner \u2013 CLSA","And then just one follow-up on another update of a deal, can you maybe tell us how the Hitachi negotiations are progressing and the late estimate on when we may see a conclusion of that?","Alex Molinaroli","We've gone it a long way since the last time we had a chance to talk about this. In fact, I will be heading over there myself in a couple weeks. We've got a few things that we need to work through, but I think we're pretty close to hammering out the few issues that we have.","It's been a lot slower than we expected. I think it was much more complicated than it was when we got involved. I'm still a little bit leery about giving you a date, but I'm just hopeful when we get together here over the next couple of months, we are able to talk about a date. But we're getting \u2013 it's closer than it was yesterday and I apologize I can't have better information.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mr. John Murphy of Bank of America. Sir, your line is now open.","John Murphy \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Just a question around the seating and interiors business, the way that you are discussing it and the business is developing. It sounds like you're much more committed than a lot of people think to that business and certainly much more committed to it than some of your competitors are alluding to. And just curious if you can comment on that and then as we think about margins going forward, if you could remind us what your targets are there for seating and interiors and how new business or what level of new business is rolling on as far as margins?","Alex Molinaroli","From a strategic standpoint, in fact you're right. I wanted to make it very clear that at this time we're not making out any other major portfolio moves and the seating business, along with our interior joint venture that we have are core to us being successful in the future. And when we talk in December, you'll understand some of the rationale. First off, the China opportunity for us is outstanding and it's based off our relationships with our partners and so we don't want to \u2013 we want to take advantage and exploit that and I'm not sure we get the fair value for that in the first place. I'm not sure we're getting fair value today for that to be honest with you.","And then the second thing that's really important to us is that we make sure that we take the expertise that we\u2019re getting out of the automotive business because of the demands of our customers and leverage that across our enterprise. So, one of the things that the automotive business brings to us around program management, our purchasing and engineering capability, our manufacturing capabilities and supply chain work, is world class because it has to be.","And we're able to take those resources, take those people and take those processes and put it across our enterprise. So when you think about that business and what value it brings to Johnson Controls. I think we\u2019ve to look past just the seating business and in the interior business and what value it creates regionally with our footprint and what value it creates intrinsically inside our organization.","Bruce, you can give them some of the numbers that we are looking to get.","Bruce McDonald","Well, I could just comment mainly on the segment income margins. The plan is to take that to 7% or maybe even a little bit above 7%, but as we sit here today, that's been kind of our stated goal for a number of quarters and that still continues to be the case. So I would say around 7%.","John Murphy \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So it would be fair to say that new business is rolling on at that level or much higher to offset some of the older legacy business?","Bruce McDonald","Yes, I would say that. I'm not suggesting we are necessarily going to get that level in fiscal 2015 here, but that is certainly our goal over the next few years.","Alex Molinaroli","One of the things that's happened is our mix is changing. As Bruce talked about our metals backlogs, our backlog is shifting from just being jet business to being components business, particularly metals and that mix is favorable as it relates to our overall margin. So it's not only margin improvement in our business, it's a mix improvement.","John Murphy \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And just to sneak in one, just on proceeds that you are going to raise ultimately from some of these asset sales. Could you just run us through the funnel of where those proceeds may be allocated as far as acquisitions or returning value to shareholders or reinvestment in the core business?","Alex Molinaroli","I will talk at that from a strategic level. We're not really ready to talk because GWS will be the first place where we see some cash coming in. We're committed to our share repurchase program at this point. There is no reason with our cash flows that we can't continue on that program and so we've got a couple more years to go with that.","As it relates to the use of proceeds for GWS, we\u2019ve a significant amount of ideas, more ideas than we have resources. In a way they help continue to transform this business from an operationally capable business into adjacencies and other markets that we can support that are going to be outside of automotive.","So I'm hopeful that we\u2019re going to redeploy that cash in a way that helps us build more growth platforms, that's what we need.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Rich Kwas of Wells Fargo. Sir, your line is now open.","Rich Kwas \u2013 Wells Fargo","Two questions, Alex, on building efficiency, so applied sales up nicely in the quarter year-over-year, Ex GWS, the margin is up 20 bps. It seems like the margins could've been better given that should be pretty good mix for you and I'm just curious if there is anything unique in the mix this quarter or from a regional standpoint that affected the limited leverage, if you will.","Alex Molinaroli","Yes. So, I actually don't have the numbers in front of me. One of the things that's been a drag to our margins all year is we've had some nagging large contracts in the Middle East and that has distorted our numbers off and on during the year. Brian, you probably have a view of that right now \u2013 but that's one of the things that I would look for. And the other thing that we weren't happy about is you saw our residential business didn't perform at the same levels and that's a high margin business, too.","Those are the two things I would point at, but the business that we are getting in the applied side is a good margin business, but it was in our backlog.","Rich Kwas \u2013 Wells Fargo","Okay, all right. And then I know you\u2019re going to give more detail in December, but if we take a step back and look at the world, currencies have weakened or the dollar has strengthened and other currencies have weakened and global auto production is slowing down. You've got some self-help certainly factored in for next year that could help nicely, but if we take a step back, how should we think about the longer term earnings growth profile for the company? You had a good earnings growth year \u2013 this year. What are kind of the puts and takes that you think were broadly for '15?","Alex Molinaroli","So if I look at 2015 and see what we're dependent on, the external market, I think that we still, even though there is a bit of a slowdown in China. We're outperforming the market in China. I think that will continue. We have lots of opportunity there. I think we have been very smart, very clever and judicious on how we've allocated our resources in the mature markets for our automotive business.","So I think our margins will continue there. The backlog is pretty much known and I think if something \u2013 absent something that happened a few years ago, I think we'll be fine. Our power solutions business, one of the things that's really interesting is that we almost sold 1 million units of AGM batteries in North America, that may not seem like a lot of units, but if you remember last quarter, I think \u2013 I can't remember what I said \u2013 that we were up some godly amount of percent\u00a0but we were up another 300% this quarter.","And so if that starts to take off, the mix is going to help in power solutions. It won't just be a European story. And I think that the China story is still intact as it relates to power solutions. That opportunity is there. It's just right there in front of us, we need to grab it.","And in building efficiency, I'm really bullish \u2013 we need the market to help us \u2013 but I'm really bullish that we're going to fix a lot of the issues that we had for us in places like the Middle East and the other thing that I'm bullish about is the changes that we have made in the organization are going to help us regardless of what the market does for us to be able to pull through on some of the products that we currently have in our portfolio.","So I think next year \u2013 I'm not saying it's all in the bag but I'm more worried in the long term about the growth than I'm about next year.","Glen Ponczak","","We've got time for probably one more, Madison.","Operator","Thank you, sir. Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Patrick Archambault of Goldman Sachs. Sir, your line is now open.","Patrick Archambault \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Just for me, wanted to just focus on power solutions a little bit what you were talking about. You were up I think 60 basis points you said in terms of your margins this year. However in the quarter there was some noise relating to that change over from LIFO to FIFO.","If I remember well, you had outlined a plan to run at similar levels of margin expansion over the next couple of years and wanted to get a sense of what the main drivers are, how much of this LIFO adjustment carries over if anything and maybe just fitting those pieces together for us. And then I have one follow-up.","Bruce McDonald","I think what we said about power solutions at our Analyst Day last year was we felt we had a couple hundred basis points of margin expansion left in power solutions and that the pace of that was going to be around 50 basis points a year. I know there is some analysts that think the pace should be faster than that 50 basis points a year, but I would point to the fact that we are stepping up our investment in some of the advanced battery things and particularly the micro hybrid and dual voltage 48 volt type systems.","So we\u2019re spending more money here because as we look longer out beyond say, a three year or a four year period that that could be an important growth driver for us. So, we\u2019re investing in that area.","The LIFO accounting change, maybe I have confused folks with that in the past. We've normalized each year from an accounting perspective, but we talked about the fact that we made that accounting change.","We did some things because we are on LIFO that were not how you would optimally run that business\u00a0and so what you are really looking at is two different years' results under the same accounting treatment. But in the prior year, we ran the business one way in terms of when we procured lead cores or when we have run our inventory of cores low versus when the market price was high or low.","Now we can take advantage of when there is market seasonality in lead prices and buying more inventory when it makes the most sense and the same thing with our production. We can smooth our production more in-line with seasonal demand, and so the choppiness that we've seen this year is really those two items that have sort of confused things--","It's really just going to be where are we going to get the other 150 basis points which we still have headwind against us I would say in terms of investing in advanced technology, but our China business continues to be \u2013 it's an area that we\u2019re investing in to add more footprint and so not dilutive to our margins.","And then the other point that Alex referred to is the increasing mix shift that we\u2019re going to see as AGM becomes a bigger portion of the pipe.","Alex Molinaroli","Yes, so I think the simple answer on that as it relates to the \u2013 it's actually smoother now than it was as compared to something that wasn't so smooth. I think this was kind of the new normal about how the quarters will flow. So we shouldn't see that as much of a whipsaw this coming year as we did last year.","Patrick Archambault \u2013 Goldman Sachs","If I can just do one follow-up, you had fairly mild temperatures during the summer. How does that impact your battery demand going forward? Is there a restocking effect that might be something to think about as we get into the fourth quarter because people's batteries lasted longer or is that immaterial?","Alex Molinaroli","In the end, I think it's really not going to matter. What will happen \u2013 the only thing that can happen if we don't get strong early sales is there will be one less cycle at the end of winter. This weather thing has been killing us the last few years. And so I think what we have done is smartly try to manage our inventory and not forecast sales and historically try to get where we are forecasting sales in a much more conservative way because we haven't been able to predict.","If you\u2019ve a good way of predicting the units, I would be open to it, but our tried and true methods haven't worked the last couple of years.","Glen Ponczak","Okay. Thanks, Patrick. Alex, a few closing comments?","Alex Molinaroli","Yes, so I just want to close \u2013 I want to thank our 170,000 employees. It's an outstanding accomplishment. I couldn't be more proud to be a part of this team and lead this team. The folks that you hear on the phone and all the people that support us that really do the work. It's been outstanding, particularly with all the distractions. All the anxiety and distractions inside this organization and this team has stayed focused, proud to be a part of it. Look forward to the coming year and I look forward to seeing you folks in December.","Glen Ponczak","Thanks, Alex.

","First that is around execution delivering both on our strategic and our financial commitments; second one is our transformation activities to make sure that we are able to complete successfully our portfolio actions. Recall the time when we had made those statements then we were talking mostly about the spin we weren\u2019t really including the Tyco transaction. ","Maintaining a strong balance sheet for the future in order to be have flexibility for our growth investments and then continue our drive toward being coming out real benchmark for operational excellence and I just like to make a comment, I believe that our Johnson Controls operating system continues to deliver tangible results and I think we just had more to come. So I am very pleased about that and then position ourselves with business platforms and you can think about the sectors that we participate in and operating models to be able to drive sustainable organic growth. ","All these with an eye, what\u2019s important to us is to increase shareholder value. I am really proud to say that we\u2019ve stayed focused. We\u2019ve been able to execute inline with the strategy and objectives that we talked about in December. ","With that, I\u2019d like to jump into the slides, just move to the Slide 7 please. On Slide 7, we have some highlights here I just like to report on. First our Q3 was a great quarter and excellent with the continued execution. Just for the Hitachi joint venture and currently in our lead cost pass-through our organic sales were 4% in Building Efficiency and 5% in Power Solutions. ","Building Efficiency growth was driven by both North America where we saw 3% growth and Asia at 9% and we are seeing some strength in China which is really encouraging. Power Solutions our unit growth across all of our regions, we\u2019ve had growth in all regions, what\u2019s particularly we are seeing strong growth in Asia, across at Asia 12% and our start-stop growth which is the future of our business over the next five years grew 22% driven by the Americas and China at 78% and 79% respectively. ","We have continued trend of our segment year-over-year profitability improvement with segment margins in all business units up 170 basis points across the board. Our adjusted EPS up 18% at $1.07 which is above our guidance for the quarter and with the strong operating performance we\u2019ve tightened our guidance to the higher end of our previous range. Brian will get into that later as it relates to our full year guidance.","We continue to invest in our future. During the quarter, we announced our joint venture with Bohai Piston Group which is an affiliate of BAIC in China to build our fourth plant. This strategic partnership is pretty important to us because it gives us access from an OE perspective to 5 million vehicles by 2020 and it also gives us access to distribution channel in 2400 outlets of OES shops in order to sell batteries to the aftermarket. ","With this local partner it\u2019s going to help us continue with our objectives to gain share in the region. We\u2019ve also announced that we are doubling our AGM expansion in North America by 2020 and while increasing our capacity up to 11 million units and we are taking advantage of the growing demand for start-stop. And I mentioned this earlier what we see is this technology is becoming more and more ubiquitous and vehicles as they come out and for our customers to meet the increasing regulatory targets. ","Our Hitachi joint venture continues to exceed our expectations and I\u2019d just give you a little bit of color on, if you look across the regions we are seeing strong performance in China, Japan and Taiwan and we are starting to see some opportunities in North America as we\u2019ve made significant investments in both product and sales. ","In order to drive profitability within the Hitachi joint venture and across the board our pricing, we\u2019ve brought pricing discipline along with cost reductions and across our operating system functions, manufacturing, procurement, and design. ","We also completed in the quarter, our $500 million stock repurchase that we announced last quarter. So we\u2019ve completed that and we are at share count that we talked about in the previous call. We continue to make great progress on our portfolio transportation \u2013 transformation activities. In fact, we are in a position now that we can talk about our merger date with Tyco moving to September 2nd and we continue to be on track for Adient spin date on October 31 as we previously communicated. Both Bruce and myself will talk about both of these transformation activities in further slides. ","If you go to Slide 8, financial highlights and we had a lot of moving pieces as we all know, if you look at the top-line and kind of break that down, you take the Interiors joint venture, where we deconsolidated the revenues for that and then you add back the Johnson Controls Hitachi revenues, you adjust for these two events and currency, our overall organic growth was 1% for the quarter. ","I noted previously that we saw strong growth in Building Efficiency and Power Solutions at 4%, 5% respectively. Overall, Automotive Experience is down 1%, Seating grew 1% and there is some remaining plants, if you recall in our discussions around our Interior joint venture, we maintained some of the plants in Interiors and as we wind those plants down as where we are seeing the decline in sales, not in our Seating businesses.","Segment income was up 19% excluding FX with margins at 170 basis points. Our adjusted diluted EPS up 18% and it\u2019s a second quarter in a row. Building Efficiency segment income continues to benefit from the contribution of Johnson Controls Hitachi, both higher volumes and cost improvements, that is being offset by some of the product and sales force investments we are making outside the joint venture. ","Auto had another exceptional profitability quarter driven by the performance of the Seating business. It was partially offset by lower than expected results from Interiors. ","Power Solutions continues to drive segment margin expansion with higher volumes both through manufacturing and pricing disciplines. ","Let\u2019s move to Slide 9, I\u2019ll give you an update on where we are with our merger with Tyco. We\u2019ve made a lot of progress in the quarter as we combined Tyco and JCI teams continue to work extremely well together. In the quarter, we\u2019ve announced our combined leadership team. Tyco has received an effective S-4 in our perspective it\u2019s clear and we\u2019ve set both shareholder meetings for August 17. The shareholders of record of June 27 should have received all the proxy materials in order to vote for the merger.","We\u2019ve received all of our antitrust clearances. So the shareholder vote is one of the last hurdles necessary to close. And based on that, we are expecting to accelerate the closing date to September 2. So we feel good about the progress we are making around synergies. ","And I\u2019d just like to reiterate the commitment that George Oliver and myself made during the quarter at the EPG Conference where we talked about $1 billion in runrate savings coming from the combination of the ongoing productivity and improvements at both Tyco and Johnson Controls along with the synergy cost reductions we remain committed and are optimistic that we\u2019ll achieve those. ","And finally I am lucky to say the date, we are going to have our first as a new company Analyst Day will be at the Mandarin Oriental in New York City on December 5 and if you could save that date it\u2019d be great because it\u2019s going to be an opportunity for us to talk about both strategically and financially on what the merged company would look like and what the expectations you should have and it\u2019s a main important event for us as we start our new journey as a combined company. ","With that I\u2019d like to turn it over to Bruce and he will update both around the Adient progress and the separation activities. ","Robert Bruce McDonald","Okay, thank you, Alex and good morning to everyone on the call today. I am real pleased to talk about where we stand in terms of the Adient separation, like the activity is ongoing with the merger with Tyco. We on the automotive side have had an extremely busy quarter as well. ","For us, July 1 was a huge milestone. It\u2019s the internal date that we said we were going to have effectively our separation largely completed. So we call that operational day one. So with that, we changed over the bulk of our IT systems, clone what we had to clone. ","We\u2019ve got new treasury systems in place. Good progress on the corporate organization structure. So for all intents and purposes, we are operating independently within Johnson Controls, we\u2019ve got a four months kind of running in parallel health until we get to our true separation which will be at the end of the October. ","In terms of the tracking of the cost of the separation, Brian had given an estimate of cost being in the $400 million to $600 million range. We are tracking well within those estimates. Those costs will quickly drop-off here in the fourth quarter and I think there is a little bit that hangs into the month of October. ","But that separation costs are on a pretty down \u2013 a pretty steep downward trajectory here as we\u2019ve done most of the activities. In terms of our Form 10, which we filed \u2013 which we filed during the quarter, the second version, it had our pro forma financial results in there and our 2-B balance sheet, in there we disclosed that we\u2019ll have $3.5 billion of gross debt. ","We\u2019ll retain $500 million and pay $3 billion dividend back to Johnson Controls just before the spin-off. In terms of our financing, great progress here. We are nearly, probably early next week we\u2019ll wrap up the first part of our financing plan which involves us putting in place $1.5 billion revolver which will be for working capital purposes and give us some cushion. ","And $1.5 billion of term loan A. Those \u2013 that we are just wrapping up the commitments from our lenders and we expect to close that out early next week and make an announcement. Then we\u2019ll shift into our bond programs. During the first two weeks of August, we will be marketing our bonds we expect to issue $2 billion of 8 to 10 year bonds here and close that transaction into escrow here in mid-August. ","In terms of our credit rating, I think we\u2019ve published that we\u2019ve received the double B Plus rating from S&P was consistent with our expectation at sort of one notch below investment grade and I really think it speaks to the underlying strength of our business and this bright future that we have. Moody\u2019s will publish a rating on us probably here within the next two weeks. ","In terms of the next version of the Form 10, that will be filed late next week. In there, I guess the most noteworthy thing is we\u2019ve decided in there to change our domicile from the UK to Ireland. ","That reflects really as we sort of working through the complexities of the separation with the new Johnson Controls entity being domiciled in Ireland, it was just more tax-efficient and less complex transaction structured for Adient to be Irish domiciles and so we made that change and you will see that reflect in the next version of the Form 10. ","I think the main issue from a financial perspective with that is it really doesn\u2019t have any impact on our numbers and with the Irish domicile we are still confident that our tax rate will be in the 10% to 12% range as we\u2019ve previously communicated. ","Lastly here, I would just comment as save the date, we expect to have our first Adient Analyst Meeting here in September 15, so prior to the spin-off we will be doing a number of shareholder outreach and one-on-one things from mid-September through our spin-off date, but sort of kicking that off will be an Analyst Meeting that we scheduled here for the morning of September 15 in New York. Teams are excited, working hard and really looking forward to legal day one. ","Maybe just transitioning into Slide 11 here, maybe just comment on our investment thesis and why the team is so excited before I turn things over to Brian. So first of all, I just point out our market position, I mean, clearly, we are the market leader in many, many sense of the word, if you look at our market share we are globally number one. ","It was 50% bigger than our next close competitor. Our product line up, we\u2019ve got a very diverse product line up from a vertical integration point of view we\u2019re the most vertically integrated. So extremely well positioned in the industry. ","Then I think really uniquely to us for Adient is our customer diversity that we have and I think it\u2019s clear that we are the envy of the industry. If you look at our share, our market share and we are leaders in all three of the major regions and we\u2019ve got great customer diversity with Japanese, with Chinese customers, our business really reflects the diversity of our \u2013 of the auto OE-based globally. So, we are not overly exposed to any one customer, any one region. We are the envy of the industry. ","In terms of looking forward, obviously automotive here is on an upward trajectory in terms of our margins and profitability this year and we expect to see that to continue as we get into \u2013 as we become our own separate company. ","We\u2019ve got a lot of self help initiatives, some operational efficiencies that we are going to implement and you can see here on the slide and we\u2019ve talked about this before that we expect to deliver 200 basis points of margin expansion over the mid-term here. ","Then lastly, coming out with $3 billion of net debt. We are not too worried about. We expect to have extremely strong free cash flow, I mean the automotive business is a strong free cash flow business. ","We will be ticking up our capital expenditure here to invest in some growth initiatives as we go forward and pay a competitive dividend, but all in all, very strong stable source of cash flow that will enable us to both quickly delever, paying attractive returns to our shareholders and also invest in growth initiatives to get the top-line moving again for automotive. ","And so with that, I thank you and I\u2019ll turn it back over to Brian to go through the business results.","Brian Stief ","Okay, thanks Bruce and good morning everyone. As you saw in our press release, our Q3 reported results include transaction, integration and separation costs of about $167 million, a restructuring charge of $102 million and a non-recurring non-cash tax charge of $85 million, which resulted in a net charge of $0.48 per share in the current quarter. We've summarized those items in an appendix, but just given their size, I\u2019d like to just briefly comment on each of those.","As far as the integration, separation and transaction costs, the majority of those costs in the quarter relate to the Adient separation, and as Bruce indicated we should be on the downside of those costs as we move through Q4 now and there will be some trailing cost into Q1 toward the separation date of October 31. ","As far as the restructuring charge, there is some non-cash impairments included in that. Stranded cost reductions in connection with us moving toward the Adient spin date as well as some footprint changes at the Automotive business. And then lastly the tax charge again is non-cash and it relates really to some Adient spin-off tax funding that\u2019s been done in the quarter. ","So as I talk through the business unit results and financials, I\u2019ll exclude these items from my comments and also consistent with Q1 and Q2, as you know we formed the Automotive Interiors JV in July 2015 and we closed on the Johnson Controls to Hitachi or JCH joint venture in October 2015 and those impact the comparability of the quarter-to-quarter results and I\u2019ll comment on those as I go through the slides. ","So with that, turning to Slide 12, on Building Efficiency, third quarter sales of $3.6 billion were up 36% from the prior year. If you adjust for FX and JCH sales grew by a solid 4%. Revenues in Systems and Services North America were up 3% as we saw good growth in the North American branches and in Products North America residential business drove year-over-year growth of 20% and Asia was up 9% ex Hitachi. ","In our rest of world segment, it was level with Q3 of 2015 with a few unpacks at Europe was up 5%, Latin America was up 3% and there was softness in the Middle East, it was down 10% and that\u2019s tied into oil prices. ","As far as orders secured in the quarter, excluding M&A and FX we were up 5% for the third consecutive quarter and we saw share gains in Systems and Services North America and Products North America related to our residential business.","Asia orders were also strong in the quarter up 6% and we ended the quarter with a backlog of $4.8 billion, which is up 2% year-on-year. As far as segment income of $397 million, it was up 48% ex FX, due primarily to the volumes in North America and Asia and the contribution of the Hitachi joint venture. ","As I mentioned last quarter, it\u2019s now difficult to isolate the Hitachi joint venture standalone results given all of the integration work that\u2019s going on and the investments that we are making in products and sales force that Alex referred to, but based upon some pro forma calculations we\u2019ve done, we would estimate that we\u2019d be in mid single-digit segment income growth without Hitachi. And overall BE segment margins in the quarter were very strong at 10.9%, up 90 basis points. ","So turning to Power Solutions in Slide 13, sales were up 3% compared to last year and 5% if you adjust for FX and the lead price. So lead price is today around 1700 versus last year at about 1950 and of course that impacts our top-line sales numbers. ","In terms of units, we saw higher volumes across all regions with global third quarter shipments up 2%, again if you unpack that, Asia was up 12%, Europe was up 2% and the Americas were up 1%. We continue to see strong start-stop growth with year-on-year volumes up 22% from 3.3 million units last year to 4 million units this year. ","All regions delivered higher year-on-year start-stop volumes with China at 79% and the Americas up 78% in growing markets and then in the mature markets, EMEA we are up 4%. We also saw Q3 global OE and aftermarket volumes increased 5% and 1% respectively. ","So from a segment income standpoint, Power Solutions delivered $262 million, which is up 13% ex FX and that continues to reflect the higher volumes, some strong price discipline and the ongoing favorable products mix that we are seeing at power. Their margins were up 130 basis points year-over-year and remain well above our expectations year-to-date. ","Moving to Automotive Experience, sales were down 19% compared to last year, but if you adjust for the deconsolidation of Interiors and FX, they were down 1% and we really saw strong global production in Asia and Europe that were offset by some expiring programs in North America. ","If you look at our China non-consolidated joint ventures on a 100% sales basis, they were up 49% in the quarter to $2.9 billion, but again, if you adjust for the Interiors joint venture and FX, they are only up 11%, but still very favorable relative to industry production of 5% in the quarter. ","Our Automotive team has been quoting significant new business and have secured wins of $4.3 billion year-to-date which already exceeds the fiscal 2015 full year total of $3.6 billion and they are well on their way to a record year of new business secured at Automotive. ","For the quarter, segment income of $344 was up 1% year-over-year as we continue to see the benefits of cost reduction and restructuring initiatives and overall Seating results were very strong however as Alex mentioned, we did see some softness in the Interiors business related to the retained plants that we have at Johnson Controls that were not contributed to the joint venture. China translation and some launch cost that were beginning to incur on new business. ","So total auto margins of 7.9% was very strong in the quarter, up 160 basis points year-on-year and up 20 basis points if you adjust for the Interiors deconsolidation. ","Moving to Slide 15 in the consolidated results for the quarter, overall third quarter revenues were down 1% to $9.5 billion, but if you adjust for Interiors FX and the Hitachi joint venture, sales were up 1% as Alex mentioned. Gross margin for the quarter of 19.8% was up 200 basis points and this just continues to reflect the benefits we are seeing from the favorable impacts of Johnson Controls operating system initiatives and our improved product mix. ","SG&A was up 7%, this increase is really a function of the consolidation of Hitachi joint venture as well as product and sales force investments in BE and this is offset by the deconsolidation of Interiors and our ongoing cost initiatives and I will just comment here as I think the overall focus that we have on G&A cost remains strong as we really right size our cost structure as we move toward the Adient spin-off in October.","As expected, equity income of $134 million was 40% higher than year ago levels, again that was due to about $19 million in the joint venture related to Interiors and certain joint ventures of JCH contributed another $30 million. So overall, third quarter segment margins of 10.5% were a 170 basis points better than 2015 and this is well ahead of the 70 basis point expectations that we had for the year. ","Turning to Slide 16, net financing charges of $69 million was slightly lower than last year and that\u2019s due primarily to the favorable interest rate environment we have today and consistent with the last quarter our tax rate remains at 17% which is favorable compared to our Q3 of fiscal 2015 which was at 18.5%. ","Income attributable to non-controlling interest is up $49 million compared to last year and that\u2019s primarily due to JCH and overall, we had a strong third quarter up 18% from $0.91 a year ago to $1.07 this year. ","And I just comment, I give tremendous credit to our business unit management teams as they continue deliver these outstanding results during a period when a lot of these portfolio transformation activities could be a potential transaction for our global teams. So, they are doing a great job. ","Turning to the balance sheet on Page 17 at quarter end, we have a net debt-to-cap ratio of 44% compared to the third quarter of last year which was at 40.7% and 40% at the end of last quarter. That increase really is a function of the share repurchase and some of the separation cost that were funded in the third quarter. ","If I turn to cash flow, our third quarter adjusted cash flow of $400 million was inline with our expectations. We have included an appendix in the deck which provides a reconciliation of our reported to adjusted free cash flow and to similar to the format we presented at our Analyst Day in December. ","And as you can see in the third quarter, we had transaction cost, separation cost in tax payments that totaled about $600 million. We do expect to be inline with the $1.5 billion free cash flow guidance that we provided at the December Analyst Meeting. ","If I turn to Slide 18, there are lot of moving pieces as we enter Q4 and I just like to comment on a couple of things before we get into Q&A here. As Alex noted, the expected merger date is now September 2, which will mean that we will pick up one month of Tyco results in our fiscal 2016 consolidated financial statements including the purchase accounting adjustments. ","Additionally, the consolidated balance sheet at the end of our fiscal year will include Tyco\u2019s historical debt of about $2 billion plus the new debt raise of around $4 billion that will be completed in connection with the transaction. And on our year-end earnings call, we will provide you with some pro forma financial information to demonstrate Johnson Controls performance exclusive of Hitachi as we provide our upcoming guidance here. ","Yesterday you may have seen we announced the fall order of our fourth quarter dividend of $0.29 to shareholders of record on August 5th and the payment date will be August 19th and we will continue to see the one-time or non-recurring items I guess, or special items related to transaction and separation cost in Q4, we will have likely another restructuring charge as we move closer towards the spin-off of Adient and the integration efforts associated with Tyco and we will have our normal Q4 mark-to-market adjustment related to our pension and OPEB plans. ","One technical thing from an accounting standpoint, we are not able to show Adient as a discontinued operation until the date of the spin. So, our year end financial statements will continue to show Adient as a consolidated entity and it won\u2019t be until Q1 that we show that as a disc-op. ","Turning to Slide 19 and our guidance and I\u2019d emphasize that the guidance that we are providing you excludes any impacts of the Tyco merger. Our Q4 earnings per share is expected to be in the range of 1.17 to 1.20 which is up 13% to 15% from Q4 last year and it does reflect the tightening of our full year guidance to 3.95 to 3.98 which will be up 15% to 16% from fiscal 2015. ","And I would just say with our fourth quarter guidance reflects the positive momentum we have going into Q4, but it is somewhat tampered by uncertainty around potential currency and volume headwinds that could exist in our Automotive business as we move through the fourth quarter. ","So with that, Kathy we can turn it over for questions.","Kathryn Campbell","Dale, we will now begin our Q&A. If you could please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up and then get back in the queue will be much appreciated. Dale?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] We have one from Joshua of Buckingham Research. Your line is now open.","Joshua Pokrzywinski ","Hi, good morning folks. ","Alex Molinaroli","Good morning. ","Joshua Pokrzywinski ","Just a quick question on BE margins, I guess, could you break down maybe some of the headwinds, tailwinds or are you moving pieces around price cost and then I know you had some investment spending last year, how did that look on a year-over-year basis? And then, maybe Brian just go through where we are at versus that $100 million of cost savings you expect it to get this year whether running ahead of that at this point or if that\u2019s all part of the performance in the quarter?","Alex Molinaroli","I won\u2019t put the numbers to it, Brian can do that, and then kind of give you a overview. As we\u2019ve quickly integrated the Hitachi business it\u2019s becoming more and more difficult for us to be able to tease out the margins inside Hitachi and outside Hitachi not because we don\u2019t have the results, but because we are making investments outside of Hitachi around on Products North America. So what you see was when you get into the Products North America, in particular you are going to see some margin pressure and you\u2019ll also see a little bit of margin pressure although because of the volumes been overcoming in SS&A where we are hiring sales people. And then we also have some products that we are building for our EPG business which had an excellent quarter, this quarter. We are making investments in new product development there. So those are the three, I guess, those are the three major headwinds we have as it relates to cost. All of them are investments and future products and a lot of that is real self help from the standpoint that we\u2019ve been able to lower G&A and reinvest it in the business in both products and sales people. I think, Brian could give you maybe some of the details around that.","Brian Stief","Yes, Joshua, I think on the $100 million number, of course that was the number that we showed at the Analyst Day and that was the gross save from our JCOS initiatives and then the net save was the 100 you referred. That of course is across all three of our businesses, but BE certainly is benefiting by that and I think some of that is reflected in certainly the margin improvement we are seeing at BE. But that $100 million would be across all three of our businesses and I would say we are pretty much on target with what we expected there. ","Joshua Pokrzywinski ","Perfect, and then, I guess just a follow-up, on the Tyco close moving forward, certainly good news there. Any expectation that we would update the synergy target or maybe some more crystallization or timing around that. At close, are you guys going to wait until you report the fourth quarter? ","Alex Molinaroli","So we will wait till December, yes, because I think that we want to make sure that as we get into post-close activities that we validate a lot of the things that we are working on now. We\u2019ve done an awful lot of planning, but I think as we put together our plans, as you remember we not only have synergy cost that we talk about as it relates to the deal itself, but also cost reduction initiatives with both companies, because we are still two separate companies, we don\u2019t have the level of details that we need to talk about it now, but when we come out December, I think we\u2019ll be able to have the level of details that becomes ourselves accountable and that you folks will be able to have some transparency too.","Joshua Pokrzywinski ","Perfect, appreciate it guys.","Operator ","Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Barry of Susquehanna. Your line is now open.","Robert Barry","Yes, hey everyone. Good morning. ","Alex Molinaroli","Good morning. ","Robert Barry","So, I think there were some concerns in the quarter perhaps about non-res flowing a little bit perhaps due to the Dodge Momentum Index slowing though it rebounded a lot in June. It looks like your orders in BE showed good growth, but steady versus last quarter even though the comp got a little easier. So just curious how you\u2019d characterize the momentum there and anything since last update, any verticals in particular got better worse?","Alex Molinaroli","So, across the board, we are seeing strong, but if you try to tease out underneath the overall North America what you trying is both in our HVAC business and our Controls business, we are not only seeing growth in the market but we are also gaining share. Where we having a tough comp is in our performance contracting business and our federal government business, those businesses are under some pressure and so, what, if you get underneath you will find the institutional markets in our core business, HVAC controls and ironically fire and security are growing extremely fast and then if you look at our performance contracting business, particularly the federal government business, we are seeing some slowdown there. And I think that is probably something that we are going to live with for a while. We're seeing a diversion of funds away from the type of activities we have. So there is just less opportunity there and in the Performance Contracting business particularly federal government. But I see strong momentum in the core of our business. ","Robert Barry","Gotcha and then maybe I did actually want a follow-up on the comments about the residential business, just because I think it\u2019s struggled a little for a while, it sounds like the momentum there is actually really good. So can you give us a little more color on how it performed and it sounds like it inflected and why that might be the case?","Alex Molinaroli","Well, it\u2019s a question, because we\u2019ve been on suppression, I mean, I think the comps are better, but we\u2019ve also had a lot of new products out in the marketplace. So we are seeing mid-teens growth in the quarter. So we had some strong growth. We\u2019ve had some specific wins. We\u2019ve also added some distribution throughout the region. So, we are pretty pleased with some of the growth that we are seeing because we haven\u2019t as we noted over a period of time, but mid-teens.","Robert Barry","Is that revenue or orders?","Alex Molinaroli","Revenue.","Brian Stief","Revenue.","Robert Barry","And the distribution you added, was that, I know you had some shortfalls or coverage weakness in Florida, in Texas because that were at\u2026","Alex Molinaroli","Yes, we lost \u2013 as you recall, we lost some distribution and in Florida we put some back and we\u2019ve also got some distribution across multiple regions, but in Florida specifically we have added back some distribution. ","Kathryn Campbell","And Rob, revenue and orders are both up mid-teens.","Robert Barry","Well, great. Even though maybe the weather wasn\u2019t super helpful. So, that\u2019s good.","Alex Molinaroli","Yes, that\u2019s great. ","Robert Barry","Thank you.","Operator ","Thank you. Our next question comes from Noah Kaye of Oppenheimer & Company. Your line is now open.","Noah Kaye ","Thank you. Good morning. Maybe just a follow-up since day with BE, so we do obviously have a little bit ongoing non-res tailwinds, you had mentioned a lot of new products in the marketplace, I was just sort of wondering particularly on VRF, what kind of traction you\u2019ve been seeing there in North America? You\u2019ve spent some resources that kind of integrate this the strength we are seeing seems to be kind of in the mid-market which is really kind of the sweet spot there. So, how is that tracking and kind of how much room do you think it has to run?","Alex Molinaroli","Well, a long way to go. I think we have, we are starting to get products out. We\u2019ve had some product gaps as part of the investment we are having to make because the products that were built by Hitachi were really not to serve the North American markets. So we are getting to where we have a full set of products. Our quoting activity is up quite a bit, but I\u2019ll tell you we still got a long ways to go and I think we will have the right product positioning and we are starting to see distribution sign up, but I would say that we are seeing most of that growth is, right now outside of North America. ","Noah Kaye ","Okay, thank you. And then just a quick clarifying question on Adient. The tax rate, it looks unchanged from previous expectations, but you did mention that you thought there might be some tax benefit moving from \u2013 moving to Ireland, certainly it\u2019s got a lower statutory corporate tax rate than the UK. So, can you just kind of clarify that for us a little bit. Is there a benefit, how should we think about that? Thanks.","Robert Bruce McDonald","This is Bruce here, maybe I\u2019ll just make a few comments and Brian, you may want to add in, but we disclosed that we would have a rate of around 10% to 12% previously when we thought we are going to be domiciled in the UK and with the change to Ireland, there is no difference and the reason why we don\u2019t have a reduction is because we really don\u2019t have any Irish income. We don\u2019t have any plants or anything like that in Ireland. So it wasn\u2019t a positive from a rate perspective for us. ","Noah Kaye ","Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. Thank you. ","Kathryn Campbell","Thanks, Noah.","Operator ","Thank you. Our next question comes from Rich Kwas of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. ","Richard Kwas","Hi, good morning everyone.","Alex Molinaroli","Hi, Rich.","Kathryn Campbell","Good morning, Rich.","Richard Kwas","Just wanted to ask Alex on Brexit here. I know it\u2019s kind of early days still, but are you seeing any impact on quoting activity, particularly as it relates to BE?","Alex Molinaroli","You know what, well first off when we put in context, our revenues in the UK are pretty small, I think it\u2019s 3%. So we started from a small place. We do have reports that not necessarily quoting activities, but things are just a little slow right now, because people are \u2013 some products that are into queue have slowed down, probably people are just trying to figure out where things are. So I think that people are at kind of the wait and see mode, so we do see some indications of slowdown, but I don\u2019t know that we\u2019d be the bellwether for the UK.","Richard Kwas","And then how about broader Europe? Anything where there is any early signs of any contagion or\u2026? ","Alex Molinaroli","No we don\u2019t see it across Europe. We do see a little bit in the UK. In fact you look at our European business, it\u2019s not doing badly, it\u2019s actually seeing some growth, because we have developed in the rest of the world where we see some deterioration it\u2019s actually in the Middle East where we are more petroleum energy dependent.","Richard Kwas","Okay, and then on North America, on the product number, which I think is new, I hadn\u2019t seen that disclosed previously in terms of your orders. So that was up eight, so that suggests there is pretty good activity on the institutional side. Is that a fair assessment of what you are seeing right now based on that number?","Alex Molinaroli","Well, the way I would think about it when our products business is probably more skewed towards the light commercial, and our branches are more skewed to institutional, because of the channel, I am sorry.","Richard Kwas","Okay, all right and then, so just, and then lastly on to the clarification on the mid-teens number for residential, is that residential and light commercial combined or just residential in terms of the orders of the revenues? ","Alex Molinaroli","That\u2019s both, that\u2019s combined. ","Richard Kwas","Okay, combined.","Alex Molinaroli","That\u2019s the old EPG.","Richard Kwas","Right, okay, thanks.","Kathryn Campbell","Thanks, Rich. ","Alex Molinaroli","Operator? ","Kathryn Campbell","Dale, you are still there?","Operator ","Yes, can you hear me now?","Kathryn Campbell","Yes, is there another question?","Operator ","I do apologize. Our next question comes from Emmanuel Rosner from CLSA. Your line is now open. ","Emmanuel Rosner","Hi good morning everybody.","Alex Molinaroli","Good morning.","Kathryn Campbell","Good morning Emmanuel.","Emmanuel Rosner","Just a couple of questions on the auto side. First on the margin performance in the quarter. You mentioned a few factors that sort of like may have sort of been keeping a lid on margin expansion there. Can you please just go back over, some of these factors were what\u2019s happening in Seating and Interiors? And then how should we think about that the margin expansion enough for the near future and in particular in the context of your ability to expend that by couple hundred basis points?","Alex Molinaroli","Maybe share buyback.","Robert Bruce McDonald","Maybe, I\u2019ll talk to what I think is going to drive the improvement in the future and then maybe Brian can just read, he went through a number of things, so maybe he can touch on those. But, from a go forward perspective, what we are seeing, we are looking for a couple hundred basis points of margin expansion. It really falls into a few big buckets. First of all, is us have any \u2013 I\u2019d say a leaner corporate SG&A structure then we have as part of Johnson Controls it would be a single industry company and we \u2013 that will and smaller and I think that will offer us some attrition. So these I think as we look at the cost associated with standing up the company to be a public entity that\u2019s a big driver. Secondly is, we are on an upward trajectory in terms of our business performance right now, really and things there you would sort of see is some improvement on metals business on a go forward basis, that\u2019s probably the single biggest bucket there and then, I guess the other thing I would point to from a margin expansion would be the growth of our equity income which flows through as our Chinese businesses grow. So those are the three main areas Emmanuel where the 200 basis points come from.","Brian Stief","And I think if you look at the segment income in the quarter, seating results were very strong and I think it continues to reflect some of the cost initiatives as well as some of the JCOS benefits that they are seeing is, it was really offset in the quarter by softness in Interiors and those would really come in three areas. As you may know in connection with the formation of the Interiors joint venture a year ago, certain plants, the unprofitable plants were retained by Johnson Controls and we\u2019re essentially winding those down as we move through about mid fiscal 2017 and so those losses have been a bit heavier than we expected, that would be one. The second item which is kind of a good news, thanks the new business that\u2019s being won by the Chinese joint venture is significant and they are incurring some front-end launch cost associated with that business. So, again that was a bit of a way down in the quarter on their results. And then lastly just the currency in China has given us some headwinds as well. So, those will be the three big buckets I guess that would explain the Interiors. ","Emmanuel Rosner","Great, that\u2019s and just a real quick follow-up on the business wins in the autos business, obviously a very strong acceleration there. Can you provide any color either by product like Seating versus Interiors or geographically where you sort of like seeing the most traction with the new Adient proposition? ","Robert Bruce McDonald","Yes, well, first of all, that the number that we quoted, just Seating. So, when we are talking about new business wins on a year-to-date basis, just the Seating side, okay. And then, if I was \u2013 we\u2019ve historically, if you sort of go over last couple years most of our new business has been in China and that continues to be the case, so, well I would say our backlog is building on the consolidated side of our business in North America and Europe. So, I think in the last couple of years and we talked through our backlog it\u2019s almost all the growth has been in non-consolidated operations, what you sort of see when we probably touched on this a bit more in our Analyst Day here in September, you\u2019ll see, we do have some consolidated new business opportunities that are coming through. So that\u2019s good because it will help us turn our top-line performance around here. ","Emmanuel Rosner","Great, thank you so much.","Robert Bruce McDonald","Thanks, Emmanuel. ","Kathryn Campbell","Thank you.","Operator ","Thank you. Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. ","Julian Mitchell ","Hi, thank you. ","Alex Molinaroli","Good morning.","Kathryn Campbell","Good morning. ","Julian Mitchell ","Good morning. Just on Power Solutions, the aftermarket shipment growth was lower in the quarter that we\u2019ve seen for a while. Just wondered if there was any background you could give on that and if you see that picking off now in the fourth fiscal quarter?","Brian Stief","Yes, so, I sort of take that, I think that, it\u2019s really a function of the market itself, I mean, as you know, it\u2019s a very mature market and with our size, our size in North America and the Western Europe is one where it\u2019s very hard for the growth we have in China at this point to move the needle. So that\u2019s one of the reasons why that the growth would not be at some of the same rate, particularly you see is around the technology changes. We had a lot finished here. We\u2019ve maintained our customers and the mature markets and we are gaining share in China. I think if you look at the fourth quarter, we\u2019ve got, we are going to see some growth in the fourth quarter. What we don\u2019t know is, how it will compare to last year, because what we need to make sure is our customers are starting to stock up for the winter to make sure that we are able to \u2013 they are able to serve their customers. So the market itself is one that we were kind of reporting because we are such a big part of the market, we are really reporting the market growth. ","Julian Mitchell ","Thanks and then, just my second question is if the free cash flow guidance is still around sort of $1.5 billion for the year, and a quick follow-up would be any color at all you can give on expected sort of Tyco financial impact in the fourth quarter?","Brian Stief","I am sorry, the Tyco financial impact in the month of September?","Julian Mitchell ","Correct. Maybe you can\u2019t talk until the actual earnings, but if there was any context you could give and then on the free cash flow guide, is that still $1.5 billion? ","Brian Stief","Yes, I mean, the $1.5 billion is still our plan. I guess, if you take where we are free cash flow-wise through three quarters that we provided in the appendix we may be short a bit of free cash flow Q4 this year versus Q4 last year and that would really be related to three items. There is a couple $100 million of additional CapEx in Q4 this year versus Q4 last year. In addition, there was a dividend that we received in the third quarter of this year from a Chinese joint venture partner in the Auto business that last year was received in the fourth quarter and then there is probably about $50 million to $100 million more in cash restructuring cost that we are going to have in our fourth fiscal quarter this year. So that\u2019s \u2013 that probably is $300 million to $400 million less than last year\u2019s Q4 number, but with that, we still end up being on or above that $1.5 billion number that we guided to in December. So we still feel pretty comfortable with that. As far as Tyco\u2019s impact, I really don\u2019t have visibility to that right now and we\u2019ll certainly lay it out for you on the year end call. ","Julian Mitchell ","Thank you. ","Kathryn Campbell","Thanks, Julian. ","Operator ","Thank you. Our next question comes from Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open sir.","Nigel Coe ","Thanks, good morning.","Alex Molinaroli","Good morning.","Kathryn Campbell","Good morning, Nigel. ","Nigel Coe ","Hi, so just circling back on the aftermarket, the plus 1%, I am wondering did the cooler weather in both North America and Europe, do you think that has an influence or maybe dampened down the market a little bit?","Alex Molinaroli","Well, it always does, Nigel. I mean, there is two things that influenced the market, one is, we are at - what position our customers are in as it relates to their own inventory and then whatever is weather-related. So I could say that\u2019s probably the case, but if you look at the overall growth of the aftermarket in both the US and Western Europe, you are really talking about a 1% to 2% growth over a long period of time, that\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s kind of what you can expect. And so it can be a little choppy, but you are really going to be sticking around that 1% to 2%.","Nigel Coe ","Okay, that\u2019s very fair. And then you called out China as an area of strength in Building Efficiency, probably not a huge surprise, but it\u2019s obviously a big debate about durability of that strength. So I am just wondering if you can maybe add some context about what you are seeing in some of the quoting activity and the general health of that market.","Alex Molinaroli","So the quoting activity is strong. We are seeing \u2013 a year ago, I didn\u2019t want to say that we felt that we were pessimist about the market. We felt like that was the place to stay there over a period of time that would \u2013 it would sort of felt up and I wouldn\u2019t declare a victory today, but I would tell you that we are seeing quoting activity be strong, we are certainly getting an awful lot both on our VRF sales not only in the joint venture, but outside of the joint venture and then we are seeing some fairly significant size orders in the core of our large tonnage business. We are also making investments in tier-3 and tier-4 cities where we are getting \u2013 we are gaining share and moving into markets that we have previously served us well. So I think the market seem, how durable it is, but it seems less choppy than it was and I think our folks feel more optimistic each and every quarter, we\u2019ve had a couple of quarters here where we could feel like things are getting stronger. ","Nigel Coe ","Great and then a quick one for Brian. On Slide 18, you call out pension OPEB mark-to-market.","Brian Stief","Yes.","Nigel Coe ","I don\u2019t know if I missed the comments in the prepared remarks, but what does that relate to?","Brian Stief","What is it referring or what do you think? Are you asking\u2026","Nigel Coe ","No, no, it\u2019s a bullet point, so I am just wondering if anything to say about that.","Brian Stief","Well, we have adopted mark-to-mark accounting. So, in the fourth quarter of each year we will have either a charge or a benefit to record based upon investment experience, actual investment experience versus expected in our assumptions and then also there is a movement in interest rates that gets taken into consideration in the valuation of the obligation at each year end. So, as it relates to that adjustment, we are working through the magnitude of that right now, but with the rates being down, I think we are assuming there is going to be a mark-to-market charge. We don\u2019t have that framed yet as to size.","Nigel Coe ","Okay, on the low discount rate, it doesn\u2019t cause any cash confusions next year?","Brian Stief","It does not.","Nigel Coe ","Great, thank you very much.","Kathryn Campbell","Thanks, Nigel. I\u2019d like to turn it back over to Alex for some closing comments.","Alex Molinaroli","So, I just want to once again thank our employees for everything that have been accomplished. Brian touched on it. It\u2019s absolutely amazing to see what\u2019s been accomplished. ","Probably the biggest accomplishment of this particular quarter, for me is to be able to see the Adient spin and we really are running as two separate companies inside Johnson Controls today and we are going to be well positioned and feel really comfortable that we are going to be in a place where in October of 31st that we are going to be confident that we will be able to turn this thing over officially. ","And then as it relates to the quarter coming up the one that we are in, obviously we\u2019ve got the anticipated merger with Tyco and the activities going on with Tyco and George Oliver and his team, I can\u2019t say anything, but good things about what I\u2019ve seen, the people at Tyco and the opportunity in front of us. ","So I think that, I feel great about what we\u2019ve been able to accomplish and I feel even better about the future. So I appreciate the questions and I am sure there might be some follow-ups. Thank you, operator. ","Operator","Thank you. That concludes today's conference. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect at this time."],"12529":["Johnson Controls, Inc.

Ponczak - Vice President-Global Investor Relations","Thanks, operator and welcome, everybody, to the review of Johnson Controls First Quarter 2015 Earnings. If you didn't already receive it, the slide presentation can be accessed at the Investors section at johnsoncontrols.com. This morning, Chairman and CEO, Alex Molinaroli, will provide some perspective on the quarter as well as some updates; and he'll be followed by Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Brian Stief, who will review the results of the individual businesses as well as the company's overall financial performance. Following those prepared remarks, we'll open up the call for questions, and we're scheduled to end at the top of the hour.","Before we begin, just want to remind you that today's conference will include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause the actual results to be materially different from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. These factors that could cause results to differ are discussed in the cautionary statement included in today's news release and the presentation document. We also remind you to review the extended disclosures related to the proposed transaction with Tyco, which can also be found in the earnings document today.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Alex.","Alex A. Molinaroli - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Great. Thank you, Glen. I first want to acknowledge that this is probably the first time in years that Bruce McDonald hasn't been on the agenda, but just for everyone's sake, he's here, so when we get to the Q&A, we'll make sure that Bruce gets an opportunity to keep his string alive.","What I'd like to do before we get started is just remind everyone, it's been a while since we had an opportunity to talk, and I wanted to remind everyone that in December when we had our Analyst Day there's some themes that I want to hit on. We talked about execution, and over the last couple years, I continue to be completely satisfied with our teams' ability to stay focused, particularly as we transform our portfolio. Our teams within the business units have been focused on reinvesting in growth, but most importantly, being able to improve margins and continue to meet our commitments.","As we talked in December, we've made a lot of progress around our operational excellence, our Johnson Controls Operating System, and it continues to bring and yield results for us as a company within our business units. And I think after the Auto spin, we talked a lot about that, and Bruce had an opportunity to meet with a bunch of you in January in Detroit about the Automotive business, about Adient, and we'll be well-positioned along with the Automotive business to be two great companies after the end of this fiscal year, and I'm pretty excited about that.","And then as it relates to the path of the remaining Johnson Controls, I think that particularly as we talk about our announcement earlier this week and the portfolio changes that we made up to this point and how we've invested within our businesses, I think we're really on a path to achieve our multi-industrial status and make sure that we are in a position to reinvest in the business and continue to increase shareholder value.","So with that, I'll start on slide seven. I won't spend a lot of time on this, but I just want to break a few things down for you to make sure that you understand that from an organic standpoint, although we're not exactly where we want to be, I am seeing some momentum in the business. If you sort out some of the numbers, you see that our FX has impacted us negatively along with a drop in lead prices within our Power Solutions business, and Brian will talk about that when he gets into each one of the businesses.","Also, you have to take Hitachi and you have to make sure that you know that we now have that consolidated within our quarter and it's over $0.5 billion of increased revenue, but then you have to take the deconsolidation of the Interiors joint venture out, and it's over $1 billion.","So if you look inside our businesses, what you see is Automotive business really exceeded our expectation around production levels across the board, and that would include China, by the way. And then BE is up organically 1%, and that excludes Hitachi and FX, and we have higher revenues, particularly in North America and the Middle East. And we'll talk later about North America, but we're seeing some real momentum in that business that we saw earlier, and I think last quarter, we had a little bit of a hiccup because some of the federal government work, but the secured sales continues to come, and our top line I think is in a position to continue to grow. And then Power Solution, if you take out the unit volume and you just take out lead and FX, we had a 3% growth, and I'm particularly happy with some of the sales increase we have in China.","Once again, we continue to see margin expansion in the business at 130 basis points across the board. In Auto, we had record performance. We've never seen this kind of performance before in our first quarter, and we continue to see improvements within that business, and so we're setting that up for success. And then Power Solutions, again, with margins that are almost 20%. A little bit benefit from the low \u2013 the pressed lead position, but still we're seeing margin improvements within the business. And now we're seeing BE with the reinvestments into that business with a real position to \u2013 in a real position to grow.","If you go to slide eight, let's talk about a couple of things here that I think are pretty important. You know that I'm pretty proud of how our team is accomplishing, and as I said earlier, and with the segmented income margins up 130 basis points and EPS 11% versus last year, even with a little softness in the top line versus where we wanted it to be, we've got a lot of headwinds in the business that are outside of our control, we continue to deliver on the bottom line despite that.","And of course, as I said earlier, operational excellence across all of our functions continues to improve. And I would say that it includes everything from our procurement, our manufacturing operations, our supply chain and the productivity we're getting out of our sales force. We have a challenging macroeconomic environment, but we are gaining some momentum.","If you look at our SSNA, our North American branch business, we saw orders grow in Q1 and we see the pipeline are up. If you look within North America and you just go to North America, you can see that orders are up 13%. Our chiller market share is up 170 basis points. Our hit rate is up; this is historical highs. And then within Q2, we see the pipeline continuing to grow. And so the institutional market focus that we have I think is starting to pay off. It's been a long time coming, but hopefully we'll continue to see that happen. And so we expect to see revenue growth and the pipeline continue to increase.","Actually, in Asia, orders were up significantly in the quarter. Now in the context of things that we saw three quarters of orders being down prior to that, so we were happy to see Asia orders being up. And if you look at Hitachi, we're pretty happy with where we were. Now it exceeded our plan, we've got a long way to go with Hitachi and the integration, but the integration is going well. And as it relates to what our plans were for Hitachi, we had more profitability and better operational performance than what we planned, so off to a good start there.","Power Solutions, great quarter; some real milestones, I was reflecting on Power Solutions and some of the growth. We're going to be adding some more capacity as we speak. Within 2017, we'll have another 6.5 million of units in a new plant in Power Solutions in China. And we hit a record of 1 million units of batteries shipped in China during December, and a little bit less than 3 million units for the quarter, and I was reflecting on that, because you know over the past few years, when I was at Power Solutions when we had our problem with the Shanghai plant, that plant was a 3 million unit plant. And so as we've moved through the past few years, we're now selling in one quarter of total capacity what we had when we first entered China with our Shanghai plant. And then AGM growth continues to be something that's accelerating. Our biggest challenge here is keeping up with capacity. We had a 41% growth in AGM, so the mix is working in our favor.","You go to slide nine, we'll talk about the Auto separation, the Adient spin-off here in a few minutes, and then as you all know, we introduced the fact that we will merge with Tyco earlier this week. And I'm incredibly excited about what I've seen so far, the reaction by our customers, by our employees and by the folks that follow us, our investors. I do think it's going to be a win-win for both companies, certainly for our customers and our shareholders. And so I look forward to working with our partners at Tyco over the next few months as we work toward close. And I think that it's just going to be more exciting times to come for both companies.","Back in December, I think there was a little bit of a disappointment. We talked about the fact that we were just a little unsure of ourselves as it relates to our share repurchase program and we wanted to pause that while we really understood what the costs and the cash flows were going to be associated with the Automotive spin. And I got a lot of feedback there at the meeting that there was a little bit of a surprise. I think it was the right thing to do, but we now understand how this is all going to come together, and so we're going to reinstate our repurchase program in the second half of this year. I think the stock price is at a place where it's a really good buy, and so we're going to \u2013 we plan to repurchase 0.5 million shares by the end of the fiscal year in the second half of the year. So I'm happy to report that.","Go to slide 10, you know that Bruce announced earlier this month, and I found out just right before you did the name of the new company, Adient, and it's a real exciting step forward. A lot of things that are on this slide are consistent with what you saw if you were \u2013 if you either had the presentation or you were at the presentation that Bruce gave in Detroit, but there's only one real significant difference is that since that time, we've actually received another piece of business, a Hyundai Kia replacement business and a VW metals program, and so that moves from the $650 million of replacement business to $750 million. And of course we already had talked about $850 million of new business that we've seen in the business essentially since we made the announcement. So the team is working hard around separation. We're not seeing any hiccups in the business itself. And in fact, we're seeing momentum. The team is really excited about their future.","You'll get some more information. The Form 10 should be out late March, early April, and then when that comes out, I think you'll get some of the details that you're probably looking for as we work toward getting that complete. I don't want to jump ahead of ourselves. And so I think when that comes, I think a lot of the questions that you might have and some of the things we're still working through will be answered.","And then I think that as we talk about our capital structure, Bruce talked about that, and nothing has really changed as it relates to how we're thinking about the capital structure for Adient.","On slide 11, I'm not going to spend a lot of time on this. This should look familiar; the Tyco and Johnson Controls merger, if you look at the key points on this particular slide, I just want to talk about a couple of things and make sure that it's absolutely clear, and we've gotten a lot of feedback over the last week.","We see $650 million of synergies including operational and the tax synergies that we're going to get from the deal. That's something that we've taken to the bank and we feel very comfortable that we'll be able to achieve. What we don't have in that is any revenue synergies. One of the things that you can expect from us over the next few months as we fully understand how that is going to come together and how we're going to integrate specifically, you can expect for us to update these numbers to include revenue synergies and the timing for that.","So that's \u2013 we've positioned that as all upside to make sure that we didn't set some expectations that we couldn't meet. But I can tell you internally, our teams are incredibly excited about this opportunity, and I spoke with George Oliver, and his team is too.","Post-merger, prior to any of the synergies, we're talking about a company with $4.5 billion of EBITDA, so I think the financial flexibility we'll have as a combined company certainly will be much enhanced from what we have today and what RemainCo would have had without the merger.","If you go to slide 12, we've gotten a lot of feedback over the last week, and so we tried to put a slide together that I think is going to be very helpful. There's been a lot of feedback that we've gotten to make sure that people can understand because we are merging and then spinning, what is the value to the JCI shareholder and what are the mechanics and what's included what's not included.","And so I think this slide certainly goes through some of the questions that we've gotten in particular. I'm not going to go through the entire slide because I think most of this stuff is something that we've talked about and that you've been able to understand. I think that the share repurchase helps you understand how we get from the current 650 million shares outstanding to the future combined company of 940 million shares outstanding after the repurchase program. So if you go back into the appendix, there is a slide that I think can help you get from the 650 million to the 940 million of shares, and that might close some gaps for some of the folks that are on the phone that were trying to understand some of the metrics around this deal.","The $10.5 billion net debt is an important number, and if you look at what our \u2013 you look at our net debt-to-EBITDA is we'll be in a strong position, as I said earlier, to be able to have some flexibility moving forward.","So with that, I think that as we move forward, we look forward to your feedback to make sure that we're as transparent as we can and make sure that you can \u2013 it helps you put together your models. I do know that it's a little bit of a challenge with a couple of the moving parts that we have here.","With that, I'm going to turn it over to Brian and let him go through the businesses.","Brian J. Stief - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Okay. Thanks, Alex, and good morning, everyone. Before we move into page 13, just a couple housekeeping things. As you saw in the press release, our Q1 results from continuing operations are adjusted for the $87 million in separation cost, primarily related to the Adient spinoff that we incurred in the quarter. And as I talk through the business unit results and the financials, I'm going to exclude the $87 million in costs from my comments consistent with what we guided to previously to exclude those type of costs. And I'll also comment on just continuing operations as we go through the slides here.","As you know, the formation of the Automotive Interiors joint venture in July 2015 and the closing of our Hitachi joint venture in October 2015, does impact the comparability of the quarter-to-quarter results, and so I will also refer to that as I go through the commentary here.","And then lastly, we did file Form 8-K today, and that Form 8-K will break out for you the fiscal 2015 results with our new reportable segments for BE. It will give you annual fiscal 2014 results as well. And then as we move through 2016, you'll have the comparable quarter amounts for the four new business segments of BE. And those four new business segments are Systems and Services North America, Products North America, Asia, and Rest of World, and we have outlined kind of the mapping as to our old segments to the new segments in an appendix to the slide deck.","So with that, let's go through slide 13 on Building Efficiency. Their sales in the quarter were $3 billion, which were up 18% from the prior year. If you adjust for Hitachi and FX, sales grew by 1%. Revenues in our Systems and Services North American business were up 4% year-over-year, and as Alex mentioned, we continue to see good momentum in the North American branch business. And the Middle East was up 31% quarter-over-quarter, and that was due primarily to several large jobs that closed here in the first quarter. However, Asia, excluding Hitachi, was down 3%, Europe was down 4%, and Latin America was down 31%, although the 31% is off a pretty small number.","Orders secured in the quarter, excluding Hitachi and FX, were up 5%. We're very pleased with the share gains we saw in the North American region where orders increased 8%. As Alex mentioned, Asian orders were also strong in the quarter, up 10%, and we did see a bit of softness in the Rest of the World.","Backlog is consistent at $4.5 billion, and we continue to see strength in the Systems and Services North American business, as far as the new business opportunities pipeline for the next six months, which is up 7%.","If you look at segment income, year-over-year, up 10%. Ex-Hitachi and FX, it's up 2%, primarily due to the higher North American volumes. And as expected, with the Hitachi consolidation, our margins were down to 6.1% versus 6.6% in the prior year. But if you adjust out for the negative impact of Hitachi, we're flat year-over-year.","And we'll comment that for the remainder of the year, we still are confident that the margins will be in line with the guidance that we provided in December, which is a 30 basis point improvement. So overall, a very solid Q1 for Building Efficiency.","If we turn to slide 14, Power Solutions, their sales were down 6% compared to last year. But again, if you adjust for FX and the impact of lower lead prices, their sales were actually up 3%. And just to kind of put a little bit of color around the lead prices, the average price in Q1 of this year was $1,681 as compared to $1,999 in the first quarter last year, and that reduced price of lead finds its way through our top line.","In terms of units, overall first quarter shipments were up 3%, with growth in all regions. Americas up 1%, Europe up 8%, and Asia was up 7%. And as Alex mentioned, we had a record 1 million units shipped in China in the month of December.","We continue to see very strong AGM growth, with quite honestly demand outpacing our current capacity, and year-over-year volumes are up 41% to 3.2 million units. And we saw strong global volumes with the OEs up 4% and aftermarket up 3%.","Segment income in the quarter was $342 million versus $315 million last year, an increase of 7%, primarily the result of the higher volumes, improved product mix and productivity improvements. The segment margin improvement was 260 basis points, but you really have to look at that exclusive of the impact of lead, and ex-lead, it was still up a solid 70 basis points in the quarter. So again, Power Solutions just continued to deliver strong quarters for us.","So turning to the Automotive business, their sales were down 20% compared to last year, but as Alex mentioned, you've got to factor in the deconsolidation of the Interiors business with the joint venture that was formed in July of last year and FX. And if you consider those two items, sales were actually up 4% on across-the-board strong global production.","China sales, which are primarily unconsolidated, as you know, improved 58% in the quarter to $3.3 billion, but that's inclusive of the Interiors joint venture. If you strip that out, China sales were up 11%. So again, very strong performance.","For the quarter, segment income of $266 million was up 15% year-over-year, and Auto margins of 6.3% were up 180 basis points. Again, we get the benefit of the Interiors equity income being picked up with the sales not in the denominator, so if you adjust for that, the Automotive business still showed a 70 basis point improvement in the quarter versus last year. So Automotive simply continues to deliver excellent results for us.","So if I take you to page \u2013 slide 16, overall first quarter revenues were down 7% to $8.9 billion. As Alex mentioned, you really kind of need to unpack that in three pieces. There's just short of $1 billion in Interiors revenue that we lost, and then we had headwinds with about $0.5 billion of foreign exchange, and then additive to that would be the Hitachi revenues of north of $500 million. So if you look at it that way and exclude those items, you end up that sales were actually up 2% on a consolidated basis and up across all three of our businesses.","Gross margin for the quarter was 18.3%, up 160 basis points, and I think that's really reflective of the benefits we're continuing to see from the Johnson Controls Operating System.","SG&A was level with last year. Really the way to look at that is the increases that came from the Hitachi JV were substantially offset by the deconsolidation of Interiors and ongoing cost savings and restructuring initiatives that we have across our business.","Equity income was up strong, 37%, to $140 million, and that's really attributable to two pieces; the Interiors JV, which contributed about $20 million in the quarter, and then there were several JVs that came with the Hitachi business and they contributed between $15 million and $18 million as well. So that really is the entire gap there.","So, overall, first quarter segment margins of 8.8% were up 130 bps versus 2015, and 80 basis points excluding the impacts of Hitachi and Interiors, so very strong performance as it relates to our segment margins.","On slide 17, net financing charges were pretty level with last year. We did have a slight increase in our effective tax rate from 18.4% to 19%. And there were a few joint ventures that came with the Hitachi transaction that added about $10 million to the minority interest line in the current quarter.","So, overall, we're very pleased with strong first quarter results and diluted EPS of $0.82, which is up 11% from last year. And I would just echo what Alex said, we're pretty proud of the management teams that are able to deliver these type of results quarter-to-quarter with all of the portfolio transformation that's really going across the company and could be potential distractions for us. But it simply hasn't been and we continue to deliver strong results.","So, quickly, I'd like to hit the highlights in the balance sheet. At quarter end, we've got a net debt to cap of 39.1% versus the prior quarter of 40.5% and year-end at 36.7%. And our net debt of $6.7 billion is up from $6 billion at 9\/30\/15. And if you look at those ratios and the net debt position, it's really a function of the Hitachi investment we made in Q1.","Capital spending at $300 million is in line with expectations and relates primarily as we've talked in the past about Power Solutions' growth investments. And then cash flow we made some good progress in the quarter. It's normally a cash outflow quarter for us, as you know. It was $300 million in the quarter, which was $100 million better than last year and we had $100 million of separation costs \u2013 roughly $100 million in the quarter as well, so stronger free cash flow performance this quarter than planned.","So let's turn to guidance on slide 19. For the second quarter, we expect earnings per share of $0.80 to $0.83, which would be up 10% to 14% from the prior year level of $0.73. And then consistent with our prior guidance, this will exclude the transaction and separation costs in the second quarter, and I note that again simply because we expect those costs to ramp up in the second quarter as we move toward a July 1 operational separation date with full legal separation in early October.","The other thing we've done on page 19 is kind of lay out for you a chart that shows what our December analyst guidance was for sales growth by business and then our sink margin targets by business for fiscal 2016, and I would highlight a couple of things.","As it relates to BE, we are seeing revenue softness in that business primarily in three areas; China, where it seems to be taking a bit longer to number one, secure orders, and then number two, to get the orders executed from a revenue recognition standpoint. So, that's causing a bit of softness for us as we look through the rest of the year. The Middle East, although strong in the first quarter, it looks like with oil prices where they are that there could be some softness in the back half of the year. And then the third area that I'd just point to is there were three or four federal jobs, one in particular, that we thought at the end of the year fiscal 2015 that we were going to secure in early 2016, and for a variety of reasons, those jobs have not been secured yet. And if they aren't secured, that'll provide a bit of downward pressure on our previously provided guidance as well. So, some softness we see in BE as it relates to the 9% to 11%.","In Power Solutions, although unit volumes remain strong, the decrease in lead prices that Alex and I have talked about, as well as the FX impact in the year, could put a little pressure on the 9% to 11% at Power Solutions.","Auto, on the other hand, continues to be very strong, and we would expect them to exceed the revenue guidance that we provided. As far as margins, despite the top line pressures that we see at BE and Power Solutions, we continue to be committed to that margin improvement as well as delivering on the $3.70 to $3.90 per share annual target that we provided in December, and that would be 8% to 14% improvement from the $3.42 that we delivered in fiscal 2015.","So with that, Glen, we can open it up for questions.","Glen L. Ponczak - Vice President-Global Investor Relations","Thanks, Brian. Thanks, Alex. Operator, we're ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from the line of Mr. Robert Barry with Susquehanna. Sir, your line is now open.","Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Hey, guys. Good morning.","Alex A. Molinaroli - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Rob.","Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Wanted to follow up on the comments on commercial HVAC in Asia, both China and elsewhere. It looks like orders were actually pretty good in the quarter, but you also cautioned that China weakness is kind of weighing on the outlook. So, could you maybe unpack a little more of kind of what you're seeing in commercial HVAC in Asia, China and elsewhere?","Alex A. Molinaroli - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, so I think that \u2013 and you're right, I caution because you look across our businesses and just because you asked the question, I'll go ahead and answer it, but I'll also point out that we're really surprised with the strength in Auto and Power Solutions continue to gain share and grow dramatically there in China. But when we look at the Buildings business, there does seem to be some delays and some stickiness, and it's been pretty lumpy. If you remember, we had a couple of quarters where we were down. We had a real strong quarter, I think it was fourth quarter sales secured, and so it's pretty lumpy.","And I think from our standpoint, it's probably just best for us to be cautious, and that's why when we talked about our guidance, we report on the top line. It's just become pretty hard to predict as it relates to the commercial business. I would tell you, though, that one of the real surprises we had, I was looking at the Hitachi sales and our VRF sales through Hisense, our \u2013 it's an unconsolidated joint venture in China, were up dramatically versus our plan. So I think it's more of a mix issue, and I think at the high-end infrastructure level some of the commercial projects we're doing moving a little slower than we thought. But our VRF sales are higher than what we expected. So, I think we're just going to have to continue to watch it. Thank goodness that North American market just seems to be kind of chugging along and gaining a little momentum.","You didn't ask the question, but I looked inside our secured for North America, and it's truly institutional. If you look at within the institutional and also commercial, which we're seeing some benefit from the CB Richard Ellis relationship, within commercial and institutional, we're seeing that outpace some of the losses that we're seeing within the, essentially the manufacturing and retail segment.","Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Got you. Got you. Just sticking with BE on the margin side, you talked about seeing improvements in the remaining quarters after some pressure in 1Q. Is that just about investment spending moderating, or what's driving that?","Alex A. Molinaroli - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So as you look \u2013 and I'll let \u2013 get Brian get into some of the details, but if you look at the margins and you get into the new segments, you'll see that our product margins are under pressure, and that's where the investments are showing up. I think what our expectation is that we had some costs that won't repeat, but we certainly have reinvested in that business purposely, and you're going to see that pressure. It'll get offset, but you'll see that pressure is going to continue to be a little bit on the product side because that's where the investments show up.","Brian J. Stief - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, Rob, I would just add to that. I mean, if you recall, in Q4 we took a pretty good size restructuring charge in BE. And if we look at the timing of those actions, some of those are occurring during the first quarter and we'll just get full run rate benefit for the year in the back half. So there's some improvement in margins just as a result of the timing of some of the restructuring actions we had.","Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Got you. And then just one last one for me. The resumption of the share repurchase, does that add to the EPS target for this year versus what was factored in at the Analyst Day? Thank you.","Brian J. Stief - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, at Analyst Day we had an average share outstanding of 652 million, and at that time, we indicated we were going to pause it for six months and then reevaluate. We had built into the guidance that we had given that repurchase program coming in for the entire $1 billion in the back six months of the year, and now we're doing $500 million, but instead of doing $1 billion at $50 a share, which was what we had built into our plan, we're doing $500 million at $35 a share let's say, just to pick a stock price. And the net effect of that is about a penny or so in the guidance that we gave, Rob.","Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Got you. It benefits it by a penny.","Brian J. Stief - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Actually, it's the other way, right, because we had $1 billion in shares at $50 in what we guided, and it's going to be $535 million. So I think the net effect of that's a penny going the other way.","Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Got you. Great. Thank you.","Brian J. Stief - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah.","Alex A. Molinaroli - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Rob.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Jonny Wright with Nomura. Sir, your line is now open.","Jonathan David Wright - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Hi, guys. Good morning.","Alex A. Molinaroli - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hi.","Brian J. Stief - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning.","Alex A. Molinaroli - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Jonathan David Wright - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","So just going to the Auto side maybe, I mean you guys are actually putting up some strong results despite certainly from some of the investors we've talked who seem more and more concerned about the Auto cycle. I know China's benefiting a little bit from the incentives that have been put in place there. But maybe you can talk about in developed markets what you're seeing, what you're hearing from companies and kind of your outlook for the remainder of 2016?","Robert Bruce McDonald - Vice Chairman & Executive Vice President","Yeah, it's Bruce McDonald here. Yeah, I think if I just sort of run through it regionally, you're right. The incentives that we've put \u2013 that got put in place in China that last till the end of the fiscal year have been pretty effective. If just look at the production throughout our quarter, and it accelerated and it continues to be pretty strong. I think there are some questions whether or not after the Chinese New Year's here in early February whether that strength is going to continue. But for now, the production schedules that we have for China look pretty good, and I think people are feeling fairly optimistic and probably much more optimistic than people looking outside into China are feeling.","The Auto sector is doing well and the stock market impact in terms of the how widespread that is, is much lower than people think. So I feel pretty good about the outlook for China for the balance of the year, probably more so than most people.","In Europe, I would say, after a long period of soft volumes, we're seeing sort of double-digit increases in some of the more mature markets like, Spain, France, Italy, the UK, and Germany. Those are holding up pretty well. Our customers are doing better there. A lot of us have taken big restructurings in Europe and so I think we are positioned well, and you'll have seen that in our margins, we're positioned well to benefit from the better volumes.","I'd also point out that in Europe, it's primarily where all the luxury vehicles are made for Audi, BMW, Mercedes and the demand globally for the luxury is strong and that's helping us particularly in our Interiors business and seats because there's a lot more content there. And then in North America, things are looking pretty good. We're, I would say, doing better than the industry because of the enhanced content in larger SUVs and pickup trucks, which as you know are sort of hard to keep in stock here right now. So, I don't think there's a lot of extra growth in the tank for North America this year, but we are seeing a richer mix on larger vehicles and that will be a good thing for Johnson Controls.","Jonathan David Wright - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Great. Thanks for that, Bruce. And on Power Solutions, 3% growth excluding FX and the lead impact, I think you guys are looking at close to double digits. But some of the key drivers in that business, you have the China record order \u2013 record shipments in the month, the AGM up 41% \u2013 look pretty robust. Maybe what's different there versus your prior expectation and kind of how do you see that playing for the rest of the year?","Alex A. Molinaroli - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, well, the numbers are so big when you get to Europe and North America. When you start talking about AGM growth at 41% and China being record sales, it doesn't \u2013 we can't get to the 9% to 10% without both mix and growth within primarily North America, I mean that's really where we need to see it. And so I think that, I mean, I think we feel good about where things are, but it's a little bit out of our control. Particularly when you start talking about the aftermarket and what the weather's going to be and what the timing of that is going to be, but that's what moves the needle when you look at North America. So I think we feel like we're in good position. A lot of it has to do with what our customers are seeing. We're not in a position we're going to gain any more share in North America and so what we really need to see is some \u2013 we need to see the weather help us out here little bit so...","Jonathan David Wright - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Okay, guys. Just, Brian, reported free cash flow this year is $1 billion still the target?","Brian J. Stief - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes. Yeah, the guidance hasn't changed.","Jonathan David Wright - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Okay. Thanks guys","Brian J. Stief - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you.","Alex A. Molinaroli - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Jonny.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse. Sir, your line is now open.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi. Good morning. Thank you.","Alex A. Molinaroli - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Brian J. Stief - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Just first a question on pricing within building efficiency. I guess firstly around \u2013 you talked about some of the private sector commercial activity maybe being a bit uneven. Have you seen any change in the ability of HVAC manufacturers to price? And then also on your margins what sort of affect do you see for price net of cost this year in BE?","Alex A. Molinaroli - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","You're talking about based on commodities?","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Yeah and your pricing net of commodity costs, yes.","Alex A. Molinaroli - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes. So I actually don't have that in front of me, so I will have to get back with you and make sure I understand our net hedge position, primarily around copper. We certainly are seeing some help as it relates to our transportation costs, but I don't have an update on that. So we'll follow up on that specifically just so I don't misrepresent it. As it relates to pricing, I was talking to Bill Jackson, our President at Building Efficiency and he seems to feel pretty good that pricing has been rational and probably because we're starting to see orders increase a little bit that we're not under as much pressure, particularly in North America. I think the opposite is the truth when you get to places like China though. I think there's some pricing pressure in China.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Understood. Thanks. And then just on Hitachi, you highlighted that it's off to a good start on growth as well as perhaps margins. I just wondered when you look at that business right now, how you think about the priorities there in terms of maximizing say VRF growth in the U.S. versus making sure that you can pull up the margins through cost synergies. And maybe how much higher do think you can push those margins at Hitachi over the next couple of years?","Alex A. Molinaroli - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes. So I think if you were going after the most important things, I mean strategically we need to be able to get our position strengthened in North America in VRF, because we're going to market now, and Hitachi wasn't in the market. So I think that strategically is going to be important.","As it relates to margins, our biggest lever on margins is going to be the business that's in Brazil, and the business that's in Japan and Iraq business, which is a residential business, and that's going to be more around cost than it is going to be around growth. So there's really two answers. One the long-term, it's going to be very important for us to continue in investing. So if you looked inside we should see we're investing in our distribution, and investing in places like North America to set up our channels and our training and our support system. And then if you look at our cost plan, it really is around the residential business and focused in Japan and Brazil.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Very helpful. Thank you.","Brian J. Stief - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","On the commodity question, just to address that quickly, I do have some data here. So as it relates to BE in the quarter, we did get a commodity benefit of about $3 million, $3.5 million in the quarter, and we're forecasting for the year that that number could be around $14 million but based upon current FX levels across the two or three main countries that they do business in that are impacted negatively, it's pretty much offset as it relates to our plan. So there's really no commodity benefit net-net coming through if you consider FX as well.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Perfect. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Mike Wood with Macquarie. Sir, your line is now open.","Mike Wood - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. First, are Hitachi sales still expected to be about $3 billion for the full year? And is the lower run rate in fiscal first quarter just seasonality or is there something else there?","Brian J. Stief - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, so a couple of things there. The first quarter was $525 million, and it is seasonal to some extent. I would tell you that we had guided at about $3 billion of sales and $120 million a sync and in that $3 billion of sales there was an entity that's got about $250 million of sales that we were planning on consolidating. And as we got in and looked at the underlying agreements related to the joint venture itself, we determined from accounting standpoint that we weren't going to be able to consolidate that entity. So, instead of $3 billion for the year, our revenues related to Hitachi are going to be $2.75 billion or so, and that correspond where there's about $70 million in the quarter that was impacted as well. So that $525 million was originally targeted to be about $600 million. So, we are now looking at Hitachi for the year about $2.75 billion. And, yes, the $525 million in the first quarter reflects some seasonality in that business.","Alex A. Molinaroli - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I'd like to point out that the strong [exposed] you saw in China is in unconsolidated. So if you look at the topline growth, where we had the strongest sales, it happens to be \u2013 and where we saw the strength in China that was \u2013 representing earlier happens to be with Hisense which is unconsolidated.","Mike Wood - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Great. Then approximately when should we expect to begin to see benefits of the restructuring in that resi business that you were planning?","Alex A. Molinaroli - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","That's a great question. I think the next time we get together I'll be able to update. In fact I'll be at a steering committee meeting tonight. So I'll be able to report on that. So I'm anxious to be able to tell you what the plan is, but I want to make sure that I get it hot off the press.","Mike Wood - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Josh Pokrzywinski with Buckingham Research. Sir, your line is now open.","Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Hi. Good morning, guys.","Alex A. Molinaroli - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Josh.","Brian J. Stief - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning.","Robert Bruce McDonald - Vice Chairman & Executive Vice President","Good morning.","Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Just to follow up on some of the BE order momentum and maybe unpacking that growth algorithm to 10%.","Alex A. Molinaroli - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I'm sorry. We can't hear you.","Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Can guys hear me?","Alex A. Molinaroli - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, go ahead.","Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. Perfect. Just to come back to that 10% outlook for BE, obviously some puts and takes internationally, and it sounds like the bottom line is North America is still pretty solid. I guess, Alex, how do you think about North America underneath that 10%, and where does the bridge from here really need to get better to start to move closer to that? Maybe the 10% number is more aspirational just given where we started, but what needs to get better or chilled from here to start looking more achievable?","Alex A. Molinaroli - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","If we continue to see the kind of momentum we have in the quarter, particularly the end of the quarter, I mean I think that at some point, in North America, I think that we can get there. I just get a little bit nervous about things that are outside our control. I mean it seems like the actual market is doing better than the financial markets, but at some point the financial markets will make their way to the investors and that \u2013 investments and that's what worries me.","I'm pretty bullish on what I see in North America, with one caveat is that there is this cloud hanging around as it relates to the financial markets that just what you hope is it doesn't get our customers spooked as it relates to investments. But the institutional markets are gaining steam, which is our strength. So knock on wood, I'm hopeful to be able to report that we will continue to see that growth. Unfortunately the one thing that we were counting on that did not come back, at least didn't come back at the pace we wanted was, if you remember we got sidetracked at the end of Q4 with the federal government work, it was huge projects, and a lot of them. And we had significant impact to our backlog and to our topline because of that, and we haven't seen that come back, hopefully we'll see it at the end of this year, when it comes to that time again, but it's always been something we can count on, and I'm just not sure if we can count on it now or not.","Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Would that branch business look even stronger ex government this quarter?","Alex A. Molinaroli - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Absolutely. The federal government \u2013 in fact earlier when I said that, I apologize, I said something about industrial \u2013 industrial and federal government together are the two ones that are off, not only where our backlog is, but we've seen that continue through the second quarter.","Brian J. Stief - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes, I mean just to put it in perspective, the government jobs that I referred to that are really out there that we aren't sure if they're going to now be able to execute or even if they will be awarded to JCI given some of the deferrals that are going on are in the $125 million to $150 million range in aggregate. So that certainly is a piece that we need to work through for the rest of the year here.","Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Got you. As I think about how that 10% broke down initially in December, it seemed like there were, if I'm recalling it right, about maybe three or four points of product \u2013 new product growth and channel penetration. How would you mark yourself against that bogie today? On track or there may be a bit of a gap there too?","Alex A. Molinaroli - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","There's a gap there and when you talk to the teams, I mean there's two things that when you look at the new segments you'll be able to see that. The product growth wasn't what we expected, and the margins because the investments were a little lower. One of the things that was a challenge for us in the first quarter was that when we were going through the integration of ADTI, one of our brands, our significant brands, we relocated one of the production facilities, and I think we had a hard time catching up with deliveries. So hopefully that will fix itself a little bit, but that was one of the problems we had in the quarter.","Brian J. Stief - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I think with some of the product investments that we made in the first quarter, hopefully we will start to see some of that benefit in the back half of this year. But I mean just to kind of frame that you, between product investments and investments in sales resources, that number was almost $20 million in the quarter for BE, and you'll see that when you see the products North America segment data that's in the 8-K.","Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Got you.","Alex A. Molinaroli - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","The other thing that this kind of a \u2013 to kind of pile on a little bit, the Hitachi channel work will show up in that number, too, which was \u2013 which is an investment that we have to put in place in order to get ready for sales for that particular product. So there was a significant amount of investments in the product North America business.","Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. And just flipping over to Adient real quickly, it might be a little premature for this. I'll take a flyer. I guess with the new structure with Tyco one would imagine that Adient now comes out maybe a bit more tax advantaged than it would have otherwise pre-merger. Any way to maybe handicap what kind of tax synergies maybe versus the former imaginary case.","Alex A. Molinaroli - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","It's a great question. It's a really good question, and I think as we work through that, we've talked about where we are and we just don't have it finally worked out. We will have it worked out by the time we get the Form 10 and the question you have is a great question, and I think that we are sorting through that now and we certainly will have that prepared between now and the Form 10 and so at the latest we will be able to have that then which is late March, early April.","Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Great.","Alex A. Molinaroli - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good question.","Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Colin Langan with UBS Securities. Sir, your line is now open.","Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thanks for taking my question. Can I just clarify \u2013 I just want to understand the power solution outlook. I mean if we take out the impact of lead prices, does the outlook on your \u2013 for that segment actually really change? I mean is the sales-that's creating a sales headwind, but dollar margins seem like they're going to look better on a percentage basis, or is there some other underlying headwind there that we should also be considering.","Alex A. Molinaroli - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","That's the way you should think about this business. So one of the things we wanted to make sure that we pointed out was that don't give us all the credit for the 260 basis points of margin improvement, because that's not all operational because as things move around, we may not be able to continue at that level. So that's why we point that out, that we are \u2013 because that's such a big part of that pass through that it does impact our margin. But you got it right. As lead prices go down, the margins go up. It doesn't impact us. There is a timing issue that flows through our books, but other than timing, it's kind of a net zero effect dollars wise.","Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC","And in terms of the outlook for Building Efficiency sales being at risk, you named three items, you quantified some like the federal jobs are maybe 1% of your growth. I mean if all of those items are issues what is sort of the bare case that you are looking at for that from that 9% to 11%? How bad do you think it will get if all of them come together at the same time.","Alex A. Molinaroli - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Probably half that number.","Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC","Okay.","Alex A. Molinaroli - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I mean I think that's probably what we see now. I mean I guess it could get worse, but if we see \u2013 kind of if you look at where we are, when we talked about it, our backlog was actually down going into the year because of the federal government work. And so what you have to \u2013 what gets a little bit difficult to predict is if the product business doesn't grow, then we are really suspect to the revenue recognition of meeting a backlog and the flow-through to the work. So even if we are secured starts moving at the rate it's been growing at, we'll still have a revenue issue, and so we need to get those orders in now.","Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Very helpful.","Brian J. Stief - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","But I would tell you, we've got a contingency plan as it relates to, if that were to happen, we've got actions that we can take to ensure that we still deliver the segment income and the margins and what we've kind of put out there for our full-year guidance. So, we're working the issue relative to top line and adjusting our cost structure accordingly.","Alex A. Molinaroli - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, absolutely. So our investments will certainly mirror our top-line prospects. We have not changed our commitment regardless of where we fit in that revenue as it relates to our bottom line, because the other part of this is, it's not like you can't see it coming as it relates to revenue. If our backlog doesn't improve, we're certainly not going to be able to make the investment as quickly as we planned.","Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank. Sir, your line is now open.","Alex A. Molinaroli - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Rod.","Patrick E. Nolan - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning, everyone. It's actually Pat Nolan on for Rod.","Alex A. Molinaroli - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Pat.","Patrick E. Nolan - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Just a similar question on Power Solutions the organic growth, the 9% to 11%. I know it's not the biggest quarter this quarter but how are you \u2013 if things are tracking pretty much in line with what you're seeing at the end of the quarter, where do you think that 9% to 11% ends up for the year? And just a housekeeping. What was the actual revenue impact from lead in the quarter?","Brian J. Stief - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I'm sorry, the...","Alex A. Molinaroli - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Revenue impact on lead?","Brian J. Stief - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Revenue impact on lead was about $50 million in the quarter. And as far as where the 9% to 11% could go, I guess based upon what we've seen, it could go down to 7% to 8%, yeah, but again, I would tell you that if it goes down to that level, we've got plans in place to cover. So at this point in time, whatever shortfall we might see at BE and Power, we think Auto is over-performing, and so we're very comfortable with where we are for full-year guidance.","Alex A. Molinaroli - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, and remember, as it relates to any of the lead impact to top line, it's not something that we should feel from a bottom line perspective.","Patrick E. Nolan - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks, guys.","Alex A. Molinaroli - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Operator, we've got time for one more.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question comes from the line of Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. Sir, your line is now open.","Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Yeah, thanks for taking the question. So with the Tyco merger now another major integration to manage, just wondering how, if at all, does that change your thinking about the capital allocation strategy once all these ducks are put in a row? Thank you.","Alex A. Molinaroli - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Do you mean as it relates to after the...","Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Yes after the spinoff and the dividend receipt, the influx of cash, how could all of this change any of your thinking about capital allocation say between M&A, share repurchase?","Alex A. Molinaroli - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So I don't know that it changes anything except that we're going to have an awful lot going on. And so depending on where we are, and if you look at the cash flows that we look at, I mean, it's going to ramp up because we'll still have some trailing costs as it relates to integration moving into next year even the separation. So I think as our cash flows improve, depending on where we are with the integration, I would expect that we're going to make the right decision as it relates to whether we return that to the shareholders or make investments.","I don't know that we've gotten that far, but one thing I can tell you for sure is around our dividend policy, we're both, at this point, we're both committed to making sure that at a minimum we continue the current dividend policies of both companies. And we have \u2013 just to make sure that you understand where we in the process, there's an awful lot of the stuff that we really have to continue work through. We haven't really had a lot of those conversations yet as a team. But we're going to have significant cash flow, that's for sure.","Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Yeah, if I have time for one quick follow-up just to come back to Power Solutions and specifically to AGM, 41% growth in shipments. Maybe at a high-level could you talk about your level of, let's call it, medium-term visibility over the next few years, you're significantly expanding capacity. How much of that visibility related to design-ins and customer commitments and what's sort of the right mix of aftermarket versus OE to think about? Thank you.","Alex A. Molinaroli - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, that \u2013 so a great question. It's still going to be a lot more OE than aftermarket because the OE business is growing so fast. And our visibility to that is pretty high because usually it's program driven. A lot of the AGM capacity that we're talking about adding has been in China, but what we're seeing is across the board. I mean we'll be adding capacity in Europe. A lot of that is because the aftermarket is starting to happen there because we've been at it much longer. And in North America, there's actually more than aftermarket that's already there surprisingly. It's not necessarily for start-stop. It's just for enhanced performance, and in China it's really \u2013 it's an OE story. So I think it's still going to be a heavy mix for OE and I think that what we see is that most of the capacity if not almost all of it is already subscribed that we're putting in.","Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Excellent. Thank you.","Alex A. Molinaroli - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Alex A. Molinaroli - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So let me close out. I mean I just want to comment again. I'm not sure if you were sitting in my shoes how you couldn't feel good about the ongoing performance of the business. We continue to meet the expectations that we set not only as an overall business but within the segments, continue to improve our margins and I think our investments, particularly in BE, we're starting to see the shoots of growth and I'm pretty proud of all that that everybody's accomplishing.","And hopefully you feel the same way that I do that our strategic position is improving. I think Adient is going to be an incredible competitor within the Automotive space and we're setting up to be successful. That's our plan and then if you look at the remaining Johnson Controls, not only the investments we're making now, but you look at the transformational merger that we talked about, we have an opportunity to be something really special and I think that we'll actualize that. So I hopefully have the same confidence I have and we look forward to continue reporting, achieving our near-term and our long-term plan, so thanks a lot. Have a great day.","Brian J.

He will give an overview of the quarter and a little bit about as we move into 2014. He is followed by Bruce McDonald, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, who will give more in-depth review of the business results as well as an overall financial review. After that, time for questions and answers, and we will end promptly at the top of the hour.","And with that, I turn it over to Alex.","Alex Molinaroli","Good morning, everyone. We were just commenting before we started that this is very strange, not seeing Steve Roell here. He's been doing these calls for as long as there have been calls. So we're going to try to fly without him today. And we'll have some comments about him in a few minutes.","So I'm pleased to announce that we had record sales and earnings in essence, and despite all the mixed economic news around the world, and I'm pretty proud of what the team has accomplished. The North American automotive production was more positive than we thought. And the production rates for our 2013 have almost recovered to our pre-recessionary levels.","The European production level was lower than prior year, but it seem to end less bad than what we though in for the third and fourth quarter. So we're hoping that means it's stabilizing.","That stabilization in the second half helped us make good progress in improving our operational efficiencies and also made a lot of progress in synergy of our metals organization. We lost $200 million in Europe in the first half of the year and we had a profit in the second half. So that's a great accomplishment.","The China auto production remain strong, it's upper-single digits. And in our case, we grew 20% and we did have a strong backlog. So we are gaining share in a growing market.","A small component of our Building Efficiency business, the growth in the residential HVAC market was upper-single digits. And if you recall, that's a business that we focused on over the past few years, we've restructured. And even though we still are not at pre-recessionary rates, we are now generating record EBIT in that business.","The commercial HVAC markets remained a real challenge in 2013. Europe continues to be depressed. And North America, our vertical markets, particularly impacted in the institutional market, the federal government and healthcare. And we're hopeful as things get sorted out beyond budgets and sequestration, the Affordable Care Act and what that's going to imply, that this will bounce back over time.","And lastly in the aftermarket for the battery business, it's still slow in North America. And it's a combination, we talked about weather with fewer miles driven, fewer vehicles on the road, but we do expect over time that that will pick back up, but we were able to overcome that in the quarter.","You go to the next slide, I'd like to highlight a few things for about our fourth quarter. We had higher revenues in all of our businesses and we were sure that was going to happen as went into the quarter. And in particular, I'd like to point out that BE had 2% growth in their topline. That's the first time since the second quarter of our fiscal 2012.","Both automotive and Power Solutions revenues increased 9%. And more importantly we had great profitability improvements. 410 basis points in Power Solutions. The Automotive Experience margins increased a 110 basis points. And the Building Efficiency margins increase 60 basis points.","I think for this quarter indicates that our cost control and our productivity improvement measures are starting to gain some real traction. And Bruce will go through these results in a greater detail in his section. Lastly, in the quarter we did complete the sale of HomeLink and we're still in the process of selling the remaining electronics business. And we believe we'll have news here by the end of the calendar year.","Let's talk about entering 2014. I think that our view is the markets are, we like it to be stronger, but we believe that they are stabilizing, both in the automotive market and the building's market. Unfortunately, we don't see a strong demand increase, but I think a lot of challenging markets have troughed, as we talked about Europe earlier, and hopefully the commercial HVAC market will start to rebound at some point.","We are almost at pre-recession automotive production levels in North America. And we do think that European production will improve slightly in 2014, but the restructuring that we've done at this point should bode well. China is expected to grow again, in 2014, and we have a great backlog and we should outpace the market again.","Continuing this trend of what we saw through 2013, I think started in 2012, our team has been working hard at our cost discipline, our pricing initiatives and our productivity improvements, and I believe we're going to continue to see results from that. We do expect, however, we're going to spend less on capital expenditures in 2014, and we should be in a position where we generate greater cash flow.","I will talk a little bit more about our capital spending at our December Analyst Meeting. As you know, we continue to restructure our business, to both improve our productivity, profitability and our efficiency. Much of that activity is focused on Europe, a lot of it on automotive, and we expect these initiatives to continue delivering the benefits in the months ahead.","We continue to invest in the markets that have the best growth opportunities, particularly China in all three of our businesses. And I'll talk about, over the last few months, we are being more active on our portfolio. Lessening our dependents in the long run on the auto sector and moving more toward multi-industry model.","This morning we announced we're exploring strategic options for our automotive interiors business. As you know, this business makes door panels, instrument panels and other interior components and had sales of $4.2 billion in 2013. And we hope to have more to talk about at the Analyst Day. We're not going to talk about our timetable at this point or comment on our specific plans, but we want to make sure that we acknowledge that.","Lastly, before I turn it over to Bruce, I'd like to thank Steve Roell. 31 years of service. And I think all of us that know Steve and I know the folks on the phone, who know Steve for a long, long time, really appreciate his leadership and not only is he a fine leader, he is a fine person. I personally account Steve as my boss, my mentor and now my friend. And I hope that his retirement is as productive as his working career.","He joined us in '82. He was the Chief Financial Officer in '91; Executive VP in 2004; Vice Chairman in 2005; and became our CEO in 2007. At the end of this calendar year on January 1, he will retire from the company. He remains as our Chairman until the end of the calendar year. So I just want to make sure, and I hope, I would imagine Steve might be listening that we acknowledge his contributions. Bruce?","Bruce McDonald","Thanks, Alex. And I too would like to add my best wishes to Steve. And I wish him a long and healthy retirement.","I'm excited this morning really to talk about our fourth quarter business and financial results. We're extremely pleased with how we came in here for the fourth quarter. And we think we've got terrific momentum, as we go into 2014.","So with our Power Solutions business on Slide 7. Here you can see our revenues were up about 9%. If you adjust out for foreign exchange and the impact of lead, our underlying sales were up about 11%. If you look at a little bit more granularly, OE volumes were up 15% in the quarter, aftermarket volumes were up 2%.","You can see geographically, we talk about the unit shipments being up 5%, with 1% growth in the Americas, 11% growth in Asia and 12% growth in Europe. And I think that growth in Europe of 12%, particularly noteworthy, given the depressed market conditions there. And this really reflects the share gains that we're seeing from the European Power Solutions team. Also we've highlighted here, if you look at the high-margin AGM sales, they were up 33% in the quarter.","In terms of our segment income, we had a very strong quarter. Here you see segment income of $330 million, was up 38% from last year. The results, generally speaking, were favorably impacted by the higher unit shipments, the ongoing benefits associated with in-house lead recycling, strong operational performance and the impact some of our pricing initiatives that we talked about on previous calls.","I'd also point out, if you recall last year, our results were negatively impacted by both a high core collection cost, as we had to bring in additional inventory to ramp up and to start up the Florence, South Carolina smelter. So the year-over-year improvement is definitely flattered by the fact that we had some high start up costs in the previous year's quarter.","Our margins at 19.4% were up 410 basis points, as Alex noted. And I've seen in some of the earlier notes that have come at this morning, sort of questions about the sustainability of Power Solutions margins. I guess, I'll just remind the analyst community that Q1 and Q4 tend to be our strongest quarters in terms of Power Solutions' production and shipments.","And the type of margins that we're seeing here in the fourth quarter, I don't think are atypical. So this was a normative level of margins that we should be delivering in our fourth quarter, when our operations are firing on all cylinders.","One other thing I'd like to point out here in the fourth quarter is we changed our inventory valuation methodology from LIFO to FIFO. And as you know, we've had a LIFO inventory methodology for a long time in Power Solutions and that's tended to make our quarterly earnings highly volatile, particularly in times when lead prices were moving around and we were building or drawing down our inventories.","So the impact of that from a U.S. GAAP point of view for the year was immaterial and same thing in the fourth quarter, but it will, when we restate our numbers, according to U.S. GAAP, change our Q2 and Q3 earnings up and down by $0.02 or $0.03, they net out to zero.","When we issue our Form 10-K we'll provide the impact of this for our previous periods. But sort of the key takeaway here is we've radically simplified the way we account for inventory in Power Solutions. We're taking away the volatility that introduces to our quarterly earnings and it did not have a material impact on either the full year or the fourth quarter earnings for Power Solutions.","Turning to Building Efficiency. As Alex mentioned in his comments, we returned to growth. Since the first time this year we saw topline growth of 2%. That's despite the sort of weakness that we continue to experience in the institutional and some of the new construction markets.","If you look at our revenue growth by business segment. Our service business, we saw a 12% growth, in Asia 6%. Our unitary products group, where we have our residential and light commercial, is up 13%; and those where partially offset by the Middle-East, which is down 7%, which is primarily the timing of large orders; and a small reduction in Global WorkPlace Solutions and Europe of 3% and 2% respectively.","In terms of our order intake, we were up about 2% for the quarter here, so roughly in line with where we were at the third quarter. We did have a few large solutions contracts that we had hoped we would walk here in the fourth quarter. We expect those will slip in the first half of the year. It's very large orders that we're excited to be close to finalizing here.","Looking at our order intake geographically, we are up 5% in Europe, Asia and North America. Latin America and Middle-East though were down double digit. Our backlog of unexecuted work at the end of the year, if you adjust for foreign exchange and the impact of divestitures, our underlying backlog was down 5%. And here we basically saw the impact of higher order intake in systems North America and energy solution offset by softness in the Middle-East and Asia.","Continuing the trend from previous quarters, our segment income was up more than revenue and we further expanded our margin. So you can see segment income of $357 million, was up 9% versus last year. Our margins were up 60 basis points to 9.2%. We saw a pretty good margin expansion in North America service, Global WorkPlace Solutions, Asia, Latin America and then our unitary products group.","And then the last thing I would just point out, as you recall earlier in this year, we implemented a business improvement program specifically in our Global WorkPlace Solutions business, and we're pleased to see that we're gaining good momentum from this initiative. And as we noted here on the slide, you'll see that our full year margins nearly doubled to 2.3% in the quarter.","Turning to Automotive Experience. A real nice quarter the team delivered here. Sales were up 9%. If you look at that by our product areas, you'll see seating was up about same 9%, interiors was up 8% and electronics was up about 13%.","If you look at it on a geographic basis to sort of put our revenue performance and the perspective against the industry, North America we were up 14%, against the 5% improvement in production; in Europe we were up 10%, with production being down 1%; and in China, and I'm counting here all of our sales, which are primarily non-consolidated joint ventures, our revenues were up about 20% and that compares to passenger car production being up about 6%, so again, all three major geographies for us, substantial revenue out performance versus the underlying production environment.","In terms of our profitability, real pleased to see a huge jump of 47% in the quarter, so segment income for automotive came in at $233 million. Generally speaking, we benefited from higher revenues and the operational performance that we saw in our metals business in South America and in our European businesses across all three product lines.","I would note that if you look at our segment income by product line in the quarter, our automotive electronics margins were down on a year-over-year basis and that really by about 260 basis points. That's generally in line with our plan and reflects the higher level of investment that we're making in our infotainment heads-up technology and things like that.","So I think the margin erosion that some of the analysts had in their model, I think it was largely as a result of the increased level of investment that we're making in our automotive electronics business. In terms of the overall margins, up 4.3% or 110 basis point higher than last year.","Turning to the financials now on Slide 10. And as we talked about in our press release, we did have a number of non-operational one-time items that resulted in a net charge of $0.80 this quarter and we had similarly large charges in this corresponding quarter of 2012, but maybe just to sort of put those in perspective, we had a net gain on the sale of two businesses, that's primarily our HomeLink product line that we sold to Gentex. We had some additional restructuring charges that Alex referred to, primarily targeted our European operations in both automotive and Building Efficiency.","We had a non-cash mark-to-market gain associated with our pension and retiree medical benefits and our pension settlement gain. Last year those were significant losses and that turnaround was really as a result of good asset performance this year and an increase in the discount rate.","And then we have some non-cash charges related to valuation allowance provisions on the tax line and a book charge related to repatriation of foreign earnings associated with our electronic business. We're bringing that cash back to the U.S. We have a book charge. The net cash tax impact of the divestures is about $50 million, so there is a big discrepancy between book and accounting tax provision and the cash tax provision on the HomeLink divestiture.","As we go through the financials, I'm going to exclude the impact of these items from our discussion. So if we just look at our revenues, you can see we're up about 6% to $11 billion. We're real pleased to see solid improvement in our margins at 17.4%. We're up about 180 basis points on a year-over-year basis and we saw a good margin expansion in all three of our businesses.","In terms of SG&A, you can see where our SG&A as a percentage of sales ticked up here in the quarter. What you really see in there is higher levels of employee-related costs, and some higher than year-over-year litigation costs in the fourth quarter. Those aren't a trend. I would just say those are timing-related.","Equity income, you can see a big improvement up to $94 million here. That year-over-year improvement really reflects improved profitability of our automotive joint ventures in Asia. And then if you look at the segment income margin on a company level, we're up a 130 basis points to 8.3% versus last year's 7%.","Turning to Slide 11. Just a little bit more information on the financials here, our financing cost of $54 million, were down $8 million versus last year, not really reflects just lower levels of average debt. I mean, our debt levels came down very nicely here in the second half of the year and that's what gives us the tailwind on our net financing cost.","From a tax point of view, our underlying rate was 20% exactly in line with our guidance, although it was up from 16.3% last year. And then income from that non-controlling interest was a charge of $36 million in the quarter versus $29 million last year. That's really attributable to the higher profitability of some of our consolidated automotive joint ventures. And lastly, looking at diluted earnings per share coming in at $0.95, which is a 23% year-over-year improvement.","I'd like you to spend a minute on the balance sheet and our cash flow performance here on the Slide 12. If you look at our cash from operating activities in the quarter, it was a great quarter. $1 billion of net operating cash flow; our strong operating cash flow combined with the HomeLink proceeds enabled us to reduce our net debt in the quarter by $1.2 billion.","If you look at where we ended the year, our net debt-to-total capitalization was about 26.5%, which is about a 510 basis point improvement in the quarter. So I just feel really good in terms of how our borrowing and our leverage metrics ended up here at the end of the year.","In terms of trade working capital, we had a great performance here in 2013, on a year-over-year basis. If you look at our trade working capital, which we define as inventory accounts payable and accounts receivable, it declined by about 70 basis points this year, at about 6% of sales.","CapEx, generally speaking, came in line with our expectations. And lastly, in terms of our pension and post-retirement obligation, I just noted in here our net unfunded liability at the end of this year was about $600 million, which was down from $1.2 billion last year. So our plans are extremely robustly funded and we do not anticipate making any significant payments to our plan for the foreseeable future.","And lastly, I would just comment on our strategy to de-risk our balance sheet. We did complete the buyout of a portion of our U.S. term vested here in the fourth quarter. That was worth about a payout of about $450 million.","And then lastly, if I just comment on our expectations looking forward here, by almost every measure I think Q4 was a strong quarter for the company. We have great momentum, as we enter into 2014 and we're highly confident in the improvement actions that the business has continued to deliver here.","So we expect to see ongoing sequential improvement in Automotive Experience and that's in the areas that we've talked about quarter-after-quarter here on metals business, South America and Europe.","Building Efficiency, we do expect to see continued, albeit slow topline growth and ongoing margin expansion for 2014. GWS were excited about the beginning results that we're seeing from the business transformation initiative, and there'll be more to come next year.","We see strong year-over-year improvements continuing in Power Solution and our restructuring initiatives were adding to them and they are generally delivering the financial results that we expected.","If we look at Q1, we expect EPS growth of about 30%. If you take out the impact of the HomeLink divestiture and that's worth about $0.02 a quarter, roughly speaking. Our underlying Q1 EPS growth here was up about 35%. And lastly, as you'll note on the slide, we do talk about holding our Annual Analyst Meeting at Stage 37 in Midtown New York on December 18, and that's the meeting where we're really going to present a little bit more clarity around our business strategy, some of our thoughts on the portfolio and provide full year financial guidance and a lot more information on our underlying assumptions.","And with that, Glen, I'll turn it back to you, and we'll open up for Q&A.","Glen Ponczak","Great. Thanks, Bruce; thank, Alex. Operator, we're ready to take question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) And our first question is from Brian Johnson with Barclays.","Brian Johnson - Barclays","Just want to follow up on the battery point, because at least I was one of those who wondered if 19% is what we can start looking forward to 1Q's and 4Q's. So a couple of things. One, to what extent did you benefit from any, it doesn't look like you benefited from any seasonal restocking after two warm winters in a row in Americas. How are you kind of looking for this upcoming winter and how do orders look going into the winter?","Alex Molinaroli","So our team does some modeling, and they don't actually expect, unless there is some weather event that we're going to see a tremendous uptick in sales, that that we do believe that will come, but unless we get some event, we're not seeing anybody anticipate those orders. What you really saw in the fourth quarter and what we expect to continue in the first quarter is the strength in Europe, I mean which is really unbelievable.","Bruce mentioned that, that you look at such a down market, we've been able to grow our share there and of course that's also where we have our AGM batteries and we get replacement for those too. So I think the numbers that we're talking about, they will be representative, but I don't think that we built anything on our plan to have extraordinary sales for the year.","Brian Johnson - Barclays","And as you kind of think of that 410 basis points, you sort of back out, maybe it sounds like 70 basis points or so for the core cost last year. How would you roughly divide the rest of it between higher margin AGM business, recycling facility actually coming online and reducing your run rate, pricing increases and other factors?","Alex Molinaroli","I don't know that I can give you a number, but there is not one single thing that would be the overriding factor, because all those things are beneficial. Our pricing initiative, a lot of that has to do with getting our commercial terms to stick with the OEs. And that's something that we trace all year, we were able to get that recovery and that will help us going forward.","The AGM business, I think you understand that 33%, you'd probably come up with some modeling and what that impact is. But we also are starting to see a more consistent benefit from our totaling arrangements, our in-house totaling. So I think that we're seeing some consistencies, but we're seeing more than anything else.","Bruce McDonald","Brian, I would probably block it in a little bit more around. I mean if you recall last Q4, we were pretty disappointed with our margins in power last year. And we talked about the startup cost of the smelter and the hit that we took buying inventory in the open market to start that facility.","So I would say, if you look at the rough, on a year-over-year base we're up about $90 million. I would say probably $30 million to $35 million of that delta. It would be the cost that we'd incurred last year that weren't there this year. So I'd say it's more a like a third of it.","Brian Johnson - Barclays Capital","And final question. Can you quantify what benefit, if any the LIFO to FIFO change had or is that just perspective in fiscal [indiscernible] actually? And did that have an impact at all?","Bruce McDonald","When we'll get some more information out on this when we sort of finalize things, but generally speaking it's immaterial in Q1 and Q4 of this year. I'd believe in Q2, it's an income item and Q3 it's a charge and those are $0.02 or $0.03. But when you sort of take the full year impact it's less than a penny.","Operator","And the next question is from John Murphy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Maybe just to follow up on the battery question. AGM obviously outperformed in the quarter for you and it looked like it was great. Just curious, if you could tell us what percentage of your total units or revenue or AGM at this point and maybe remind us generally what the delta is in the margins between AGM and your regular lead acid batteries?","Bruce McDonald","If you look at on our full year basis, our unit sales is about a $135 million and the AGM is like 5% of that.","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And the profitability roughly, two times, three times?","Bruce McDonald","Well, we've said it's like two to three time for the margin.","Alex Molinaroli","Margins are like 50% higher roughly, I mean, very generally speaking.","Bruce McDonald","That's not right, so net impact of 50%.","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Then a second question. Alex, you seem to be going through a portfolio review here, which seems very rational given your new position. As you look at the interior business, which is coming on your radar screen, is that a business that you necessarily need to have alongside the seating business in your view? Or really could that be something that would be really separated from the run seating on a standalone basis?","And then also just a question on the interiors business as well, I mean there is some antitrust stuff for some investigations going on in Europe around some price-fixing or something that is not actually completely clear get. So I was just curious if you have seen any of that as well in the interiors business?","Alex Molinaroli","We're not impacted by any of that investigation in our interiors business. I think that what we found when we split the seating business from the interiors business for that very reason is we learn how much they are interconnected. I think that they are only interconnected by convenience not interconnected commercial convenience, not by any other reasons. Whether we divesture that business or do something else with it, I don't think it's going to be harmed or harmful to our seating business.","Bruce McDonald","I would just maybe add to that, John. If you sort of go back in time and you look at the portfolio that we have in automotive today, interiors, electronics and seating, it was really put together with a view that what we're going to see was our customers source complete interiors.","And as we've talked about on previous calls, that the sourcing pattern is now much more at the component level, and not at all customers, but the total interior sourcing just has not materialized by enlarge and so they need to have those three product lines, it doesn't exist anymore.","Alex Molinaroli","And Bruce's point is very valid. If you think about from a customer standpoint that might have made sense for a total interiors, but the amount of complexity for a supplier to have all those products is incredibly complex.","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And then just lastly, Bruce, I mean you guys are net debt to cap of 26.5%, balance sheet is in great shape. I mean what are your general targets or rules of thumb of where you want the balance sheet to be or go? And maybe, Alex, you have some different views on this or than maybe in the past as well. But just curious if there is any update there or changes or where you think you stand and where you want to be as far as capitalization?","Bruce McDonald","Well, I'll comment first and then we'll see if Alex agrees. For us the thing that's important for us to maintain, investment-grade balance sheet. And so I would say we will feel uncomfortable going below BBB plus, just because in the event of a shock to the system like we saw in all '08 and '09, we want to be comfortable in that investment-grade rating, so that we can weather the storm here. But having said that we're probably seven to 10 points below where I would say it's ideal from a optimal capital structure. And that's where we are right now.","Alex Molinaroli","So I think we'll talk more about that in December, but we've talked about the fact that we are looking not only our capital structure, but looking across capital allocation in a very broad way. So we'll have much more to talk about in December.","Operator","And next question is from Patrick Archambault with Goldman Sachs.","Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs","I guess my main ones are on Building Efficiency. I guess the first one would be the backlog, which was down 5%. How much of that was due to some of the disruption from the government shutdown? I take it that added probably quite a bit of uncertainty. And maybe kind of tying to that question, sort of what's the prospect for that just given, what you're seeing in the order book for that to swing positively? And I have a follow-up as well.","Bruce McDonald","It would be nice to blame all this on what happened in event. I think that uncertainty does not help these types of investments. And there has been uncertainty around the federal government spending, the state government funding for a long, long time. These are just events that that really are typical of the kind of things that don't help. So I wouldn't say that one event, but I think the overall uncertainty about funding of the federal government and state government is hurt.","And the other thing that is hurt is in the healthcare business, which is very important part of our business, is the uncertainty about what's going to happen with our healthcare customers. What I would expect though as they sort that out, that's going to create opportunity. But unfortunately it's not sorted out yet. And so the opportunity will come, but we've got to wait for them to deal with their business issues.","Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs","And just in general, you had this very significant improvement in Global WorkPlace Solutions. Can you just remind us of what the components of margin expansion is? I mean obviously you've had significant restructuring efforts in that segment, in Building Efficiency, in general, but that seem to be having a very good impact, particularly in GWS. How much of the driver is from additional benefit from that? How much is mix, as some of the high-margin stuff rolls back on, just giving us a little bit of a roadmap?","Alex Molinaroli","I'll take this and Bruce can probably even give more color. We really don't have restructuring benefits, when you think about GWS at this point. But what you'll see going forward is we will see some of that as we change our operating model. And so at this point it's really been efficiencies going forward. There will be some restructuring benefit, but that restructuring benefit has to do with how we're going to change the way that we service the accounts and manage the accounts.","So we put a lot more tools and rigor and operational effectiveness inside that process. In December, we'll probably outline exactly what that initiative looks like, but we've got a strong roadmap and they are executing against that. So we expect to see that improvement continue. We're hopeful that we're going to continue to talk about that in a positive way over the next few quarters.","Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs","And maybe just some comments on how do you see the mix changing, as we go forward? And is that something that's also accretive to margins?","Bruce McDonald","Probably the best way to think about this one is, if you think about GWS in the past, it's been a very commercially focused organization and our structure reflects that. So we would have our business, it was tend to be broken up by vertical market, so someone wanted to [ph] charge up the financials or pharmaceuticals or whatever. And which was good, because it gave us a very strong focus on the customer.","The downside to that structure was if you went, then you took a place like a lot -- let's just take London, as an example. We did not leverage our resources within let say the city of London. So we may have had staff that was sub-optimized from a utilization perspective. But if we manage them across our businesses within the same geography, we could better exploit our resources.","So what we're really doing here is we want to maintain the strong commercial focus that we have in that business, but operationalize it together. The cost savings of our delivery model, scale and our purchasing by vertically integrate like self perform more. And then get some more scale and economies of scale on the utilization of our overheads, SG&A.","Alex Molinaroli","And a last point I'll bring on that is, when you go to an operational review for GWS today, you'll hear them talk about six sigma, lean, the types of conversation that we used to have in our execution oriented businesses. And so that's why we feel fairly confident that a lot of this is in our control.","Operator","Next question is from Rich Kwas with Wells Fargo Securities.","Rich Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities","A question on automotive in Europe. So, Bruce, if I have my numbers right, profit for the entire segment was $13 million in the quarter, because I think it was an $81 million swing and you were at a loss of $68 million last year. Just curious, when you look at seating, what was the relative difference in profitability in Europe across the business segments when you look at electronics, interiors and seating? Just trying to understand structurally how much improvement seating saw?","Bruce McDonald","We can follow that, because I don't know the specific numbers. But what I do know is our profitability was up in seating, and interiors is down and electronics, which reflects the investments that I talked about in infotainment. And the fact that our electronics business in Europe is one business that we have significant exposure to French OEs.","Alex Molinaroli","And while we're on the topic, you didn't ask, but I would like to make sure that the metals folks know that we really appreciate what they've done. We've turned that business now to where it's crossed over the breakeven line, at least for the quarter. So we're pretty pleased to see that that part of our business is starting to perform. So that turnaround has really made a lot of progress.","Rich Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities","So, Alex, that's something that should provide some tailwind to seating, as we move forward in 2014, correct?","Alex Molinaroli","That's correct.","Rich Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities","And then on battery, I know in the past you've talked about 8% to 10% growth over the long-term on an annual basis. With the aftermarket being as weak as it has been lately and I know you expect that to get better over time. But should we think of this as not being quite that level of growth, if aftermarket doesn't return back to mid-to-high single-digit growth? How should we think about that?","Bruce McDonald","I think the law of large numbers will hurt us at some point, because we have a strong position in North America and Europe, but we're making the investments in China. We are also seeing the topline growth because of the AGM mix. So I think that it's going to move around a little bit. But I don't really change my view of the overall prospects long-term for battery. Easy for me to say, I'm not there right now.","Rich Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities","And then the last one, first quarter guidance, does it assume any air pocket from the federal government shutdown in terms of Building Efficiency?","Alex Molinaroli","I think in the short-term, whether the federal government is open or closed, it's not going to impact us materially.","Operator","Our next question is from Colin Langan with UBS.","Colin Langan - UBS","Any color, I'm just trying to understand the logic of the interiors announcement today. I know earlier you had talked about, you are looking at all your portfolio. I mean should we view that, are you still looking at the other divisions and now you feel like you've done the assessment on interiors or have you kind of concluded the other divisions and this is the only one that you're looking for strategic options for?","Bruce McDonald","Well, I'm not sure you'd really expect me to answer that one completely. I think that the reason why we announced interiors now is because we have to make sure that we're able to execute on some of the opportunities. So it made sense for us to talk about it now. You see we have the impairment, as it relates to the rest of the portfolio, I would say just call it an ongoing process, not something that it's going to be an event. Obviously, we're having and it seems like an event now, but I would say it'd be more of an ongoing process for us.","Alex Molinaroli","I would just maybe add a little bit of color is, think about of the interiors business, I mean they've done nice job turning it around. But they are sort of sitting in a position same as we were last year with electronics. And that they've come to us and said look here is some further restructuring that we want to do, here is some increased amount of capital investment that we'd like to make, and it's not a priority for us.","So given that we're constraining the capital for this business, and also given the fact there is a lot of rumors out there. We felt it is important to our people to be forthright with them about what it is that we're planning on doing. And we have talked to various people about and parties about the business, and so we rather handle the communication like this than be reactive to a leak in the future. It spuds really around the respect for our employees.","Colin Langan - UBS","Going back to your Power Solutions that you talked about earlier, what kind of quarter-to-quarter volatility should we normally expect when we go down to Q2, Q3? Does this seem like, given the Q4 exit rate, we're almost near I think your mid-decade kind of outlook for margins with normal sort of typical seasonality?","Alex Molinaroli","Part of this I'm not going to be able to answer because of the accounting change. So I need to look at what impact that's going to be, because what happens is we basically run our factories, not completely at full load, but as best we can. And so it's become seasonal, because we have seasonal sales because of the nature of the business. And then we have building inventory and depleting inventory.","The LIFO and FIFO change is going to impact that somehow. So I really don't know if I can answer it completely or probably less volatile, but certainly be more predictable. But one of the reasons why you saw the change between Q2 and Q3 is one of those quarters were building inventory, one of them were depleting inventory. And so for LIFO that becomes a P&L hit and for our FIFO it does not.","Colin Langan - UBS","And just thinking about going forward, you've kind of indicated as AGM mix grows you'll see margin improvement. So that story and looking at Q4 in and of itself, if AGM is up, we should still continue to see margin expansion over the next few years, there is no reason to think that would normalize?","Bruce McDonald","The one thing that I would just tell you is that we'll continue our investment in China. And as we invest in China, that's a lumpy investment and it's bringing on new clients. You don't have the absorption that you like. And so I think that that's going to be headwind for a while as it relates to our overall margins, but that's where our growth and investments will come for the future. So I think that you'll probably start hearing us as we talk about margins, there will be some impact by what pace that when we are opening plans in China that's my guess.","Colin Langan - UBS","And just one last question. On Auto Experience or particularly around the seating side, are the major restructuring actions done or we are still going to see some sequential benefits from restructuring those things?","Alex Molinaroli","We'll see some sequential benefits in 2014.","Operator","Our next question is from Matt Stover with Guggenheim","Matt Stover - Guggenheim","Just a detailed question. Could you reiterate the order detail that you provided in the walk-through, Bruce? I didn't get quite all of it.","Bruce McDonald","The order detail?","Matt Stover - Guggenheim","Yes.","Bruce McDonald","So in Asia and North America and Europe, we're up about 5%. In Latin America, we're down 15%. Middle-East we're down 19%.","Matt Stover - Guggenheim","And then the second question is as I look at the sequential progression in the auto business, I know there is a lot of noise that occurs there. But was there something in particular that would affect our impression of the sequential margin, because it appeared as though you had for the revenue delta quarter-to-quarter a pretty significant decremental?","Bruce McDonald","Significant decremental?","Matt Stover - Guggenheim","Yes, last quarter Q3 to Q4?","Bruce McDonald","I can't think of anything in the fourth quarter or third quarter like some that was benefited Q3 or something that hit Q4, I can't think of anything off the top knot. But maybe we can follow-up on that, if you could share your model, maybe we can help you out.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Leiker with Baird.","David Leiker - Baird","A handful of detailed questions here first. Bruce, with the write-down in the asset value of the interiors business where did you write the book value down on that, what are you at?","Bruce McDonald","I'd rather not say.","David Leiker - Baird","And then as you go through this, I mean obviously, Alex, you have got a couple of different options you can go and some of the product lines you are already starting to wind it down. If you went down the path of winding down the whole business, is that positive or negative to the profitability over time?","Bruce McDonald","Well, that's a hard one to answer. I mean in the short-term, what would end up happening, David, is let's say that was with our plan. Then we could dial-back a lot of SG&A in the short-term, run out our contracts, but then we'd have a series of plant closures as program startup to rolled off.","Our strategy, just by the way, I mean we're not planned on winding down the interiors business. I think we've got some ideas .We aren't saying we're exploring our strategic options and we haven't got a clue what we're going to do. We have a few ideas, some sticks in the fire, but we're not planning on shutting it down.","Alex Molinaroli","I mean, we would rather not even be talking about this, but as Bruce said, we need to be transparent to our employees. But I think it's very similar to electronics. Obviously, the financials aren't the same, but we run a good business. There is structurally some issues with this market and I think we're not the only ones who are suffering from it, but there is no reason for us to wind this business down, particularly as we explore options, we have multiple options.","Bruce McDonald","David, maybe one other point, I mean we did mentioned in the press release, look, here is what the interior sales and earnings are. Keep in mind and you know this, but we allocate our corporate cost to our segment. So when I'm looking to do something with interiors, if I back away the corporate costs that wouldn't go with that business, it has positive earnings. So it's the external segment number maybe does a little bit of this justice in terms of what a buyer would get.","David Leiker - Baird","And then on the Building Efficiency side, you have the backlog there of $4.8 billion, there are some adjustments there for down 5%. If we did it apple-to-apples, what would that look like?","Bruce McDonald","I think it's down to 7%.","David Leiker - Baird","It says divestitures and FX, yes.","Bruce McDonald","I think FX wasn't -- and divestures rates where the point.","David Leiker - Baird","So you would have been down to 7%?","Bruce McDonald","Yes.","David Leiker - Baird","And your orders are up and I think in the last couple of quarters you talked about, each of those stages leading to the backlog. It sounds like you are not getting things out of the pipeline into the backlog, is that what we are seeing here?","Alex Molinaroli","I think that everybody keeps talking about this recovery that's hasn't happened yet. And if you look at the indices, what you'll see is there is some recovery happening at the architectural level. Unfortunately, it's not happening in a lot of the markets where we have our strength, where we are the strongest in the institutional markets and that seems to be a big lager at this time, which is unusual. So as that sorts out, we'll pickup pace, but unfortunately it looks like it's a few months away at least, and so that's why we're going after a lot of these costs initiative, because we're acknowledging the position we have with our backlog.","David Leiker - Baird","And then the last item here is on the battery side and I'm going to pile on the margin question. I mean if you look at that business you have the assets in place for AGM and you've got the initial assets in place in China. And I don't think you are going to open another China plant for a year and a half. You've got the mix of AGM. You've got the pricing, the vertical integration. It just seems like you've got a pretty high ceiling on margins for that business from where you are today.","Bruce McDonald","Well, I think if you're asking do we think we are willing to expand our margin for Power Solutions, we would agree with you, we do. We've talked about the fact that we expect to see couple of hundred basis points more of margin expansion over the next two to three years. I think we're on track to deliver that. So we don't disagree, we are not saying we're peaked here.","You're absolutely right, as AGM becomes a bigger piece of a pie that's beneficial. And as our China business, which right now losses money because of the investments that we're making as that swings into a profit, that even though it degrades day-to-day our overall margins, but the swinging from the lost to profit it helps the total.","David Leiker - Baird","And the timing for China during that is what?","Bruce McDonald","We're looking to get close to breakeven kind of run rate by the end of next year. I think the breakeven run rate by the end of next year.","Operator","And the next question from Rod Lache from Deutsche Bank","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank","Just to clarify one thing on the Power Solutions, certain things must have gone better than you expected late last year when you projected 200 basis points of margin expansion from 2012 to 2017. Would you agree with that and what would those items have been?","Bruce McDonald","Well, I think we were saying we expect a couple of, I think 200 basis points or 250 basis points, we were saying over a three year period there, Rod. But I think we've got a bit more lift this year with the pricing that would probably be why we did better. And that somewhat we lost some of that with the fact that the after-market volumes were softer than we thought coming to this year. So those will be the two little positive and negative, but net to a positive.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank","And then switching to seating, you've talked a little bit about that. And obviously there has been some improvement in the metals business, which was a drag last year. Could you just tell us just from a high level, what actually has happened and what actually do you have to do going forward? I think you originally were targeting a 5% margin in metals by 2014. It sounds like you've already made some progress but there are some specific actions you still need to take?","Bruce McDonald","You're right. I mean if you looked at our last analyst deck, we talked about metals being at like a 5% run rate by the end of '14. We're little bit behind that. But basically if you sort of unpack what's going on and what's driving the operational improvement here, the first and formal it's been the fact that we fixed all of our launch problems. And so for the last up until probably the early part of fiscal '13, we were lurching from problematic launch to problematic launch.","And incurring cost to sort of fix it and then another launch would come up and that would be a challenge and we'd fixed that. So we've kind of been out of that mode now for two or three quarters. So I'm not saying all of our launches are perfect, but we're not having these launches that are really problematic for us. So I'd say we're back to normal mode. And if you look at our forward pipeline of the metrics that we have on programs that we're launching in the next 12, 24, 36 months, we're back to normal. So that's a great result. That's what has really driven us from the heavy losses to get to breakeven.","What's in front of us? There is probably two big things. One is we still have a lot of our supply based in high-cost country and so we have work stream that moves a lot of our tools, this is largely a Europe story, Western Europe to Eastern Europe. And then probably a bigger part of the story is then the product and process standardization. And that we're really in the early innings on.","And by that what I mean is if you think about JCI, KEIPER and Hammerstein, I'll just take recliners. We all had a recliner and we are standardizing on the KEIPER recliner family, and so we're going through a process of getting that recliner fitted out on our backlogs, that we can stop the product proliferation, rationalize our engineering around the 1-2b product family and then converting our manufacturing operations, so they can all manufacture the same thing. It's a lot of words, but it's can take bit of time, but it drives the big value.","Alex Molinaroli","The other thing that we'll see benefit from is the investments in Chin and we'll start to see that benefit. But this is a long-term fixed, I mean with the cycles of this business, we have to get these things approved and if it's mid-cycle, that's even tougher, so we'll see improvement, but it is going to take a lot of to get to our standard products.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank","And just to clarify, at one point, Alex, you had said or the company had said there was a bit of an offsetting trend in that division as some customers were kind of changing the way they were purchasing, moving more towards components away from systems. Is it safe to assume that that's basically kind of played out at this point and that now there is a mostly operational positive that you can affect as opposed to kind of market negatives that you have to deal with?","Alex Molinaroli","Well, I guess, the comment before was that we think our strategy was right. And we think our execution has been suspect and tough, but we had the right strategy. And I think that was the context of the comment. I do think our customers have picked their way and it's different in different parts of the world, but for the most part component sourcing is where our customers are going. So I guess, I would agree overall with what was your comment.","Glen Ponczak","We're out of time, Alex, couple of closing remarks.","Alex Molinaroli","The only thing I'd like to do is first is I did say it earlier, but most importantly I want to make sure we thank our employees. Our employees have been under a lot of stress over the last couple of years as we've tried to deal with the market conditions. And we're starting to see the results and I'm very proud of what they've accomplished. And so I want to make sure I mention that. And then last we have a lot to talk about. It will be more detailed, more talks, more strategically in December. So hopefully we'll see you folks in December 18, in New York, because I think it will be a good meeting.","Glen Ponczak","Thanks, everybody."],"12535":["Johnson Controls International Plc (NYSE:JCI) Q4 2016 Earnings Call November  8, 2016 11:00 AM ET","Executives","Antonella Franzen - Johnson Controls International Plc","Alex A.

Your lines have been placed on listen-only, until the question-and-answer session. This conference is being recorded, if you have any objections, please disconnect at this time.","I will turn the call over to Antonella Franzen, Vice President of Investor Relations.","Antonella Franzen - Johnson Controls International Plc","Good morning and thank you for joining our conference call to discuss Johnson Controls' fourth quarter fiscal 2016 results. The press release and all related tables issued earlier this morning, as well as the conference call slide presentation can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website at johnsoncontrols.com.","With me today are Johnson Controls' Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Alex Molinaroli; President and Chief Operating Officer, George Oliver; and our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Brian Stief.","Before we begin, I would like to remind you that during the course of today's call, we will be providing certain forward-looking information. We ask that you view today's press release and read through the forward-looking cautionary informational statements that we've included there.","In addition, we will use certain non-GAAP measures in our discussion, and we ask that you read through the sections of our press release that address the use of these items. In discussing our segment operations during the call references to adjusted EBIT margins, exclude transaction, integration, and separation costs, as well as other special items. This metric is a non-GAAP measure and is reconciled in the schedules attached to our press release.","In addition to our earnings release issued this morning, we filed an 8-K, which contains quarterly pro forma fiscal 2016 financials for Johnson Controls Plc. The pro forma financials represent the combination of Johnson Controls, excluding Adient and Tyco, including conforming accounting adjustments and recurring purchase accounting, to provide you a comparable basis for our reporting in fiscal 2017.","The purpose of this call is to discuss the quarterly results for the fourth quarter. If you have any questions regarding the pro formas, please contact me after the call.","Now, let me quickly recap this quarter's reported results. On a GAAP basis, which includes one month of Tyco, sales of $10.2 billion in the quarter, increased 17% year-over-year on a reported basis, driven primarily by the contribution from the Hitachi joint venture as well as Tyco.","Earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to Johnson Controls' ordinary shareholders was a loss of $1.61 and included net charges of $2.82 related to special items. These special items were primarily composed of non-cash mark-to-market pension\/post-retirement and settlement losses, transaction, integration and separation costs, restructuring charges and tax expense related to the Adient spin-off.","Adjusting for special items and excluding the Tyco results, non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $1.21 per share, compared to $1.04 in the prior-year quarter.","In order to remove the complexity associated with the closure of the merger with Tyco, the results discussed on today's call reflect the underlying non-GAAP operating results of legacy Johnson Controls.","Now, let me turn the call over to Alex.","Alex A. Molinaroli - Johnson Controls International Plc","Thanks, Antonella. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today on this call. Before I get into the details for the fourth quarter, I'd like to just spend a moment as I've done over the last few quarters to reflect on the commitments we made last December. Of course, we'll be making some new commitments in the upcoming December, but to reflect on how we did against those commitments throughout 2016. As you all know, there was an awful lot that happened at Johnson Controls.","Let's start on slide five of the presentation. As we started the year, we had a couple of strategic objectives we needed to achieve during the year, first, was our integration of Hitachi as you recall, first of last fiscal year we formed a joint venture with Hitachi. And I'd just like to say that the performance of the Hitachi joint-venture, the integration activities has far exceeded our expectations. And I think it's a great platform for us moving forward.","The second thing that was important to us to get accomplished, and we just accomplished this on October 31, was a spin-off of Adient. I just want to make a couple of comments about that. I was fortunate to be invited by the Adient team to be a participant at the New York Stock Exchange last Monday when they rang the bell and their first trade happened. And I couldn't be more proud to be associated with the team. And I feel great about what they have in front of them as it relates to the opportunity. Great team and I'm happy for Bruce and for all the Adient employees. And I wish them well in the future.","And then obviously, one of the most important events, clearly that's a watershed event for us, is the historic merger with Tyco, which happened a month ahead of our schedule. We'd scheduled it for October 1, and we were able to get that done a month early. And we have our legacy Tyco team members here today.","In line with our vision three years ago that we started to transform ourselves to a multi-industrial leader, I can say now we truly are a multi-industrial. We have a great position, leading positions in building technologies, integrated solutions for buildings and energy storage. And George will give you some updates on the progress that we've made so far related to the integration and sort of frame-out the organization.","Second, our financial commitments; throughout this entire process, we've had every opportunity for our folks to be distracted. And I couldn't be more proud of what they've been able to accomplish, 150 basis points of adjusted EBIT margin expansion over the last year, and most of that achieved, at least in large part due to our Johnson Controls operating system initiatives and our cost reductions.","Earnings-per-share growth 16%, and without sacrificing the continued investments we have in our business, and just to highlight a couple here on the page, we have strategic capital investments as you know expanding our AGM capacity 245 million in North America. And then, forming the joint-venture in order to add our fourth plant with Bohai Piston, which is an affiliate of BAIC in China, in order to increase our capacity there in China.","We've accomplished a tremendous amount this year in this quarter, and I just want to thank all of our employees for their hard work, it's truly remarkable. Across the globe, across all of our segments in all of our businesses, everyone really pulled together as a team.","Our transformation, coupled with our strong financial performance, allows us to enter this 2017 with great momentum. We're really positioned well to deliver \u2013 continue delivering strong results. So if you turn to slide six, I just want to reiterate, we exceeded our guidance for the fiscal fourth quarter, and then we were at the high end of our guidance for the fiscal year.","Let's go to slide seven. So we finished the year strong, both from a top-line and a bottom-line perspective. Organic growth, our sales increased 4%, if you exclude Automotive or Adient, with 2% growth in Building Efficiency, and 8% growth in Power Solutions. Building Efficiency; to give you a little bit of color on that: underlying strength in Asia, real progress in China, when we started the year we weren't sure, but as the year has gone on, China has gotten stronger and stronger. We've introduced some exciting new products in our HVAC product range around small tonnage chillers for the Asian market, and really seeing good traction there.","Another thing to really happy about is our products in North America. In our UPG business, we are actually gaining share, both in residential and light commercial, and seeing strong growth both in residential and light commercial mostly because of new product introductions there and the investments we've made over the past couple of years.","Power Solutions has benefited from strong growth across all of our regions. Start-Stop technology has grown 30% globally, that's held up over the year, and as you know, we're adding more capacity. This year we shipped over 152 million batteries, which is an increase of 4% from a unit perspective.","Lastly, an added confidence as we move into 2017, orders grew 6% in the fourth quarter, and it's a fourth consecutive growth \u2013 fourth consecutive quarter of mid-single-digit growth in orders secured. And we continue to see strength in our orders in the institutional vertical markets, and that is on a tough comparison. We've seen growth on a year-over-year perspective here for the last couple years.","Turn to slide eight. I just want to remind you this excludes any results from Tyco. Revenues in the quarter increased by 7% to $9.4 billion. If you take-out FX and M&A, the overall revenue was level, and Brian will give you more detail business-by-business.","Profitability, we continue to show improvement year-over-year with all of our \u2013 across each and every one of our businesses with the segment income adjusted up 16%. Our adjusted margins expanded 90 basis points overall for the quarter, EPS up 16% to $1.21. And I couldn't \u2013 I think as Brian goes through the numbers, I think you'll see that we had strength in almost all of our regions and in each of our businesses, so great performance.","With this, I'm going to turn it over to George, and he will give you an update on how we're doing with integration.","George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc","Thanks, Alex, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start by thanking and congratulating, both the legacy JCI and legacy Tyco teams for all of their hard work and dedication over the last nine plus months. Our integration teams, working with our employees across the globe, have put in countless hours and an enormous effort to put us in a position to complete the merger a month ahead of schedule, so that we could hit the ground running in September.","We have moved firmly into the execution phase of our Day One plan. And although, we're only two months into the process, I'm encouraged by what I'm seeing, including some very early traction on our $1 billion cost synergy commitment, as laid out on slide nine. We'll update you in more detail and provide some timing around synergy achievement at our upcoming Analyst Day on December 5.","As we have come together as one team, it has become more and more apparent to me that the two organizational cultures have more similarities than differences, as I've seen that in nearly every region of business I visited within my first 60 days. In the marketplace, we continue to receive positive feedback from our customers and channel partners, and I can tell you they are just as excited about this combination as we and all of our employees are.","Turning to slide 10, we will be organized around two strategic platforms: Buildings and Power. The Buildings platform represents a combination of the legacy Building Efficiency businesses within Johnson Controls and the legacy Tyco businesses. Together, these businesses will generate roughly $23 billion in annual sales and consists of several well-known and trusted brands across complex HVAC, building controls and fire and security systems. We are well-positioned in the building, with one of the broadest portfolios of products, integrated solutions, and service offerings in the market. We are also uniquely positioned with our customers and channel partners with a large installed base and significant scale in the direct channel.","Going forward as one company, we will be able to leverage that global scale to expand our installed base as well as our market reach. And as the technology convergence in the building evolves, we'll be prepared to lead the way.","The Power platform includes a portfolio of leading battery technologies across the product technology continuum, with number-one positions in conventional lead acid and AGM Start-Stop batteries globally. Our Power Solutions business has a large and resilient aftermarket business with consistent performance and growth throughout the cycle.","I look forward to providing you more details on our strategic growth plans across the portfolio on December 5 at the Analyst Day.","Let me now turn it over to Brian to walk through the financial details of the quarter.","Brian J. Stief - Johnson Controls International Plc","Thanks, George, and good morning, everyone. As you saw in our release this morning, our Q4 reported results, as expected, were a bit noisy and included a number of special items which resulted in a net charge of $2.82 in the quarter. We've summarized those adjustments for you in an appendix. But just given their overall size, let me briefly comment on each of them.","First of all, transaction, integration and separation cost of $293 million. Those costs relate primarily to the Adient separation and the Tyco merger and were in-line with our expectations.","We also had a restructuring charge in the quarter related to asset impairments as well as some workforce reductions. And the way you should view that, as outlined in the appendix, is about half of that charge is cash and the other half is non-cash. And it's really spread ratably across the businesses and corporate.","We also have, as we always do in the fourth quarter, a mark-to-market pension adjustment given the accounting method that we use. That adjustment was $514 million in the fourth quarter, related primarily to a decline in interest rates year-over-year.","There were also some non-recurring purchase accounting items of $74 million. A good example of that would be the requirement to step-up inventory to fair value in the opening balance sheet, and that turns out as that inventory turns. That we've called out separately at $74 million. And then there was $1.1 billion charge related to the Adient separation.","As I talk through the business results, I'll exclude the impact of the special items as well as the Tyco results since they were not included in our previous guidance of $1.17 to $1.20. Similarly, we've got the Hitachi joint venture, which closed in October of 2015, and so the Hitachi JV does impact the quarter-over-quarter comparability, and I'll comment on that as I go through the results. And then for the first time, the Automotive Interiors joint venture, which closed in July of last year, we do have comparability in Q4 this year versus Q4 last year as it relates to the Interiors JV.","So with that, let me turn to slide 11, Building Efficiency. Their fourth quarter sales were $3.6 billion, which were up 25% from the prior year. If you adjust for the impacts of M&A and FX, the sales grew 2% and had a strong comparable 2015 quarter, which saw a 5% growth rate.","Revenues in our Systems and Services North America business were level year-over-year, and we saw a good growth in our Residential business and Products North America of 3%, and as Alex mentioned, Asia was up 8%, ex-Hitachi.","We had good order growth in the quarter, up 6%, and as Alex mentioned, it's the fourth consecutive quarter where we saw order growth above the 5% level. Systems and Services North America was up 6%, Products North America was up 7% due primarily to growth in our Residential business, and Asia was up 7%. Our backlog ended the year at $4.8 billion, a 5% year-over-year improvement.","Turning to segment income at Building Efficiency, it was up 17% year-over-year due primarily to the contribution of the Hitachi JV entities and the North America Residential business in Asia. And as expected, in the fourth quarter, we did see a 80 basis point reduction from the prior-year quarter to 11.3%. That was due primarily to mix related to the lower-margin Hitachi joint venture and some ongoing product and sales force investments we made. If you kind of step back and look at the full year as far as Building Efficiency margins, we ended the year up with 9.2% from 9.1% last year. And that was far in excess of the guidance that we provided in December of last year at our Analyst Day.","Moving to slide 12, real quickly touching on the Tyco results, which as you know, that merger was completed on September 2. Sales for the month of September were $828 million and segment EBIT was $86 million. That $86 million does include $21 million of recurring purchase accounting amortization, so if you adjust for that, the EBIT of $107 million reflects about a 13% loss in the quarter. And I'd say overall, as we look at the Tyco businesses moving into fiscal 2017, they've got solid momentum.","Turning to slide 13 on Power Solutions, they just had another great quarter. Their sales were up 7% compared to last year, 8% if you adjust for foreign-exchange and lead. And in terms of units, we saw higher volumes across all regions, with global fourth quarter shipments up 7%. Asia was up 22%, Europe was up 11%, and the Americas were up 3%.","As far as Start-Stop shipments, they continued to be strong, up 30% year-over-year, growing from 3.1 million units to 4 million units. And all regions delivered higher year-on-year growth with China up 136%, albeit on a very low base. Americas up 87% in a growing market, and EMEA is up 3% in a very mature market. We also saw Q4 OE up 2% and aftermarket up 9%, again strong showing.","If you look at Power Solutions segment EBIT for the quarter of $394 million, it was up 16%, primarily driven by the higher unit volumes, product mix and cost reduction efforts.","There was segment margins in Q4 were up 160 basis points and were well above our expectations for the year. For the year, we had 19% margins and we had guided in December to 17%. So another great year for Power Solutions.","Touching quickly on slide 14 on the Auto business: Their sales were down 5%, the higher volumes in Asia were offset by lower volumes in North America and Europe. As far as China, we did see the 100% sales numbers for our non-consolidated JVs, up 26% in the quarter to $2.9 billion and if you adjust for foreign-exchange that was actually 31% compared to industry production of 21%. So the JVs continue to perform exceptionally well. For the quarter, Automotive segment EBIT of $281 million, up 13% year-over-year, and overall Auto margins were 7.1%, up 110 basis points for the quarter.","So, let's move to the financial highlights on slide 15. Overall fourth-quarter revenues were up 7% to $9.4 billion, that was primarily driven by the Hitachi JV, offset by some headwinds for FX. If you look at gross margin for the quarter, it was up 90 basis points to 20.5%, and as Alex mentioned, we continue to see the benefits of the Johnson Controls operating system efforts on a global basis.","SG&A was up 13% from last year. If you remove the impact of Hitachi joint ventures, the SG&A is actually down 4% year-over-year, and I think this is really reflective of the continued focus that we have on right-sizing our cost structure in connection with the Adient spin-off.","Equity income of $150 million was up 43%. That was due primarily to the Interiors joint venture, which added about $8 million year-over-year, and the Hitachi JV with $30 million.","So overall, a great fourth-quarter with double-digit EBIT growth at 16%, and segment margins improving to 11.6%, which is a 90 basis point improvement.","Turning to slide 16, fourth-quarter net financing charges of $77 million were slightly higher than last year, due primarily to the portion of the Adient debt proceeds that we drew on in the quarter. Tax rate remained at 17%, and the non-controlling interest was up $40 million, due primarily to the Hitachi joint venture entities.","So as Alex mentioned, diluted earnings per share of $1.21 was up 16%, and I too give a lot of credit to our management teams globally to continue to focus on our external financial commitments that we've made in a period when it would be pretty easy to point to the transformational activities and other initiatives that we've got in our businesses being a distraction. So, well done to our global teams.","On slide 17, balance sheet and cash flow at quarter-end. Our net debt-to-cap ratio was 39.4%, which is right in-line with expectations. We do have kind of a grossed up balance sheet at the end of this fiscal year, primarily related to the $2.2 billion of debt we assumed in connection with the Tyco merger. In addition, there was the $4 billion of newly issued debt in connection with the merger, the cash of which went to the JCI shareholders. And this balance sheet that you have at September 30, includes $3.5 billion of debt related to Adient, and there's $2 billion of cash in escrow, $1.5 billion which will be retained by JCI, and $0.5 billion has gone to Adient as of October 31.","Our cash flow in the quarter was $900 million, which exceeded our expectations, and for the year adjusted free cash flow was $1.7 billion versus a plan of $1.5 billion. So I was pleased with the progress we made there in fiscal 2016. And CapEx was pretty much in-line with expectations.","Just a waterfall chart on slide 18, to kind of show you the pro forma net debt; you can see we started at the $16.4 billion and the $3.5 billion of debt that went with the Adient spin on October 31. We have net cash of $700 million at the end of the year, and then we will have $1.5 billion of the $2 billion in escrow come to us. So our true pro forma net debt position as we move forward is $10.7 billion, which is right in-line with where we expected after the transformational activities.","Before we open it up for questions, I'd just like to take a couple minutes here on slide 19 and talk about items of interest as we move into fiscal 2017. First of all, as we've talked about throughout the quarters this year, even though the Adient spin-off has already occurred, from an accounting standpoint we can't report that as a discontinued operation until the date of the spin. So the first time we'll report Adient as a discontinued operation will be in Q1 of fiscal 2017, and all prior periods will be restated.","Consistent with George's comments regarding our two strategic platforms, we do plan on changing our reportable segments, probably in the later half of 2017. So within the Buildings platform, there will be more granularity that we provide as we move forward into 2017, and we'll talk about that a bit more at our Analyst Day on December 5.","We're also going to report corporate as a stand-alone segment and we think that's going to provide better transparency to our underlying business unit margins, and the overall level of corporate costs. We will also finalize the Tyco purchase accounting. As of September 30, 2016, we've done a preliminary allocation based upon some preliminary work done by our outside valuation firm. There will be some true ups to that as we move through the first half of fiscal 2017.","We'll continue to have some restructuring, and impairment and integration costs as well as our Q4 pension mark-to-market in 2017. But I think those will be communicated as far as range and expected costs, again on December 5.","As Antonella mentioned, we did file a Form 8-K this morning, which shows the fiscal 2016 quarterly and full-year EPS numbers on a pro forma basis. The full-year is $2.31 and that includes about $0.31 of annual consolidated amortization expense.","So on slide 20, to wrap up here, please join us on December 5 at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel in New York for our Analyst day, and at that meeting we will present our Q1 and full fiscal 2017 guidance.","And with that, Antonella, we can turn it over for questions.","Antonella Franzen - Johnson Controls International Plc","Thanks, Brian. Operator, could you please provide the instructions for asking questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question is from the line of Deane Dray from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and congratulations on getting to the finish line and then starting your next marathon as well.","Antonella Franzen - Johnson Controls International Plc","Thanks.","Alex A. Molinaroli - Johnson Controls International Plc","Thank you","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","The slides were real helpful as were the 8-K just to kind of sort us through the changes. And maybe just for the legacy Tyco analysts like myself, George, can give us a perspective on the quarter consistent with the metrics that we are used to seeing on organic revenue growth orders and so forth?","George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc","Sure, Deane, let me just give you a high-level summary. Certainly, as the year played out we saw a continued softness in the high-hazard heavy industrial end markets, and that had a fairly significant impact on our product businesses as they played out for the year. That does impact about 35% of our revenues in that segment, and certainly these are high-margin businesses. Overall though, the orders for Tyco were up low single-digits so we continue to expand orders. The backlog year-on-year is up 4%, which does position us well here to get out to a good start in 2017.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","And then, Alex, this might be a good question for the Analyst Day, but your comment that the transformation is complete, certainly, JCI is \u2013 has arrived as a multi-industry company, but the idea is portfolio optimization never ends. And where do you think \u2013 at the margin do you expect portfolio moves over the next year or so?","Alex A. Molinaroli - Johnson Controls International Plc","Yeah, so that's a good question. So I'm not sure if I had an adjective in there or not. At the margin, we're going to be looking at our portfolio. That's not going to change. But I think that the comment that I made was the major transformation to get us to a platform that we can truly call ourselves a multi-industrial is complete. I mean, and I think that probably means more to the legacy Johnson Controls people that had followed us, because we've gone through this transformation over the last three years, and if you've been a spectator, it's been quite a transformation.","I think where we are as we're in a position we can truly call ourselves a multi-industrial now. Now we have to \u2013 that just means \u2013 I think you just said it a minute ago that it's the new marathon begins. And portfolio optimization is not going to be something that's going to be lost on us. We're looking at our \u2013 actively looking at our portfolio both in the legacy Johnson Controls and legacy Tyco businesses, and that will continue. And we'll talk a lot about that, or at least we'll talk some about it in December, as it relates to not only capital allocation, but strategically how we want to position ourselves. So more to come on that.","But if I left you to believe that we are done, that's not correct. I think I want to make sure that you understand, everyone understands, particularly our employees, that we've got ourselves now positioned where we need us to be as a true multi-industrial. The Automotive business is set-up to be successful, and I think now we have a platform for us to optimize...","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great to hear. Yeah, that's \u2013 I appreciate that. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Jeffrey Sprague from Vertical Research Partners. Your line is now open.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Antonella Franzen - Johnson Controls International Plc","Good morning.","Alex A. Molinaroli - Johnson Controls International Plc","Hey, Jeff.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Just some questions really kind of on the numbers so we're just kind of level-set here, because I think we're not getting a lot on forward guidance. But first, just on the amortization, maybe it's for Brian. It looks like the deal-related amortization came in on the low side of what was expected. Can you provide a little bit more color on what drove that, and if that number is likely to move around some more?","Brian J. Stief - Johnson Controls International Plc","Yeah, I don't think that number is going to move around now significantly. I think we're pretty well grounded with the valuation firm we're working with relative to the amortizable intangible asset base. So I think the number that's out there in the pro formas is a pretty solid number as we look at it going forward.","You're right, it did come down from the preliminary filings that were made. I think it came down roughly $100 million or so; I'm probably rounding there. But that had to do really with the original information that was provided to the outside firm. As you go through that process of finalizing a valuation, there's tweaks you make to it based upon variations in earnings levels by geography, and what ended up happening as a result of some of those changes we made, some of the amortizable asset base came down as far as intangibles, and it really got reallocated to either indefinite-lived intangibles or to goodwill. So I think that number where it stands right now, Jeff, is a pretty good number to use. And that number will be with us for a while because the life associated with those amortizable assets is anywhere from 10 years to 15 years, so that's a pretty good number.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay. And then \u2013 thank you very much for that detail. And then also just on the baseline number of $2.31, I believe stranded costs would be conceptually in that number. Can you give us a sense of what that is, and how rapidly that could come down, or what we should think about that?","Brian J. Stief - Johnson Controls International Plc","Yeah, I mean, the stranded costs number that we've kind of been talking about related to the Adient spin-off. It was about $150 million, and I think a little over half of that was taken out in fiscal 2016, so it's already reflected in the results. The other half will come out during fiscal 2017, and it's really part of the $300 million of productivity that we've talked about that will be recognized over the next three years as part of the JCOS benefits that we're going to realize. So I think that's the way to think about that, Jeff.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Thanks. And if I could just sneak one more bigger-picture in. George, you mentioned kind of just an early traction on cost synergies. I'm just also wondering early reaction from customers on the sale side, I doubt you have some big marquee order to share with us today, but how is the sales funnel looking? And do you guys see some early traction on that effort?","George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc","Sure, Jeff. As you know, and Alex and I've talked a lot about this. We had an outstanding integration team put together over the last 10 months and they've done some great planning work and now we're into the implementation phase. Revenue growth is a key component of the merger, and we've had commercial teams across the globe laying out the existing customer bases, how we serve them today, the opportunity that we have to be able to cross-sell and serve them with more of our portfolio. Build services and how we create additional value for those customers that we serve. And we feel really good about the planning process, and now we're putting in the right incentives so that no matter where our commercial people sit across the globe, they are going to be properly incentivized to be able to bring the new capabilities to their customer base, and to be able to drive growth.","We're going to lay this out in a lot more detail at the Analyst Day in December, but we are certainly feeling very good about this because this, certainly, was a key component of the merger to be able to accelerate the ability to be able to serve customers, being able to capitalize on the full portfolio, being able to converge some of the technology to be able to longer-term change the game, and how we serve buildings. And I feel really good about the progress we've made.","Brian J. Stief - Johnson Controls International Plc","Hey, Jeff, I'd just add as Alex said, you know we had an opportunity to work on this almost in a lab environment for nine months, so it wasn't real except for the fact that we had a chance to visit with customers. And what I've seen happen with the integration teams over the last couple of months, it's gone from an idea to a reality, and I've seen a lot of confidence building in our team. As we get an opportunity to meet with the integration team and now moving into the business. George put together an organization that's going to activate it, he talked about incentives, I know he'll talk about that. But I'm actually really pleased with what I see.","One of the things I didn't mention earlier, I'm just going to sneak in, it doesn't have anything to do with this question, but it relates to being able to get synergies. We've actually seen almost $100 million in revenue \u2013 in secured the CBRE relationship, and we've learned a lot. It's not the same, but we've learned a lot in being able to pull-through activities from activities like that. So I think our team is seeing those things too, and that gives them confidence. I think we're going to be pleasantly surprised. Obviously, we've got to secure it before we revenue it, but I think in December, we'll maybe have a couple of those stories we can share with you.","Alex A. Molinaroli - Johnson Controls International Plc","Yeah. And your questions about customers, I've met with a number of customers in my first 60 days here with the integration, and they're very excited about the combined capabilities and our ability to be able to better serve them on combining the work that we do across our channels.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Gautam Khanna with Cowen and Company. Your line is now open.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC","Good morning, guys. Congratulations.","Antonella Franzen - Johnson Controls International Plc","Good morning, Gautam","Alex A. Molinaroli - Johnson Controls International Plc","Good morning, Gautam.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC","I have three quick questions. First, I was wondering, at the Investor Day do you plan to lay out multi-year targets, revenue and EPS like you used to at Tyco?","George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc","Well, I can't speak about Tyco. But we will give you some \u2013 we'll give you some ongoing metrics that you can look at that you can hold us accountable to, hold ourselves accountable to, which I think, look, based on what I've seen in the past, very similar to what we've done at Johnson Controls Investor Day. So you will get something that gives you guidance on each aspect, whether it'd be cost reductions, productivity, top-lines, bottom-line. It will give you some guidance on how we're thinking about capital allocation also.","Alex A. Molinaroli - Johnson Controls International Plc","I think we will probably give pretty solid focus on fiscal 2017, and then we will give medium-term guidance relative to key financial metrics, sales growth, segment EBIT growth et cetera. And that's reasonably consistent with what JCI has done historically as well. So you'll be able to kind of take it through 2020 based upon the way we're doing things.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. That would be helpful. And the second question was on Power Solutions and the strong growth you experienced in the quarter. Was there any one-time affect in the quarter? Or is this what we should be anticipating going forward in terms of organic growth based on the mix shifting to AGM and what have you?","George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc","Well, I think the unit growth, I don't really think about it quarter-to-quarter because there are \u2013 depending on \u2013 a lot of times it depends on pricing and stocking. A quarter can move around a little bit. But I think what you've seen if you look at our average growth across the year, I think that's really consistent. I think when you look at it quarter-to-quarter, it's a little bit dangerous as each one of our customers is either filling their channel getting ready for the season, or finishing the season and sometimes that doesn't happen the same quarter after quarter. But if you look on an annual basis I think it's fairly consistent, which is around 5%, and I think that's probably a pretty good number. And the mix is obviously going to help us because it's more and more AGM and of course, a lot of our capacity is moving into China, so it's going to be heavily focused on Asia growth.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC","All right. Thank you. And lastly, I was wondering, maybe you gave us this before, but what is the dividend for the go-forward company?","George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc","We didn't get into that. (40:02)","Brian J. Stief - Johnson Controls International Plc","That will be approved by our board at the November meeting, and it's still under review. So we don't have the go-forward dividend for 2017 established yet. We'll be announcing that at the Analyst Day, as well.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC","All right. Thanks a lot. I'll turn it over.","George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Steven Winoker from Bernstein. Your line is now open","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thanks. Good morning, and congrats on the milestone, everybody.","Antonella Franzen - Johnson Controls International Plc","Thanks, Steve.","George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc","Thanks, Steve","Alex A. Molinaroli - Johnson Controls International Plc","Thank you.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","So I just wanted to maybe start with getting a little more granularity, if I could, on the HVAC side, and specifically YORK equipment as opposed to services, resi versus non-resi. Can you just give us some color for the quarter of what was the organic growth in that business that you saw, resi, non-resi in the Americas maybe?","Alex A. Molinaroli - Johnson Controls International Plc","Why do you ask? We had a great quarter. I'll put it in units. Our residential unit growth was 23%, which is outstanding. Now we have a lot of new products to come out. We also announced some pricing that's going to be effective the first of November. So I'd have to say that, I'm sure some of that impacted it, but what we're seeing is an awful lot of growth in both residential and our light commercial growth was in the upper teens also, from unit perspective. And that's really a benefit from a lot of the product investments we've been making over the last couple years, and then we've also been making some investments in some of our channel structures. So great quarter, gained share. Glad you asked the question","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","And the second part of that question was non-resi?","Alex A. Molinaroli - Johnson Controls International Plc","Non-resi in the unitary was close to 17%","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","And applied?","Alex A. Molinaroli - Johnson Controls International Plc","Around 4%","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. Specifically, on the applied side for, maybe large absorption chillers, are you seeing large project activity picking up on the bid front?","Alex A. Molinaroli - Johnson Controls International Plc","We're seeing project activity because that would be in line with our SSNA channel in North America where we're seeing weakness is in the Middle East and Europe, particularly as it relates to when it's starts moving toward the energy-related markets is where we're seeing some weakness. So we're seeing strength in China. We're seeing steady as she goes in North America, and having, just like, the rest of the market, almost a near collapse when you think about the Middle East because of the energy-related part of the market. And then of course that bleeds into our industrial refrigeration. So a lot of the gains that we are getting are being offset by industrial refrigeration and some of the toughness in the Middle East market.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","That's really helpful and sounds good. Secondly, on CapEx and cash. Maybe just a little bit of picture or you may defer this to December, but how should we think about in Georgia, also, as you're starting to look across the organization, how that CapEx may pace down over years or how working capital may improve on maybe the combined business? A little color there would be helpful.","George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc","Yeah. We ended the year with CapEx right at $1.250 billion which is what we planned for. The current year included in that number. Round numbers was about $300 million or $350 million related to the Automotive business. And if you look at Tyco's historic CapEx, it's in that $300 million to $350 million range, as well. So I think in the near-term here we don't see a significant reduction in CapEx. I think a number between $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion will probably be steady-state for us for the next two or three years as we ramp up some of the investments that Alex talked about in the Power Solutions business. That does give us a reinvestment ratio that's probably around 1.5 times or thereabouts. And so we recognize it's probably a bit higher, but I also would tell you that the growth investments we're making have good business case financial metrics associated with them.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","All right. Great. We'll leave the rest for December. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Julian Mitchell from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi. Thank you. I just wanted to start with the Building Efficiency organic sales growth. You'd called out that the EMEA region was very soft in line with other companies. But if we look at the North America Systems and Service specifically, sort of flattish sales there and I think that did drag down the global organic sales average a little bit. Did you see any delays in customer conversion of orders into revenues? Or it's just sort of classic kind of lumpiness and we should expect that revenue number in North America Systems and Service to accelerate soon?","George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc","Yeah, I think we had a pretty strong comparable last year in North America, but I do think it's just project flow. There's nothing that you would look inside there and see an aberration. The orders are strong; backlog's up. So I don't expect that that's something to be concerned about. I think it's probably, as you just said, just the timing of projects themselves. Nothing sticks out as being unusual.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thanks. And then related to that, you called out the strength in some of the institutional buildings verticals.","George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc","Yes.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Remind us, I guess how much of your Building Efficiency segment is institutional?","George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc","Well over half. Probably two-thirds of our Buildings business is institutional related. And just to remind you, when we say that, that would be the government verticals, healthcare, and education.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thanks. And then secondly would just be on the Power business. Very good incremental margins, 40%, 45% or so. Could you remind us where we are on the cost build-out within China? On and off in the past 18 months, that has been a headwind on your EBIT margin within Power. Was there any kind of one-time factor driving that down in Q4? Or you think that the margin headwind from China is kind of behind you largely in Power?","George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc","Well, we're going to continue to launch plants. So I think that what you \u2013 instead of what I \u2013 if you look at China and you separated it, what you'd see because we're adding capacity obviously is \u2013 because of launch costs, it's going to be a lower margin than other regions. But I think the right way to think about it is the plant economics are no different in China than anywhere else. And so we're getting good economics, but we also have the launch costs that are in. And they're going to be there for a while. But as we continue to add, as our capacity increases, it becomes a much smaller percentage of the overall cost structure. But launch costs in that business are fairly significant. It takes a while to launch those products.","Some of the quirkiness of the China market as it relates to the testing required to go-to-market. And then of course, having a plant that's got open capacity also has some cost. But I would say that the plant economics, which is probably the most important thing, are really no different in China than anywhere else.","Brian J. Stief - Johnson Controls International Plc","I think our EBIT margins of 19% for fiscal 2016 were pretty strong relative to what we expected. But I think if you look at the investments that we're making in Power Solutions in China over the next two years to three years, there will be a bit of drag on margins simply because of the launch costs that Alex referred to. But we'll actually be providing both 2017 and guidance through 2020 on Power Solutions margins on December 5.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Joshua Pokrzywinski from Buckingham Research Group. Your line is now open.","Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Hi. Good morning, guys.","George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc","Good morning.","Antonella Franzen - Johnson Controls International Plc","Good morning.","Alex A. Molinaroli - Johnson Controls International Plc","Good morning.","Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Just a follow-up on couple of the questions on your non-resi businesses, particularly in legacy JCI. Alex, I think there's been a lot of debate around where we're at in the non-resi cycle. Clearly, institutional verticals are a little later positioned than some of the other ones. But can you just talk about the lead time and the visibility and the \u2013 maybe the percentage of revenue that you have booked for 2017, just to give people some comfort about the level of visibility, kind of the long-cycle nature of that business as we stand here today?","Alex A. Molinaroli - Johnson Controls International Plc","Yeah, so the good news about our business is that it's late cycle and the bad news, it's late cycle. In this particular case it's good news, because as we build our backlog, typically our projects are more complex, larger in late cycle. So our position is probably \u2013 we're probably in a better \u2013 it was tougher for us to get to this point, but probably in a better position than we have been because if you look six months, nine months out, our business is fairly predictable just because of the nature of the type of projects that we have. And so if you look at the flow rates of our projects, on average you're talking 9 months to 12 months. And it's pretty easy for us to see six months to nine months out. And then we look at our forelog, which is our pipeline, we can pretty much look at the next quarter and see what we can expect. So I think that we feel, if you look at it from a FY 2017 perspective, I think we have pretty good visibility in North America.","Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Great. And then, just following-up on some of the stranded costs questions. I understand that JCOS productivity has been aimed to bring those down. I think it was $100 million a year that we should expect. Brian talked about $75 million of leftover stranded in the next year that, that comes out. Does that come out on a run rate basis or does it actually come out in $75 million lower. I'm not trying to put too fine a point on it, but it seems like this has been a source of confusion.","George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc","Yeah, I think the $300 million I referred to is $100 million over each of the next three years and we took out a little bit more than half of the $150 million in 2016 and the remaining piece is really part of the productivity $100 million that's embedded in the 2017 plan that we'll present December 5. So it's part of the productivity piece that's been out there given the fact we knew that we were going to be spinning Adient.","Alex A. Molinaroli - Johnson Controls International Plc","Probably the way to think about it is, because you take out $75 million last year, take out $75 million on stranded costs, whether it's an exit rate or ongoing rate, you probably at a zero-sum game here because you've got last year's costs benefiting this year, and this year's costs benefiting next year. So I think you can \u2013 I know that you \u2013 probably a little more detail and we'll give it to you, but I would think it's going to be fairly consistent with what we've seen over the last year.","Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","That's helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Evelyn Chow - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi. Good morning, guys. This is actually Evelyn Chow on behalf of Joe. Maybe just starting with Power for a minute. Your EBIT was very strong and represents a much higher-level of EBIT dollars than you've historically achieved in 4Q. Can you just help give us a sense of what were the headwinds and tailwinds you saw on the margin line? Maybe the lower lead prices, potentially as some mix shift from the better aftermarket and start-stop growth. A little color there would be helpful.","George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc","Yeah, a lot of time when we give you the numbers \u2013 I think when we gave you numbers, we were trying to make sure we take out the effect of lead. Lead is, right now, it's about where it was last year but it's been a round trip that's gone down and it's back up to about where it was a year ago at this time. So I think that that's probably not much of a change year-on-year if I think of it intuitively. One of the things that is obviously a tailwind, is the more AGM Start-Stop batteries we sell, the better. The second thing that's happened is that, we're seeing some really strong growth in the market in North America, particularly.","I think what the people inside the business call is an echo of five years ago when the OE build started, we're starting to see the aftermarket from that grow and registrations pick up. So we're seeing some strength in North America which is good for us. We do well when we're able to run at capacity and then Start-Stop in China, and China aftermarket growth has been incredibly strong this year, which is something that we had always planned for, but we're just really pleased to see it happen.","Evelyn Chow - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Understood. And then maybe...","George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc","Lots of tail \u2013 a lot of headwinds, not tailwinds.","Evelyn Chow - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Makes sense. And then maybe a similar question on the Building Efficiency side. I think you've called out some investments both this quarter and in prior quarters, too. I guess I just want to get a sense of what the puts and takes are on the margins and maybe a little bit more context around the year-over-year decline that you saw in the business on the margin line.","George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc","So as Brian talked about the specific margins for the quarter, but to give you overall what's happening. First off, we knew that Hitachi was going to be a drag on our overall margins in general because of the lower margin business. However, Hitachi is doing better than we expected, but it's still dilutive. So that's one of the things that's kind of fighting us on a year-on-year basis. Brian can give you some more specific color, but the investments that we've been making, two specific investments, some in our product ranges, you know, there's been refrigerant changes, plus, as many of you may know, over the last few years, we've had to catch up on some investments in our UPG business, light commercial and residential. We're seeing the benefit from those investments now. And then we've made significant investments in just sales head count over the last year. So those are the three buckets of investments.","Brian, you might want to give a little bit of color on the margins.","Brian J. Stief - Johnson Controls International Plc","Yeah, I mean, the margins for the year at Building Efficiency were 9.2%, and that's a 10 basis point improvement. But I think what you're referring to is it was pretty choppy quarter-to-quarter. I think in the first quarter for Building Efficiency, we had a 50 basis point improvement. Second quarter, we were down 50 basis points. Third quarter, we were up 90 basis points, and fourth quarter here that you're referring to is the 80 basis point decline. So it's been choppy.","And a lot of that has to do with the timing of when we're making some of these product and sales force investments and also the timing of some new product launches. And in particular, in the fourth quarter, there was some new product launches that impacted the basis points reduction in the quarter.","So I think to step back and look at it, I think you really should look at it on a full-year basis and say we improved 10 basis points versus what we thought going into the year. We thought our margins were going to be in the 8.1% to 8.3% range, so I think the folks at BE are actually pretty happy with where they ended up margin-wise.","Alex A. Molinaroli - Johnson Controls International Plc","Yeah. And what I would say is we did that and we didn't jeopardize any of our investments. We made the investments we needed to so to not only help us with the growth that we're seeing now, but allow us to position ourselves well for the future. And so I think being able to get those margins and maintain our investments and our product investments, I feel good about.","Evelyn Chow - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks, guys. I'll get back in queue.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Shannon O'Callaghan from UBS. Your line is now open.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","Good morning.","Antonella Franzen - Johnson Controls International Plc","Good morning.","George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc","Good morning.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","In terms of cash flow, I mean, you're going to have the elevated CapEx continuing in Power. It seems like a lot of the opportunity cash conversion-wise has to come out of Building Efficiency. Can you talk about where that stands, and as you've looked at the initial integration plans, et cetera, just frame a little bit the opportunity you see for that piece of the business cash-wise?","Brian J. Stief - Johnson Controls International Plc","So, I think if you look at free cash flow adjusted for next year, and the reason I say adjusted is we've got some really choppy tax impacts that will hit us from a free cash flow standpoint in fiscal 2017. But as I step back and look at Building Efficiency, I think the opportunities for improvement are probably in the \u2013 geographically in certain pockets in the accounts receivable area.","I do think there might be some opportunities in Power Solutions in the inventory area, and I think on a combined basis, as we look at Tyco and JCI together and kind of put together the JCOS operating system embedded across the organization, I think there's going to be some working capital opportunities there as well for legacy JCO (57:48) and Tyco combined. So I mean, I guess when we look at fiscal 2017, it's going to be choppy, but on an adjusted basis, I think we're going to probably be in 75% to 85%.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks. And then in terms of the treatment of restructuring and special charges, I mean, there's obviously some things to be called out, but is there also sort of a pay-as-you-go restructuring or repositioning element that you are going to include? Could you just maybe clarify what's going to be in and what's going to be out of the numbers?","Brian J. Stief - Johnson Controls International Plc","I think the adjustments that we've historically made have been the tax payments, and we've had separation costs included in the adjustments, and then any other significant one-time charges. I mean, we're going to put only items that are kind of viewed by us to be material on a quarterly basis in that adjusted free cash flow number.","Antonella Franzen - Johnson Controls International Plc","Yeah. And just to clarify on the historical Tyco side, because Shannon, I think you're referring to how we typically grouped restructuring and the repositioning all into one line item. So what's reflected in the pro formas is the restructuring dollars or charges are out, but those repositioning charges that Tyco took in 2016 are part of the $2.31 pro forma.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks.","Antonella Franzen - Johnson Controls International Plc","Operator, I think we have time for maybe one more quick question.","Operator","Thank you. And our last question is from the line of Robert Barry from Susquehanna. Your line is now open.","Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for fitting me in.","Alex A. Molinaroli - Johnson Controls International Plc","Good morning, Rob.","Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Just wanted to actually follow-up on a couple of things. One is on the government vertical within North American non-resi, I know that last year in the quarter that was a pretty significant pressure. Did that snap back? Or what are you seeing in government?","Alex A. Molinaroli - Johnson Controls International Plc","Still under pressure. So if you looked across the institutional, that would be the one place, healthcare is reasonably flattish, and the government business is down, continue still down under pressure. Everything else is really strong, but we're still seeing pressure there. I don't think that is anything that's unusual to us. I think what we're seeing right now is \u2013 maybe it has to do with the environment we are in, hopefully things will free up here after today.","Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Got you. And then you talked about strength in Hitachi. I think half of that is residential air-conditioning in Japan. Is that what's doing well? Or what's growing there so well?","Alex A. Molinaroli - Johnson Controls International Plc","Yeah, I wouldn't say it's across the board, but it's in a lot of places. The Residential is doing much better than we expected. But what we are seeing is it's really quite impressive. Maybe George can even comment. He had a chance to see some of the integration activities, but on the cost side across the board we're seeing an awful lot of benefit that we've been able to bring through our integration and synergy activities. There's been some pricing actions and some channel restructuring as it relates to Residential business. There's been some new product introductions. The China business with our partner at Hisense is doing really well, and Taiwan is doing fantastic. So I would say it's not everywhere, but it's more places than not we are seeing improvement, both on the cost and on the sales side. There is still opportunity, but it's been pretty impressive.","George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc","Yeah, just a quick comment on that. I had the chance to join the team at the one-year anniversary and was very impressed with the work that's been done from an integration standpoint, deploying the JCOS across all of their business processes. As you talked about, how do we now leverage that platform in many other markets that are very attractive markets that we don't ultimately served today. And the team has got plans, detailed plans and how we take that product and truly capitalize on the growth opportunity that we see in any other markets beyond Japan. So I would tell you my first view there and I was very impressed with the team, very impressed with the performance in the first year. And truly, it's going to be a strategic platform for the future for the company.","Alex A. Molinaroli - Johnson Controls International Plc","Yeah. Been a great partner too. (1:02:06)","Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Got you. I think originally that was targeted as like a 4% to 5% Op margin, and it sounds like it's tracking well ahead of that?","George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc","Well ahead of that. It was a great investment for us, it was even better investment for Hitachi.","Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Great.

Our Chairman and CEO, Steve Roell, will give us an overview of the quarter and provide some market highlights. Afterwards Vice Chairman, Alex Molinaroli will talk about results for Power Solutions and Building Efficiency. Then Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Bruce McDonald, will talk about our mode of experience and then provide a more detailed review of our financial results. And then we will do questions-and-answers until the top of the hour.","And with that, I will turn it over to Steve.","Stephen A. Roell","Okay. Thank you, Glen. Well, good morning and thank you for joining us. As Glen mentioned, I\u2019m going to make some general comments about the business environment and our outlook and then Alex and Bruce will provide highlights on each of the business segments.","Entering the quarter we had modest expectations for our growth due to the depressed economic conditions in Europe and the softness in the non-residential building market. And while growth was hard to define, I think there are some signs we can point you today that conditions are improving in our markets. Looking first at the automotive industry, North American industry production was up 1% on the strength of passenger cars, which were up 4% and they were offset by a slight decline in light trucks.","Industry production was up 10% in China, consistent with our view that the market will have high single-digit growth at this fiscal year. As many of you know that follow the European automotive industry, it was a difficult quarter were production declined 8%. In terms of the near-term outlook for the auto industry, in Europe we expect the upcoming quarter to be down about 3% versus the 8% decline we encountered in this past quarter, comparisons continue to improve in the second half of the year in Europe, in fact by the fourth calendar quarter the current projections are that the build will be slightly higher than the prior-year.","North American production will rebound with growth of 4.4% and 6.8% respectively in the upcoming third and fourth fiscal quarters. Then finally, China production will be up 9% in the next six month period consistent with the comment I made earlier about the prospects for the full fiscal year.","Non-residential markets will improve over time. Some of you watched the recent AIA billing index and showing signs of recovering, and our pipeline activity in systems and solutions has accelerated over the last quarter. Our year-over-year comparisons for our backlog will improve throughout the remainder of the fiscal year, although admittedly we are dependant on the timing of several large solution contracts.","Power solution\u2019s doesn\u2019t really see any unusual trends. We don\u2019t see anything unusual there in terms of inventory levels or stocking patterns, core prices have stabilized and therefore we expect a fairly predictable shipping pattern over the remainder of the fiscal year.","So now turning to our second fiscal quarter sales of $10.4 billion we\u2019re 1% lower than last year, FX accounting for that decline. Our European operations in automotive and building efficiency accounted for about another 400 basis point decline in revenues. This has been offset however by the power solutions in certain business -- building efficiency businesses.","Segment income was $463 million in the quarter down from the $581 million a year ago. This was consistent with the expectations we provided in our January 2013 earnings conference call. The decline is associated with our automotive business segment which Bruce will address in his comments. And net income and EPS then reflects the decline in the segment income.","Well based on the conversations we\u2019ve had with our various businesses, recent forecast and the market outlook, we\u2019re confirming our previous guidance range for EPS of $2.60 to $2.70 for the fiscal year, and in addition in our press release you\u2019ll note that we confirmed \u2013 that we\u2019re comfortable with the current sell-side consensus estimate for our third fiscal quarter.","Last quarter I highlighted five factors that are key to our second half of the year, and I just want to review those \u2013 each of those with you. The first item is that we will benefit from the restructuring actions that we announced in the third and fourth fiscal quarters of fiscal 2012. If you recall, we took restructuring of $52 million back in Q3 of late last year and $245 million in Q4 and those benefits accelerate in the second half of our current fiscal year.","The second item is the comparison for Power Solutions business which benefits from the avoidance of, if you recall the impact of high core cost last year of the inventories we had as well as the ramp up of our South Carolina Smelting Plant.","The third item is our Building Efficiency group which will see higher margins as their cost containment efforts more than offset the impact of softer volume. If you recall Building Efficiency from a seasonal standpoint there\u2019s much higher volume in the second half and if you recall it was the second half of last year where we saw this significant margin improvements year-over-year, we expect that to be true again in this fiscal year.","The fourth item was that we continue to see improvement in our South American and metals business in automotive. We\u2019ve taken some aggressive restructuring actions in South America with the closing of several facilities and in the metals operations the improvement is a combination of commercial negotiations, lower material cost, operational improvements, lower launch cost and lower SG&A in engineering. Now that may sound like a laundry list, but really those are the cost changes that we actually monitor and have been monitoring since the beginning of the fiscal year. And they probably \u2013 our efforts will probably be evenly distributed amongst that, so you can just assume the commercial negotiations, our operational benefits, our lower SG&A in engineering and our purchasing each of those contribute about 25% of the improvement in the third and fourth quarter.","And last item that we have, which is simply the improvement in the European and stronger North American auto builds. So obviously for North American it's the higher build rates in the third and fourth quarter and in Europe it's the fact the declines are of less severe, the year-over-year comparisons are easier, okay. So those are the five items that we are confident that will provide the second half performance for us.","So with that, I\u2019m going to turn it over to Alex, who will start going through the Power Solutions Business. Alex.","Alex A. Molinaroli","Okay. Thanks Steve, good morning. Power Solutions sales were up 10%, and if you adjust for FX and lead, sales were up 7% in the quarter. OE volumes were up 7%, and the aftermarket volumes globally were up 1%. The overall quarterly shipments were up 2% in the Americas, up 14% in Asia and it was offset -- those gains were offset by a weaker Europe.","The results were favorably impacted by some strong operational performance and the ongoing benefits associated with our vertical integration or in-house lead recycling. We\u2019ve improved our pricing, and we also had a one-time favorable legal settlement in the quarter for $24 million. Just to make sure that you note that last year, we had a one-time gain of 9 million in the same quarter related to our joint venture transactions.","Segment income was up to $221 million. That's 11% from $200 million in 2012. And if you normalize the results for the legal settlement and the prior year gain, the segment income was up 3%. Lead core prices remain elevated, but they're in line with what we expect. In the third quarter, we expect to see a favorable year-on-year comparison, because if you recall last year just about when we started seeing the high lead prices.","Let's switch to building efficiency, which posted slightly higher earnings. And that's really despite some tough markets both in the institutional and construction markets which impacted the top line. For the quarter, sales were 3.5 billion. It's down 3%, down 2% if you adjust for FX. We saw revenue growth in North America Systems, it's up 2% but it was more than offset by weakness in Europe, Asia and our North American service business.","Overall, at the end of the quarter, our unexecuted backlog was 4.9 billion. That's down 6% from a year ago, higher demand in Asia offset by our energy solutions, Europe and the Middle East. Order intake in the quarter was down 10%. Let me give you a rundown geographically; 12% in the Middle East, down 12% in Asia, down 10% in North America, down 13% in Europe and that's with one region Latin America up 5%. So overall it was a tough quarter for orders. I'll come back to that in just a minute.","The segment income of 139% was 1% higher than 2012. That's 3% if you exclude the FX. The good news here is that year-over-year margins continue to increase by 10 basis points to 4%. Margin expansion in service and GWS were unfortunately offset by the market pressures that we're seeing at systems Asia and in Europe.","Some of the positive signs we are seeing is our pipeline is increasing. Steve mentioned that in his comments earlier, and so we do see that although the backlog is under pressure, we do see orders picking up in the second -- our third and fourth quarter.","With that, I'll turn it over to Bruce.","R. Bruce McDonald","Okay. Thanks Alex. Start on page 9 here in terms of auto experience, for the quarter or generally speaking our results were in line with our expectations. As some of the analysts' notes out there have reflected volumes on a global basis came in a little bit stronger than we had thought coming into the quarter, so we're pleased to see this sort of outlook in Europe stabilized and we feel pretty good about where we're headed here in Q3 and our Q4 to start to see some sequential improvements.","On the upside that we got from extra volume however was offset by a payment that we had to make to exit a distressed supplier which I'll comment on later. So just looking at revenues, we were down about 3%. That's the same with or without exchange. In terms of seating, we were down %, interiors down 3%, electronics business our sales were down 13%. That business was much more heavily exposed to Europe and in particular to some of the French OEs, so that business was overexposed to a weaker part of the market.","Look at geographic, sales versus the production levels, North America were up 7% versus the 1% increase in the market, so good over performance there. In terms of Europe, we were down 11% versus the market being down 8%. If you sort of peel that back a little bit of underperformance that we had, what you would see in there is it's really attributable to our interiors and electronics business. Electronics being more heavily exposed to the French customers and also our exposure to Volvo, which had a weak revenue quarter for us.","In terms of China, we continue to see very strong momentum here. Look at our sales in the quarter and I'm talking about both non-consolidated and consolidated, up about 31% on a year-over-year basis to 1.3 billion and we think that compares to passenger car production being up about 10%.","In terms of segment income you'll see we had a down 58%, to just a $103 million. Main issue here obviously being a lower level of profitability of our European business where we continue to struggle with some operational difficulties and lower production volumes.","Couple of things I may be sort to point out in here. If you look at the last quarter call, we talked about delays in our restructuring programs in Europe, not unplanned delays, but just the time it was taken to sort of get heads out. If you look at where we\u2019re in an overall restructuring basis, we got about 45% of our heads that we\u2019ve targeted to take out in Europe, the headcount on a year-to-date basis its down about 2,000 heads. So we\u2019re generally pleased to see how we\u2019re doing in terms of taking the actions that we committed to.","And then if you look at some of our leading launch indicators, we probably in better shape and we\u2019ve been in a long, long time. So, pretty comfortable that the initiatives that Steve referred to that we\u2019re tracking in our metals business are going to produce sustainable results we\u2019re looking for here, we\u2019re not going to slip back with some problematic launches that we have in the pipeline.","Couple of things I\u2019d \u2013 also note in the quarter, if you look at automotive we had higher engineering and launch cost. That\u2019s not really a full-year issue for us, but in the quarter its more of a timing how it faces out, that was about $17 million and we also have these distressed supplier costs about $22 million in the quarter, most of which was in our North American business.","Looking at margins, about 1.9% or 240 basis points lower than last year. Looking at our margins on a geographic basis, what you would see is North America we came in at 5% versus a 6% level last year, if you were to adjust it for the non-recurrence in these distressed supplier charge, we\u2019d be coming around 5.8% versus that 6%. Europe, we had a loss of $74 million, that represents a $31 million sequential improvement versus last year, but it\u2019s a $100 million deterioration versus where we were in the second quarter of last year and lastly Asia margins about 9.9% versus 13% last year.","Turning to the financials here, you will \u2013 you note that in our press release we talked about three non-recurring items, which in aggregate resulted in a net charge of $21 million. And in the comments that Alex just gave, we sort of talk through our \u2013 the business results excluding those, but maybe just highlight what those were we \u2013 three items as we referred to, one was a gain on the consolidation of an automotive joint venture in India. We had incremental restructuring charges which were targeted at our South America seating business, our European interiors business. We want to do more to get those businesses to a breakeven level quicker. And we took a non-cash charge to set up some tax valuations allowance against some of our operations in Brazil and Germany.","In the prior-year we also had a few non-operational items that we talked about in terms of an act on EPS, however they offset one another. So backing all those charges and talk into the columns excluding items here, we can see our revenues were down about 1%, foreign exchange generally speaking had very little impact on in terms of our top line. In terms of our gross profit we were down about 40 basis points on a year-over-year basis. What we sort of saw in there as we did see stronger margins in both Power Solutions and Building Efficiency, though these were largely offset by deterioration in our margins in our auto business in Europe.","In terms of SG&A, see SG&A level was up about 4%, about half of that is the distressed supplier payments. The rest of the increase would be around investments that we\u2019re making at innovation and some of the infrastructure in that emerging markets.","Equity income you see down, both $13 million year-over-year and you recall and as Alex comment, we had $9 million one-time gain in prior year\u2019s level. So generally speaking equity income is kind of inline with what it was last year and you can see our segment income margins at 4.4% were down about 110 basis points versus year-ago levels.","In terms of our net financing charges, they tipped up a little bit, $66 million, was 3 million higher than last year really reflecting just a little bit higher level of overall average debt levels. Tax rate in the quarter when you adjust out for the one-time items was in line with our guidance of 20% and consistent with last year. And then in terms of income attributable to non-controlling interest of lower charges, as we've talked about for the last two or three quarters, that really reflects the buyout of our minority partner in plastic that we did in the third quarter of last year. So we have one more sort of quarter of favorable year-over-year comps on this line and it will start to normalize out for us.","A few comments before we open it up for questions. I guess I'd just like to summarize some of the key messages and sort of reflect back on the quarter. So for us, Q2 really represents an inflection point. It was a tough first half of the year in terms of the year-over-year comps. We're pleased with the progress that we've made in terms of our restructuring and so pleased \u2013 we've sort of announced some other actions in Brazil and in European interiors. So we feel good about that. We confirm in our guidance here of 260 to 270 for the year and we're introducing \u2013 comfortable with that third quarter analysts' consensus estimate of $0.75.","Reasons why I think we feel so confident in terms of our outlook here in the second half is when you sort of look at it, it's really \u2013 it's going to be influenced by things that we have 100% control internally on. So we're not counting on any uptick in the back half of the year in terms of our markets. The restructuring initiatives that we need to pay dividends for us in the second half, we're tracking those closely and they're on track. If you look at our European automotive business, it's still not obviously where we like it to be but we are seeing good momentum on a monthly basis and as I referred to in the comments here, we made a $31 million improvement a quarter. We're pretty confident in terms of our outlook that we'll be able to get our European auto business to a breakeven level by the end of this year.","Look at our balance sheet, again significant year-to-date improvement in terms of our free cash flow. We've taken down our CapEx outlook. It's going to be about $1.2 billion. We've got some targeted working capital actions that we're implementing here. So if you look at between now and the end of the year, we expect to see about $1 billion reduction in net debt before we end the year. In addition to that, we're making good progress in terms of the divestiture of our electronics business. We're in the very early stages of that process. We do have multiple expressions of interest from several strategic buyers. We're not really going to comment a lot more about that, but in thinking about the next three to four months, we ought to be in a position where we can provide a little bit more clarity around what's going on there.","So with that, Glen I'll turn it over to you to open it up for questions.","Glen Ponczak","Great. Thanks, Bruce. Mica, we're ready to take the questions here. I've just been told that there's a lot of folks in the queue here wanting to ask questions, so would like to ask you to limit your questions to one and a follow-up at most. And I think everybody who's calling are professional financial analysts and you're good with numbers, so the number to think of is one. With that Mica, we'll take some questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions). Our first question is from Ravi Shanker of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley","Thanks. Good morning. I wouldn't want to incur Glen's wrath so I'll keep it strictly one. Steve or Alex, can you elaborate a little more on the decision to divest or potentially explore the divestiture of automotive electronics? I thought you actually sounded pretty enthusiastic about the opportunities in that business at your Analyst Day in December, so what changed there and also what does that mean for some of the other businesses that you have that you may potentially consider non-core? Thanks.","Stephen A. Roell","Sure. I think we'll leave our discussions specifically, Ravi, to electronics. I think we had a meeting in the September timeframe where we talked about looking at our \u2013 we just completed our strategic reviews of our businesses with the Board and we had concluded that two things. One is if you recall even at the management meeting or the analyst meeting we had in December, I think it was pretty well recognized that that we're a niche player in the industry and that in order to participate in a bigger way and sustain that business we were going to have to make investments in navigation and other types of technologies. And we just had to make a decision whether or not that was the business we wanted to allocate capital to. And we concluded at that point in time that there were other opportunities for us in other businesses that we felt were better long-term bets where we had leadership positions. And so really the decision was to pursue that divestiture for purposes of being able to use that capital for other business growth opportunities and really a decision that we would not invest in electronics and maintain a niche position. It's really that straightforward, Ravi.","Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from Brian Johnson of Barclays. Your line is open.","Brian Johnson - Barclays Capital","Good morning. So sort of continuing on that theme, are there other areas of automotive in particular the interiors business, it looks the market reacted very positively when there was a mistaken leak that, that would be for sale or would be upper and then sort of retreated when it looked like electronics. I understand you\u2019re thinking electronics, but interiors doesn\u2019t seem like particularly a business that has a lot of scale advantages, it doesn\u2019t seem to have any interesting technologies doesn\u2019t tie to your broader themes of energy efficiency in you other business units. So, do you have any kind of thinking on that?","Stephen A. Roell","Yeah, let \u2013 Alex and I\u2019ll talk. Alex, go ahead.","Alex A. Molinaroli","So I think if I remember that day that the market responded interiors retreated and then it responded positively to electronics if I recall, and I think that it's a fair observation. The best thing that we can say at this point is what we talked about electronics is that we\u2019re looking at everything, but the decision for electronics I think the way Steve described that is we can\u2019t afford to invest in everything to be a winner in everything and electronics decision was made based off of that. So, I don\u2019t think we really want to comment on anything we\u2019re going to do in the future, but just to let you know that as we\u2019ve talked about it as we recognized that we have strong positions and lots of opportunity and we need to make sure we invest in those opportunities.","Brian Johnson - Barclays Capital","And in terms of the proceeds, would you see that going into organic acquisitions or dividends or share repurchases?","Stephen A. Roell","From my standpoint, I guess we\u2019ve targeted some potential acquisitions but they would be \u2013 they had still a long ways to be determined yet, okay. So initially we probably would use it to pay down some of our debt, but we probably we then look to augment some of the investments we\u2019re going to make in other businesses, okay. If I could just go back to the interiors comment, two things happened, Brian to be honest with you. One was the fact that the information that was out there was really inaccurate regarding the amount of proceeds and the market reaction it just was real, I wouldn\u2019t put a lot of credence on how the market reacted based on proceeds people felt we can get from that business or anything else. But that business has a lot of opportunity for us too in terms of our \u2013 we have seen our ability to engage with customers and what we can do in total interiors with them. Some of our interior designs, there\u2019s some real value in that business in terms of customer relation. So, I wouldn\u2019t speculate that, that\u2019s on our list right now.","Brian Johnson - Barclays Capital","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from Chris Ceraso of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Christopher Ceraso - Credit Suisse","Thanks, good morning. Bruce, I was wondering if you could take us through maybe a somewhat more detailed bridge for the automotive business where revenues were down $180 million, but EBIT was down $130 million, you highlighted the supplier payment which was $20 million and a couple of other items, a normal decremental margin on that lost revenue was maybe $40 million or $50 million worth. So how do you plug the rest of the gap? Can you give us some big buckets, how much is South America? How much is metals? How much is launch cost et cetera, so we can think about how and when those items diminish and profitability starts to get better?","R. Bruce McDonald","Yeah, well there\u2019s a lot in there, but I guess like I said -- I mean just to sort of quantify, about $22 million was distressed supplier, one the launch and engineering is a $17 million. So, let\u2019s say there\u2019s nearly $40 of the reduction. And then I think if you were to look at our metals business in the quarter we still, it's still a -- not much of an improvement. In fact I think if you look at the overall level of profitability there it would be down slightly. Like you said, if you look at our profitability in electronics negatively impacted by some of the investments that we're making in infotainment. But I think maybe just to sort of help you out, volume was probably worked maybe 35 million, pricing on the year-over-year basis worked maybe 30 million and I think the other thing that I touched on would sort of bridge that.","Christopher Ceraso - Credit Suisse","Okay.","R. Bruce McDonald","I think, Chris, there's a lot of moving pieces here so I think maybe what we can do is set up a time and Glen and I can get on the phone. Maybe we can spend a little bit more time and maybe you can probably ask me five more follow-ups on that.","Christopher Ceraso - Credit Suisse","Yeah, probably. Okay, but I'll let that go.","Stephen A. Roell","Okay. Thanks, Chris.","Christopher Ceraso - Credit Suisse","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from Rod Lache, Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank AG","Good morning, everyone. In that automotive experience business, could you talk a little bit about what we should see as we moved into the June quarter? Was there around $60 million maybe of non-qualifying restructuring in the fiscal second quarter that goes away, was that distressed supplier issue a one-timer in that engineering thing unusual? I assume you're going to get a disproportionate amount of that 200 million of cost savings in the back half?","R. Bruce McDonald","Yeah, that's right, Rod. I think I'm not sure I'll answer them all, in terms of the distressed supplier payment, that was a one-time event. So that is not \u2013 I mean not to say we don't have charges, but if you \u2013 I would say on average that number maybe 4 million or 5 million a quarter, so it's exceptionally high with one large amount in the quarter. So that's non-recurring. The restructuring item that you referred to, like we said on the [call] [ph], generally speaking it's right in line with what we were expecting for that. That's very consistent with what I think we told you in Q1. The benefits are going to start to flow through like you said, a couple of 100 million is in the annualized number, so it gets some good leverage in the back half of the year. Just to be a little more specific if you look at the European profitability that we're looking for, in Q1 it was 105 million loss here. In the second quarter, we were at 74 million. That number we're anticipating for the third quarter here should be in that 30 million-ish range it'd be sort of where we see that and get into a breakeven in the fourth quarter.","Stephen A. Roell","The only thing I can add, Bruce, is that engineering will continue higher in the third quarter and then by the time we get to the fourth, it looks pretty cut flat to the prior year, okay.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank AG","Okay, thank you. And just my second question is a clarification on power solutions. Did you say that the volume was up 7% but the earnings were up 3% ex the settlement? I'm not sure if I misheard that?","R. Bruce McDonald","That sounds right.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank AG","Okay. And why would you not be getting the operating leverage on the additional volume.","R. Bruce McDonald","I think that where the volumes are increasing as in Asia and our fixed cost structure is higher there as we ramp up.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank AG","Okay. But shouldn't there be some savings from the smelter and some of the other actions that you were taking to mitigate that.","Stephen A. Roell","Yeah. So we're starting to see that. The smelter will ramp up through the summer, so we should start seeing more and more favorability, but that's sort of where the offsets were.","R. Bruce McDonald","I think Rod what you'll see is in Q3, you'll see the margins pop up here in power.","Stephen A. Roell","Particularly with pricing and everything else that takes place, so we're expecting power to be a big contributor to our third and fourth quarter.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank AG","Okay. All right, thank you.","Stephen A. Roell","Thanks, Rod.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from John Murphy, Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good morning, guys. To keep it one question, I just wanted to focus on Europe and just get your thoughts as we look at that \u2013 through that improvement sequentially that you're looking at in your losses to breakeven by the end of the year, I'm just curious as we think about that, how much of that is coming from stabilization and a potential recovery in volumes and how much of it is your internal actions? I'm just trying to really gauge what's micro versus macro in the improvement? And really the crux of the question is there is such risk to the downside in European volumes and maybe another 10%, I just kind of want to understand the sensitivity there, to that potential risk?","Stephen A. Roell","Yeah. Well, I would say by far the majority of what we're projecting for the third and fourth quarter comes from our internal actions and not from volumes. If I look at the current projections that we have for our Q3, we\u2019re still expecting as I mentioned, Europe to be down about 3% year-over-year. Now you can take that range going to be down 10, but far John the majority of our improvement year-over-year is coming from the actions I described to you. Our commercial negotiations which, if you want to translate that, that\u2019s getting paid for our engineering changes, it's our purchasing initiatives and moving our tools use, it\u2019s a function of our launch cost and our efficiency in our manufacturing operations and its lower SG&A as we get into that fourth quarter, particularly from engineering\u2026","R. Bruce McDonald","And the restructuring.","Stephen A. Roell","... and the restructuring benefit, yeah.","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And you\u2019ve identified all the actions that you think you need to take even if volume were weaker, would there be incremental actions that you could take in response to potentially weaker volumes?","Stephen A. Roell","There\u2019s some, but I wouldn\u2019t want to say I could cover a full 10%. If its down 10%, John I would have \u2013 if we got some exposure we have to run hard at, okay?","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah, absolutely. But would there be more opportunities to maybe structurally shift the business further East or take other restructuring actions it might set you up better for the long-term?","Stephen A. Roell","Not in a quarter\u2019s timeframe. Longer term, but not in a quarter, it cant move in that quick, okay?","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay.","Stephen A. Roell","Okay.","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","All right. Thank you. Thanks a lot.","R. Bruce McDonald","I think one thing that\u2019s worth commending on though is, if you look at the European production levels if it were to go down another 10% in the back half, I think we have to sort of step back and think when are they coming back because we\u2019re already at sort of 20, 25 year lows here in terms of volume and we\u2019re not going to incur several $100 million of cost to take some actions that we\u2019re going to regret when the volume start to bounce back here a little bit. So, I think I\u2019m more optimistic that we\u2019re starting to see the bottom and I\u2019d be -- maybe I will be proven wrong, but I would be surprised to see it down that level.","Stephen A. Roell","Hey Mica?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Tim Denoyer of Wolfe Trahan. Your line is open.","Timothy Denoyer - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","Hi. Good morning.","Stephen A. Roell","Good morning, Tim.","R. Bruce McDonald","Hi, Tim.","Timothy Denoyer - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","Good morning. Just wanted to ask about the competitive dynamics in the U.S. battery market, I\u2019m wondering if you\u2019re seeing any changes based on some competitive issues, especially as it relates to the market share and prices for lead cores?","Stephen A. Roell","I will take that. I think that there is a lot to change as most of you know going on with our competitors. So I think there is lot of activity quoting activity, but I don\u2019t know that we\u2019ve seen anything happen yet. Probably the biggest phenomena right now is not due to our competitors it\u2019s just the fact we haven\u2019t had our spring yet and we\u2019re looking to hopefully get the spring orders out, so the people can get out and ride their lawnmower but unfortunately that hasn\u2019t happened yet. But from a competitive standpoint its fairly stable although there is -- there are people that are checking to see what capacities in the marketplace in case something happens.","Timothy Denoyer - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","Okay. And did it -- sorry, just one quick follow-up on that, did the spring -- the late spring helped, end it with pretty lean inventories the prior quarter?","Alex A. Molinaroli","Well, inventories are more \u2013 I would put it as more normal. So they\u2019re lower than they were a year-ago. I\u2019d put it at a more normal level, what the inventories are in the channel.","Stephen A. Roell","We\u2019re just talking really about lawn and garden, so that will all recover itself here as the spring unfolds in the quarter, okay.","Alex A. Molinaroli","Eventually that will happen.","Stephen A. Roell","Yeah.","Timothy Denoyer - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","Okay. All right. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from Rich Kwas of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.","Richard Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC","Hi. Good morning, everyone.","Stephen A. Roell","Hi. Good morning, Rich.","Richard Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC","Switching gears on to Building Efficiency, so orders down pretty much across the board regionally speaking and somewhat similar to last quarter. I noticed the seasonal pickup in the second half, but doesn't this kind of indicate that the growth rate is going to come in a bit as we move through the next few quarters and I know you\u2019re going to give your \u201914 outlook six months from now or there about, but what do you \u2013 in terms of growth rate for \u201914 it just seemed like its going to have to be more modest, so I\u2019m just curious on your thoughts here given the order rates of the decline for two quarters in a row?","Stephen A. Roell","Yeah, my guess is what we will see, Rich if I had to play out the quarters, I think you will see a backlog recover here in between now and the end of the year. And that will be driven though as I mentioned by what we see in the pipeline. And so that will come primarily from two areas. It will come from systems work in North America, it will come from Asia and to a greater extend maybe even the Solutions Business that we see the pipeline picking up. So I think our volume issue is really one right now that we\u2019ve got to address in terms of our cost containment for the remainder of this fiscal year. Then I think we need to check back and see where our backlog ends up at the end of this calendar \u2013 this fiscal year relative to 2014 and that will dictate it. But I do think what Steve and Alex are working on is making sure that we go in with a fairly conservative view of our cost structure into '14 until we get a better view of that. But what we do like is the fact that and I can just tell you our systems pipeline's up about 10% and our solution's up 20%. And we're seeing good growth across a lot of verticals. So that makes us feel good. We're doing good things in Asia. We don't expect much from Europe. So that's sort of how we see the [lamp]. But I would say that '14 will be based on what kind of orders and backlog we have at the end of the next few quarters.","Richard Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC","And just a quick follow-up on the federal government state governing, what are you seeing early read on sequester and impact on the business at all?","Alex A. Molinaroli","That's good questions, Alex. So first I'll reinforce what Steve said. I think the business has done a great job of managing costs and they have to continue that because we're at the \u2013 what I think is going to be the low point of our backlog. We'll see if I'm right, but the order intake should pick up as the pipeline in some of our segments has historically high levels but the backlog is under a lot of stress. So hopefully that picks up over the next few months. But one caveat and I'm glad you're asking is we're not sure what the sequester might mean as it relates to funding. We haven't seen anything yet, but that will show up probably late in our fiscal year to find out if there is any ramifications. Our customers aren't telling us that there are, but we're trying to make sure we understand that. So that's a good question. Right now, we don't see an impact.","Stephen A. Roell","As we've said that the federal backlog is one of our strongest movers right now.","Alex A. Molinaroli","Yeah, the federal and state actually.","Richard Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC","Okay, thanks. I'll pass it on. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from Joe Spak of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open, sir.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I just want to get back to the statement made about comfortable with third quarter estimates and really the reiteration of the full year guidance. Is there any shift internally between the segments and the reason I ask is if you look at auto or seating per se, seating more specifically, you did about 2.3% margins in the first half and to hit the full year number that you initially got it to, it seems like something over 6% in the back half which even if you add up all the factors, you mentioned it seems a little bit aggressive. So I'm wondering if you guys internally have shifted expectations between the segments for the year?","R. Bruce McDonald","Not really. I'm not sure I'd agree with that mass, so maybe we have to take that offline. But I think if you look at \u2013 just talk about going from Q2 to 3, I think we have a significant step up in building efficiency. That is very much in line with our historical pattern in terms of the seasonality. It's sort of high margin as our service business starts t pick up when people initially turn their [air-conditioning on]. We see a big ramp up of Q2 to Q3 in terms of building efficiency. I touched on some of the issues earlier in terms of pickup that we expect to see in auto and Europe in particular. And we also expect, like I said to see margins pick up strongly in power solutions here in the third quarter.","Stephen A. Roell","I can't add much more. I guess I would tell you if you had to look at business and say where are we dependant in terms of improvement, clearly it's -- year-over-year it's automotive. I think that we should say BE, we expect improvement, but that \u2013 we also had the seasonal factor that comes in the BE. It's just a bigger contributor in the second half of the year.","R. Bruce McDonald","I guess our residential business too picks up.","Stephen A. Roell","\u2026picks up too, yeah. I guess those are the two factors, but that's probably the only color I can provide you.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets","All right. And then just quickly on the quarter, you mentioned Asia margins 10%. I think under the old report, if you look back at the old reporting structure, that's down about 300 basis points from last year. Is there anything specific in the quarter out of Asia?","R. Bruce McDonald","No, it's really just the \u2013 we are down about 300 basis points in the quarter. It's just \u2013 as you know, that's where our equity income flows through and it's just timing of investments. Right now, if you look at kind of \u2013 a couple of our biggest joint ventures that are opening up several new plants in the west and so it's just sort of start-up costs of new facilities to come underneath the growth.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets","Okay, thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Pat Archambault of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs","Yeah, thank you very much. My main question is more I guess, just on the industry side, and forgive me if you\u2019ve said this, but you kind of have a constructive tone on the European market stabilizing. You had obviously the retail auto sales numbers have been pretty weak. Can you just tell us a little bit more about what you\u2019re seeing in terms of near term production schedules at some of your big customers there and I\u2019d be also particularly interested in your views of inventory, because if it's coming in better but the demand is worse, one would think that there might be some de-stocking to deal with into the back half sometimes, so just your views on that would be great.","R. Bruce McDonald","Yeah, I\u2019ll take this one, it's Bruce. I think we don\u2019t have as reliable information in terms of what sort of in the dealer inventories and things like that in Europe as we also do here in North America, but I think -- I\u2019ve seen a couple of research reports that would suggest a fairly significant amount of inventory that\u2019s come out of the channel, it's hard to say. But I think we feel pretty comfortable that with once you look at our schedules which generally are pretty firm for like the next four to six weeks, so we could say half, but we\u2019re sort of already a month into the quarter and we have pretty good visibility in the next four to six weeks. I would tell you right now we see very little downside to the quarter. I think if you look at how the OEs have tended to flex and if sort of things weaken up it would be around taking some more time out around the shutdowns which would be kind of into our fourth quarter. So I think when we -- again to our confidence here in the third quarter month of it early in the bag and we got pretty good visibility here, so we don\u2019t see a lot of downside risk for the current quarter and we\u2019re just happening to keep our eye on whether any of our customers extend some of the shutdown timeframes. And that\u2019s in Europe, I guess I would flip that and say on the other hand in North America our customers are asking us -- some of our customers are asking the supply base about shortening the summer shutdown. So, I think we maybe talked about some of the risk in Europe but I think in North America there is some offsets.","Stephen A. Roell","Maybe (indiscernible) and I mentioned the fact that the Q2 lower level from the first quarter is, going from a 8% decline to about a 3% decline, but the absolute production levels were about 4.8 million units for both periods, so we\u2019re not anticipating any significant recovery. And then of course in Q3 we had the shutdown period. So we\u2019re only projecting about 4.2 and that\u2019s consistent with our (indiscernible). As Bruce mentioned, we\u2019re well into this queue with our build, so we feel comfortable that those numbers are reasonable.","Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs","Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. If I could just one housekeeping one on building efficiency. Can you just remind us in terms of the timeframe that both orders and backlog typically get translated into revenue?","R. Bruce McDonald","Okay. Well, I would say that backlog today, about 40% to 50% of that will flow this year. So when you talk about our backlog, when you look and it's skewed depending on what your solutions backlog they\u2019re larger projects. So if you look at what we have to work with for the remainder of the year, for the most part we can see it. We will be determined to get some orders here in the third quarter in order to finish the year out, so the orders in the third quarter are important for the rest of the fiscal year. And then if you look going into next year I think when Steve talked about going into next year as the sales increase in our fourth quarter it will put a little bit of pressure in the first half of the year, but those -- because those orders will flow second and third quarter next year.","Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs","Okay, guys. Thank you very much. I'll turn it over.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Brian Sponheimer of Gabelli & Company. Your line is open.","Brian Sponheimer - Gabelli & Company, Inc.","Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my call. Just want to spend a second on the balance sheet looking at around 6.2 billion in that debt right now targeting 5.2 towards the back half \u2013 at September 30. Obviously CapEx is about 200 million of that. Talk about some of the levers that you can pull and where you expect that incremental $800 million to come from?","R. Bruce McDonald","Yeah, I think if you sort of want to do a high level bridge there, I think our earnings in the second half versus the first half is a big chunk. It's probably 40% of it. If you look at our net working capital outflow on a year-to-date basis, I think it's around \u2013 nearly 400 million. And within that what you would see if we typically have an outflow in the first half of the year associated with a lot of setup compensation and sales commission plans as well as some contributions to like our defined contribution employee plans. So those flipped from being uses of cash in Q1 to sources in the second half of the year. And then we've probably got, I'd say about $100 million of receivables that we didn't collect in the second quarter. That would be to name two specific issues, one was Good Friday was the last sort of day of the quarter, so we had a couple of customers that we were expecting the payment and we didn't get [receipted] and we had a few of our Japanese customers which have a March 31 year end kind of withheld payments from us. And then I guess the last thing would be we've got a couple $100 million and we've talked about this before of overdue VAT receivables, some indirect taxes that we're starting to make some good progress and I think we can bring most of that in, in the second half. So those would be sort of the main drivers.","Brian Sponheimer - Gabelli & Company, Inc.","Okay, great. And then just switching gears real quick. If I'm thinking about energy prices and how it relates to building efficiency, if we start to see oil come down a little bit more here, would that be a net benefit for you with some of your customers becoming a little more cash flow positive or should we think about the other way that high energy prices means that Johnson Controls becomes more valuable as a solutions provider?","Stephen A. Roell","Just to make sure we're talking about electricity, not gasoline prices, okay.","R. Bruce McDonald","Look, if you're talking energy prices, I think that it's \u2013 if you believe that energy prices are going to continue on the long haul to increase, I think that's the way our customers view the world. Most of our customers are looking at assets that are long life assets and a lot of the paybacks are also for deferred maintenance programs. So I'm not sure it will have a meaningful effect. I'd be more concerned about interest rates.","Brian Sponheimer - Gabelli & Company, Inc.","All right, thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Matthew Stover of Guggenheim. Your line is open.","Matthew T. Stover - Guggenheim Securities","Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to see if you can give us a little bit more color about what it is that you see driving the margin outlook for power systems in the second half, there's significant volume reduction, there's mix, there's some price and there's some core cost impact, but if you can kind of scope some of those things, it'd be helpful? Thank you.","R. Bruce McDonald","So I don't know if I can give you the dollar versions, but what I'll do is give you the things to be looking for. First off, we're going to see the benefits of the Florence Recycling Center. It's been something that we \u2013 as we ramp up, we're getting some benefits but we'll also have start up cost that we've had in the first part of the year. The second thing that's going to be very important is a year ago, we put some pricing in place, we're going to see that benefit of the pricing over the summer and we also have more pricing that's going to go in play in July. We've notified our customers about a 3% to 4% pricing increase across North America. So those things are significant. Our operational improvements have continued, our China operation is also getting up to scale in operations. So all these things added together along with more and more AGM coverage in Europe add up to the numbers. So the volumes \u2013 if the volumes happen, I feel pretty comfortable about our forecast.","Stephen A. Roell","The only thing I can add to that is the core \u2013 last year we had the core imbalance that we had and\u2026","R. Bruce McDonald","Yeah, so the core costs are still high but one of the problems we had is that we were out of balance ourselves as it relates to our core inventories and we've been able to get that more in line with normal \u2013 that was a cost that we had last year that we hadn't incurred in the past.","Matthew T. Stover - Guggenheim Securities","Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from David Leiker of Baird. Your line is open.","Joe Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co","Hi. Good morning. This is Joe on the line for David.","Stephen A. Roell","Hi Joe.","Joe Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co","May be just a little more generally or broadly looking at Building Efficiency, you\u2019ve really seen you go out and say we\u2019re going to not do these things to improve margin, its follow through what\u2019s the margin improvement Building has been able to post. Where are you may be in terms of like a baseball now, since we are in that season and in terms of innings into ticketing the improvement or is it the type of thing were you the pricing gains, the cost reductions carry through year-end and then you\u2019re sort of more at a normalized level for that business?","Alex A. Molinaroli","Great question. I think that this was \u2013 so let's just say that this is a baseball game and maybe the first game is over but this is a double-header. And I think we have more opportunity. So, there is a lot of programs that BE group has been looking at both in North America and across the world, some of them are structural and some of them are pricing. I think we're going to see more and more of that. We have opportunities, it will come in small chunks, and little chunks, but I think that we're pretty excited about the opportunities we have in front of us in different ways in order to solve some of the current problems or the problems that we have with our customers that have had over the last few years. So I'm pretty confident that we're going to find more opportunities. I think we have more opportunities than we have heartbeats to go get them.","Stephen A. Roell","I think the other thing we got to mention with Joe is also we\u2019ve got opportunities to invest in areas that we want to really drive future value with our customers in terms of product technology. So that\u2019s the tradeoff that we\u2019ve got is making sure we can sustain those investments and at the same time, continue to ratchet down our cost structure, but we\u2019ve still got \u2013 as Alex mentioned, we got lots of room.","Alex A. Molinaroli","Yeah, and I actually think they go hand in hand. So there's good opportunity there.","Joe Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co","And if I can ask a quick follow-up, you\u2019ve always talked about that business being 8.5% margin business, is the pricing sticking or any of these things maybe coming in faster than you were expected? I know the 8.5% kind of has allusive end date associated with that.","Alex A. Molinaroli","Well, I don\u2019t know that \u2013 I don\u2019t know there is an end date. I think that there is plenty of opportunity, a lot of that has to do with the mix of our business and how the \u2013 and how that\u2019s going to -- how we\u2019re going to make investments in the future, but I think that all of the targets we put in place are realistic.","R. Bruce McDonald","And Joe, just to clarify, our objective in this business is to get to a 10% without GWS. It's the way we've always phrased it, okay? That\u2019s just to clarify that. And I think to Alex\u2019s point, part of this cost structure a lot of it just growth and pricing, I mean I think we\u2019ve got opportunities in the service area to grow. We know we\u2019ve got some opportunities in our cost structure. So the margin improvements that you should see in the second half or it should be dramatic and help drive another step towards that improvement longer term, okay.","Joe Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co.","Great. Thank you.","R. Bruce McDonald","And we have time for one more.","Operator","Okay, thank you. Our next question is from Ryan Brinkman of JP Morgan. Your line is open.","Ryan Brinkman - JP Morgan","Hi, great. Thanks for squeezing me in.","R. Bruce McDonald","Hi, Ryan.","Ryan Brinkman - JP Morgan","You\u2019ve touched on Europe a few times already, just throughout the Q&A here, but I am curious if there\u2019s a level of European light vehicle production that you\u2019re preparing the European business for through your restructuring program. Do you have a sense of what the threshold of production is necessary now for the automotive business to breakeven in Europe, and what might that threshold become after the restructuring program?","R. Bruce McDonald","Yeah, Ryan I would say that -- I would tell you that our business is sized to be profitable at the current level. Our issue is really the internal challenges that we talked about before. It's a lot of things that we\u2019re doing to drive the improvements in the metals operation that Steve talked about. Our challenge that we have in interiors isn\u2019t really so much around volume, it's around -- we\u2019re overly exposed to Western European for manufacturing perspective rather than Eastern Europe in where some of our competitors are and that sort of set the market price. So, I wouldn\u2019t really look at it like, we have a footprint that\u2019s sized to breakeven at a level that\u2019s higher than a market. I think most of the issues are around our operational performance, some product lines that we\u2019re looking to exit and things like that.","Ryan Brinkman - JP Morgan","Okay.","Stephen A. Roell","I think Bruce made a comment earlier to \u2013 if you go back \u2013 kind of the fact that we're already at 20-year lows here, okay. And so I think we recognize that we'll take steps as our customers take steps and we know that some of those are coming, but I don't think there's a big structural issue here that we have to deal with relative to the fact that we need the plan for the production going much lower. I mean right now, we've got our Western Europe production and on a calendar year \u2013 on the calendar year, it's 20 million units. And that's still below 12.6 last year. So I think to Bruce's comment, I think we have hit bottom, I think we can plan for whole lot lower. I don't think that's not a sustained level that we'll see Europe drop to, okay?","R. Bruce McDonald","It wouldn't be like \u2013 like you sort of read the industry comments about capacity utilization in Europe for the industry at the OE level being at the 50% or 60%. We wouldn't be like that at all.","Ryan Brinkman - JP Morgan","Yeah. I appreciate the color. Thanks a lot.","Glen Ponczak","Great. Thanks a lot. Folks we'll be \u2013 Dave and I will be available through the balance of the day. Thanks for calling. Steve, is there any concluding comments?","Stephen A. Roell","No, I think that's \u2013 I think the way to view this quarter is Bruce used and stayed with and talked about the fact that I do think we have a point of reflection here and I do believe that we feel that internally, and I think that a lot of it is within our control as he also mentioned. So I think that this is just a function of our execution in the second half and hopefully by the time we meet at the end of the quarter, we'll be talking about our improved backlogs in BE and the fact that we'll start seeing some recovery in our end markets, okay.","Alex A.

I'd like to go ahead and turn the call over to your host for today, to Mr. Glen Ponczak. Sir, you may begin.","Glen Ponczak","Well, good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Before we begin, just want to remind you of our forward-looking statements. That Johnson Controls will make forward-looking statements in this presentation pertaining to financial results for fiscal 2012 and beyond that are based on preliminary data and are subject to risks and uncertainties.

","In just a few moments here, Steve Roell, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Johnson Controls, will give an overview of our second quarter results and take a brief look at the balance of the year. He\u2019ll be followed by Bruce McDonald, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, who will give a more detailed review of the business results by segment and a financial review. That will be followed by questions and answers, and we expect to conclude the call at the top of the hour. ","And with that, Steve.","Stephen A. Roell","Okay. Thanks, Glen, and good morning, everyone. Our second quarter financial results were consistent with the guidance that we provided earlier to you this year. Before we comment on those results and provide you with our outlook, I'd like to take just a minute to thank the Johnson Controls employees who are listening for their continued contributions to our success. Well, let's start with the business environment for each of the 3 segments.","North American automotive production was stronger than we anticipated, and several of the U.S.-based automakers increased their output in response to higher sales. The benefit of this increase was partially offset by the continuing weakness in Europe. However, our sales in the region were not significantly different from the expectations we had coming into the period. ","Industry production of passenger cars in China were 2% higher and again, in line with what we had planned. And I know that we've talked in the past that there's varying numbers coming out of China, and again, our number references specifically passenger cars, as opposed to the overall vehicle production.","Our Power Solutions business had overcome the mild weather conditions in North America, that I'm sure all of you are well aware off. As we discussed in January, the period just ended is dependent upon restocking by our aftermarket customers. And unlike the prior year or probably even the past 4 years, the lack of a winter did not allow that to occur. We were fortunate that European -- that Europe experienced a more normal weather pattern in January and February, and we did see demand recover quickly in that market.","We believe that the inventories in the aftermarket channel in the U.S. are lower than they were a year ago, and therefore, we would expect our shipments to normalize. And in fact, we could see some upside in late summer time period as a result of that. ","Turning to Building Efficiency. The nonresidential markets remain mixed, while growth rates have slowed. And in China, we continue to see expansion of the Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities. The same really holds true in the Middle East across Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Turkey, and of course, those markets are driven by infrastructure projects. ","In North America, the overall market is showing some signs of recovery, but at a very modest level. Some of you follow the American Institute of Architects Billing Index, which has shown slight growth in the past 5 months, after 4 years of decline. The most recent data from McGraw-Hill forecast also suggest that nonresidential institutional markets will not grow the remainder of 2012 and be fairly flattish. ","But now, I guess I want to share with you what we're seeing in our own data, which is more optimistic given the bidding activity that we see, which we often refer to as our pipeline. In our systems business in North America, we're seeing good year-over-year activity at health care, higher ed. and K-12. And really, the only segment that we see that is soft or down from last year is really the state government activity, which, I think, we all could probably assume what that's attributed to. ","In our own energy solutions business, the improvements we see in K-12 and the federal activity are somewhat offset by softness in health care and local government. We've gained share over the past 4 years, and I'm encouraged by our pipeline activities. So if I look at it, there really is a divergence from some of the data that we're seeing from both McGraw-Hill and from the AIA. And I would just tell you that we are very, very optimistic based on what we see in some of the vertical markets that we participate in. The lower U.S. industry residential HVAC shipments persisted into the quarter, partially attributed to the weather conditions. But we believe there are a lot of fundamental issues that are impacting that industry.","Now let's just turn to the numbers. For the second fiscal quarter, sales were $10.6 billion, up $500 million or roughly 4%. Segment income increased slightly to $558 million in the period. Net income of $353 million was lower than last year, primarily due to the interest cost associated with the new debt we issued at the quarter and the higher tax return. Bruce will go into more detail, but we just want to give you some idea of what the high level was.","With the first half now behind us, we want to focus then on the second half and the projected improvements that we have. And I just wanted to highlight some of the factors that we believe will contribute to the stronger third and fourth quarters. Starting with Power Solutions. It's really a combination of a number of items: number one would be the pricing actions that we've announced; secondly, the benefits of our vertical integration; third would be the avoidance of the cost that we've been incurring as we've imported batteries in China due to the closing of our Shanghai plant there. And then as I mentioned earlier, we do believe that the summer months will see some recovery from the depression versus the past 3 months in North America. ","Automotive Experience, it's a combination of several factors: one would be stronger North American production; continued improvement in our new program launches and containment cost shutting; and the avoidance of the cost incurred last year as a -- excuse me, the avoidance of the cost incurred last year due to the earthquake and tsunami that occurred in Japan. ","In Building Efficiency, it's really a function of lower SG&A cost. We've highlighted that. I'm sure Bruce will talk more about that. But we've consciously taken our SG&A cost down just basically to protect us against the softness in volumes, should that occur.","We also have instituted a number of pricing actions across all of our businesses in Building Efficiency, if you\u2019ll recall. So there's a seasonal pattern, which drives our profitability and sales into the third and fourth quarter. And finally, we see improved performance in our service business.","And shifting more from the near term to more the mid-long term. We just wanted to make the comment that our long-term strategies remain intact: our position on the SLI battery market; our ability to drive higher margins through vertical integration is intact; the role of our AGM battery technology to support our customers' Start-Stop vehicle production; our position in the emerging markets across all 3 of our businesses continues to be a key factor for us in the future; our metal strategies and our ability to improve margins in automotive is -- with our core product portfolio and standardization; and finally, the fact that our Building Efficiency's ability to gain market share and help our customers improve their energy efficiency and reduce greenhouse gases. So those are some of the factors that give us confidence that, looking forward, our strategies, as we've described to you on an ongoing basis, continue to be very much intact. ","Now I'm going to turn over the conference to Bruce for his remarks on the quarter and the outlook. Bruce?","R. Bruce McDonald","Okay. Thanks, Steve. Let me first start off with a bit of an overview in terms of some of the nonrecurring charges. You'll see in our press release, we kind of referred to 3 of those. And as I talk through the financials and each of the business results, I'm going to kind of strip these out. ","So really 3 things: one is we had a gain on the divestment of 2 of our non-core businesses in Building Efficiency. Those were businesses that we sold with gross proceeds of just a shade over $90 million; we had a write-off on a Power Solutions investment that went bankrupt; and we took some restructuring charges in automotive and Building Efficiency to accelerate second half cost reduction initiatives. So as I talk -- as I said, I'm going to exclude those items. The net effect of all those is they completely offset one another, so they don't really affect the bottom line in aggregate.","So turning to auto. Our business delivered here another nice quarter against the backdrop of modest improvements in global production volumes. You can see our sales were up 7%. If we back out foreign currency and acquisitions that we made last year, our sales were up 4%, with strength in all 3 geographic regions. And that\u2019s really attributable to the backlog flowing through in our numbers here. ","In North America, our sales were up 12% versus a 17% increase in production. I know there's been some questions in some of the early notes about the decline versus the industry here. If you just kind of look at our sales by customer, what you really see is a few of -- few, 2 or 3 customers, were business that we did not requote in the 2009 time period because they did not either meet our financial criteria or were unable to get material indexing in place or beginning to ramp down. So we'll see a little bit of that in the next couple of quarters. But that's sort of margin accretive and something that we thought was critical to de-risk our business here.","In Europe, we are up about 8%, if you back out -- backing out foreign currency, if you take out -- and that compares very favorably to a 4% decline in production. Acquisition\u2019s about half of that delta. The other part would be the new business awards. And then, if we look at our sales in China, where we are primarily in non-consolidated joint ventures, our sales were up 5%, just over $1 billion, and as Steve indicated in his comments, passenger car production, which is our primary market, was up 2% in the quarter. ","Turning to segment income. Excluding the items I referred to earlier, we were down 4% at $236 million. We continue to benefit from higher volumes, particularly in North America, the accretive impact of the acquisitions, though as we've talked about before, our results continue to be impacted by some of the launch difficulties. In addition, we saw exceptionally strong performance from our Asia business. Most notably, that was in Japan, where we were up significantly on a year-over-year basis. ","Looking at our sort of margin rates. If you look at North America, we were down about 180 basis points versus last year. And that's really the start-up of the new metals plant, that the costs that we had there were significantly lower than the first quarter. So we're confident we're on the right path here. And in Europe, generally, our results were in line with our expectations, though down on a year-over-year marginally due to higher launch costs. ","So if you just look at these in sort of geographic ROS, north America we\u2019re at 5.4%, and that compares to 7.2% last year, but a big improvement from the 3.5% in Q1. In Asia, our margins were 13%, up from 8.5% last year, and that's the strength in Japan. And in Europe, we're at 1.2%, down from 2% last year, but up from 0.8% in Q1. So I know we -- in our slides, we haven't sort of shown the decimal point. So on a sequential basis, our margins in Europe were up about 50 basis -- 40 basis points in the quarter. ","If we turn to Building Efficiency. Here, you saw our sales were up 1%. If we sort of back out the impact of the euro, it'd be up 2% excluding that. We saw modest revenue growth across most sectors. The strongest sector was in Asia, where we're up about 10%. Look at our North America Systems and Global WorkPlace Solutions businesses, we're up 6%. Service, we were down where we're continuing to see customers defer maintenance. Europe was down 4%, and we saw much larger declines in like mid-double digit, 20%, 30% reductions in Latin America in our residential business. ","Just commenting on residential. Even though it's a small piece, that's one of our higher-margin businesses and just to put our numbers in perspective here, unit shipments in the quarter were down about 27%. I think that's kind of comparable to what we see in the industry. So don't think we're losing share, that sort of just reflects the depressed state of that market.","In terms of our backlog, you can see here a record at the end of the second quarter for us at $5.3 billion, which is up about 3% versus last year. In the quarter, our order rate was a little bit softer than we were expecting, but we do expect to see that pick up as we go into the back half of the year. We're up 8% in Asia, 6% in North America, but we were down in Latin America, the Middle East and -- in solutions. And those markets tend to be pretty choppy because we have large orders that come and go. And you can really be -- distort sort of the underlying trends in the business when we look at it just on a 1-quarter basis.","Looking at segment income. You can see we were down x items, about 4% to $127 million. In terms of the margins, we were up in North America Systems, North America Service, Global WorkPlace Solutions in Asia. But these were offset by declines in Europe, the Middle East -- sorry, Europe, Latin America and a higher margin residential business. In fact, if you just look at the absolute level of profitability decline here, $5 million in Building Efficiency, the decline that we saw in just the residential sector is $10 million. So x residential, we actually saw a little bit of improvement in our profitability in Building Efficiency here.","If we slip over to Power Solutions, the business performed well in a pretty tough environment, owing to the weather factors that Steve mentioned earlier. Sales were up 1%. You can see in terms of our shipments, we participated in the uptick in the OE markets globally. So we're up 6% there, though aftermarket volumes were down 1%. And I think as we noted in our press release, if you just look at the aftermarket volumes in North America, we are actually down 6% in the quarter. And that's something that we're hoping that we -- if you just look at general patterns, we would expect to recover that volume decline over the next 3 to 4 quarters here.","We're also starting to see good -- our product mix rich enough [ph]. AGM shipments continue to grow. Maybe just a comment on our Shanghai facility. I think in the last call, we mentioned that we were going to make the assumption that facility would remain idle for the balance of the year. That was certainly the case in the quarter, although we are continuing to dialogue with local government officials to see if we can find a mutually agreeable solution to restart production at that facility. But our guidance that we're providing here, we're not assuming that happens.","In terms of segment income, you can see up about 10% to $195 million, again, excluding items. We saw strong margin performance in the quarter as we're benefiting from our vertical integration initiatives, that's the investments in smelters and separators and the accretive impact that the AGM volume has on our margins. ","I'd also mentioned that partially offsetting that is the consolidation of the Saft joint venture. So that was a business that we now have 100% ownership in the start-up and investment mode, so we're bearing 100% of the start-up costs versus 50% a year ago. That had a slight depression on the margins in the quarter. Nonetheless, a very solid performance for Power Solutions. ","Just flipping then to the financial statements. You can see our top line was up 4% to $10.6 million. If you exclude the impact of the euro on that, this year, it was $1.31 versus $1.37 last year. Our underlying sales increased by 6%. In terms of our margins, they ticked up about 20 basis points versus last year. Here, you can see us getting the benefit of higher revenue, slightly richer product mix and some of the benefits of our cost reduction initiatives. ","In terms of our SG&A as a percentage of sales, you'll see those were up about 50 basis points year-over-year to 10.1%, which is a level that's comparable to our first quarter run rate. And kind of in our SG&A, a couple of things you need to remember when we sort of compare year-over-year here is we're not comparing all of the automotive acquisitions because some of those came into Q3, so we have those in this quarter. We've also got the consolidation of the hybrid business, which sort of is a shift of cost into SG&A out of equity income. ","So those are sort of -- make the year-over-year comparisons a little bit less meaningful. But nonetheless, we continue to invest in our longer-term growth initiatives, but we are scaling back our SG&A levels to cope with these slightly softer revenue outlook that we guided to at the end of our first quarter. ","In terms of equity income, you can see a 30% increase to $79 million. The bulk of that increase is due to the loss-making hybrid joint venture flipping into 100% consolidated associated with that acquisition.","Lastly, on Slide 12, as I go through the financials, commenting on financing charges. You can see a fairly significant increase of $17 million versus prior year. This has really just represented higher general levels of debt associated with the acquisitions and the increases that we're making in our capital expenditures for the year. Our tax rate for the quarter at 19% is consistent with our guidance and what we told you last quarter. ","Lastly, in terms of income from noncontrolling interest, you'll see that charge has gone up $7 million to $38 million. This is primarily attributable to increased profitability at some of our consolidated power solutions joint venture, primarily in Europe. Then, lastly, our earnings per share coming in at $0.53, down $0.03 from a year ago.","Then, lastly, on our -- in terms of the balance sheet, we continue to make focus here in terms of deleveraging. Cash provided by operations increased by $207 million versus the second quarter of last year. You can see our capital spending was up 63% to $448 million. And as I commented on early, you'll see in our cash flow statement the $91 million cash inflow associated with the Building Efficiency divestments.","We continue to focus on improving our trade working capital performance, which we sort of define as inventory payables and receivables, so pleased to see a big improvement year-over-year. And we're confident we'll see further improvements as we get into the third and fourth quarter. ","And then, lastly, in terms of our debt-to-total capitalization -- our net debt, sorry, to total capitalization, we ended the quarter at 34%, which is where we were at the end of the first quarter. We continue to have a strong balance sheet, which gives us the ability to take advantage of attractive growth opportunities when they arise.","And now if I just look at our full year earnings, like we said in our press release, we're comfortable where the -- with the current analyst consensus estimates here. If you sort of look at the quarterly phasing, a little bit different than the analyst consensus out there. We think Q3 earnings are to be a bit about 20%, and we see top 25% in the fourth quarter as some of our cost reduction initiatives kind of gather momentum.","Overall, if you sort of look at the markets, they\u2019re little changed in aggregate versus what we thought they were going to be at the end of the first quarter. We're confident that we're taking the right measures to both deliver our near-term financial commitments, but also to continue to position our businesses for long-term growth. ","And with that, Glen?","Glen Ponczak","Yes. Jos\u00e9, we'll open it up for questions. [Operator Instructions] Jos\u00e9, we're ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Emmanuel Rosner with CLSA.","Emmanuel Rosner - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","I would like to talk a little bit about your strategy of vertical integration in the seating business and sort of your new focus on the metals. We're about a year after your acquisitions in Europe, and I'm curious. Are you starting to see the benefits from these strategy, either in terms of margins or your rate of business wins, as you quote on seating business?","Stephen A. Roell","This is Steve. I think the -- let's go back to the strategy itself in the quarter. We really have seen continued success in terms of the quoting activity. They had a big backlog coming in for both those transactions. And again, the trend from the OEs is to disaggregate the complete seat award into the components side. And so we certainly are seeing the increase in our backlog. We'll share the new backlog with you in October at our analyst meeting, but you should expect that to be a strong backlog. So it\u2019s continuing. The strategy, we believe, is very much the right strategy just given the -- how the OEs and more OEs are doing that practice. So I feel pretty good about what's there. I think we realize we've got a lot of -- as we've gone through the acquisitions, we've learned not only what's their value in terms of their capabilities, in terms of process and product technology, but they were very, very good at launch. And so we've actually borrowed on some of their expertise to help us in some of our prior launch initiatives as well.","R. Bruce McDonald","Maybe one thing I\u2019d maybe add to that -- it's Bruce -- is in addition to -- there's been a lot of talk about component sourcing, but one of the trends that has definitely materialized as we had expected is source -- global sourcing of the structure in particular. And so with the acquisitions that we've made, we really have an unparalleled global footprint versus our competition, and that really has positioned well for us to quote and win some of these global structure awards, which are starting to manifest themselves both within the customer, but also customer groups are coalescing and asking for a common structure as well.","Stephen A. Roell","We've also had -- one other comment I can make, as well Bruce, is the fact we've had a lot of requests from our Chinese partners to locate -- bring the technology into that market. So we're currently facilitizing [ph] in China with our JVs there.","Emmanuel Rosner - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Okay. So I guess that leads me to my follow-up. I understand the strong benefits in terms of winning new business and how that sort of the trend sourcing is going. But what is really the expected impact on, I guess, the margins of your seating business? Is the ultimate goal to sort of -- that it should enable you to surpass prior peak margins because, obviously, everything is sort of vertically integrated and there are some synergies there? Or is it more a case of protecting margins in an environment of pricing pressure from the OEMs?","R. Bruce McDonald","Yes, no. I think the profitability on metals is higher than average. So when we made the acquisitions, we upped our sort of margin guidance in automotive from a previous range of 6% to 7% to 7% to 8%, and that's really associated with the higher profitability that we see the metal area being able to deliver. And we need those margins because capital intensity in that business is higher as well.","Stephen A. Roell","But I think also the fact that there is such capital intensity and the fact that there aren't any competitors who really have that -- not many competitors that have that global capability that Bruce described earlier. So that allows us to protect and improve those margins.","Operator","The next question comes from Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","In automotive, first of all, you mentioned that launch costs moderated from the first quarter to the second quarter, and I'm assuming that, that's one of the factors behind your first half to second half improvement. Was hoping you can give us a sense of how those cost containment in Europe and the metals launch on an absolute basis, how should we be thinking about those first half versus second half sequentially and year-over-year. And also, just kind of more broadly, if we're thinking about back in October, in Automotive Experience, you were targeting, like, a, I think it was 5.3% to 5.5% margin, and obviously, those expectations were taken down maybe to the mid-4s. It looks like you probably need to get to at least the high-4s by the back half. Broadly, is that a correct -- is that reasonable?","Stephen A. Roell","There's a lot there. Let me try a part of it, okay? Rod, part of the strength in the second half is the improvement we expect in Europe, again, okay? If you recall last year, we had a lull in our margins in the first half and then by the time we got to the third and fourth quarter, I think we ended the year with about a 3% margin in that business, okay? If I look at Europe, I would expect us to see, probably, something close to 3.5%, 4% margin in Europe in that fourth quarter. So we do see that, and that's a function of the fact that our launches are improving, that our cost of containment and the quality issues are also being reduced. So sequentially -- I'm trying to go back to your question sequentially, we continue to see improvement in terms of our, what we call, cost of portfolio, which is really nothing more than our containment cost. And as we shed that, we also see that the launches that we do have are -- in terms of readiness, are in great shape. We've been able to go through with the issues that we had, and given the combination of our -- where we think we are in the design validation and production validation, we feel very good about that. So we expect a consecutive -- sequential improvement in our cost quarter-over-quarter, but also year-over-year as a result of that. Bruce, you're [indiscernible].","R. Bruce McDonald","Yes. I think, Rod, I think we talked with you early in the quarter, and I know we've had several discussions with other analysts here. And given our revised guidance, we talked about the fact that we did have some at-risk launches in the pipeline. And I think we said we had 4 or 5 in particular that we -- weren't in the shape that we would like them to be and in the guidance that we provided at the end of our first quarter, we said we tried to take a realistic assessment on how those were going to flow. One of those launched in this quarter. It wasn't great, but it wasn't as bad as some of the other ones we've experienced earlier. And as Steve's mentioned, if you look at the sort of status of those ones that we still have on our watch list, they continue to get better. But they're not going to be flawless. They're just too late. But we're confident that we're going to continue to make improvements. If we just look at the metals plant in North America, if you look at the rate of improvement we have to our containment cost in the quarter here versus Q1. So we know how to do it. I think in the guidance that we've given, we factored in where we think they're going to come out, and our teams are making good progress. We've also added a lot of resource to try and minimize the financial impact sort of ahead of time here. So we're adding cost to sort of make sure that we don't go into production and stub our toe.","Stephen A. Roell","And maybe let me just elaborate just for a second on what Bruce just said about resources. When we launch a program, it's what's called an SDT team. It's a strategic development team that's comprised of advanced manufacturing, advanced engineering, quality financial people, and where we got behind was the staffing of those programs because they got pulled off in programs that had issues. So we've actually been adding that talent, that advanced manufacturing, advanced quality talent, all the way through the last 9 months to the point where we know we're fully staffed right now for all the launches we have. And so what we're looking going forward, the key from our year-over-year performance will be our ability to launch all the new programs we have over the next 3 years flawlessly. That's our objective.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then on, Building Efficiency, how much savings are you targeting there? I know you've mentioned something about $150 million, but some of that may have included cost avoidance. And how should we be expecting that to start rolling in into the results?","Stephen A. Roell","At the end of the first quarter, Rod, that's right. We talked about $150 million in SG&A reduction, primarily in Building Efficiency.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Can we see that in the numbers currently? Or is that something that you affected the restructuring and we should be looking for that going forward?","R. Bruce McDonald","Well, it would be both. I mean, we did take some restructuring in Building Efficiency that's going to give us, I'll say, probably another $30 million or $40 million of run rate savings over and above that number. And that will start kicking in here in Q3.","Stephen A. Roell","The key thing we were trying to do, Rod, was get our run rate and SG&A below last year's level, and we have achieved that really out-of-the-box from September. But right now, we're probably running probably 3% lower than last year on a monthly basis, okay. And that's a big number for us in that business.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Right. And GWS, just my last thing here is it sounds like you're over the hump in absorbing some of that growth here because you did comment that the margins were up. Is that reasonable that we should be looking for a kind of sequential improvement from the low levels that it had been running at?","R. Bruce McDonald","Yes. I mean, obviously, I think in -- I don't have the number right in front of me. But I think in Q1, we were at like 0.8. I think we're at like 1.3 or something for this quarter. So we still have a longer-term goal to get that unit up to a 2.5% or 3%. But yes, we didn't have any of the ramp-up or the efficiencies that we have associated with some of the new business are coming through like we expected.","Operator","The next question comes from Chris Ceraso with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Christopher J. Ceraso - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, so I wanted to talk a little bit about your expectations for the Building business. I think, last quarter, you reiterated your expectation that you'd grow revenues 9% to 11%, segment margins of 5.6% to 5.8%, but the hurdle looks pretty tough. I mean, year-to-date you've grown revenue less than 3%. Your backlog is growing at 3%, and the implied margin for the back half is north of 7%, which you haven't done in a long time. So let's talk about that.","Glen Ponczak","Chris, it's Glen here. We didn't really talk on revenues on BE for the balance of the year. We didn't change any of those expectations. But certainly -- so we didn't reiterate that number. Certainly, you're right when you look at where we are the beginning of the year, the softening of our markets. That's not a number that we confirmed.","Stephen A. Roell","Now let me go back and tell you what I think, Chris. We will -- I can give you some guidance, okay? If, first of all, the backlog we've got today is -- the 3% growth is not going to be indicative of where we think we'll be at the end of the year. And we've talked to the management team. We've looked at the pipeline and backlog or the order activity, and we believe that by the end of this fiscal year, our backlog will be up somewhere in the 8% to 10% range. Secondly, I guess, I would tell you, and I've said this before, because of the cost reduction initiatives that we've initiated, I feel very confident in some significant margin improvement in BE in the second half of the year. And I continue to feel that as we've gone through our forecasting that we'll be very close to the guidance that we provided at the beginning of the year. But that's probably the one that I feel very good relative to how we're going to handle the market and how it's going to play out in the second half.","Christopher J. Ceraso - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. It just seems that each quarter that division falls a little bit short on both revenue and margin. And I'm wondering if you agree with that and if you think you need to take broader restructuring action in that. I know residential has been a drag, but broadly speaking, it seems that the other divisions have had some fits and starts, but this one seems chronically to fall a bit short.","Stephen A. Roell","Yes, I think that's fair. But I would tell you that I think the outlook we have for this quarter and for the second half has been something that we've had in mind since the beginning of the fiscal year. This is not different, okay? So some of the actions they've taken from a cost standpoint was really there just to protect us in the event that volumes did soften in the industry in the second half. So again, I'm just going to reiterate, I feel very confident in the second half performance by Building Efficiency.","Operator","The next question comes from Tim Denoyer with Wolfe Trahan.","Timothy J. Denoyer - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","A quick question about the North America services part, specifically within BE. Can you comment on how you expect that revenue growth trend to go in the second half? Clearly, that's seasonally the strongest time of the year as you mentioned, but on a year-over-year basis, relative to the -- despite the decline in 2Q?","Stephen A. Roell","We're expecting some pickup in the North American service business in the second half. We did start to see that occur in March. As you can imagine, with the warmer weather in North America, we thought that might occur, and we did see that. So we're hoping we'll get some of the improvement there. But I'll be honest with you, our forecast isn't predicated on volume improvement as much as it is execution, so that's what I would say is going to drive that business. There's still a sense out there that some customers are deferring maintenance. And so that's why we're not going to bank on it. We've got an early start on the spring season, but from our standpoint execution will be the key, not revenue growth in service on the second half.","Timothy J. Denoyer - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","Okay. And if I could throw in a follow-up on the Asian automotive business. I understand that you outperformed in China specifically. But can you address the sequential decline in Asian EBIT from the fiscal first quarter? It seems like China was roughly flat sequentially and Japan was up.","R. Bruce McDonald","Yes, I can touch on that. I think if you look at the -- I think in Q1 our margins in Asia were 15%, which was exceptionally high. In Q2, they were 13%. The year-over-year increase in the first quarter was more attributable to China, Tim. In the second quarter, as I said in my comments, maybe you missed that, most of the increase was due to Japan. If I look at our equity income coming through in China, it was flat versus last year. And the reason for that is we've got one facility that we are in the midst of closing and moving. Our facility is actually expropriated by the government. So it's something that we knew was going to happen. And then, we've got some start-up costs associated with a couple of new joint ventures. So if you look at the underlying profitability of our like, say, a same-store-type comparison of our JVs, we are up slightly, but the combination of this plant move and some start-up costs associated with some new joint ventures pushed the absolute level of profitability in the quarter to be sort of flat. Versus Q1 then, as I said, there's 200 basis point reduction, that will really be those start-up costs in this facility that we\u2019re moving.","Operator","The next question comes from Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley.","Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","A couple of questions. One is you seem to have a good level of visibility for -- through the end of the year with your guidance with 3Q and 4Q. Do you get a sense that the issues you're having right now are more near-term issues that can be resolved in 2012? Or are these launch costs -- I mean, the complex launches and the metals plant and such going to persist into 2013 as well? And the other question is on cash flow. You spent nearly $1 billion on CapEx in the first half of the year, and you tend to be back-end loaded at least in the recent few years. Where is CapEx going for 2012?","R. Bruce McDonald","Yes, maybe I'll take the CapEx one first. You're quite right. We do typically tend to be back-end loaded, but that's not going to be the case this year. I think we've guided to -- I think $1.7 billion is our CapEx number, and I would say we're going to be in the $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion range for the year. So we're very atypical this year in that we're much more front-end loaded than in the past.","Stephen A. Roell","This is Steve. Let me give you some general comments about things that persist here that would go on. I'm going to probably take it in a different direction to begin, then I'll come back and talk about auto. Two items in Power Solutions. We're currently at full production right now. We're using all of our capacity, and we're doing that because of just the demand that we see. So we will be at full capacity in Power Solutions from now through probably going into the first of December. So some of you may not be familiar with that business, but at this stage, we are not weather-dependent. This is where we begin to stock, and given where we believe the market is, we'll have to go at full production in North America to be able to meet demand. So that's one factor. Second thing is the subtlety of that price increase, that went up in Power Solutions, the 8.5%. That price increase is not to recover ongoing cost in the context of material costs or freight cost. That is really to offset capital investments that we have to make relative to environmental improvements. So that margin, that price increase will go -- that's effective May 1 -- will go directly into margin in Power Solutions. So that's something that's probably a subtlety that some of you may not realize as well. In the segment of auto, the key thing there is the issues that are persisting, I think, because we've described to you the fact that we really are getting some of the -- I'll call them, programs that were engineered 3 years ago, that those are behind us, we feel good about where we are in all the new engineered programs. And so we would expect to see sequential improvement going well into 2013. We still have a lot of ways to improve, not only on our operations, which I think gives us good opportunity to improve profit quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year. But also, I think we're also focusing on our commercial excellence relative to how we negotiate change management. So I feel good about the sequential ability to improve our business quarter-over-quarter, but that will extend into 2013. And in my mind, that's a good thing because we do have year-over-year comparisons we can make. That's the best I can give to you.","Operator","The next question comes from Brian Johnson with Barclays Capital.","Brian Arthur Johnson - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just on a similar vein. North America Service, you're continuing to see revenue pressures there, but the margin, which, I guess we'll get the real margin in the 10-Q, but it's ticked up. Are you beginning to get some benefit from rolling in contract restructuring, pricing increases, that internal effort you've described to kind of relook at the -- particularly in the facility side of that business? And if so, kind of how is the cadence? And is that part of your fourth quarter optimism? And will that continue on through 2013?","Stephen A. Roell","Well, Brian, let me try to separate things. So I think we've probably confused the world here a little bit. When we talk about service, there are 2 elements to the service. There's what's called truck based. And then, there's also what we call energy solutions, which is where our performance contract is. So 2 different factors. The truck based service business is the one that's more seasonally based. The solutions business is the one we described, which is more the performance contracting, energy solutions selling. Neither one of those had to do with Global WorkPlace Solutions, GWS. So from the standpoint -- let's go back. I think from my standpoint, the key to the margin improvement and -- the pricing issues we take are primarily around product, although we did increase our pricing in the service area as well in terms of our labor. So that should be kicking in, and we should see that benefit. And that was, like, the core of your question in the second half. The pricing on product has a tendency not to have that immediate reaction because it flows through our backlog. It takes longer to get that realized. So that's really those 2 factors, Brian, okay? Relative to GWS, we really didn\u2019t do anything [ph] with pricing. That was really more of an execution base that's going to get us that improvement. Okay?","Brian Arthur Johnson - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And on the Solutions side, I thought you had mentioned at one point that some of those contracts were in need of restructuring for profit improvements.","Stephen A. Roell","They're not -- those -- I guess, I wouldn't tell you it's those projects. What we've done with the price condition, if you recall, I brought in Bill Jackson. And Bill\u2019s worked with Dave Myers and his team at Building Efficiency on how we price our solutions business going forward. So they've got a different -- whole different ballgame and playbook relative to how they price new contracts, not really into restructuring the existing ones that we have.","Brian Arthur Johnson - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. So that -- this North American Solutions effort is really more -- exciting more profitable new business? And to the extent things are repriced, it's more on the product side?","Stephen A. Roell","That's correct. That's correct. And I think...","Brian Arthur Johnson - Barclays Capital, Research Division","[indiscernible] on technical services?","Stephen A. Roell","We took those up, the service business, so that will be immediate for us in the second half, okay?","Brian Arthur Johnson - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. So really when you think 2013, you're selling solutions?","Stephen A. Roell","That's correct and beyond. And I think, Brian, at some point, we'll go through and describe what that means and how we get there. But we think we've got as much as a 400 or 500 basis point improvement opportunity in the solutions contracting work we do.","Operator","The next question comes from Pat Archambault with Goldman Sachs.","Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just on the automotive side, I wanted to go back to, I guess, a comment that was made about, I guess, an implied content decline, right, the revenue going up by less than the production for the quarter. Maybe we can dig a little bit into that. I mean, how much of that is just the way your North America revenue is measured because I think a lot of the Japan stuff is still not consolidated, right? So you might have a CPV headwind there. But then, you did mention that there was a portion of it that was getting rid of -- or not getting rid of but not renewing contracts, and I'd like to hear a little bit more about that. How much of a tailwind is there in your portfolio from getting rid of some contracts that were maybe not optimally priced? And maybe we can just find out a bit more about that.","R. Bruce McDonald","Yes, first of all, while we do have some sales to the Japanese customers through nonconsolidated, the bulk of them is consolidated, and especially in North America. But just to give kind of a bit more granularity, if you look at our sales by customer and I was to compare that to the production increase in the quarter, we are down in 3 customers, okay? And I'm not going to get into which ones or which platforms on the call. But those declines, where we have an adverse delta to the industry, is directly related to programs that went out of production in the quarter, that were in production last year and weren't in production this year. And we didn't rebid those contracts because either the profitability didn't meet our hurdle rates or we were unable to get -- in 2 of the 3 cases, we could not get material indexing, commodity recovery indexing in place. So if you kind of go back into the late 2009, early 2010, what we said we were going to do, particularly in North America, was we had to de-risk our business. For us, that -- one of the key tenets of that was getting commodity recovery mechanism in place with our customers. And if we were unable to do that, we decided we were not going to bid for the renewal contracts. So it wasn't a case of these are contracts that we lost money on, that we didn't rebid. You should think about this in more of a risk mitigation strategy, and we're seeing the impact right now. But I think you could kind of feel bad in terms of the short-term impact here. But we took a much longer-term perspective here and felt that for us to earn the returns that we need to make in this business for shareholders over a longer period of time, it was critical for us to get the indexing in place.","Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And maybe if I can just follow up on that -- not to beat a dead horse because I know you guys answer questions on this all the time. But the fact that the industry pricing is such that some people are refusing to give indexation. Is that something that we should be concerned about in terms of the behavior of some of your competitors? Or are these just kind of one-off instances and you would expect that, on a go-forward basis, you're not going to have to go through such aggressive pruning? And well, I guess, I'll just phrase it that way.","Stephen A. Roell","Pat, this is Steve. Let me try something. I guess I would tell you that we've learned some lessons here over the last 3 years relative to staffing levels and having capabilities to execute programs, too. And so I think we're working extremely hard to get our workforce planning done, and let me tell you how that comes into play. There's probably -- and I'm going to use an estimate. There's probably $1 billion worth of business that we're passing on right now. And a lot of it pertains to the fact that we just aren't going to overextend our resources and take on marginal jobs where the execution risk is high. Now we're still going to have good growth, so I don't want to mislead anyone on that. We're still going to have good top line growth and growth in our backlog, but I do think that our disciplines and our ability to just to walk away and not bid on programs is really a reflection of the risk that we see, whether it be material price recovery, or in this case, it's really a function of do we really have the resources that are going to be available to execute the program. So right now we have more opportunities than we can bid on.","R. Bruce McDonald","And I think you need to look at it in the global perspective. You're focusing just here on North America. If you look at our $4 billion backlog, it's very heavily skewed towards Asia and Europe. In those markets, we are a lot more successful in getting the cost-sharing agreements with the OEs. And so if you just say, well, where is there the best use of our resources? It's in those markets. And so if we go back to the 2000 and time -- 2010, our backlog, I mean, we talked about North America was negative. There was really a shrink in North America, and our growth was all in Europe and Asia where we felt the risk profile better matched our appetite.","Stephen A. Roell","Rich Kwas.","Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","On Power Solutions, any benefit this quarter, tangible benefit from lower lead cost?","R. Bruce McDonald","Rich, with our investments in smelting, we actually are disadvantaged by lead going down now. So our vertical integration benefit is higher depending on the higher lead. So it's actually the fact that lead last year or I think, in the quarter was around $2,600 a ton, and this year, it's in the $2,100-type range. There's actually a headwind year-over-year, but not material.","Stephen A. Roell","It's pretty small, that's why we didn't call it out.","Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then, just on this discussion around the underperformance versus North American production, and I think Bruce and Steve, you have explained how you've walked away from business. But what was the margin impact? Is it tangible? When you look at the margin versus say, first quarter or just last year, was it meaningful in basis points?","R. Bruce McDonald","No, that wouldn't have been a factor. I mean, if you look -- if you sort of look at the North American automotive decline year-over-year, I think last year, what was it, 7.2%, and this year we\u2019re at 5.4%. The main factors would be -- for that delta would be the metals plant that we're starting up. And so we still have costs associated with that, although they did improve a lot in the quarter. That would be the single largest item. The loss of the 3 pieces of business that I referred to wouldn't be accretive or dilutive.","Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then, just real quick one before I run. Equity income has been bouncing around. I know you explained that the hybrid consolidation in China impacts that line item. How should we think about that for the back half of the year?","R. Bruce McDonald","It's going to be in that $80 million to $90 million. I mean, it could be $100 million. But in the $80 million to $100 million range, I'll say. It is kind of choppy.","Operator","The next question comes from Colin Langan with UBS.","Colin Langan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","You talked a lot about Building Efficiency margins getting better in the second half. Any color on the sales? Obviously, they're coming in weak, and I was a little surprised that the discretionary services is actually softening. It seems like an odd time in the market for that to happen. Any color there? And then, you also commented that your mix was -- I thought you had a lot of government business, which I would think would be negative. But you seem to think that, that would actually be a positive in that segment. Any reason why you think your customer base is actually good even with a lot of government?","Stephen A. Roell","Yes, it varies. As I mentioned, I think we've got situations where we've got nice improvement in our pipeline activity in federal work, but we have state markets, which are very weak for us, particularly in the systems work right now. It's dropped off dramatically. So you have to look at the type of government, where the funding is. If you look at the funding activity over the last 6 months from municipalities, that's way down. But we've been able to find ways to grow local government. State has been our weakest part. Federal has been strong. So that's why I guess I would describe that one, Colin. Okay? I'm trying to go back. Your earlier question had to do with the softness in sales. I think that you've got a mixed blend here. I think that Europe is a weak market for us. We've had good growth in our systems North American business. And in the service side, this is not typically a very strong -- if you think about truck-based service, the January through March period is not typically a very strong period for us. We really start doing a lot of our commissioning of units for customers in spring, and that's really what the April, May, June time frame is. And then, after that is primarily a lot of truck-based service doing repairs and maintenance. That's the way that -- that market flows that way, okay?","Colin Langan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So since it's normally small, you're not worried about the year-over-year decline there? You think it'll get better?","Stephen A. Roell","I think it will get better.","Colin Langan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And just one last follow-up. In terms of your-- obviously, your balance sheet is in very good shape. It sounds like you're having some integration issues from recent acquisition. What is your outlook right now? I mean, if there's a large deal, is that something you'd be willing to do? Or is that something that has to wait until you kind of fully integrate what you've done recently?","Stephen A. Roell","Well, I guess, in terms of large deals, there's nothing that we would want to take on right now with our balance sheet. I think we always look at opportunities to invest in technology. Things that we're looking at right now would be, primarily, engineering-technology related, but we're not going to expose our balance sheet at this stage. That's not our intention, okay? In the automotive side, particularly, we have to continue to further integrate the metal transactions in fabric. So I don't see anything significant for us in 2012 or early 2013.","Operator","The last question does come from John Murphy with Bank of America.","John Lovallo - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","It's actually John Lovallo on for John Murphy. I missed the very beginning of the call, so I apologize if this was spoken to. But it looks like your revenue in China was up about 5%, and I think previously, you had spoken to about volume being up about 8% to 10% for the full year. Are you guys still comfortable with that outlook?","Stephen A. Roell","Yes, we are. I just confirmed with our leaders in China. We've got exposure to a couple of OEs that are particularly strong, particularly SAIC, with our joint ventures with both Volkswagen and with General Motors. And those volumes are strong. If you look in the quarter, I think, the production levels were up 24% in those JVs. So as we look at the balance of the year, we feel good about that 8%, 9%.","R. Bruce McDonald","A lot of our growth is tied to some new plant openings in the West.","John Lovallo - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division",".","Great. If I could just ask one more. With the Shanghai facility still down in Power Solutions -- or still not reopened, I should say. Have guys made any decisions on where you're going to build the AGM batteries?","Stephen A. Roell","No, we're still in discussion, and in fact, there's meetings next week to talk about that. We're going to be making decisions soon because we do have a lot of requests from our customers to get the facility running [ph] there. ","Okay. Well, listen, thank you very much for your questions.

Sir, you may now begin.","Glen Ponczak","Well, thank you and welcome to the Johnson Controls\u2019 Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. The slide presentation, if you don\u2019t have, it can be accessed at johnsoncontrols.com by clicking the Investors link at the top of the page, then scroll down to the events calendar section.","This morning, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Alex Molinaroli will provide some spectrum on the quarter, will be followed by Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Bruce McDonald for a review of the business unit results and overall financial performance. Following our prepared remarks, we\u2019ll open up the call for questions and we\u2019re scheduled to end right around top of the hour.","Before we begin, I would like to refer you to our full forward-looking statement disclosure in our news release and slide deck and remind you that today\u2019s comments will include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual results to be materially different from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.","These factors include required regulatory approvals that are material conditions for the proposed transactions to close, strength of the U.S. or other economies, automotive vehicle production levels, mix and schedules, energy and commodity prices, availability of raw materials and component products, currency exchange rates and cancellation of or changes to commercial contracts, as well as other factors discussed in Item 1A of Part 1 of Johnson Controls\u2019 most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2013.","Johnson Controls disclaims any obligations to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this presentation.","And with that, let's get started Alex.","Alex Molinaroli","Okay. Good morning everyone. I\u2019d like to start by recognizing that the quarter was fantastical draw, I\u2019m really pleased with our results. And even with some of the mixed results as it relates to the top-line, operational improvements are really across all of our businesses. So, we are exactly where we wanted to be, in spite of some of the markets not helping us so well.","So, I\u2019ll just jump right in on the second quarter, some of the highlights or some of them, what\u2019s happened in the industry. What we saw was a stronger Europe market than we anticipated, continued strength in North America, and we\u2019ll talk later about China but the marketplace in China remains around 9%, but you\u2019ll see later that we\u2019ve outperformed the market.","In the battery business, we had great results in North America, the aftermarket we saw demand increase due to the cold weather particularly in the Midwest and North East. And then, but unfortunately in Europe, we see demand continue to drop and it\u2019s specifically in Northern Europe, you look at Russia, Northern Europe meaning Germany and the Baltics, Russia and Turkey.","In the HVAC market, the commercial markets we\u2019re still awaiting for a rebound that we haven\u2019t seen. And unfortunately it continues to push and in spite of that we have been able to have great bottom-line results, but it\u2019s bit frustrating that the market hasn\u2019t turned on us yet, but we\u2019re ready when it does. And then all of our businesses, we are still seeing strong markets across the China region.","So let\u2019s talk about our results. For the quarter, our revenue is up for 4% and our segment income was up 36%, a little growth (inaudible) the operational increases which were significant and then our earnings per share was a little bit better than what we expected overall up 52% shows that the segment income increased, the operational income increases along with some of the other non-operational items.","Our Q2 results are at the high-end of what we guided and we will talk later about what our future guidance or the guidance for the rest of the year. I would to just say that execution remains our number one priority, but all that being said, we have been pretty busy on our strategic initiatives trying to keep everyone updated on our portfolio changes. And that known I\u2019d like to remind you this is the slide where it is we\u2019re going and where we\u2019ve been.","We have list here just reminds everyone of things that we are working on or have completed over the last year. And specifically there are two things that over the next quarter are two we should see close is the ADT acquisition we hope that closes in the next quarter and the closing of the Electronics deal that will certainly happen this fiscal year.","If you go to the segments, let\u2019s talk about Power Solutions. So sales were actually up just a (inaudible), so basically flat sales in Power Solutions. And if you look at it outside of [LatAm] we actually saw a 4% increase.","Unfortunately all the great news we had in North America in the aftermarket was offset to a large extent by Europe. Specifically it\u2019s Russia, Germany; the Baltics is the bulk of it. There is a few things that account for that, weather is one, our AGM penetration sales is another one. Our AGM penetration is up 24% in the quarter. And then we are also seeing some of the effects of the downturn on the first replacement cycle, the downturn in \u201808 and \u201809.","If you look at their results, the bottom-line shows that the results we retrieved 5%, but what you need to keep in count is the footnote we have here that we had a legal settlement last year that [popped-up] the numbers of $24 million.","So what we are seeing is; we are seeing the margins at what we expected; we are still seeing the operational improvements and hopefully we will continue with that and get some additional volume. We should see some good improvements in the third quarter. If you recall last year, the third quarter is when we started having some of our difficulties in Power Solutions.","If we move to Building Efficiency, probably the most frustrating part about this business is the commercial HVAC markets, particularly the high-end particularly the institutional segments continue not to grow. We are seeing some pipeline growth, so our orders secured is still tough but we\u2019re seeing projects go in our pipeline at an increasing rate. So hopefully that will turn into growth in the future but I am a little shy to start talking about that until I start see anything move to the pipeline.","So, if you look at sales being down 2%, and when you take out GWS and divestitures, you can see that Asia was up 5%, North America was down 4%, and orders in North America were down 2%. The Middle East was down 31%, the Middle East being down 31% has a lot to do with very large projects we had in the pipeline last year. And then workplace solutions were down 8%.","If you look at the operating performance, it has to do with all of the initiatives that we\u2019ve had in place; the restructure we\u2019ve had in place; and also the separation of GWS, strong operating results considering the lack of volume. And GWS specifically is really benefiting from the restructuring charges and the operational initiatives we have. The backlog is about flat to last year and then orders down 2%. So, we\u2019re hopeful that that will turn as we continue to see some toughness in the markets we participate in.","Automotive experience is really a great story, not only are we participating in the growth, we\u2019re giving the pull through on the income side. If you look at our revenues in North America, Europe, Asia, China all sales are up. And if you look at the sales of 25% in China, that shows you that we\u2019re benefiting and gaining share continually in China. The production numbers are really to remind you.","The segment income is also a great story. In fact, pretty pleased that metal performance is one that went from an unprofitable business last quarter to a profitable business this quarter. And so we continue to see improvements in our metals business. Our margins are up and both in the interiors and our automotive business and both have done very well. If you look at our interiors business, they\u2019ve gone from a loss making business last quarter -- last quarter of this year -- last year this quarter to a business that\u2019s now making money.","So all-in-all, not a lot of help to top-line except for automotive, some incredible results. And I\u2019ll turn it over to Bruce and then I\u2019ll close up.","Bruce McDonald","Okay. Thanks Al. Yes, just on slide 9 here, I\u2019ll just talk about the financial highlights. And these are from continuing operations, so maybe just before I -- some of the early notes that there is some confusion around those in and out. But electronics for the quarter, we pulled out of our numbers, if you were to sort of add it back in the quarter, the sales were about 344 million and segment income was about 18 million. So, those sort of get collapsed and just reported net of tax on the discontinued operations line. So, that\u2019s kind of how things shake out versus probably what was the most analysts\u2019 model.","We\u2019ve also had some one-time charges in this quarter and the prior year. This year we had non-cash tax charge of about $0.27 and last year, we had three non-operational items that resulted in net charge of $0.20. And as I go through the numbers, I\u2019ll back those out. So I\u2019m going through the adjusted numbers.","So let\u2019s start with revenue, we\u2019re up about 4% to $10.5 billion. You can see our gross profit here up about 50 basis points. Here we\u2019re really seeing the benefits of the automotive operational performance and the impact of higher global revenues in the auto space.","SG&A. Here as we will start to see the benefit of a lot of the restructuring cost reduction initiatives, so on a slightly higher sales level you receive SG&A expense were down 10%. So, that we can see the impact that had on our segment margins.","Equity income, a little bit higher than last year about $8 million, we benefited from improved profitability of our automotive joint ventures. And we can see our segment income margins of 6% were 140 basis points higher than the 2015 Q2 number.","On slide 10. Might I just draw your attention to financing charges that were down about $10 million versus the prior year, really, really benefited from really lower interest rates. So borrowing levels were slightly lower than last year, we had more of our debt in shorter term commercial paper which has a significant lower interest rate.","Tax rate in the quarter is just above 19% and roughly in line with where we were in the second quarter of last year. There is a tweak to our tax rate associated with the reclassification of electronics and discontinued operations, our blended rate is 20%, but continued operation a little bit lower and the electronics rate to discontinued operation is necessarily higher. So, the average about 20%.","And EPS for the quarter came in at $0.64 which is up the 52% that Alex referred to and including the impact of the discontinued operations our total to diluted earnings per share were $0.66 which is at the high end of our guidance.","Slipping to slide 11, I just spend a minute on the balance sheet and cash flow, and we are sort of pleased with how the balance sheet sort of smack back this quarter, you recall with a fairly large outflow in the first quarter really around some of the seasonal working capital factors and the $1.2 billion buyback that we completed. So if you look at this quarter our cash flow from operations was $730 million, you can see that\u2019s nearly club (inaudible) versus where we were last year.","Our net debt in the quarter came down almost $400 million and we are sitting here right now with the net debt to total capitalization of about 34%. Our trade working capital was source of cash in the quarter. If you look at that and we define trade working capital\u2019s payables receivable inventory which is now about 6.9% of sales, down about 80% basis points from where we were last year.","In terms of CapEx on a year-to-date basis where we thought would be are half way through in a $1.2 billion that we have guided to. Really pretty confident in the second half cash flow, our cash flow is back end loaded with our earnings and we remain on track to deliver the $1.6 billion free cash flow target that we set at the beginning of the year.","And lastly on slide 12. I just touched on our guidance. I just want to be clear in terms of what we are saying and what we said. So if we go back to the guidance that we have provided on December analyst meeting in New York, we talked about a range of $3.15 to $3.30 including Electronics and Electronics perhaps within that range was up $0.10 to $0.12. So on an apples-to-apples basis that we were to pullout Electronics, our guidance back then would have been $3.05 to $3.18.","And so what we are doing here today is we are tightening and slightly raising the midpoint of our guidance to a range of $3.10 to $3.15 without electronics so it\u2019s continuing operations. And then from the third quarter we\u2019re introducing earnings range of $0.81 to $0.84 which as we compared to last would be an increase of between 13% and 17%. And we talked a little bit about air distribution technology and the impact it would have on our 2014 numbers, excluding any transaction related costs we think it\u2019s going to be fairly neutral to our Q4 earnings estimates.","And so I will turn it back over to you Alex.","Alex Molinaroli","","Yes, before we get the questions there is a couple of things I would like to point out where I think there might be some concerns. First I will give you some, my take on B\/E, if you look at our share which is something that we can only control, we can\u2019t control the marketplace, we are maintaining or increasing our share.","If you look at our profitability, I will just give you an example, I go to North America, if you look at our profitability in North America with sales being down 4% our earnings are up 22% a quarter, 12% year-to-date. So we have got operational improvements that are put in place, we are not losing share and when the market comes back we are going to be in a position to take advantage of that. So I want to make sure it puts it in a context that we are very pleased with what\u2019s going on and we just wish the market was coming back quicker.","And in Power Solutions we are increasing our share both in the OEs if you look at it this time versus last year and the aftermarket unfortunately in Europe the aftermarket is not helping us, it is helping us in North America. Along with increasing share our AGM growth is continuing and we are very pleased with our China growth. So if you look at our strategic initiatives and what we have been saying with what we can control, I am very proud of what the team has done. Last thing that I will leave you with, if you look at the portfolio moves we still have ways to go but I am also pleased with how quickly the team has been able to get their heads wrapped around and get some actions put in place in order to meet some of our portfolio changes, so all-in-all I am pretty pleased with what we\u2019ve accomplished so far.","With that Glen I think we\u2019ll take the questions.","Glen Ponczak","Yes. (Inaudible), we\u2019re ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). Our first question is coming from the line of Mr. Brett Hoselton. Sir you may now proceed.","Brett Hoselton - KeyBanc","Good morning gentlemen.","Alex Molinaroli","Hi Brett.","Glen Ponczak","Good morning.","Brett Hoselton - KeyBanc","Two things here, related to the automotive segment. First, can you provide your guidance while you\u2019re looking at CD margins coming at high 4% or 5% range? And I am wondering how are you tracking, how are you feeling about that (inaudible) a little bit of pressure on their margins versus their previous expectations, but how are you feeling about the margins kind of in the short-term relative to your guidance? And then kind of longer-term where do see that segment potentially moving to you?","Bruce McDonald","Yes, Brett it\u2019s Bruce here. Well, we\u2019ve always talked about we think our margins are to be in the 7% to 8% range, if you look at this, the quarter that we just did our ceiling business was 5.2% and that\u2019s off of a depressed, our metals business a lot better than it was, but still not anywhere close to where we think that business should be from a longer-term margin perspective and obviously Europe is pretty fast. So I would tell you right now our, if you look at where we are through these six months our ceiling business, our interiors business and the Electronics business are all performing ahead of our plan, both in terms of our top-line and margin performance, so we're pretty pleased.","Brett Hoselton - KeyBanc","","And then on the interiors business, can you provide us with an update as to your latest thinking, I know you\u2019re doing a strategic review of the interiors business. Is there anything new that you can share with us with regards to future of that business?","Alex Molinaroli","Unfortunately we\u2019re not in a position to share yet. I could tell you that we're heavily engaged in activities and I\u2019m hopeful and I told our employees that over the next quarter or so we should be able to talk about it, so that\u2019s where we are today.","Brett Hoselton - KeyBanc","","Okay. Thank you very much gentlemen.","Alex Molinaroli","","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Mr. Rod Lache from Deutsche Bank. Sir you may now proceed.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank","","Good morning everybody. Alex, so speaking you might be willing to just kind of revisit your thoughts on the long-term goal for the building efficiency, auto experience and power solutions and whether those have changed? Just in the context of what we\u2019ve seen here building efficiency down, it was down last year and year before was weak. I think long-term you\u2019ve been talking about 5% to 6% growth there. I think you sort of intimated that automotive experience would be kind of flattish, but here it\u2019s been running up over 9%.","And similarly for power solutions, there was originally like an 8% to 9% long-term growth expectations, but that\u2019s been running a little bit lower. So you get a couple of years here of different performance than what the long-term plan was, is that kind of factor into your thinking about the long-term now?","Alex Molinaroli","Well I think we\u2019re going through cycles. The automotive cycle is better than what we expected and we certainly want to take advantage of that long-term, but haven\u2019t really changed our view. Building efficiency, unfortunately we just have not seen in the commercial market especially the high-end come back. Our recent acquisition of ADT is going to help us not only with other distribution that participate in the broader in the market, but also in some of the products that are more down market.","So, we can have a broader participation in the marketplace. So, I'm still bullish on BE long-term, frustrated with where we're at. So, we'll continue to invest particularly in North America and China, but we think that long-term that's the best place to invest in our dollars; the Hitachi JV is an example of that.","And as far as our power solutions, I think we're finally getting some traction in China. And as you know, the AGM growth just happens quick as we wanted to. But we're maintaining the share and keeping share in that business.","So that business is one that we can't control necessarily what's going to happen on the ground, but what we can control is make sure we maintain share. But I would tell you that my long-term view of where we're going to invest has not changed.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank","And you\u2019re still expecting kind of a secular growth rate in building efficiency. Is that what you are referring to as more of the cyclical part, but in the past you've talked quite a bit about some of the savings opportunities there and why that should grow on a secular long-term basis?","Alex Molinaroli","Yes, I expect to outperform the marketplace. And we're certainly getting our cost inline and I think this will make us not only more competitive, but put us in a position to take advantage of the upturn. So, I would expect that we're going to outpace the market, not only because we have a good cost position, but because we're adding to our portfolio.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank","Okay. And in auto experience, could you just give us a little bit of detail on what the profitability looks like right now and structures and what's the gap to your target. And I don't know sounds like you don't really want to give us a lot on the interior sale process, but is there any kind of broad framework that you can convey on valuation or what you are thinking that you can get out of it at this point?","Bruce McDonald","Well, I think we\u2019ve said organic sales in terms of the interior just got to be pretty (inaudible) but in terms of our structuring business, I can tell you that we were profitable in the quarter, so we are profitable in fact every month. I don\u2019t have that top of my head, however the margins, I would say it\u2019s probably in the 1% to 2% type range and it\u2019s a business that when we look at our metals business overall should be normally 8% to 10% range.","And we\u2019ve talked in the past about what are sort of things that we need to do to get there, it\u2019s not going to be a -- right now we are benefiting from fixing a lot of our launch problems, but to get to the target that I talked about, we really have to accomplish two things; one is getting our plants converted over so they are all making the 2b technology and right now we have a eight plus four of technology that came from the three businesses before.","And then we are working on some initiatives to spend on some of our [product] technology as well, standardize how we make things. So, once we kind of get through that and it\u2019s going to take two to three years working with the customers this product stays out and the new 2b technologies phase in. And we\u2019ve been encouraged that the underlying problems that we\u2019ve had in that business are not reoccurring and the benefit of the longer term plan that we\u2019ve put in place are all performing as we\u2019ve expected.","Alex Molinaroli","Yes. And this is Alex. So I think that probably after another quarter or so not only do we have confidence, but everyone has confidence that fixing is behind us. We\u2019re going to start talking more about the future of business, which is exactly what Bruce said. We have an opportunity to grow that business. We have a great position technology wise and then we have also extended our position in China. So I hope we could start talking about what we\u2019re doing to grow that business and make it more profitable in the future now that we are getting operations issues behind us.","Bruce McDonald","Yes, I\u2019d probably should just clarify my comments are rolled our North American, European business. One of other initiatives was growing that business in China so that we have made the investment and then that\u2019s the business that we expect to be pretty close double-digit this year.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank","Great, thank you.","Alex Molinaroli","Thanks Rod.","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions). Our next is coming from Mr. Mike Wood. Sir you may now proceed.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, thanks for taking my question. In building efficiency things maybe, could have been impacted by a pull forward from the Energy Policy Act expiration at the end of last year and also weather in North America. Can you give us a sense of how the orders exited the quarter?","Alex Molinaroli","","Let me make sure I understand the question. Is it relates to what orders we have in place or what happened at the back-end of the quarter?","Unidentified Analyst","Yes, the back-end of the quarter, I just feel like the beginning of the quarter may not be representative, so it would be interesting to know what run rate you exited the quarter at?","Alex Molinaroli","","I think that you are there is couple of things; I think there is problem asking that type of question. We are obviously going to see a seasonal benefit on a year-on-year basis, we are seeing some improvement and quite interestingly one of the things that\u2019s really growing is our service business, service contracts and our repair business which is high margin business is benefiting more than the marketplace.","So, there are lots of signs but we\u2019re skittish. And until we have more than a month or so we\u2019re not going to be really bullish talking about growth. But you\u2019re right, it was back-end loaded in the quarter.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. And also can you give us a sense of the European vehicle production forecast that you have embedded in 2Q, we had another supplier reported this morning had 2% forecast for next quarter wondering if you\u2019re seeing the same moderation, despite the vehicle registration that\u2019s been strong there?","Bruce McDonald","Yes, it\u2019s Bruce. We\u2019re in that I\u2019d say 2% to 3% is what we\u2019re sort of seeing.","Unidentified Analyst","Great, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Mr. Italy Michaeli. Sir you may now proceed.","Italy Michaeli - Citigroup","Great, thanks. Good morning everyone.","Alex Molinaroli","Good morning.","Bruce McDonald","Good morning.","Italy Michaeli - Citigroup","Just a follow-up to maybe to Rod\u2019s question I was hoping you can just update us on what you\u2019re expecting for revenue by segment just the growth rates that you led out for \u201814 by segment?","Bruce McDonald","In terms of our guidance here, yes\u2026","Italy Michaeli - Citigroup","Yes, you\u2019re talking now with post electronics and just with the B\/E kind of numbers in the quarter just kind of what your significant 1% to 3% growth in building efficiency in \u201814 and about 7% to 8% in power solutions?","Bruce McDonald","Yes. I\u2019d say right now if you kind of look at it, we\u2019re looking at I don\u2019t have the numbers at the top of my head. But I can tell you directionally B\/E is going to be flattish to slightly down in terms of just given our backlog performance because there are not very lot we can do to move the needle in terms of whether pick up and its impact on the second half of the year.","Power solutions, it is difficult to get some visibility around the aftermarket trends, but they are probably slightly down, maybe 1% to 2% lower than we said before. And automotive will probably be stronger even, the underlying growth in our seating and interiors is stronger. What I -- I can\u2019t do math in my head here quickly in terms of how that translates into striping out electronics.","Italy Michaeli - Citigroup","","Okay. So sure, that\u2019s helpful. And just two follow-up balance sheet questions, one, pretty impressive, you are able to maintain the free cash flow guidance for the year, just maybe talk about what\u2019s going right there. And then two, I think your prior guidance was to end \u201814 with about 23% or 25% in net debt to cap ratio, I was hoping you can update us on that and if you have a pro forma for where that would be after the recent acquisition announcement, those would be great.","Bruce McDonald","","Yes, the free cash flow and just maybe to help you out of couple, our earnings tend to be our backend loaded, so there is more cash flow that comes through because of the earnings seasonality and that\u2019s (inaudible).","Secondly is we tend to have a inventory build towards the first half for the year around some of the equipment and building efficiency that sort of winds back in the second half of the year. In our guidance, we\u2019ve got the proceeds of the electronics divestiture which is 265 million coming in. We also in the second half of year get our dividends from our equity accounted for Chinese joint ventures, those around couple of hundred million. And those would be the -- those would sort of be the main factors that drive us to the skewing there.","And then your second question in terms of the balance sheet, it\u2019s around 400 basis points to 500 basis points increase, as a result of the financing, the $1.6 billion, the debt that we\u2019ll take on for the ADT acquisition. So, around 29 to 30, I think is the number.","Alex Molinaroli","Could I address something before you hang up, just to make sure you get kind of what we look at as it relates to the rest of year on building efficiency. When we start talking about the backlog number, which is flat to last year; that just gives you an indicator of what\u2019s going to happen over the next six months; that usually brings pretty true.","Italy Michaeli - Citigroup","Right, absolutely. Great. Thanks for that clarification Alex and the detail, Bruce. Thanks.","Alex Molinaroli","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Mr. Rich Kwas. Sir, you may now proceed.","Rich Kwas - Wells Fargo","Good morning everyone.","Alex Molinaroli","Hi Rich.","Bruce McDonald","Hi Rich.","Rich Kwas - Wells Fargo","On building efficiency, just on the margins here you\u2019ve been able to do pretty good job driving the margin without revenue support. Alex, where are you in terms of the restructuring benefit, as you look at the balance of this year and into \u201815? Can you still drive margin higher without volume looking out 12 months or so, or do you -- when do you start to need to see the volume come through?","Alex Molinaroli","Well, we\u2019re certainly going to benefit the rest of the year. And we\u2019ll benefit on a percentage basis even more, because remember the revenues will increase. And we\u2019ve taken, both SG&A and cost of goods sold out. So the margins would probably be at low end of where the margins will end up at the rest -- end of the year because the volumes will pick up. And then over the first couple of quarters and next year, we should continue to see benefit. Because we\u2019re -- particularly in North America, we\u2019re getting close to our target. In fact, in some ways it\u2019s actually more than our targets because of the pressure on the backlog.","Bruce McDonald","Yes, and I\u2019d maybe add to that, Rich, the other thing is I would say, I think on the cost side going to 2015 and then towards the backend of \u201815 and \u201816 and we\u2019ll start to see the accretive benefits of the ADT acquisition that\u2019s accretive to the margin.","Alex Molinaroli","That\u2019s right. And fortunately, I can\u2019t tell you when the Hitachi JV will be completed. We\u2019re working diligently on it, but long-term -- mid-term, I\u2019d say that we\u2019re bullish on the [BE] with the a little bit of help, we could be dangerous.","Rich Kwas - Wells Fargo","Okay, all right. And then on GWS with the sales down, the margins up, is that business you are walking away from in terms of just less profitable business or is that just fundamental weakness of the business?","Alex Molinaroli","So a little bit of both. I\u2019d say there was a period where we weren\u2019t securing work, I would say it\u2019s probably a 12 month period because we are working on their own cost basis. We\u2019ve changed our cost basis, you can see that it\u2019s reflected in the numbers; you are seeing it come through. In fact we are only seeing part of it come through because we give a bunch of that back to our customers. So you see the profitability in that business improve, imagine that we are giving at least half of more than half back to our customers as we change current contracts.","When we look at our pipeline, it\u2019s getting stronger and stronger. Last time we met with GWS folks a couple of weeks ago, the pipeline, they are cautious, but the pipeline looks pretty strong both in the near term and long term.","Rich Kwas - Wells Fargo","Okay. And just the last one from me on China with power solutions, do you expect to be profitable in China power solutions by year end, is that still the target and what\u2019s your confidence on that?","Alex Molinaroli","Yes, go ahead.","Bruce McDonald","Yes. I think I will hang myself on this one for [Brian]. No, it\u2019s -- the issue was if you just were to look at the business that we have today that [profitability] is improving. We are going to see in May we are launching our second plant, so that\u2019s going to start up and then we are going to start work on sites watching things like for our next plant in China. So, I would say the business will flip to profitability but we are going to make some investments that are going to offset that.","So what I think and I have said this before, and we probably just need to bring more visibility to it. The way that we look at it because of the lumpiness is our plant economics, what is our plant economics, how does that stack up with the rest of our portfolio. The fact that it\u2019s in China, it means it has a little higher overhead because we don\u2019t have the footprint in place yet. So, we\u2019ll probably bring some more visibility to that, helps people understand where we are. But if we just looked at the profitability, it would be hard for us to add these plants.","Rich Kwas - Wells Fargo","Okay, thank you.","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Mr. Ryan Brinkman. Sir you may now proceed.","Ryan Brinkman - J.P. Morgan","Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Maybe one just on the automotive in China, the revenue growth of your unconsolidated JVs there, it\u2019s really been outpacing the industry for a few quarters and a lot again this quarter. So maybe just comment on the drivers there, is it because your levered to the right auto makers that would seem not quite sufficient to explain that proper or are you expanded into new automakers or what, I mean how much longer can we expect this type of outperformance to start in here?","Alex Molinaroli","","So I will start, this is Alex, and then Bruce can clean it up. One of the things that we are fortunate is that we do have the presence across the board but what you see is our transplants are doing better than the locals and our share with the transplants is very, very high, particularly you look at the European transplants. So if you look at our mix of business, our customers are doing well plus we are gaining share. So if both are happening, we certainly have the right customers.","Bruce McDonald","And then I absolutely agree with that. Three other factors I\u2019ll point to, one is our components growth. So we touched on metals but we really weren\u2019t there and we\u2019ve made some investments, so we\u2019re growing there. And then secondly would be if you look at the market SUV, penetration is rising and we\u2019re gaining a lot more dollar content there. And the third factor would just be we\u2019re seeing increased interiors content in the vehicle market there as particularly China brands try and compete with the transplants. So we\u2019re up contenting the interiors to compete with the transplant vehicles.","Ryan Brinkman - J.P. Morgan","Okay, great. And then just last question on GWS, starting to post some better operating results there despite the top-line headwind, kind of how the -- and presumably on restructuring and expenses and sort of how the turnaround to automobile began and maybe sort of where you\u2019re given out for couple of quarters in building efficiency apart from GWS? So does this change at all your thinking relative to sort of hold versus sale decision you face there?","Alex Molinaroli","I don\u2019t think it impacts our decision because our decision, we knew we were going to get this business fixed. That was never a question. What we need to make sure is strategically does it fit with our portfolio moving forward. So that\u2019s we\u2019re certainly going to make it more profitable, it\u2019s good for our customers, it\u2019s good for us, but it doesn\u2019t really impact our decision of what we\u2019re going to do with that long-term. And by the way, there is a lot more profitability to come there, they\u2019ve done a great job.","Ryan Brinkman - J.P. Morgan","Good to hear. Thanks for the color.","Alex Molinaroli","Thanks Ryan.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Mr. Brian Johnson. Sir you may now proceed.","Alex Molinaroli","Brian?","Brian Johnson - Barclays","Brian Johnson. I just want to go - hello, hello?","Alex Molinaroli","Yes.","Brian Johnson - Barclays","Just want to go back to some of your comments on decline in segment in particularly the mix differences as you know a large competitor of yours reported this morning with commercial, HVAC revenues up single-digits and reported decent demand growth in North America.","So when you talk about share is that in the overall market or is that in the segments at the upper end you are competing in and also just as you bring in ADT, is that going to give you more exposure or perhaps more cyclical small and mid commercial where other competitors might have more of the mix currently?","Alex Molinaroli","","So let me answer the last part of that question, first, absolutely. So the ADT acquisition has two things, one is the products go across all the segments of the market place, low to high complexity, but it also has a distribution system that\u2019s lower cost and touches those customers, so it gives us both from that standpoint. Now obviously I didn\u2019t get listen to the call, but what I looked at the release both the today\u2019s release and yesterday I saw that when they talk about commercial HVAC revenues would be flat with the quarter and first quarter commercial bookings being low.","So I think we're pretty consistent, we're not losing share I just think we have a bad mix. When I looked at some of the numbers that came out, they are comparable for us, so we're not losing share, in fact at our UPG business is growing more actively, but we just don\u2019t have -- it is just not as large as our competitors.","Bruce McDonald","","Yes, and maybe just put some the number around that Brian. If you look our EPG business in the quarter, we are up about 12% on a revenue perspective.","Brian Johnson - Barclays","","EPG meaning, unitary?","Alex Molinaroli","","Yes.","Bruce McDonald","Yes. Residential, residential like commercial, which I think is a smaller percentage of our business than our competitors\u2019.","Brian Johnson - Barclays","","Right, I mean is it, as you just kind of look two or three years out, would it be fair to say some of the large institutional markets are not growing as fast as you might have thought? And we can all think of fiscal budgets, pressures on academic institutions, healthcare. And that you want to pick it up more in the mid and small commercial?","Alex Molinaroli","So, here is how I would look at it. It's certainly going to be last end cycle to come. So, you\u2019ve got residential like commercial and you are seeing it in the numbers are growing quicker. And then within the segment that we are strong, you are seeing the commercial space grow quicker than the institutional.","From a long term debt, the institutional market\u2019s right place for us to be. But what you are also seeing is that like the acquisition and investments you are going to be in products and channels to sure up our lower-end. So we're not kept on the high end market, but we're planning to keep our share, because it will come back. So, as you see we're making moves in the lower end in marketplace.","Brian Johnson - Barclays","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Mr. Colin Langan. Sir, you may now proceed.","Colin Langan - UBS","Great, thanks for taking my question. Any color on why auto experience is so much stronger than you're expecting the original guidance for 1% to 2% for the year and I think year-to-date you are up 11%. I mean it doesn't seem like some of production forecasts or is that materially better, I mean is this the customer mix factor or there is something, it was the 1% to 2% including the divestiture of Electronics?","Bruce McDonald","No, it would be -- the markets are better than we have thought, so that has certainly an element there. And then the mix, we have got a pretty favorable product mix particularly in Europe. So, I mean I don't think going into the year, we envision Europe being up double digit. And it's just we have -- I guess what we\u2019re seeing now is the downside and having a lot of launches over the last two years [compass] in our P&L. But we have a higher percent of our sales of our newer vehicles that are performing well in the marketplace with consumers.","Alex Molinaroli","And I also think we probably gave our guidance earlier because of our fiscal start at the 1st of October and I could recall we didn\u2019t expect much at all. We were talking about being at the bottom and hopeful. So, it\u2019s really outperformed what we thought.","Colin Langan - UBS","Okay. And then any comments on the seating business, you keep focusing on the multi-industry. Is that still a core business or is that something you\u2019d consider selling overtime at the right way?","Bruce McDonald","Seating business is core.","Colin Langan - UBS","Okay. And on power solutions just a quick question. And it seems like a pretty steep decline in Europe on the aftermarket, down 15%. Is that due to tough comp or is that almost sounds like it could be a record low type number; I mean any context on how tough it is in Europe right now?","Alex Molinaroli","I probably wasn\u2019t very clear in my remarks, this is Alex. If you look at that business four years ago, you would flip it and you would see the OE business being down 15%, 20%, 25%. Now what we are seeing is the first wave of replacement being down because the vehicles are there. We are also seeing the impact of the AGM mix and that\u2019s something that we expected and then the weather is not helping.","So I think that there is a lot of things that hit us at once and that\u2019s why it\u2019s so severe. I\u2019m also having a little concern because Eastern Europe is where we are growing and places like Russia and there is a little uncertainty there today. So, we are not losing share, but we are suffering with the marketplace. And the market will come back, because sales in Middle East came back. So, it will come back overtime, but unfortunately it\u2019s offsetting all of the growth we\u2019re having in other places.","Colin Langan - UBS","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Mr. David Leiker. Sir you may now proceed.","Unidentified Analyst","","Hi, good morning. This is Joe [Vruwink] for David.","Alex Molinaroli","","Hey Joe.","Bruce McDonald","Hi Joe","Unidentified Analyst","Just looking at building efficiency EBIT, I am wondering how much the ability to grow with the revenue declines is more belt tightening in a difficult end markets versus actions that actually are going to widen your incremental margins later on, because if I just, if I think of your long-term targets, the goal was there about 50 bps on margin annually, you did more than that this quarter with a revenue decline I would just think that going forward when growth returns the margin gains should be bigger?","Alex Molinaroli","","So, I will take this, this is Alex. So, I would talk about B\/E in a couple of ways. First off, we have retrenched in Europe and I think that that will continue to be the position that we will, we want some profitability in Europe, but not make a lot of investments. Where we plan to make our investments is Asia specifically China and in North America where we think the market is only going to be stronger, but it\u2019s going to be longer lasting and less cyclical.","We are going to expand our footprint with the type of buildings that we approach and the channels that you see in that that\u2019s evidence of that that\u2019s happening today, but we also think that our cost position, which is not just SG&A, but our operational cost will benefit us in the future in gaining share in the markets we already participate in.","We\u2019ve taken $100 million of cost out of the channel in North America. And I think we are more efficient and more effective than we were in the past. We\u2019ve really streamlined our service to our customers. So, I am pretty bullish, I just need some market to participate in.","Unidentified Analyst","So those efficiencies, cost actions those are things you carry forward as the volumes come back, so it just seem to me like the incremental to be as much better is something higher than kind of the 50 bps to that\u2026","Alex Molinaroli","","I would tell you yes with one caveat. As the market grows, we will be adding to our direct sales force. And that will be a direct P&L hit, that\u2019s not a capital investment. So, when the market comes back we will see the benefit operationally, but we\u2019re committed to grow with the market and we\u2019ll need to add some sales cost, but you\u2019re right overall.","Bruce McDonald ","Yes. I think for the -- and we\u2019ve talked about this on previous calls. If you think about B\/E business we wanted the people business we have to invest ahead of the curve. So once you see our order intake climbing we have to start to make investments. And we have said in the past that time is when we\u2019re in a no investment mode, we\u2019ll have opportunity to grow our margins quicker than 50 basis points. And so that\u2019s what you\u2019re kind of seeing right now is (inaudible) adding the investments we\u2019re getting all of the leverage from the cost saving initiatives, but it\u2019s not sustainable.","Alex Molinaroli","Yes.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. And then switching over to automotive, there was a lot of talk during the Analyst Day about just being more discipline and going after new business really rationalizing the backlog. But as you see the returns step up in that segment, you certainly start rebidding on things and maybe weren\u2019t meeting your ROIC targets before suddenly they do it and so maybe automotive is a faster grower in the future?","Alex Molinaroli","We\u2019re not going to change our discipline I think that\u2019s probably the economist in the past. So we\u2019re going to make sure that we are obtaining work not only with the right margin, but the right customer. So I think when we go after work in more aggressive way, there will be a strategic reason to do it. But certainly we\u2019re going to leverage the footprint we already have and we\u2019re going to make sure we can maximize the investments we\u2019re making in Asia. So, I think that you can see us continue to keep our discipline in place because the good times are always here.","Unidentified Analyst","So longer-term the view that seating is basically a no growth but better return as a whole?","Alex Molinaroli","Yes. The no growth is what we said, it was based on some market growth projections, which right now we're seeing better than that. So, based on what we projected in the market to be that will be true. If it continues to be stronger that won\u2019t be true, we\u2019ll benefit from the growth. But you will see is if this is a pie chart, you will see our business moving more and more into Asia over the long-term from a percentage standpoint.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, great. Thank you.","Alex Molinaroli","Thanks Joe.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Mr. Jeff Sprague. Sir you may now proceed.","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research Partners","Thank you good morning gents.","Alex Molinaroli","","Hey Jeff.","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research Partners","Alex, I was wondering actually if you could maybe sort of find a point on the overall kind of strategic vision as it relates to multi-industry. And the nature of my question is that in essence you are a multi-industry company, you\u2019ve got improved segments plus or minus a billion dollars of OP. So, does your vision really (inaudible) and at some point you need entirely new wag although that meaning that the return profile in these businesses just needs to be much higher to really put you in a different lead relative to kind of pure type company?","","Alex Molinaroli","Yes. Here is how I would answer that. I think we need to rebalance our portfolio whether that requires another wag or not. Today, just like if you look at ADT acquisition, we're staying near adjacent where we feel comfortable, overtime that may change.","As it relates to our automotive business, we can only get so much margin on our business, it has a theoretical cap and we want to get the most that we can. And we're not sure what the cyclicality of that business, if we\u2019re over weighted in the auto that we\u2019ll look get the benefit of being the multi-industrial. So, that\u2019s kind of the perspective that I have and continue to see investments outside of automotive and thus making sure that we\u2019re rational in what we do in automotive.","And in particular, we have a great position in China and we\u2019d be silly not to take advantage of that.","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research Partners","Do you have a view of how much auto is just right not too much that you\u2019re not penalized for auto? ","Alex Molinaroli","No, I guess you guys are going to tell us that. But what I would tell you is we feel mostly the margins go up, because China will grow and we will limit our investment to other places. So, I don\u2019t know the answer to that, but I do think we have some, I know it\u2019s less than what we have today. That\u2019s what I know for sure. And as I\u2019ve told everyone and I answer the question earlier little flip it, seating is not on the table, but what is more important long-term, I\u2019m committed to be a leading multi-industrial. But today seating is not on the table, but we have clear plan to do in order to meet our objectives.","Bruce McDonald","Yes, it\u2019s important to think about the investments that we\u2019re making in Hitachi and ADT and the ones that sort of making clear in electronics, I mean that\u2019s quite a major shift and it\u2019s just lifted our revenue profile.","Alex Molinaroli","So far what I would tell you, we\u2019re doing pretty much what we said and in some ways, I think we\u2019re ahead of schedule.","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research Partners","Okay. Thank you for that additional color. Just a quick little clean up, the repatriation tax is non-cash, is that the whole idea of the repatriation taxes, what that were in fact cash, that\u2019s why people don\u2019t repatriate cash often?","Bruce McDonald","Yes, and I can help with that one. You are absolutely right, there is a cash tax payable on repatriation of [foreign] earnings. We have foreign tax credits that we can use to offset that tax, so we have the book charge and we have foreign tax credit that are on deferred tax assets that offset the cash tax payment. It\u2019s a book charge but not a cash charge.","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research Partners","Okay. And then just finally on the balance sheet, obviously you need to finance ADT, but as you noted Bruce you also are kind of under short end of the curve, should we expect any kind of financing headwinds term out some of the CP from a near term either separately or as part of the ADT transaction?","Bruce McDonald","Well, the ADT call we talked about we were going to sort of go out there along, so we are looking at, I think at the call I talked about assuming it\u2019s going to be a blended 4%. So as that stands right now, obviously subject to market conditions, we would think about now the substantial portion of financing being 10 and 30 (inaudible).","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research Partners","Okay, great. Thank you very much guys.","Alex Molinaroli","We have time for one more call.","Operator","All right. Our next question is going to be from the line of Mr. Ted Wheeler. Sir, you may now proceed.","Unidentified Analyst","Yes, good morning all.","Alex Molinaroli","Hi Ted.","Unidentified Analyst","You gave us a little detail on building efficiency North America. I wondered if you could give us some more detail on the other segments in the BE for the quarter.","Bruce McDonald","As far as regions?","Unidentified Analyst","Yes, well I guess it\u2019s regions right, you got North America, you got this Asia other and GWS if I look, the units that you put in the filings?","Bruce McDonald","Are you interested in sort of orders\u2026?","Unidentified Analyst","I\u2019d love anything you can share but I just\u2026","Bruce McDonald","","Okay.","Unidentified Analyst","","Revenues and margins if you could.","Bruce McDonald","We will have those in the in our filings; I don\u2019t -- again we don\u2019t have those with us, we kind of just talk about the business. But I mean I can go through the geographically if you look at our orders, when you out exchange it is down about 1%. So on that basis what you would see, the Europe was actually up a bit 2%, Asian orders were flat in the quarter, North America is down, Alex commented on the fact that service orders are up and equipment and controls were down, then where we are really seeing pulled out from an order perspective is Middle East and Latin America which tend to be lumpy in terms of large jobs and those were down by 27% and 29% respectively.","Alex Molinaroli","","The way I\u2019d look at those two is, when we say we are up 30% in the Middle East, I won\u2019t get excited about it and we say we are down 30% in the Middle East I won\u2019t get excited about that because these projects, one project could be almost the size of the entire backlog; these are very large and very lumpy.","Bruce McDonald","And maybe just to help you out a little bit on the margins, some margin, sub margins (inaudible) North America and Asia, we did see good margin. I don\u2019t have the numbers at the top of my head. On slide that Alex went through on building efficiency, you see that we did reference the fact that we continue to have some contract charges in the Middle East it\u2019s what we have had some in the previous quarter that will pull down the profitability of that segment, now we have headwinds in the quarter of a $0.02 this year.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. And I guess Global Workplace Solutions, I think you gave us a number, I guess we had last years and would you say the profits, could you refresh me? And you said, I think you\u2019ve said Global Workplace Solutions profit is good.","Alex Molinaroli","We said the profits were up 24%.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. I\u2019ve got the other.","Alex Molinaroli","Yes.","Unidentified Analyst","Thank you for the color.","Alex Molinaroli","Okay.","Bruce McDonald","Okay. All right thanks Ted.","Alex Molinaroli","Okay. So, I want to just wrap up. I appreciate everyone\u2019s great questions. And I wanted to once again thank our employees. There is a lot of opportunity for distractions in our business, a lot of the change going on but our employees\u2019 number one focus on execution and I think you see that in results. So we\u2019re going to continue to execute; we\u2019re going to continue to meet our commitments and that includes changing our portfolio and meeting our strategic objectives. So, I appreciate all the calls and look forward to talking to you next quarter.","Glen Ponczak","Okay. Thanks Alex, thanks Bruce. And thanks to all on the call for your interest.

He will be followed by Executive Vice President and Vice Chairman, Bruce McDonald, who will review of the business unit results and then Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Brian Stief will review the company\u2019s overall financial performance. Following those prepared remarks, we\u2019ll open the call for questions and we are scheduled to end at the top of the hour.","Before we begin, I\u2019d like to refer you to our full forward-looking statements disclosure and the news release. You can also find it in the slide deck and remind you that today\u2019s comments will include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual results to be materially different from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Those factors include potential impacts of the planned separation of the Automotive Experience business and business operations, assets or results. Required regulatory approvals that are material conditions for proposed transactions to close, the strength of U.S. or other economies, automotive vehicle production levels, mix and schedules, energy and commodity prices, availability of raw materials and component products, currency exchange rates and cancellation or changes to commercial contracts, as well as other factors discussed in Item 1A of Part I of Johnson Controls\u2019 most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2014. Johnson Controls disclaims any obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this presentation.","And with that, I will turn it over to Alex.","Alex Molinaroli","Alright. Good morning, everyone. I want to start by recognizing the fact that our employees, once again I feel like a broken record and it\u2019s fantastic to be able to say that our employees continue to deliver in an environment that externally has some mix markets and we will talk about that a bit, but probably more importantly for us through the significant amount of change that we are going through, our employees continue to deliver in each one of our businesses and I am particularly proud that our margins continue to improve lot of that from an perspective as we follow and implement our Johnson Controls operating system.","So, if we are on the first slide there that I have, we will start to talk about the markets. In a minute, I am going to talk about China. But for the most part, the markets are participating in a way and improving in a way except for China that we have been able to take advantage of and it\u2019s good for us both in buildings market and in our automotive market and in our battery market. And I have a slide here in a second we will talk about China specifically, but if you take a look at where we are and what I am particularly proud of, our revenue and backlog, we will talk a minute about building efficiency. We are starting to see particularly the strength in our institutional markets. Over the last year, I think it was either a year ago or 9 months ago, we talked about the fact that we saw our pipelines improving and consistently we are seeing growth in our markets and now we are starting to capture those opportunities. And I am happy to say the second quarter in a row we have got 6% once you adjust for ADTI and just for FX a 6% improvement in our secured line and a 5% improvement in our backlog. I asked Glen to look and see when was the last time we could talk about our backlog improving and the last time we had an improvement like this was the third quarter of 2012. So, we finally have turned the corner here.","The outlook for the next quarter also seemed strong as it relates to the secured business in the secured part of our income statement. And the reason I feel confident is that as we look at the institutional markets, where we mostly participate they seem to be healthy. And in fact what you will see is we have hired almost four dozen sales people in the last couple of months and we have got another four dozen, more to go in the next quarter. So, we are staffing up to capture the opportunities and it\u2019s a great opportunity and it\u2019s a great problem to have the fact that we need to staff up. We haven\u2019t been able to exercise that muscle for quite sometime.","The other thing that we will talk a little bit about this is that the battery business continues to perform quite well are the OE and aftermarket demand continues to be strong globally. We have increased sales in China and our AGM business for the last quarter actually increased 47%. And so if you start looking at the strategies that we put in place many years ago, we are starting to see the market come to us even outside of Europe. We will have a slide here in a second about China and you can see what the opportunity is, but the Power Solutions business is really clicking on all cylinders right now and are very proud of what they are accomplishing.","Also, the progress around our initiatives, the Yanfeng Interiors JV closed on July 2 and we will reconcile our numbers going forward. Brian will talk about that. The GWS sale is on track and we expect to close that here in the fourth quarter. And the Hitachi JV is expected to close early in the first quarter of 2016. So, all of the initiatives around portfolio are on track. And in fact I would say that looking back retrospectively we are doing as well or better than what I expected when we embarked on these initiatives.","Let\u2019s talk about China a bit because there has been a lot of noise around China, specifically as the market is slowing down, there is no doubt about that. But I want to talk about how that\u2019s impacting our business and how we are performing. So, if you go to Slide 5, we will start with Power Solutions. What we see when you look at the Power Solutions business, because the market is not only an OE business, but we are going to be able to participate in the growing aftermarket business. We see a CAGR of 8% to 9% through 2020 even with the slowdown in the OE business, because the aftermarket was growing so rapidly. For us, because of the future growth in AGM, we even see the market expanding much quicker than that. And in fact if you once more look at this year-to-date, we have 9 times the sales that we did a year ago for AGM in the year and we continue to see that part of our business growing significantly. And in fact, you will see here we have got a huge order with another OE customer that we are putting capacity in place for.","If you look at our aftermarket shift, it\u2019s 58% prior Q3 a year ago. And so you can see the capacity that we are putting in, in place. In fact, we recently announced I think in the last couple of weeks that we have located our plant for our third facility in Northern China in Shenyang and we continue to gain share in Power Solutions in China.","Talking about gaining share if you move to Automotive Experience, one of the things that we feel good about is that not only our position in the market with around 40% market share in seating, but we have the right customers and we certainly participate with the right programs. And there is no doubt as it relates to our partners, we have extremely strong partners. So, even though that we do acknowledge the market slowing down, we have the right mix of customers and the right mix of programs. And in fact, one of the things that you need to make sure that you understand you look at our business is we are in the passenger car business. And if you look at the numbers that people talk about as far as the market slowing down, the path of the business has not hit as hard as the overall market, particularly in the truck and third-party van business.","And in building efficiency, I am quite proud of what they have accomplished. Certainly, the market has been under some stress for quite some time. But if you look at our orders for Q3, our equipment business is up double-digit. Our controls business is up almost 50%. And we are growing an emerging service business, 16%. So, we are gaining share. This is in our York brand. And then when you see here on the slide I talked about VRF, Johnson Controls has a small position with our York branded VRF system, but this 10% also speaks to our future partner gaining a share of 10% in a very fast growing VRF market. So, our position in China is unique. I think that we are not immune to the market changing, but we are in a really good position. And all of our businesses are gaining share and really doing well based off of some of the activities that we put in place over the past few years.","So, let\u2019s talk about the real news of the today. So, I want to congratulate Bruce McDonald. Bruce have been named to be the new Chairman and CEO of the Automotive Spin [ph] Company that we expect will be completely separated and spend 12 months from now plus or minus. We believe that based on the work plan that we have that we will be able to get that accomplished in fiscal year 2016. And my belief about this business is that it \u2013 we are already being one of the largest automotive companies in the world, but I would certainly believe it will be, if not the best, one of the best automotive suppliers because I think we already are in the world. And I think that and in fact Bruce and his team will be able to take this business to new heights.","As we get more information we will continue to keep you updated. But I thought it was good for you, for our employees and for our ability to be able to move forward for us to bring some certainty around that. So we will \u2013 what we have to announce today is the path that were on. It doesn\u2019t preclude us being able to sell this business if it came up, but we are focused on making sure that we can control our own destiny and spend this business in fiscal year 2016. And I want to congratulate Bruce again, he is here and he is pretty interested in making sure that this works for us and for the remaining \u2013 the remaining Johnson Controls.","So I will conclude my remarks. I will come back later and talk about the quarter. Pretty impressive numbers with FX adjusted we saw growth of 5%. You can see our earnings per share of 15%, our segment income up 14%, 19% if you FX adjust. And then as I have talked about earlier, 120 basis points of margin improvement and that\u2019s been a consistent theme that we have been able to talk about over the last couple of years. And I see no reason that we won\u2019t be able to continue to expand margins.","So with that, I will turn it over to Bruce and we will talk about the business.","Bruce McDonald","Alright. Thank you, Alex and thanks for the kind words. So let me start with Slide #8 on building efficiency. You can see, if you look at the numbers here we had a nice quarter. Sales were up 5%, $2.7 billion. I think it\u2019s important to really look at the FX adjusted number. Here we can see that without foreign exchange, our revenues were up 10%, so double-digit increase in underlying revenues. To look at that kind of by region, North America \u2013 our North American business up about 4% and we are finally starting to see higher demand in the institutional markets. So for the last probably six quarters to eight quarters, we have been talking about how the HVAC market we have seen the smaller end of the market, the residential side picking up. And I think what\u2019s exciting here and Alex alluded to the fact that we are adding resources, program management and sales force is that we are finally starting to see the long awaited recovery of the institutional market, I think that\u2019s pretty noteworthy. Elsewhere around the world, Middle East is up 18%, still pretty soft in Europe, about down 1% and Latin America not surprisingly continues to be a problem for us, it was down 10%.","Orders for the quarter were up 9% if you take out foreign exchange and ADT, underlying orders were up 6% with really strong growth in local and state and federal government. Those were the vertical markets that really drove the growth in our orders in the quarter. Outside of North America, if we look at Asia, up 13%, the Middle East was up 11%, Europe down 1% and Latin America down 11%. Backlog is up about 5% at $4.7 billion if you adjust for foreign exchange. Regionally if you look at our backlog, North America was up 5%, Middle East was up 16%, Asia was up 9% with Latin America being down 19% and Europe being down 3%. So the Latin America and European we are not seeing any signs of recovery in those markets. But when you look at the overall total, North America key emerging markets for us, the strength is really stronger than the overall number.","Turning to segment income, you can see for the quarter, we are at $272 million, up 3%. This includes \u2013 ADT was in part of last year\u2019s quarter. So this is the last quarter you will see ADT results in one quarter, not in the previous year. So that will clean itself up. Margins, real strong at 10%, that\u2019s for those of you that follow Johnson Controls from a time know that our target margins for building efficiency is to get them for the 10% level. They were down about 20 basis points versus last year, but that really reflects the fact that we have to bring on the resource in anticipation of an improving growth outlook. So a good strong quarter for BE and margins of 10% are something that we are really happy about.","Turning to power solutions, sales were down 2%, again if you adjust for foreign exchange, here we are up about 6%. Led in the quarter really was an issue. It was pretty comparable from the top line perspective versus last year. Geographically our volumes were flattish in North America. Asia was up 8% and Europe really driven by the strength in the aftermarket. You know last year we said aftermarket demands have been somewhat constrained with channel destocking. If you just look at the year-over-year aftermarket growth in Europe, it was about 43%. And that\u2019s a poor comp last year, but also indicative of the fact we just continue to gain share in that market. Looking at it by OE versus aftermarket, OE was up 2% globally, aftermarket was up 7%.","Alex touched on AGM in China early on, but if you look at overall, our AGM growth was accelerating. That\u2019s pretty exciting, because that\u2019s the product that\u2019s really driving a lot of our margin expansion, so that 47% in the quarter to nearly $2.9 million. We have really seen growth in all regions. And one other things that we are starting to see now is because we have got a little bit of capacity we are able to start building up our aftermarket AGM business both as replacement, lot of units in the market that need replacement right now, but we are seeing our customers interested in AGM as a premium replacement battery. So that\u2019s pretty exciting for us. In terms of segment income, a great quarter here, looking it without foreign exchange, up nearly 30% to $234 million, really seeing the benefit of strong operating performance, higher volume and improved product mix, so great quarter for the power solutions here.","And lastly on Slide 10, we will flip you over to automotive. In terms of the auto business, it continues to deliver very strong results. In the quarter, again taking out exchange sales were up about 3%. And if you look at it geographically, we are down about 1% in North America against the industry being up 2% that kind of is the reflection of some of the new business that we were \u2013 or some business that we lost associated with some commercial issues, that just started to roll off against us. In Europe, on FX adjusted numbers our revenues were up 3% against the sort of flat production environment. In total Europe, but up 4% increase in Western Europe. And then in China, which we mostly do business by a non-consolidated joint ventures, you can see in the quarter our sales were up about 10% to $1.9 billion.","In terms of the our interiors joint venture, Alex talked about it early on but that business closed on July 2 and as a result as \u2013 on a go forward basis, the business will be accounted for an equity affiliate, so you will see the earnings flowing through in our consolidated results, but about $1 million of sales per quarter will be de-consolidated. So when you start just to look at the auto numbers here, the revenue will be down for the next three quarters year-over-year as a result of the de-consolidation.","Turning to segment income results, you can see our margins were up about 110 basis points to 6.5% versus 5% \u2013 or 110 basis points. If you look at interiors \u2013 that was seating, sorry seating was up 110 basis points to 6.5%. Looking at interiors you can see 5.8%, about 240 basis point improvement year-over-year. The turnaround in the interiors has been pretty breathtaking and kind of what you are seeing here is the benefit of us taking the restructuring actions in some of our loss making product lines and in some of our high cost country locations. So over the next 12 months we will be winding down the bits and pieces of interiors that did not get contributed to our joint venture. And you will start to see the strong results and the growth that we will see coming through from our global interiors business with Yanfeng.","So, with that, I will turn it over to Brian.","Brian Stief","Okay, thanks, Bruce and good morning, everyone. As you saw in our press release, our results from continuing operation included $26 million worth of transaction integration cost associated with the number of portfolio activities that we have going on and then also included a non-recurring tax charge of roughly $75 million related to some tax plan done in connection with the Interiors JV which closed on July 2. These items resulted in net charges in aggregate of $0.15 in the quarter.","As I talk through the financials, I will exclude the impact of these items in my comments. And in addition, you recall that our results from continuing operations will exclude GWS as we continue to report that as a discontinued operation. Overall, third quarter revenues were down 2% at $9.6 billion with higher revenues from Building Efficiency related primarily to the ADT acquisition offset by lower revenues in Power Solutions and auto. But as Bruce and Alex mentioned, each of our three businesses were impacted negatively by FX in the quarter, primarily the euro. If you exclude FX, our revenues in the quarter were up 5% and that\u2019s across all businesses showing year-over-year solid increases ranging from 3% to 10%.","If you look at gross profit for the quarter, it was 17.8%, which was up 170 basis points from the prior year. And that\u2019s really due to improved product mix and the ongoing benefits we are seeing from the implementation of the Johnson Controls Operating System. SG&A is up 2% year-over-year that relates primarily to building efficiency where we have got the ADT, SG&A in this quarter and it wouldn\u2019t have been in the prior year quarter. And as well we have added the sales personnel in North America that both Alex and Bruce referred to, to capture market growth opportunities. So overall, when you look at our SG&A line, our JCOS benefit some cost control efforts are really in line, if not exceeding our expectations. Equity income of $91 million was 3% higher than last year just a general reflection of improved profitability across most of our JVs. And overall, third quarter segment income was up 14% if you back or adjust for FX, it\u2019s up 19%. And segment income margins of 8.8% or 120 basis points better than last year\u2019s 7.6%.","So, turning to Slide 12, net financing charges of $75 million, or $8 million higher than the prior year. That simply reflects the financing cost associated with the ADT acquisition in June of 2014 as well as our ongoing share repurchase program. As far as our tax rate in 2015 and 2014, the underlying rate from continuing operations approximates 19% in both quarters. Income attributable to non-controlling interest is up $12 million and again that just reflects the improved profitability of our Power Solutions and Automotive consolidated joint ventures. So, overall a very strong third quarter across all of our businesses, diluted EPS at $0.91, a 15% improvement versus the $0.79 a year ago.","So, turning to Slide 13, I would like to spend just a few minutes reviewing our balance sheet and cash flow position as well as providing some guidance for Q4. If you look at our Q3 free cash flow of approximately $400 million, that\u2019s slightly behind plan and the prior year. However, this is due to one item, which was $170 million dividend that we expected to receive in Q3 from one of our unconsolidated automotive joint ventures and that\u2019s not lined up to receive that in Q4. So, it was simply timing. As far as year-to-date capital spending, $820 million is in line with our expectations. And based upon current forecast, I think we will be slightly below our CapEx plan of $1.3 billion for the year.","As everyone knows we embarked on a 3-year $1.2 billion per year share buyback program beginning in fiscal \u201814. Through Q3, we have now executed on $1 billion of our fiscal \u201815 plan of $1.2 billion. Trade working capital as a percentage of sales continues to improve and that\u2019s down 110 basis points year-over-year and this continues to be an area of focus and I think an opportunity for us as we move forward. Net debt to cap is 40.7% at the end of the third quarter. And given our free cash flow and divestiture proceeds in Q4, we expect that percentage to be in the low to mid 30s by the end of the fiscal year. So, as we look into Q4, we expect to receive about $1.3 billion in net proceeds from the sale of the GWS business to CBRE and we continue to target approximately $1.5 billion in free cash flow for the full fiscal year.","As far as our Q4 guidance, the range is now $1 to $1.3, which will result in $3.38 to $3.41 for the full year, excluding transaction and integration costs and any other non-recurring items. And our Q4 guidance now assumes the euro is at 110 versus the 105 we assumed in previous guidance, that benefit is going to be substantially offset by some increased commodity prices and some other currency exposures that we see in Q4. So, in summary, we are very pleased with the Q3 results. We have seen strong performance across each of our businesses and we continue to meet our financial commitments even during a period of significant portfolio change and a number of internal initiatives. Building efficiencies year-over-year improvement in orders secured is a very positive sign and we continue to see the strength in the North America institutional market. As Alex mentioned backlog at $4.7 billion, an increase of 5% is the first time that we have seen that since Q3 of 2012.","Year-over-year segment margin improvement of 120 basis points reflects our commitment to reduce cost and the implementation of the Johnson Controls Operating System. And I think we have talked about the portfolio changes that we are making, all of those we have now got really line of sight to complete within calendar year 2016. So with that, Glen, we can open up for questions.","Glen Ponczak","Actually, we are ready to take some questions. I would ask everyone to limit their questions to your best and follow-up. And if you got other things to ask, please get back in the queue, so we give more people an opportunity to participate. Ashley?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Mr. Emmanuel Rosner. Sir, your line is open.","Emmanuel Rosner","Hi, good morning everybody.","Alex Molinaroli","Hi, Emmanuel.","Emmanuel Rosner","So many things to talk about. Let\u2019s maybe start with the spin-off decision. I was a little bit surprised to see such a rapid decision just over a month after you sort of announced that you were exploring strategic options. Can you maybe talk to us about the decision process maybe the rationale to spin-off the business as opposed to maybe selling it? And you see it back from your automaker customer so far.","Alex Molinaroli","Yes, that\u2019s a great question. So, actually it was not too tough a decision. If you think about the size of that business and the natural buyers of that business, we have the opportunity to spin the last bit speaking to those potential buyers and understanding what the real opportunity is. And it came very clear to us that we needed to make sure that we focused on the spin. And just like I said in my comments, it\u2019s possible you could still sell, but we need to provide the same amount of work in order to make the spin decision. And I think our customers also needed to have some certainty about what it is that we were going to do, particularly our Chinese customers, because as you know we have many partnerships in China and uncertainty is just not a good thing. So, I think for us and our employees and for our customers and our partners in China, it made sense for us to make this decision. And quite frankly because of the resources that we have on our GWS transaction, our JV with Yanfeng, we have the resources right now to transfer on to this project right now and so it just made sense.","Emmanuel Rosner","Okay, that\u2019s clear. And just switching gear quickly, I wanted to ask you about building efficiency services, in particular, I was a little bit surprised to see your service revenues which are now ex-GWS down quite significantly year-over-year. I think you have been running at $900 plus million a quarter for the past. So far this year as well as last year the same quarter and now this fell sort of like to the $700 million type of range. And so I was curious what maybe happening in services ex-GWS and also why your margins overall down year-over-year, a little bit despite revenue growth?","Alex Molinaroli","Yes. So, I will need to look at the numbers on service. Without having \u2013 without getting to some of the specifics, it could be some of our services. We went through a process with GWS as we went through the disposition to decide what part of our service business belong with GWS and what part of it with building efficiency as there is nothing underlying this exchange. So, we will follow up on that, but my guess is it has something to do with how we parsed out what meant the GWS and what stayed with the buildings business. But I will validate that. Nothing \u2013 just rest assured, nothing has really radically happened differently around our service business. And in fact what I would tell you is our service business particularly is driven by North America. The margins are up. Our renewal rates are up. And so I don\u2019t think we have any deterioration of that business. I think as it relates to the overall margins of the business and I think you are talking about a year-on-year basis, Brian went through some of the specifics, but one of the things and I did signal this last quarter is that we were going to be staffing up in advance of the growth of the market. And then quite frankly, I will be honest with you not that I would like to see the margins under pressure, but we are having a hard time hiring at the pace that we need to hire in order to capitalize on the opportunities for next year. So, I do expect that we will be hiring in anticipation of the market, because you remember, our business which might be different than some of our competitors, most of our sales go through brands or company-owned operations, so that SG&A cost hits us immediately.","Emmanuel Rosner","Great, thank you very much.","Operator","Okay. Our next question comes from the line of Colin Langan. Your line is open.","Alex Molinaroli","Hi, Colin.","Colin Langan","Great, thanks for taking my questions. I was hoping to get some color on the joint ventures in Auto Experience in China. Can you give us any color on the size of the EBIT margin for those joint ventures, if there is any cash stuck in those joint ventures, do you know what their balance sheet look like? And all we really have is the net income.","Alex Molinaroli","So, this goes really good. I am going to turn this over to Bruce.","Bruce McDonald","Yes. As we have gone through this process, I think one of the things that sort of become apparent from a valuation perspective is we are not doing a good job giving the analyst community a lot of color around our Chinese joint ventures. And from a valuation perspective, we are probably not getting the full valuation there, but I can tell you that I would think for \u2013 I am not so sure we can pull together from the next quarter, but definitely by the time we put together our analyst presentation here in the December timeframe, we will provide a lot more clarity there. They are accretive to overall automotive and otherwise the business, the joint ventures of higher margins, not in our base business. But generally speaking, if joint ventures have any debt, it\u2019s nominal, but net-net there is a significant cash balance in the JV. It\u2019s probably in the $700 million to $1 billion range.","Colin Langan","Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. And any color on the cost savings program that was announced with any opportunity there to get margins to your targets a little bit faster?","Alex Molinaroli","Color on the cost reduction activity initiative?","Bruce McDonald","So, I think as it relates to the Johnson Controls Operating System, I think in the last call we mentioned that we were going to get about $50 million of run-rate benefit in fiscal \u201815 and there would also be another $125 million in run-rate benefit in 2016. And in addition to that, we announced in the press release and maybe this is also what you are referring to that we were going to be looking at really a cost savings review here in the fourth quarter. And those activities are really being done in conjunction with looking at the separation of auto and standing up both those companies as separate public companies and to see whether there is some operating model changes or cost savings that can come out of that process. So, that\u2019s something that we will look at beginning immediately and will probably take place and take action on throughout the next 12 months or so.","Alex Molinaroli","Yes, we are bringing more information to you about that. This is Alex. I am sure you are referring to what was in the press release. As we go through separation process, it\u2019s going to be clear that we need to take the opportunity in advantage of not only setting up a new automotive company with the proper operating systems and cost structure, but we need to do the same thing for remaining Johnson Controls. And so that\u2019s what you are referring to. We don\u2019t have anymore information on that, but you can expect to hear more.","Colin Langan","Okay, alright. Thank you very much.","Alex Molinaroli","Welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mr. Robert Barry. Sir, your line is open.","Robert Barry","Hey, guys. Good morning.","Alex Molinaroli","Good morning.","Bruce McDonald","Good morning.","Robert Barry","Hey, Bruce congrats on the new role. Quick actually housekeeping item, could you give us or maybe I missed the North America orders in BE?","Alex Molinaroli","Yes, I think that \u2013 North American orders in BE up 8%.","Bruce McDonald","8%.","Robert Barry","Got it. Thank you. And then also I had a quick follow-up on the spin, I know it\u2019s still early, but just your thoughts on the anticipated balance sheet at auto and whether the plan is contemplating any kind of dividend back to JCI?","Alex Molinaroli","There will be a dividend back to JCI. We are still working through what the proper leverage is, but you can expect that we will make sure that the automotive business is in a position to compete. So, it would be similar to its peers.","Robert Barry","Got it. And then just given how much advancement you have made in some of the portfolio initiatives, I guess I would expect M&A to start to become a larger part of the story you have alluded to that in some of the comments. Maybe just provide an update on what the M&A pipeline looks like and in particular the size of some of the deals in there and what the timing is on when we might see something of size in BE or Power?","Bruce McDonald","Yes, so that\u2019s a great question. And I don\u2019t think that we can answer it to fulfill you. But I can tell you that as busy as we are on the things that we are talking about as we are just as busy and the things that we are not able to talk about, but we are looking at deals that will complement us from a product standpoint will help us geographically and shore up some of the technical product challenges that we have. So, we have plenty in the pipeline. And I would say, they span the gamut from being bolt on to being things that are transformational.","Robert Barry","Got it. And then maybe just one last housekeeping item, what\u2019s the net impact that you expect from the interiors kind of income going out of the P&L versus picking up the 30% ownership in the JV? Is that relatively neutral or is\u2026","Alex Molinaroli","It\u2019s neutral.","Bruce McDonald","The equity, 30% of the JV is pretty close to 100% of the remaining parts.","Alex Molinaroli","Yes, I think the difference is going to be as we move forward and we pick up the joint ventures income on an equity basis, you end up where you pick that up on an after-tax basis. So, there is going to be essentially a flip between segment income and our tax rate as it relates to how we look at the Interiors joint venture income.","Robert Barry","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Okay. Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Josh Pokrzywinski. Sir, your line is open.","Josh Pokrzywinski","Hi, good morning guys.","Alex Molinaroli","Hi, guys.","Josh Pokrzywinski","So, just on some of the comments you made on moving the staff up in BE and I guess that\u2019s pressuring the margins in the short-term. But how long should we think of the staffing drag weighing on the margin expansion? And then given that you are seeing budding strength, particularly in North American institutional where you have always had a big presence. How should we think about the leverage on the North American institutional web recovery, maybe X some of these staffing up periods, but more ongoing as we get into late \u201815 or I guess late calendar \u201915, \u201816 and beyond?","Alex Molinaroli","Yes. So, I think that as I said we have some variable cost, because of the sales staffing and it\u2019s going to be in advance. I think without being able to put numbers on that, I don\u2019t have a calculator in front of me, but what I would say is over the next [Technical Difficulty] is going to be a little bit of a catch-up, so make sure they catch up to the marketplace. And then we should see, because remember we are selling and then our backlog is about a 6 month \u2013 it\u2019s about a 6-month backlog before we usually start to see the income from that. So that\u2019s when you will start to see the leverage and we won\u2019t be seeing the sales \u2013 the sales headcount as just a cost, we will be seeing that as. We will start seeing the earnings from that. I don\u2019t know that I have that exact leverage in front of you but you can expect some margin expansion. Today we are seeing the margin expansion based on the back of our cost profile. We should start seeing some margin expansion based off of our top line.","Bruce McDonald","Yes maybe add a bit to that. I mean we have already sort of talked about those who have been around for a while that our margin improvement trajectory in building efficiency being sort of 50 or 60 basis points a year and over the last couple of years, we have seen growth a lot stronger than that which we attributed to the fact that in a normal business environment, we have to add project managers, people that can do the work on an installation business. And so in weak times, we saw margins growing a lot quicker than that that, that 50 basis points to 60 basis points was a result of some of the improvement activities that we are doing. And here for the next couple of quarters, you are going to see a little bit of lower than that because of the sort of headwind that we have which is absolutely necessary to grow the installation business. So we can\u2019t grow the installation business without putting the resource and training them in advance.","Josh Pokrzywinski","Those two more quarters of that or how should we think about how long this?","Alex Molinaroli","So the way that I would think about it is, look at hopefully continuing adding sales resources, but it\u2019s going to take us a couple of quarters to take advantage of the backlog we just put in place. And two quarters the backlog that you just see, the 5% up backlog, is when we will start to see that flow through. And that\u2019s when we will see that at least the effect of the initial hiring behind us and we should see it more of an ongoing hiring as revenues continue to grow. So I think we have got a couple of quarters before we see the real benefit of the sales people that were put in place today. We should see in the backlog but we won\u2019t see in the income statement.","Bruce McDonald","I don\u2019t think what we will see it in the next few quarters. We are going to see margin contraction. That\u2019s not the takeaway here. The takeaway is we are doing a lot of things to grow our margins in all the three of our businesses that we expect to continue. This is a little bit of the headwind against that.","Alex Molinaroli","Yes, two quarters out from now then we should be able to attribute our margin improvement not just from our operating efficiencies but also because of the fact we will have some volumes, right.","Josh Pokrzywinski","Alright, that\u2019s helpful. Thanks guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Johnny Wright. Sir your line is open.","Johnny Wright","Hi guys. Thanks for taking the question. Alex just looking at the slide you gave on China is very helpful and sort of putting out the color longer term actually maybe just talk a little bit about what you are seeing right now in China, next couple of quarters and how you are going to see the auto demand playing out over the second half of the calendar year?","Alex Molinaroli","I think what we see talking to our customers, remember we are talking about passenger vehicles, is that we see the market is going to be growing out about a 6% clip. And we continue to see that and remember for us because we have got some of the right customer some of the right program and we are gaining share in metals, we should be able to continue to outpace that.","Bruce McDonald","So I was in China last week and so maybe I will just add a bit more stories from Ground Zero there. If you look at the passenger curve looks for 2016, so for our next fiscal year, I just anticipate that being in about the 6% range. If you look at our business mix and by that, I mean we tend to be very strong in the premium brands. We don\u2019t have stronger share in the Chinese loan brands or with the Japanese that are doing well in the market. Our production volume based on that 6% for 2016 we anticipate being up 8% to 9%. And then like Alex said, on top of that, we still have some incremental programs, market share wins and the penetration of our metals business. So we still \u2013 we feel like with the industry work is now we are well positioned to continue to drive double-digit growth for 2016.","Johnny Wright","Okay, great. Thanks. And then just on free cash flow, I know we are taking $1.5 billion for \u201815, but given the CapEx now $100 million to $150 million low than you originally expected, what are kind of the puts and takes in the operating cash flow lines versus your original expectations for the\u2026?","Alex Molinaroli","So, I think the $1.5 billion is still our target for the year in order to get to that target we are going to have to generate free cash flow in the fourth quarter of roughly about $1.4 billion. We have got plans to do that I would say there are some opportunities that we still have in the trade working capital area and also be benefited by the dividend that I mentioned earlier that did not come in Q3 but will come in Q4. So we are going to be pretty close to that $1.5 billion number I wouldn\u2019t expect any significant movement either up or down from that number.","Johnny Wright","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Brian Johnson. Sir your line is open.","Brian Johnson","Yes, good morning. Want to talk a bit about BE in China. You posted some fairly healthy order numbers A couple of things, when would those come through? Is there anything difference around the conversion and backlog in revenue? Just second, given the slowdown in the China economy, where is that coming from? Are there segments of the Chinese institutional market that you are better exposed, are you gaining share in the segments that you are in and just how you are able to get that order pace?","Alex Molinaroli","I don\u2019t know that I would call it episodic, but the fact that we are able to see it across our equipment business and our controls business and our service business I think it has a lot to do with some of the operating models and the changes that we are making as it relates to how we are going to market in some of the cities that are Tier 2 while we have been focused in Tier 1 cities. I don\u2019t know that our backlog is much different in the rest of the world than it does in North America. And the reason is because we are selling the same products. I am hopeful and I believe that, that will change over time. It will be a lot more rapid as you bring on Hitachi product line since you remember that\u2019s a different product and a light commercial product line, and that market is actually going quicker. So I don\u2019t know that I will be able to be a whole lot of color except that about the market as much as this is more about us and I think how aggressive we have been in the marketplace to gain share. I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s about the marketplace I think it\u2019s more about us. And I would expect as soon as we are able to bring Hitachi on board to be able to see the benefits of being able to participate in the VRF market, which we see is growing almost 10%.","Brian Johnson","Okay. And just where are you in that expansion to second and the third tier cities as well in terms of building out the brand for whatever structure using branch distribution are there more cities to come?","Alex Molinaroli","Absolutely. I think we are in the early stages, as it relates to the opportunity particularly as we get more products because as you move further and further away from Tier 1 cities, you need a broader set of products particularly at the light commercial and we really just haven\u2019t had that full complement of products. So I think we are going to have even more impetus around that. We have got a long way to go.","Brian Johnson","And on North American HVAC, you are definitely seeing orders picking up. But how long do you think this recovery could last? Is this just a kind of bounce off the bottom or do you see any structural tailwind in your institutional markets?","Alex Molinaroli","I just think \u2013 this is Alex. I think by its nature the fact that it\u2019s happening in the institutional market is usually a much more of a structural than some of the commercial markets. So I think when we are seeing the institutional and government money being spent, I mean, I think the thing to keep our eye on is health care because it has grown some and I would say if there is anything that would be less certain and less predictable is what\u2019s going to happen in the health care market. But if you look at the local government, schools, state government, those seem to be pretty strong in the pipeline strong. So I think that we are in a good cycle for those markets. For health care, I would never consider a victory yet because I think that market is still under a bunch of change, but we are seeing improvement but I don\u2019t know that if I would consider it a victory.","Brian Johnson","Okay, final quick housekeeping question, Power Solutions, China, can you kind of update us on the OEM versus aftermarket split there and how you see that developing?","Bruce McDonald","Yes. Brian its Bruce here I think Glen will follow-up with specific numbers. But I think what we are sort of giving you that commentary here on the market. I think the most noteworthy thing that we are seeing is we have talked about this last couple of quarters, but really rapid acceleration in AGM demand from the customers. We were awarded just in this quarter a $1.4 million unit order. We talked on our last couple \u2013 on our last call around that we are adding AGM production in the north plant, where we are looking to do sort of half AGM and half SOI. It\u2019s looking like we are going to have to pivot away from that and put in all AGMs. So, lot of customer interest in the AGM product line and that\u2019s great for us.","Glen Ponczak","We do have, it\u2019s Glen here, on aftermarket in China, it\u2019s somewhere between 45 million and 50 million units today going to somewhere around 80 million by the end of the decade, Brian. And we think our share goes by 40% of our business being aftermarket to like 60% of our business being aftermarket only at the same timeframe.","Brian Johnson","Okay. Okay, thanks.","Operator","Okay. Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Rod Lache. Sir, your line is open.","Pat Nolan","Good morning, everyone. It\u2019s actually Pat Nolan on for Rod.","Alex Molinaroli","Okay.","Pat Nolan","A couple of quick questions just to follow-up on that last year\u2019s questions on the healthcare side of the business. Can you just refresh us, because it seems like that part is actually not growing, how big of your business today is just healthcare, not institutional, just healthcare?","Alex Molinaroli","About $1 billion, $1.5 billion, something like that.","Bruce McDonald","Yes, I was going to say it\u2019s around 20% overall, but we could get back to you to specific numbers.","Pat Nolan","Okay, that would be perfect. And to switch gears a little bit, on the Power Solutions business, it seems like you are getting incrementally more positive on the gross and AGM. How does that play into the 5% to 6% annual growth that you have been expecting over the mid-term? Do you think that could potentially push you beyond that target or push towards the high-end? How do you think about that expanding growth in that context?","Alex Molinaroli","That\u2019s a good question. I think we have \u2013 just to be completely honest, I think that we have been caught off guard with how fast the AGM market has grown in the last couple of quarters. As you can tell as we talk about the orders that we have received in China, the growth that we are now seeing in North America we had been expecting at some point, but it\u2019s really come very quickly. So, I don\u2019t know that we have those exact numbers. It\u2019s something that we need to pull together, but you could probably tell by the way that in reacting we are adding capacity at a rate that we didn\u2019t actually expect even a year ago. So, good question. I think we probably owe everyone some follow-up, but the bottom line is really good news for our business, because our position in the AGM market is significant.","Bruce McDonald","It\u2019s still probably somewhat smallish as far as moving the needle even without acceleration here early on at least, because I mean we are talking about 10, 11 million units in \u201815 here, as we exit \u201815 out of 140 million units total. So, while the percentage is moving and it probably doesn\u2019t have an impact, it\u2019s not like it\u2019s going to move at multiple points.","Pat Nolan","Got it. Thanks so much, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Joe Spak. Sir, your line is open.","Joe Spak","Thanks, everyone. Maybe just one more on AGM, while we are talking about it, you sort of talk about the profitability on those units being about 3x of that asset. It\u2019s been a while since we heard an update on that. Is that still \u2013 is that what you have been realizing and is that still sort of the right way to think about that profit mix?","Alex Molinaroli","It hasn\u2019t changed. Yes, same, so still 3x the profit dollars I believe is what we have talked about it.","Bruce McDonald","And I think \u2013 I have made some comments about we are starting to see some aftermarket growth here. So, I think there is an opportunity to improve on that as we go forward.","Joe Spak","Right. And then I know it\u2019s too early to think about \u2013 maybe it\u2019s too early to think about the pressure on the auto spend, but what about the other side of that? Any thoughts on what the leverage opportunity is on remaining JCI?","Alex Molinaroli","On the \u2013 so, I don\u2019t think we are ready to talk about the capital structure. But what I would tell you is that we will \u2013 regardless of what the dividend side is we will be in a very good position to make \u2013 to need to make those choices around capital structure, but what we do is with a very, very strong balance sheet.","Joe Spak","Okay. And then quickly on \u2013 I appreciate all the color on China, specifically with the controls growth you are showing there on the order side, is that related to sort of the build out you are talking about in the other tier cities or because that\u2019s mostly goes with new construction as opposed to retrofit, is that correct?","Alex Molinaroli","Yes. So, I will just be 100% honest. When I saw those numbers, that can\u2019t be just \u2013 that has to be some unique success that we have had with the quarter, certainly not the marketplace. So, I don\u2019t want to make something up to know why those numbers are as high as they are, but I think it\u2019s just representation as why we wanted to bring it is that we are seeing it across all of our product lines. I don\u2019t know they have a lot more information on that exactly why it\u2019s so much different than our equipment business.","Joe Spak","Okay, alright. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Okay. Our next question comes from the line of Rich Kwas. Your line is open.","Rich Kwas","Hi, good morning, everyone.","Alex Molinaroli","Hi, Rich.","Rich Kwas","Just, Alex, on the \u2013 so, on the proceeds, the net proceeds from GWS $1.3 billion, you got Hitachi you are going to make the payment for that here in the next quarter or so. The remaining funds how should we think about that? I know M&A is the focal point, but what\u2019s the appetite to do incremental buyback above and beyond what you outlined?","Alex Molinaroli","Yes. So, I will turn this over to Brian in a second, but from a strategic standpoint, I think that when we start embarked on this, hopefully we demonstrated that we are going to make what\u2019s the right choice not only for where we are at the moment, but also strategically. And it\u2019s probably going to have a lot to do with where we are with some of our opportunities for investment, but we do recognize that we will have an opportunity to maybe change the pace at which we do some of the buybacks if we choose to.","Brian Stief","Yes. I think, if you look at the $1.3 billion, Rich and then it\u2019s roughly $500 million investment we will make in Hitachi joint venture that leaves you with $800 million. Couple areas that we are going to be looking at, we have got potentially a pension contribution that we could make on a discretionary basis to essentially get the plans funded at the level we have historically targeted. We are going to have in the fourth quarter here through the adoption of some new mortality tables about a $200 million increase in our liability. So, we may use some of the proceeds to pre-fund the pension. There is also certainly in the share repurchase area we have got $200 million left on this year\u2019s program and we could pull some forward potentially from next year\u2019s $1.2 billion. And then there is also some moving parts just relative to tax payments. So, I would say, we are kind of \u2013 we are going to look at various options there and we will see certainly keep our flexibility.","Rich Kwas","Would the discretionary investment be matched at $200 million increase in the liability be more than that?","Brian Stief","The $200 million is right now what we think the ballpark increase in the liability from the new mortality tables.","Rich Kwas","Okay. So you would match that and then go from there.","Brian Stief","Yes.","Rich Kwas","Okay. And then just the couple of housekeeping items, Brian, the $1.5 billion of free cash, does that include the $150 million from GWS?","Brian Stief","We include what?","Alex Molinaroli","The $150 million from the joint ventures.","Rich Kwas","I thought GWS generated about $150 million in annual cash flows. So, does the $1.5 million include that? Does it include the disc ops?","Brian Stief","Yes, it does. Yes.","Rich Kwas","Okay, alright. And then for the fourth quarter, you cited in terms of the guidance commodities, I just wanted to get some additional color on that given that metals prices have come down and I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s material?","Brian Stief","Yes, I think its diesel cost is what we are looking at. And then from a currency standpoint, the real or kind of the two items that seem to be offsetting the benefit of going from 105 to 110 in the euro.","Rich Kwas","Okay, okay. Thank you.","Glen Ponczak","I think actually we are done here, because we are at the top of the hour. Alex, any concluding remarks?","Alex Molinaroli","Yes. I just want to once again thank our employees for not only the incredible performance that they have provided, but all the support that they are giving us is as we move forward with this transformation to accomplish an awful lot, we have got more to do. And I think our employees are not only are they actually making this happen, but I think they are very proud of what they have been able to accomplish and they should be. Thank you.","Glen Ponczak","Great. Thanks, everybody. Kathy and I are available for the balance of the day with any follow-ups that you have got. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. That concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you all for participating.

This conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. I will now like to turn over the call to Antonella Franzen, Vice President and Chief Investor Relations and Communications Officer.","Antonella Franzen","Good morning and thank you for joining our conference call to discuss Johnson Controls third quarter fiscal 2019 results. The press release and all related tables issued earlier this morning as well as the conference call slide presentation can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our Website at johnsoncontrols.com. With me today are Johnson Controls' Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, George Oliver; and our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Brian Stief.","Before we begin, I would like to remind you that during the course of today's call, we will be providing certain forward-looking information. We ask that you review today's press release and read through the forward-looking cautionary informational statements that we've included there. In addition, we will use certain non-GAAP measures in our discussions, and we ask that you read through the sections of our press release that address the use of these items. In discussing our results during the call, references to adjusted EBITA and adjusted EBIT margins exclude restructuring and integration costs as well as other special items. These metrics are non-GAAP measures and are reconciled in the schedules attached to our press release, and in the appendix to the presentation posted on our Website.","The results of Power Solutions for the month April are reported as discontinued operations. The focus of this call will be on continuing operations. GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to Johnson Controls ordinary shareholders was $0.16 for the quarter and included a net charge of $0.49 related to special items which Brian will address in his comments. Adjusting for these special items non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.65 per share compared to $0.54 in the prior year quarter.","Now let me turn the call over to George.","George R. Oliver","Thanks Antonella and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us on today's call. I'm going to start with a few strategic highlights from the quarter beginning on Slide 3. Looking at our results for the quarter as a whole we remain encouraged by the ongoing progress we've seen over the last several quarters. We delivered another strong quarter of organic revenue, order and backlog growth and also delivered on our commitment to generate $600 million in adjusted free cash flow. These results reflect the continued emphasis on driving underlying fundamentals focused on innovation and new product development, talent management, enhancing commercial excellence across the organization, and optimizing our cost structure. ","As I think about the reinvestments we have made and continue to make to support future growth I am confident that we are strategically strengthening our market position. As we highlighted in the examples we provided to you last quarter our objective to lead the evolution of smarter, more efficient, and more sustainable buildings and infrastructure is coming more into focus every day. In pursuit of developing our strategy in connected buildings we are actively partnering with our customers, technology providers, and integrators to create comprehensive digital solutions with attractive value propositions that assist our customers in achieving their goals and missions. Our broad portfolio of smart edge devices, connected equipment and systems in cloud based data analytics capabilities provide Johnson Controls the unique competitive advantage as the industry begins this transition.","With the closing of the Power Solutions sale at the end of April our ongoing portfolio transformation will be focused on optimizing the alignment of our portfolio with our longer-term strategic vision around connected buildings and infrastructure. For example, this quarter we made the decision to divest a business within our air distribution portfolio which was deemed to be non-core.","Lastly we made significant progress on the deployment of the Power Solutions proceeds successfully completing both the equity and debt tender. Brian will provide you more details later in the call but we redeploy nearly two thirds of the $11.6 billion within 45 days of completing the transaction between the $4 billion share tender and the $3.4 billion of debt paid down. More to come on that but I am extremely pleased with the execution from our teams on returning capital to our shareholders.","Turning to orders on Slide 4, order growth returned to the mid to high single-digit range as expected with organic growth of 6% in the quarter on top of 8% growth last year. Our order pipeline remains robust with an attractive mix of service and a balanced profile of small and large projects. Our short [ph] cycle book to bill ratio was up slightly in the quarter. Brian will provide more details on order performance by segment but from a high level we continue to see good underlying growth in our core HVAC and Fire & Security end markets across most of our regions. Although we are continuing to monitor the macro uncertainty our end markets generally remain healthy and we are well positioned to continue to gain share. Backlog ended the quarter at $9 billion up 7% organically versus the prior year which supports our Q4 revenue assumptions and also provide better visibility into 2020.","Turning now to Slide 5, let me provide a quick recap of the financial results for the quarter, sales of $6.5 billion increased 6% on an organic basis with solid growth across all four segments. Adjusted EBIT of $809 million grew 7% on a reported basis which includes a headwind from FX of approximately $20 million in the quarter. Adjusted EBIT grew 11% on an organic basis driven by solid 7% growth in segment profit as well as lower corporate expense. ","I would note that segment EBITR margins came in a bit below what we were expecting in the quarter due to mix in our North America business. Brian will provide more color on North America and I will provide updated guidance later in the call. Overall underlying EBIT margins expanded 60 basis points year-over-year excluding the impact of FX and M&A. Adjusted EPS of $0.65 increased 20% over the prior year driven by solid top line performance as well as the initial benefits from the capital deployment actions related to the utilization of proceeds from the Power Solution sale.","Adjusted free cash flow of just over $600 million in the quarter represents conversion of 109% and brings our year-to-date free cash flow to nearly $650 million keeping us on track to reach our targeted 95% conversion for the year. With that I will turn it over to Brian to discuss our performance in more detail.","Brian J. Stief","Thanks George and good morning everyone. So starting on Slide 6 let's take a look at our year-over-year EPS bridge, operational performance including synergy and productivity save contributed $0.10 which was partially offset by $0.02 of continued product investments in the fiscal 2018 run rate sales force additions we have talked about in prior quarters. Other below the line items contributed a net $0.03 to our Q3 results of $0.65 which was up 20% year-on-year. ","Moving to Slide 7 let's review our segment results on a consolidated basis. Sales of 6.5 billion increased 6% led by 7% growth in products and 5% growth in our field businesses. During the quarter we saw solid service growth in North America and tempered growth in EMEA\/LA and APAC. Overall service growth was 2% in Q3 and we continued to convert our project backlog with installation revenue up 6% led by solid growth across all regions.","Segment EBITDA of 992 million grew 7% driven by volume leverage from our field and products businesses as well as productivity and synergy save. Q3 segment EBIT margin provided 20 basis points to 15.4% as volume leveraged across our businesses, favorable mix in global products, and synergy and productivity save is partially offset by a 30 basis points headwind related to mix in North America that George mentioned. As you can see in our margin waterfall, underlying operational improvement contributed 60 basis points which was partially offset by continued product and run rate sales force investments. ","Now let's take a look at each of the segments in more detail, so starting with North America on Slide 8, sales group 4% driven by continued strength in both installed and service which were up 4% and 3% respectively. Q3 growth was led by strong high single-digit growth in our applied HVAC and controls businesses as we saw double-digit increase in Applied Equipment sales. Our Fire & Security service and installed businesses grew low single-digits on a tough prior year compared to 7%. Our performance solutions business declined high single-digits in the quarter.","Adjusted EBITDA declined 3% and EBITDA margin decreased 90 basis points to 13.3%. Benefits from synergy and productivity save as well as volume leverage were more than offset by unfavorable mix within the individual platforms and the year-over-year impact of our run rate sales force additions. So just to comment on mix as this was a primary driver of the North American margin headwind we saw in the quarter. You may remember that in Q3 last year we benefited from very favorable mix in our North America segment. This was a result of a higher margin Fire & Security businesses growing at a faster pace than our HVAC business. Additionally within Fire & Security our high margin retail business had a very strong Q3 last year driven by several large shipments to big box retailers. ","In this year's quarter in addition to install growing at a faster rate than service we also saw our HVAC businesses grow faster than our higher margin Fire & Security business. In total mix was a 90 basis points headwind to North America's year-over-year margin rate, as expected orders in North America were very strong in the quarter increasing 6%. Orders for Applied Equipment were up low double-digits aided by a strong rebound in equipment but this was also on an easier prior year compare. You may recall we had a decline in equipment orders in Q2 due primarily to the timing impact of price increases between the years. Year-to-date HVAC equipment orders are up most double-digits. Fire & Security field orders were relatively flat in the quarter while our performance solutions business saw order growth of over 20%. North American backlog of 5.7 billion increased 6% year-over-year. ","Now let's turn to Slide 9 and we saw another solid quarter from [indiscernible]. Sales grew 6% with service up 2% and a strong and strong install up 10%. Growth was positive in most regions and across most lines of business with the only soft spot being in the Middle East HVAC. We saw Europe grow high single-digits led by mid single-digit growth in our Fire & Security businesses which accounts for two thirds of our revenues in region as well as mid teens growth in industrial refrigeration and low double-digit growth in HVAC. Orders in Europe increased high single-digits led by strong demand in IR and Fire & Security.","In the Middle East revenues declined mid single-digits as modest growth in service activity was more than offset by softness in HVAC project installations and in Latin America revenues increased low double-digits lead by strength in Fire & Security. Adjusted EBITDA increased 14% and EBITDA margin expanded 60 basis points to 11.2% and this includes a 30 basis points headwind from foreign currency. Similar to the past few quarters underlying margins increased 90 basis points in EMEA\/LA as favorable volume and productivity in synergy save more than offset the sales force additions. Orders in EMEA\/LA increased 8% led by continued strength in Europe and Latin America across both service and installation and EMEA\/LA backlog ended the quarter at $1.7 billion up a strong 11%.","Moving to APAC on Slide 10, sales grew 6% led by higher demand for project installations which grew 9% in the quarter. Install activity was led by continued strength in our core HVAC and BMS platforms with sales in China up mid single-digits. Sales for our core service offerings grew 1% in the quarter which included high single-digit growth in China. Adjusted EBITDA increased 4% with margins now at 14.2% as we saw favorable volume leverage partially offset by the higher install mix and run rate sales force additions. Asia Pacific orders increased 1%, a strong service growth of 10% was substantially offset by mid single-digit decline in installation orders due primarily to the timing of some certain project awards. APACs backlog increased 7% year-over-year to 1.6 billion.","So moving to Slide 11, overall global product sales increased a strong 7% on top of the 7% growth in the prior year quarter. Let's take a look at the pieces. BMS once again grew low double-digits with continued strength across all three platforms; controls, security, and fire detection. Sales across our HVAC and IR equipment businesses grew mid single-digits. Global residential HVAC grew mid single-digits in the quarter. North America residential HVAC revenue increased mid single-digits on a low double-digit compare benefiting primarily from strong price realization and favorable mix. I would note that volumes were down low single-digits in the quarter given the negative impact from the cooler weather.","Looking to Q4 although July weather has been more favorable, channel inventories at the end of June were relatively high and our business grew just over 20% in Q4 last year. Our light commercial unitary business grew high single-digits in the quarter with North America also up high single-digits. IR equipment declined low double-digits in the quarter against a tough prior year compare of low double-digits and our applied HVAC equipment business grew mid single-digits reflecting continued strength in our chillers business in indirect channels in North America and Asia. And finally specialty products grew high single-digits on strong demand for our fire suppression projects -- products particularly in North America.","Products segment EBITDA increased 12% and EBITDA margin expanded a solid 100 basis points driven by leverage and higher volumes, favorable mix, positive price cost, and the benefit of cost synergies and productivity save slightly offset by product investments in the quarter. I would point out that we do expect a higher level of planned product investments in Q4 which will impact our year-over-year margin compare.","On Slide 12 corporate expense was down 13% to 90 million driven primarily from the benefits of synergy and productivity save but also from the early actions we've taken to reduce costs given the recent Power Solutions divestiture. For the full year we now expect corporate expense to be in the range of 370 million to 380 million. So let's turn to free cash flow on Slide 13.","Free cash flow from continuing ops for Q3 was 500 million on a reported basis and slightly above 600 million on an adjusted basis. We continue to make good progress on trade working capital which is as a percentage of sales is down 20 basis points year-over-year. As we expected we did see a seasonal inventory build which supports the continued growth in our HVAC businesses. Year-to-date adjusted free cash flow was nearly 650 million up 29% year-over-year and for the full year we remain on track for 95% conversion.","So let's turn to the balance sheet on Slide 14. With the closing of the Power Solutions transaction there were a lot of moving pieces in the quarter. Most notably we repaid over $5 billion in gross debt and we completed over $4 billion of share repurchases in the quarter. I'll provide you with more detail on each of these but before I do that I would just like to remind you that our net debt to EBITDA leverage will remain well below the target range of two to two and half times as we deploy the balance of the Power Solutions net proceeds. It's our intent to let our net debt to EBITDA multiple gradually move back to our target range throughout fiscal 2020. Having said that should the need arise to conserve more cash on our balance sheet we will maintain that flexibility.","So let's turn to Slide 15 and let me walk you through our debt pay down bridge. As you know we started fiscal 2019 with gross debt of 10.9 billion. During the first half of 2019 we increased short-term debt by a 1.5 billion which was a combination of higher TP as well as a $750 million term loan. This increase funded our first half seasonal cash outflow and also supported our $1 billion in share repurchases. As we committed to you we repaid $3.4 billion in debt using a portion of the $11.6 billion in net proceeds from the Power sale. This included a 1.5 billion debt tender and a 1.9 billion in paid down of other short-term securities. This debt paid down was completed as planned and is expected to generate $100 million in annual run rate interest savings on a go forward basis. ","In addition to the $3.4 billion pay down I would like to point out that we did repay the 750 million term loan that we secured in early fiscal 2019 I mentioned earlier and we have now terminated all TSarl debt related agreements having repaid all TSarl financial obligations a bit earlier than originally planned. We now expect net financing charges for the year to be in the range of $295 million to $300 million.","Slide 16 provides a walk of our share repurchase activity. As you know we successfully completed the $4 billion tender in early June buying back about 102 million shares at a price of $39.25. Shortly after the completion of the tender we entered into an open market repurchase program and we purchased an incremental 2 million shares in the final two weeks of Q3 for a total cost of $100 million. Year-to-date we've now repurchased 135 million shares for 5.1 billion. ","Looking ahead to fiscal Q4 and into 2020 we are moving forward with the plan to continue repurchasing our stock. Our current plan provides for an OMR of 3.1 billion throughout fiscal 2020 and leaves the flexibility for the remaining $1 billion. We will continue to update you on future calls on our share repurchase plans as we move through the next several quarters.","Before I turn it back over to George for an update on Q4 guidance I did want to provide some commentary on the significant special items that we had in the quarter that are outlined on Slide 17. Let's start with the tax indemnification reserve release of $226 million. This was a historical reserve that was recorded by Tyco several years ago related to a prior year divestiture which was favorably resolved in the quarter resulting in no cash payments.","Secondly as part of our continued portfolio reviews we recorded a $235 million non-cash impairment charge related to the planned sale of a non-core business in our air distribution portfolio. Third, after conducting a comprehensive review of our environmental exposure related to our facilities in Marinette, Wisconsin led by third party environmental consultants we recorded environmental charge of $140 million. This reserve will address the costs of environmental remediation related to contamination resulting from the use of firefighting foams containing PFAS compounds at our fire training facility in Marinette. The cash impact of this charge is expected to incur over multiple years and will be funded through our normal annual cash generation.","The fourth item relates to a discrete tax charge of $226 million associated with newly enacted regulations on June 14, 2019 related to the 2018 U.S. tax reform. We expect a substantial portion of this charge will not result in cash taxes and will be paid in future years. Since in connection with our 1.5 billion debt tender that I mentioned earlier we had a $60 million charge related to the early extinguishment of that debt which was funded with the proceeds from the Power Solution sale. And then finally on a dis ops [ph] basis we recorded a $5.2 billion pretax gain on the Power Solution sale. With that let me turn it back over to George for guidance. ","George R. Oliver","Thanks Brian. Before we open up the line for questions let me provide you an update on our 2019 guidance starting with our EPS walk on Slide 18. Just a couple of changes versus what we shared with you last quarter, there is no change to the EPS benefit from operations, synergies, and investments in sales force additions. You can see the impact of our capital deployment on net financing charges and share count.","Compared to our EPS guidance range last quarter there is $0.04 of additional benefit at the midpoint of the range. This primarily relates to a benefit in net financing charges due to favorable interest income rates and less interest expense given our significant debt paid down activity during the quarter. As well as a start to right size corporate costs resulting from the sale of Power Solutions. As a result we are tightening our EPS guidance to the high end of our previous range and now expect the EPS before special items to be in the range of a $1.93 to a $1.95 representing EPS growth of 21% to 23% year-over-year. This includes an expected Q4 adjusted EPS range of $0.76 to $0.78.","Turning to Slide 19, we have updated some of our operational assumptions as well as the below the line items to reflect our year-to-date performance and current outlook for Q4. For the full year organic growth is now expected to come in at the high end of our previous range up 5% to 6%. Given the higher expected revenues coupled with the Q3 mix in North America our segment EBITR margin expansion is now expected to be approximately 30 basis points for the year.","As I mentioned earlier we are continuing to see top line momentum across the businesses and our focus remains on driving the fundamentals both from a P&L and cash perspective. With that let me turn it over to our operator to open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open.","Jeffrey Sprague","Hey, thank you, good morning everyone. ","Antonella Franzen","Good morning Jeff.","Jeffrey Sprague","Good morning. Just on cash use and kind of the outlook for that, clearly on the repo it looks like you're holding back and Brian actually used the term like if we see the need to preserve cash, so can you just give a little bit of color on what you're thinking, do you see something more worrisome from a macro standpoint, or are there some particular reason you're kind of keeping a 1 billion in your back pocket here?","Brian J. Stief","No, I think what I was trying to communicate there Jeff was simply that we've got a formal program right now for 3.1 billion and our plan is to make sure that gets executed during fiscal 2020. As we move through the year we could very well use that other $1 billion for share repo as we move in the back half of next year but we are going to just maintain a bit of flexibility both from a macro standpoint to see how things play out and there might also be some product line gap fillers or other M&A that we want to look at as well. So we just didn't want to fully commit right now the entire 4.1 but we're going to do the 3.1 and the remaining $1 billion will kind of keep you updated on as we move throughout fiscal 2020. ","Jeffrey Sprague","And then maybe as a follow up on that George, what are you thinking on the M&A front, you have an active bolt on pipeline, anything moving through that pipeline?","George R. Oliver","Yeah, let me start Jeff by saying relative to our performance as we've communicated we're continuing to focus on execution, delivering our commitments and delivering results. That all being said we continue to look at M&A with bolt ons that as we're reinvesting with our organic reinvestments we're making sure we're supplementing that with strategic bolt on. So there is a pipeline that we've been working, a lot of that is in the building management systems as we build out our capabilities within our digital solutions, and so we are continuing to pursue acquisitions. As Brian said we do believe that the environment we still see a very good environment, pretty much across our markets. And we're continuing to capitalize on that as we're converting not only the pipeline to orders but now the orders to grow. And so we're going to stay focused on execution, we're going to make sure that we're also keeping track relative to what's happening in the M&A and as we go forward we want to continue to strengthen what we're doing organically.","Jeffrey Sprague","Great, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz with Citi. Your line is open.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Hey, good morning guys. ","Antonella Franzen","Good morning Andy. ","Andrew Kaplowitz","George, we know you had a relatively significant mix issue that you talked about in Building Solutions North America. You mentioned Fire & Security is growing more slower than HVAC & Controls but it did slow down a little bit in Q3 versus Q2. You mentioned a difficult comparison on retailers this quarter but any of the store growth a little slower in U.S. retail economy and how much would you expect a 90 basis points of mix headwind on the business to improve in the quarters ahead?","George R. Oliver","Yes, so as we look at what took place in third quarter, as you said it was mainly driven because last year we had very strong growth in Fire & Security and within that very strong growth in retail. And then year-on-year although we are outperforming the market in Fire & Security in 2019 it's at a much lower growth than our HVAC business which we're continuing to execute very well. And so as we now project North America going forward we see in fourth quarter roughly about 30 basis points with the mix that's going to come through in third quarter. And for the year I mean it will be relatively flat for the year. ","Now when you look at the year it suggests that our productivity and synergies is offsetting the investments we're making in sales force as well as the pension headwind. And then the volume that we are achieving now is offsetting some of that negative mix. But we're very confident with the fundamentals we have in place, the way that we're driving improved fundamentals to be able to on a go forward basis see improved leverage as we go into 2020.","Andrew Kaplowitz","George maybe if I could follow-up on that, the incrementals in your products business were much stronger than usual. We know that pricing versus costs are strong but did you actually have lower investment than usual in the quarter in that segment and you talked about incrementals in products getting up to 30% over time, I know you mentioned op investment in Q4 but you are actually ahead of schedule on improving the execution on the products in that segment?","George R. Oliver","Yeah, when you look at our product business year-on-year this is where a lot of the work that we've done around price cost has come through and as you know we had significant commodity headwinds as well as tariffs. We've done a nice job ultimately driving price as well as productivity to get positive price cost and that within the quarter is about 40 basis points. So overall that has been a big strength for us. With the leverage when you look at our investment profile it is -- it was pretty much spread through the year and as Brian said, we'll see some additional reinvestment in fourth quarter based on the timing of our product launches. But it's not -- it's in line with what we expected. ","So as we look at these businesses what I would say is we're building the fundamentals, we're getting the lift with the reinvestments we're making and that's coming through the growth, and that we're executing very well the price cost which is adding to the overall margins. On a go forward basis we believe with the continued performance with growth, with the work that were driving fundamentals we're going to be in a position to be able to leverage the product. The leverage margins will be 25% to 30%. ","Andrew Kaplowitz","And you see that 40 basis points being pretty stable going for the price cost?","Brian J. Stief","Yeah, I mean based on what we see today I mean you can't predict all of what's going to happen in the future but I feel confident now that we're -- we have a good understanding of what's happening from a cost standpoint, what's happening with tariffs, and that from a pricing standpoint we're now pricing -- taking that into account on a go forward basis. ","Andrew Kaplowitz","Thanks guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Stephen Tusa","Hey guys, good morning. ","Antonella Franzen","Good morning.","Stephen Tusa","Can you maybe talk about what you are seeing on the global applied markets, what your order pipeline looks like for the next several quarters including in China?","George R. Oliver","Yeah, what was the -- which markets are you referring to Steve?","Stephen Tusa","Global applied. Applied equipment, just the order pipeline there, HVAC applied. ","George R. Oliver","So, let me just give you a perspective on our overall HVAC businesses globally. When you look at our performance our orders are up 6% globally. Our revenues we converted revenues at 7% and when you look at our pipeline we're continuing to build pipelines pretty much across the globe that are up kind of mid to high single-digits both in our commercial and residential businesses. So overall I feel very good about the work that we've done to be able to take advantage of that market. When you break out into the segmentation you see our commercial HVAC businesses are growing 7% and that's been driven by applied as well as with the service that we're getting and as a result of the installed base that we're putting in place. And then when you look at rev [ph] we're up kind of mid single-digits and that's a combination of our UPG business up kind of mid single-digits in North American and our [indiscernible] business up high single-digits. Up high single-digits globally and so overall Steve we still feel very good about the pipeline, how we're converting the pipeline, and then how that's setting us up here as we go forward in 2020.","Stephen Tusa","Okay, and any specific comments on China, what you're seeing in China commercial HVAC?","George R. Oliver","Yeah, so China when you look at the China market it continues to perform. I mean we're seeing kind of orders in the mid single-digits, we're seeing a little bit better in service which is high single-digits. So we're watching this closely but as you know we have a strong presence there. We have a strong positions from a market share standpoint and we've been making sure that we've got the right product. And we're ultimately capitalizing on the growth that's occurring. So we have not seen any significant change in the activity or the pipeline that we're building and as I said we're continuing to build our service business which over the cycle is very important to make sure that we're getting the recurring revenues. ","Antonella Franzen","Steve the only thing I would add is that China specifically orders were very -- although APAC was up 1%. China orders were really strong and it was a mix between install and service.","Stephen Tusa","Great, thanks for the color guys. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. ","Nigel Coe","Thanks, good morning. ","Antonella Franzen","Good morning. ","Nigel Coe","Just wanted to go back to North America [indiscernible] and the retail headwinds, you have obviously covered that already but can you just recap how big is the retail exposure there and it does feel like the physical footprint of the retail effect is starting to shrink in an accelerated pace, I'm just wondering how you think about that business going forward in light of this online transition that seems to be occurring?","George R. Oliver","Globally Nigel the retail business is about $1 billion business. It is a global business with a significant piece of that in North America. What happened last year we had very strong growth in the quarter last year and it was mainly driven by some significant product shipments in the quarter which obviously didn't repeat this year. Overall as you know we got multiple businesses there, we have the antitheft security business as well as we've been building a digital traffic business. As well as our inventory management business, those businesses are performing well. Certainly with the slowdown in some of the challenges in retail, some of the projects have been pushed out which we've seen here in third quarter and we're watching that closely for fourth quarter. But as you know overall this is a good business. We've had a lot of growth, we had a lot of growth last year obviously seeing the impact this year, but we're going to watch this closely.","Nigel Coe","Okay, great and then just a quick one on the NPI line, it's up quite a bit from your prior guides and I'm just wondering what's -- what business is driving that? ","George R. Oliver","So those would be the Hitachi businesses where we own 60% of those ventures and they perform -- continue to perform very strong and that Q3 and Q4 and even into fiscal 2020 we're going to continue to see that NCI line move up simply because of the strong performance of Hitachi.","Nigel Coe","And then just Brian quickly is that better revenue or better margin and where do we stack up right now on getting cash out of those JVs? ","Brian J. Stief","So you probably saw in the quarter if you look at the cash flow statement that was attached to our release we did get a big dividend in the quarter as we expected. As I think I've mentioned on this call in the past the second calendar quarter of each year is when we have certain of the board meetings related Hitachi entity -- entities I should say and we did receive a large dividend in the third quarter as we had planned so the good news is it's at a larger amount than we've got in prior years and we continue on a go forward basis. We'll have to work on getting out a similar level of dividend or again as I've talked about in the past it may require some reinvestment in the Hitachi business to support the growth. So on a go forward basis we're just going to have to monitor the level of dividends that we get out of the Hitachi joint venture but in the quarter we got a large one.","Nigel Coe","Okay, thanks Brian.","Operator","Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Your line is open. ","Julian Mitchell","Hi, good morning. Maybe just the first question on the corporate expense, very, very good progress there again. And when we think about the sort of go forward run rate I think we've been thinking maybe another 50 million or so reduction into next year. Does that sound about right so the sort of go forward to run rate is closer to 330 million figure like that? ","Brian J. Stief","Yeah, that might be a little heavy. I would just say that I was very pleased with the actions that our corporate team took immediately after the Power sale to begin taking costs out to right size. I would say this year there's probably going to be $10 million taken out. Realistically as we transition through fiscal 2020 I would say that cost will be taken out during the course of the year so if you assume we take them out pro-rata that's going to probably give you another 20 million minimum and if we can accelerate some of that maybe 30 million to 35 million would come out next year. And then the full run rate of 50 million we would see as we move into 2021. So I think more along the 30 million to 35 million is probably a better number to work with.","Julian Mitchell","That's helpful, thank you. And then just a quick follow-up, I'm not sure how specific you can get but you did book that 140 million environmental reserves in the quarter, so maybe just give us a mark-to-market of where the environmental reserves sit now in total at present at JCI and this charge obviously cleaned up that Wisconsin issue you mentioned in the Q and the noise on a triple S around municipal and individual actions, any upcoming events you think we should watch for, all points on that as they pertain to JCI? ","Brian J. Stief","Well let me comment on your first question regarding environmental reserve. I think we are appropriate reserved for the Marinette issue based upon all the work that we did in the quarter. Incremental of that $140 million reserve I believe we've got reserves globally for other matters less than $100 million. I want to say between $50 million and $100 million. There's a footnote disclosure on that in the Q's and K's but this particular matter in Marinette at 140 million is the largest one that we will manage over the next several years. So I think from an environmental research standpoint we feel comfortable with where we are. ","George R. Oliver","And Julian let me address the other part of the question on the civil litigation. I think we need to put this in perspective. Tyco and Chemguard make life saving firefighting foam, PFAS chemicals. They purchased the compounds that contain trace amounts of PFAS which they then blend to make the foam. And the fire fighting foam is made to exacting military standards. So majority of the foam at issue is specified and used by the U.S. government and military and therefore subject to the government contractors defense. And Tyco and Chemguard have always acted responsibly in producing these firefighting foams and we feel very confident in our ability to defend these clients.","Julian Mitchell","Great, thank you","Operator","Our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. ","Joshua Pokrzywinski","Hey, good morning guys. So you made a comment earlier George about some of the channel inventories in the unitary side just still being high at the end of the quarter. How long do you think it takes to work those down and then if you seen any pushback or softening in the price environment just as other folks in the system as well are trying to move inventory along a little bit in the back half of the cooling season?","Brian J. Stief","I think we should see a normal bring down of that inventory during Q4 and I don't think it's going to have any impact on our pricing in the market at all. So I think it's more seasonal that will come down here as we move through the fourth quarter.","George R. Oliver","And we've been managing the inventory as this has played out over the last quarter and some of the impact of weather and the like we've been managing that appropriately. We are watching that closely as we get into the latter part of the season here but we are positioned as we have planned.","Joshua Pokrzywinski","Got it, that's helpful. And then just a follow up on the retail Fire & Security exposure there. I guess I knew mix was strong last year, I didn't appreciate exactly where that came from. But just thinking about the pipeline in that piece specifically is -- does that tend to be lumpy over time, are there any other quarters that we should keep in mind over the past several that have had outsized mix there as you comp that could be could be a challenge?","George R. Oliver","When I look at -- I've been part of the business for a number of years, when we look at the profile of business you do have some year-on-year compares occasionally because of the way the projects are executed with retailers. There is a seasonality to the business as you look at the four different quarters. So I don't think it was anything unusual based on what we've seen. Certainly we're pretty much aligned with all of the big retailers given the presence that we have in retail and we are staying close to what their plans are relative to their investments and the like. So I don't see anything that's significantly unusual at this stage.","Joshua Pokrzywinski","Great, thanks for the color.","Operator","Our next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. ","Deane Dray","Thank you. Good morning everyone. ","Antonella Franzen","Good morning. ","Deane Dray","Hey, would like to get some color as you see it in North America non-res construction, just kind of trends, there's some anxiety in some sectors that the macro uncertainty is weighing on project releases and just are you seeing anything along those lines and just to be clear on the retail push outs that you've seen, is that more retail sector specific or would that be attributed to some of the broader macro ones certainly?","George R. Oliver","So let me start with your first question there Deane relative to the environment. I think when we look at all of our industries whether it be ABI, Dodge [ph] forecast and what the overall activity is it's still given where we play and a lot of that is in the institutional space we see continued expansion. Now we've also expanded our sales force and our footprint so I think at this stage you could it would suggest we are picking up some share. So our pipelines are continuing to grow, we're converting those two orders are North America orders. We are up -- North America orders in total are up 6% but HVAC was up double-digits. And so we're high single-digits -- we're performing well and creating a backlog and we feel confident that we're going to see that continuing here at least in the near term. ","As it relates to retail the discussion around retail is retail specific. I mean this is a project by project as we look at our customer base and what their plans were and what ultimately played out. It's specific to each of the retailers and so as I have said we have pretty good visibility especially with the large retailers, what their plans are, and we're going to monitor that as we go forward. ","Deane Dray","Great and then just what's embedded in the 4Q guide, you typically see during summer months some verticals make bigger project implementations like K through 1 colleges, are you seeing that those projects going through as expected?","George R. Oliver","Absolutely, I mean when we look at our growth as we suggested we're going to grow mid single-digits in Q4 and that will get us to 5% to 6% organic growth in total. And when you look at the compare that's over a 7.6% growth last fourth quarter. So we look at our current pipeline of projects that we're executing to deliver on that, those are all moving forward as planned.","Deane Dray","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Walsh with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","John Walsh","Hi, good morning. ","Antonella Franzen","Good morning.","John Walsh","Hi, so we were actually talking to a couple of integrators and they were really excited about a new product release you guys had put out enterprise management 2.0 and what they were basically intimating to me is it seems like JCI and Honeywell are really taking the lead on smart buildings AI and really bringing additional capability to occupants. Is there anything you can point to around metrics you've seen not necessarily specific to this product but other control products, obviously there's been good growth there that we're actually going to see building owners willing to upgrade and pay for some of these newer services that you're offering?","George R. Oliver","So this is core to our overall strategy for the company as you think about our portfolio leading in our HVAC equipment and then leading in building management. And building management it's how this is on top of what we're doing to integrate all of our digital platforms, create a data layer with our Digital Vault, and then to be able to create new solutions on top of that data to be able to create value for our customers. And so what you're referring to the enterprise management is what we call our jump which is John's controlled enterprise management taking all of that data and positioning that data to be able to deliver and execute for our customers things that they ultimately see value in. And so we've got that deployed now across a number of installations and very successfully and as we think about not only that but we've got a number of other digital solutions that we're deploying today that we can take our installed base that we have with our service business to be able to add on these digital solutions and be able to accelerate our service growth with the customers that we're currently supporting. So as you said its core to the strategy how we ultimately create more value for our customers and then leverage all of our digital capabilities to do that.","John Walsh","Yeah I guess maybe as a follow on, do you have any numbers around the size of the business either what your pure software component is, things like that if you can share? ","George R. Oliver","We don't segment our revenues today but as you know across our business we have a lot of software embedded in the products as well as the solutions that we bring to the market. So when you look at that we have software within our building controls, within our security platform, within our fire platform, and what we're doing now is taking all of that, integrating that as well as building a data platform that enables us to be able to create apps and be able to create new outcomes that ultimately is going to create service growth for us. So we don't segment it that way but as we go forward that's something as we look at how we're taking our building management solutions forward is something that we'll focus on and how we can create some metrics so you can track the progress that we're making with the investments we're making? ","John Walsh","Great, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.","Noah Kaye","Good morning, thanks. Just going back to China you talked about service maybe outpacing install. Just your thoughts on I guess one install coming back, reasons for any kind of delays there, and then your confidence and ability to drive price and favorable mix on the business you quoted?","George R. Oliver","Yeah, the comment on the low single-digits was in order as I think overall our orders were somewhat flat on the install side with the service being a little bit higher. But as we project what we're going to do there when you look at the overall growth in the pipeline we suggest that we're still going to see kind of mid single-digit growth in both orders as well as revenue. And that from a service standpoint we're continuing to put resources in place to be able to accelerate the service off the installed base that we've got in place there. And so this for us is a big market for us, it represents in our field business it's about -- represents about -- well in the overall buildings business 6% of our revenue and in the field business in APAC it's about 35% to 40% of our APAC business. So obviously a very important market for us.","Noah Kaye","And I guess not just generally -- not just for APAC but generally can you talk about some of your initiatives to drive greater recurring revenues, your previous comments on software and obviously there are tools here to make business more sticky but just generally how should we think about kind of the growth of recurring as a percentage of the total?","George R. Oliver","So in total when you look at the overall company service represents a little bit better than 25% of the revenue. About 60% of that is recurring and how we contract that revenue. And a lot of that is supported by software and so as we have been driving our service strategy there is a couple of key components making sure we get the right sales force that we're deploying globally. And as you know we've made tremendous progress over the last year, year and a half with the sales force getting the right footprint in the key markets that we're looking to grow within which we've been expanding our footprint. And then enabling that with the right solutions leveraging our technology incapability. So it's a combination of all three. We've been able to get to our run rate overtime that's roughly been about mid single-digits and our goal is obviously not only to continue to grow at the same rate that we're growing installed but also grow with a higher percentage of recurring revenue. So that's 60% that we contract that's recurring and then creating more stickiness with the digital solutions that we can ultimately deploy that becomes more recurring longer-term with the solutions that we put into place. And that's the overall strategy.","Noah Kaye","Perfect, thanks George.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tim Wojs with Baird. Your line is open. ","Tim Wojs","Yeah, hi, good morning everybody. Just -- maybe just one question I had on the investments that are you're kind of incurring right now, what's the right level of kind of ongoing incremental investment that we should think of as we kind of think in the out years, it was 60 basis point headwind to margins last year. I think it's probably closer to half that this year. How much of that can kind of go away over time and how much of that will kind of continue incrementally each year?","George R. Oliver","Well there is two elements that drive that reinvestment. The first is the sales increase that we were adding ahead of the growth actually coming through and that's been the headwind for the last two years. We are now adding at a rate that is sustainable so that the cost as a percent of revenue now has flattened out. So we shouldn't see any additional headwind going forward relative to our sales cost. The other big bucket is our reinvestment in R&D in new products and as you know we've been ramping that up over the last three to four years. We're now ending as we get through this year and we project going forward we should be able to maintain that level of reinvestment as a percent of product revenues more flat. So we shouldn't see any significant headwind there on a go forward basis. ","Tim Wojs","Okay, so if we kind of look into 2020 the investments that you've seen over the last couple years you'd actually think that would be more kind of flat on a year-over-year basis versus a headwind? ","Brian J. Stief","That's correct. ","George R. Oliver","As a percent of revenue so we'll be spending more dollars but as a percent of revenue we won't have the headwind on the EPS bridge. ","Tim Wojs","Right, right, exactly, okay. And then Brian just -- just on the debt pay down what's the average cost of the remaining debt now.","Brian J. Stief","About -- the remaining debt there's 97% of that that's fixed and it's at an average rate of just a little bit above 3%. ","Tim Wojs","Okay, great. Thank you.","Antonella Franzen","Operator I would like to turn the call over to George for some closing comments.","George R. Oliver","So again I want to thank everyone for joining our call this morning. As you see we're pleased with our continued momentum in growth orders and backlog. As I mentioned earlier we are keeping a close eye on the macro environment but overall our end markets are remaining healthy and our order pipeline robust. And I certainly look forward to seeing many of you soon. So operator that concludes our call.","Operator","Thank you for your participation in today's conference.

Then Bruce McDonald, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will talk more specifically about business results and the financial review. And we just talked to you a month ago, today, actually in New York at our Analyst Day, so our presentation here at the beginning is a little abridged from what we normally do by maybe slide or so, so that will be a little shorter. We'll keep the same amount of time that we normally do for questions and answers, but we expect to end the call about quarter of the hour.","And with that, we'll turn it over to Steve.","Stephen A. Roell","Okay, thank you, Glen. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. As Glen mentioned, I'm just going to make some very general comments about the macro environment that we had in our first fiscal quarter. If we look at automotive production in North America, I think most of you are well aware of the fact that it was a strong North American quarter for the industry, with production up 11%. And production continued to inch higher in China, where it was up 3%.","The biggest issue we have is what we talked to you about at the Analyst Meeting, which is the softness in Europe. And in the quarter itself, the European production was down 9% year-over-year. And of course, there was also some softness in South America.","In terms of the -- I hate to be a meteorologist, but talking about winter weather as we -- in the battery side, what we saw was the warm weather really didn't impact our service [ph] until probably late December, where the stocking period was complete, and there was no additional stocking because of the warm temperatures.","As you're well aware, in the early part of January, again, temperatures were generally warmer throughout the country. It's just been very recently that we've seen the downturn in terms of the cold weather. And of course, we're seeing -- we expect to see some significant weather changes next week with severe cold. So that will help us.","Right now, the stocking level at the distribution is a little higher than we would expect, but more towards normal periods -- than normal levels than not. And what we would expect is that given the weather that's coming, we would expect that we would not experience what we did a year ago, which was the mild weather continuing all the way through the January-February timeframe. That bodes well for us because that says that as we go to the second half, we'll see a more normal stocking period. We wont have the core issue that we experienced a year ago.","In terms of the HVAC and controls business, there clearly are lower U.S. and European commercial shipments. Demand is soft in both of those markets. China still remains positive. We see good signs from China. It was a market that we had some concerns about coming into the fiscal year. But right now, the order rate and activity we see continues to be positive in China.","There's a comment in the slide that we sent to you regarding November ABI being up. But probably the one I should highlight most is McGraw-Hill, who came out most recently and is still forecasting softness in both equipment and the controls market for calendar 2013. So that's still a concern to us, and we see that in our activity.","Our backlogs are very comparable with what they were a year ago. Our -- we have mixed results in terms of our -- at this time in terms of our pipelines. We see some softness in systems. We see some strength in solutions, so it's a mixed bag at this stage. And of course, we're watching the consumer confidence indices just to see what's happening. And of course, they're mixed right now across various geographies.","Turning to the absolute quarter. Sales of $10.4 billion were comparable to the quarter a year ago. Segment income was down from $621 million a year ago to $541 million. These numbers are consistent with the guidance that we provided to you at the end of our first quarter call -- excuse me, our year-end call back in October. We had guided to the range that we had performed, and we had fairly good visibility as to what was going to take place at that time.","Net income and EPS then of course followed the shortfall in net income, where -- in segment income, where net income was down from $424 million to $354 million and EPS went from $0.62 down to $0.52. But again, they were consistent with what we expected when we guided -- gave you guidance back in October.","In terms of our second quarter outlook, we're now providing guidance that says that EPS will be between $0.40 and $0.42. Let me tell you some of the things we highlight here is that Western European auto production will be down 14%, just to give you some sense for what we see. That -- second -- and the second half of the year is expected to turnaround, where it's expected to be down only 3% and 1%. But nevertheless, we have a real trough here in production in Q2, our fiscal Q2.","The same can be said about North American build. Right now, the North American build is expected to be down 2% in the quarter that we're in. But in the Q3 and Q4 of our fiscal year, it's expected to be up 5% and 7%, respectively. So as you start to think through the cadence of our quarterly earnings, the European and North American auto production is 1 of 5 key elements that really will help drive that delta, okay?","We also just highlight here briefly that some of the restructuring costs that we incurred, particularly the nonqualified, are going to be in Q2, and we do have significant launch activity as well in the quarter.","We continue to look at the full year and feel good about our -- the guidance that we provided to you when we met in December. And we're still projecting that segment income will be up 10%, and that the EPS range will be between $2.60 and $2.70. We're reaffirming that -- reconfirming that guide to you today.","So with that, I'm going to let Bruce go through the business segments, and we'll come back and open it up for questions. Bruce?","R. Bruce McDonald","Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everybody. Starting off with Building Efficiency here on Slide #6. We had a good financial quarter for Building Efficiency. So if you think about the last 3 or 4 quarters, we're sort of on a trend here of seeing relatively soft top line growth, but a very healthy expansion in our margins. And we saw that again here in this quarter here. So if you look at the overall numbers, as we highlight here, our sales were flat at about $3.5 billion. Foreign exchange really for Building Efficiency wasn't a factor here in the quarter. So generally speaking, a fairly flat quarter.","If you look at that geographically, Asia was up 7%; GWS, Global Workplace Solutions business was up 4%, though this was offset really with softness in Latin America, Europe being the sort of 2 biggest markets that were down. If you look at North America, we're down about 7%, and we continue to see softness in discretionary project work and delays in booking new solutions business.","Just commenting on residential, which flows up within one of our subsegments here, in the quarter, we are benefiting from the upturn in that market. Our revenue was up 16% and unit shipments were up about 9% in the quarter. So we are seeing the uptick that the players are seeing on the residential side of the market.","Looking at our orders and backlog, as Steve indicated, our backlog was flat at about $5.1 billion. If you look at our order intake in the quarter, it was down 9%. Again, a mixed bag geographically here. Asia kind of led the way. It was up 12%. So we continue to see good growth there in Asia. In fact, we're seeing that sort of accelerating. In the Middle East, which tends to be fairly lumpy, we're down about 8%. In North America, we are down 16%, with both systems and solutions being down double-digit. Although I would note that if you look at our service business, it was down only 1%. So we're starting to see some signs of improvement in the order intake in our service business. And I'd just kind of remind folks that that's one of our highest margin businesses, and for a long time now, we've been talking about delays in discretionary project work, so that's an encouraging sign. Elsewhere, geographically, Europe and Latin America were down 13% and 15%, respectively.","If you look at the segment income, 19% growth to $172 million here in the quarter. If you look at the margins in Building Efficiency, we had an 80 basis point improvement, up to 4.9%.","The sort of main drivers, I guess, would be twofold. It'd be, one, the benefit of the pricing initiatives and some of the cost reduction and restructuring activities that we're starting to deliver impacts the bottom line here. I'd also note that we did have some favorable commercial settlements on some of our contracts in the quarter.","Turning to automotive on Slide 7. I guess our automotive business overall, we came -- it came in a little bit softer than our expectations, really driven by Europe. If you look at the sort of drivers there, it's really delays in flexing out our direct labor workforce. I'll talk a little bit more about that later on.","From a sales perspective, you can see we were down about 1%. Because a large portion of our business is based in Europe, the euro in the quarter was about $1.30 versus $1.35 last year. So on an exchange adjust basis, we were up about 1% overall. If you look at that by product lines, Seating sales were up about 2%, again, adjusted for inflation. Interiors was sort of flat. And Electronics, which is the most heavily exposed to Europe, we were down about 5%.","In terms of China, we sort of made it -- one of our takes here commenting on the momentum that we're seeing in China. Really terrific quarter over there. You can see that our sales, which mostly come through nonconsolidated joint ventures, were up about 21% in the quarter, up to $1.4 billion. So we're pleased to see that. And that really is in comparison to passenger car production in China being up about 3%.","If you look at segment income, down -- roughly half of what it was a year ago at $101 million. Steve touched on some of the factors, but maybe a little bit more color here, higher engineering and product launch costs and operational efficiencies. If we look at Europe, we continue to see near term profitability pressures as we face delays in flexing out our labor. So you look at our results here in Europe, they're kind of flowing through as we expected. We talked about the -- having about $0.08 to $0.10 of non-qualifying restructuring cost. Those primarily fall us -- for us in the second quarter. It's probably $0.02 or $0.03 in this quarter and $0.06 or $0.07 in Q2. We didn't expect that we would be able to execute some of our social plans and things like that in the first quarter. That sort of falls here in the second quarter.","So if you think about auto, what you're kind of seeing here is a little bit of labor inefficiency in the first quarter as we wait for our social plans to get approved. In the second quarter, we'll see less of that. It will be done by the end of the quarter, but we will have the substantial -- the bulk of the non-qualifying costs flowing through in the second quarter, and hence, the weakness of our second quarter outlook for automotive.","If you look at the business by product line, we did well in Interiors. We started seeing the benefit of some of our cost reductions. We've lowered our losses. But nevertheless, if you look at our overall margins, they're at 1.9%, about half of what they were a year ago.","Geographically, I mean, we're sort of phasing that out, but just to provide some color there, we saw good improvement in our underlying profitability in both North America and Asia. Those were both higher on a year-over-year basis. Europe continues to be the challenge. Our margins in Europe were about negative 4.5%.","In terms of Power Solutions, on Slide #8, you can see our sales were up about 4%. If we adjust for foreign exchange and lead differentials, our underlying revenues were up about 7%. OE volumes were up 9% and aftermarket volumes were up about about 1%. And as Steve indicated, if we just look at the North American aftermarket, which is our biggest sector, in the quarter, unit volume shipments were down about 4%. And as Steve mentioned, we were up year-over-year in October and November. We really saw it drop-off in December.","From a bottom line perspective, you can see we're down about 3% versus last year, but a very strong quarter with margins of 16%. We're really benefiting from the volumes. The benefit of our vertical integration, in particular the Florence, South Carolina starting to come online here in the quarter as we expected an improved pricing that we took last year. So that's sort of flowing through as a benefit on a year-over-year basis.","And then the only comment I'd make maybe here is if you looked back at our slides from last year, we did have a nonrecurring equity gain in 2012. That obviously makes for the year-over-year comparables a little bit difficult.","Just turning to the financials on Slide #9. As we talked about earlier, revenues coming in at 10.4% (sic) [$10.4 billion], a 1% increase adjusted for FX. If you look at the gross margin, you'll see we're down about 20 basis points on a year-over-year basis. We saw margin expansion in Building Efficiency, and that was really offset by the lower gross margins that we saw in automotive business in Europe.","You can see SG&A, a small increase on a year-over-year basis. If you look at it as a percentage of sales, it's up about 20 basis points to 10.1%. All that increase is really investments that we're making in innovation and new products and our emerging market infrastructure.","Equity income at $85 million. You can see is sort of down versus last year. That whole delta is really attributable to the slightly higher investments in some of our joint ventures and then that onetime gain in Power Solutions that I referred to earlier.","Then lastly on Slide #10 here, just going through the net financing charges, up about $61 million. That's kind of the run rate that we've been operating over the last 3 or 4 quarter -- or 2 or 3 quarters, I'm sorry. It's up versus last year. If you recall, we did a bond issuance in Q1 of last year, and so you just sort of see in the -- us terming out some of our debt. So we have slightly higher financing costs, those generally in line with the guidance that we provided at the beginning of the year.","In terms of our tax rate, we had a clean quarter, 20%, which is the same level as last year. You can see income attributable to noncontrolling interest, down about 5%. And that really reflects the buyout of one of our minority partners in our plastic joint venture here in North America.","And then lastly, you can see our earnings per share at $0.52 were down about $0.10 from last year which really attributable to the shortfall in the segment income.","So with that, I think we'll open it up for questions.","Glen Ponczak","Yes, Mary Ann, we're ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Rod Lache of Deutsche Bank.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","A couple of questions. Just hoping you can maybe give us a little bit more granularity on that bridge in the Automotive Experience segment, EBIT going from $200 million to $100 million. I think based on what you said for the non-qualifying expense, that was probably a $20 million headwind, and I would imagine that you had a couple million dollars of headwind from FX, but you mentioned that your organic revenue was up. So can you just help fill in some of the blanks there on what actually is continuing to drive that on a year-over-year basis?","R. Bruce McDonald","Yes, I mean, I'm not going to get into the -- like all the detail there, but I mean, I'll tell you what kind of the headlines are here, Rod, is -- we definitely seeing some margin pressure. So if you -- when I talk about our gross margin on a company basis being down, that was really driven by the auto Europe side of the business. And really what we've got there, as I'm sure you know, in Europe, we just can't take out the labor as quick as we can in North America because we have to go through a consultation with our -- with the various works councils and get sort of those signed off. So those are all progressing as we expected, but what you end up getting is the incremental labor flowing through until you can get it out. So that's quite a significant headwind there, if you put it in the context of our volumes being down 10%. And then, we always talk about, in the first quarter of our calendar year tends to be Q4 of our customers' year end, and so we typically have lumpiness in terms of commercial settlements that we are paying or getting from our customers, and those were -- from a year-over-year basis, those were adverse to us. So those would be the sort of line items.","Stephen A. Roell","Rod, if I had to just -- see if I can help Bruce a little bit, too. I think if I had to box things for you, I would say -- and this isn't going to total 100%, but about 40% of our issue is operational, but it's not operational in the sense that how we run our plants. In some cases, we're making line moves. We're shipping production to different locations. We're doing a lot more of that to get our efficiencies up. That cost hit us in the quarter. Probably 25% of our issue is commercial, as Bruce described, and probably 20% is volume. So again, we still have the ability, as we've come throughout the year, to improve our results in this group, primarily by addressing some of the operational costs we're incurring.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, and on Building Efficiency, how material was that contract gain? It sounded like you had something that was nonrecurring in there?","R. Bruce McDonald","Yes, there's about 3 or 4, Rod. So when actually in our K -- in our Q, sorry, when you sort of see the pieces, there's some lumpiness in there. But the net impact is about $10 million.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","All right. And then the decline in orders that you're seeing in Building Efficiency, does that not -- you're still working off of your backlog that you were reporting at year end, I would imagine here. Does that sort of manifests itself in 6 to 9 months? Is that when we start to see some of that play out?","R. Bruce McDonald","Yes, a little bit. I guess, maybe one thing to maybe make you folks feel a little bit better about that is that if you actually look at the solution -- Steve sort of talked about solutions a little bit in his comments. But if you actually looked at our order intake in solution, that's really what's driving the bulk of the decrease. It was down by over 40%. Those projects tend to be very -- we got a lot of big ones that we're working on, and they tend to revenue fairly slowly. So I wouldn't get overly concerned about the orders being down 9%, so we've got kind of a big problem coming at us in, say, Q3 and Q4.","Stephen A. Roell","I would agree.","Operator","Our next question is from Ravi Shanker of Morgan Stanley.","Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Steve, did the $0.93 that you're expected to earn the first half, is that in line with where you were thinking at the end of last year or has it got a little bit more second half-weighted in terms of earnings?","R. Bruce McDonald","Well, I'll take that one, Ravi. Bruce here. I would tell you, if you sort of look at our plan here, Q1 we came in a couple of cents better than we were expecting. And if you kind of look and say, \"What really drove that,\" I would tell you that the -- our revenues came in a little bit stronger than we thought. In the second quarter here, if you look at our outlook, it's probably $0.03 or $0.04 sort of weaker than we thought. And that would really be around the delays in flexing out the labor. So generally speaking, I mean, we did provide guidance that Q1 and Q2 would be down significantly. Maybe we could have done a better jobs, because I -- because if you sort of look at what the analyst models were for Q1, it wasn't too far off our internal plan. But for Q2, folks were down high single-digit, and I guess I wouldn't think that's significant.","Stephen A. Roell","Ravi, I guess the other -- maybe I think that maybe is confusing people, even those that were at the auto show this week. If you would ask the analysts, I think, what they're seeing for European volumes, production volumes in 2013, I think the numbers were like 2%, 3%, 4% down, and that's true for the calendar year. But that's not true for our fiscal year, because if you look at how it -- the cadence -- Q4 is expected to be up considerably as -- the projection is part of the IHS model as we look at 2013. If you just look at our fiscal year using the same IHS model, it's not down 2%, it's down 7% to 8%. And so I think some of our numbers or maybe the cadence is being confused by calendar year versus fiscal year. But as I mentioned in my opening comments, if you just look at the fact that North American production is going to be down in Q2, it's the only quarter that's down after being up 11%, and then going up 5% and 7%. And then European volume is expected to be off as severe as they are, it really is a trough. And I'm not sure that the models got -- reflect that kind of a downturn, okay?","Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","That make sense. A quick follow-up to that, is there any risk that the restructuring plans in Europe get delayed beyond 2Q in terms of getting those permissions?","R. Bruce McDonald","No, no. There is just like a -- there's like normal 90-day type consultation periods. There's nothing -- we aren't -- if you think about it, Ravi, we're not out doing something that everyone else in our industry is doing as well. So it's not that we're an outlier there. I mean, it's generally pretty well known that our customers are cutting down volumes. It's being somewhat erratic the way it's being done right now. But we're not an outlier, and we've been very successful in the past. And if you look at the scale of what we're doing versus what we've done before, we really don't have any reason to believe it should be problematic.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tim Denoyer of Wolfe Trahan.","Timothy J. Denoyer - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","A couple of questions on Power Solutions. I guess in the outlook for the fiscal second quarter, are you expecting margins on a year-over-year basis to be down? It seems like to get down to $0.42, that's essentially what we have to assume. And I realize there's a tough comp year-over-year in the first quarter, but can you give a sense of why that might be?","Stephen A. Roell","Tim, well, first we haven't said anything about margins, but let me just make sure we understand the seasonality of our business. Volumes drop off from Power Solutions as a normal period. We're through the stocking period of October, November to midway December. So our volumes drop off at Power Solutions. I don't know of any reason why our margins drop off, okay?","Timothy J. Denoyer - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","No, I'm just saying in terms of year-over-year margins?","R. Bruce McDonald","I think -- I don't have the numbers in front of me, Tim, but I do think that we -- if you take out the impact of foreign exchange and [indiscernible] of the year, okay, we're looking at Power Solutions' margins being up about 50 or 60 basis points, okay? If you think about really where that -- what's driving that, it is really going to be -- one of the biggest -- it's sort of 2 big drivers. It'd be, one, the savings that we'll make from the increased recycling in Florence. And then you'll recall, in the back half of last year, we talked about having about $40 million or $50 million of headwind as we built up our lead core inventory as a one, sort of like a nonrecurring onetime hit that we took and that sort of goes away. So most of the power -- I mean if we look back to last year, Power Solutions had a great Q1 and Q2, exceptionally high margins that were -- are tough comps on this thing for us. And the real drivers of the year-over-year improvement are coming in the back half of the year.","Stephen A. Roell","Right. From an absolute standpoint, the only thing that we have to watch, too, is that lead price. We always look at our data without lead, without FX. Lead prices have skewed up, so we have to definitely watch that, but we normalize that in our -- in how we look at our data.","Timothy J. Denoyer - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","Sure, understood. And in terms of -- I think you may have touched on this in your opening comments, but in terms of the supply of cores, given the mild weather, is there a risk that the smelters may be a little bit underutilized over the next couple of quarters? How do you see the inventory right now?","Glen Ponczak","I guess -- and Tim, I guess I'm trying to project here, okay? But I mean, I think that what we're seeing is a -- we expect to see demand pick up. The cold weather should help us out here, the severe cold that's going to hit next week and this week so. And the rest of the country, I mean, what's happening now in Alabama, what we're seeing in California. So we expect to see the core issue not being an issue. We don't expect that right now.","R. Bruce McDonald","And I think, Tim, some of our competitors have made very similar comments. So our core inventories, we're starting to see them pick up here in the quarter, a noticeable improvement. I know one of our competitors made similar type comments, so that -- I think it's low risk.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Johnson of Barclays.","Brian Arthur Johnson - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just want to, I guess, drill down further on Automotive Experience. I guess a couple of questions. You seem to be a little bit below the IHS-CSM consensus. It happened to be where we are. Are you seeing anything in production schedules or kind of where inventories came out of calendar 4Q that lead you to be a bit more conservative in calendar 1Q?","Stephen A. Roell","Which -- are you talking about Europe or North America?","Brian Arthur Johnson - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Yes, Western Europe, or European auto production. And also the broader Europe picture when you include Eastern Europe and Russia, which are a bit healthier, right?","R. Bruce McDonald","Yes, yes, well, I would -- if you sort of look at the -- we're basically using IHS, Brian. So if I just...","Brian Arthur Johnson - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. So this is -- right. That's because you're doing Western?","R. Bruce McDonald","Yes, so we're looking at Western Europe being down about 14%, and I guess if you said East, which is around -- which is like 3.1 million, and that compares to 3.57 million last year. And Eastern Europe, it's down about 3%, about 1.7 million to just above 1.6 million. We -- those are sort of the industry numbers. And like I said in my comments, we've tended to see the volumes come in a little bit better than the overall industry when you're looking at year-over-year. And the factors are really, we are underexposed to the French and Fiat, we were [ph] less than -- less exposure to those customers, and they've tended to trail the market. And on the higher-end vehicles that are -- like the, let's say the BMW and Mercedes in particular, where they're manufactured in Germany, and I know there is some softness in exports to Asia, but less so to North America, but those have a lot more content, and we sort of benefit from that. So in Q1, that -- and even all of last year, that sort of made it a little bit better than the industry for us.","Brian Arthur Johnson - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And then my second question is -- and it's similar to the operational walk question, which I guess we have to wait to Q4. But if you separate the operational issues into the flex time and just appropriate staffing for the level of build versus the operational issues we've been talking about most of the last fiscal year around the metals businesses and the inefficiencies in the yields, what kind of progress, if any, has been made on those issues? What's the year-over-year improvement there? And then what's the cadence of that through the year?","Stephen A. Roell","We haven't really described that magnitude, okay? I think, although the only thing I've alluded to, Brian, so far is the fact that, if you recall the STEP program that Beda referred to relative to the metals operations specifically, we expect to see a couple of hundred million dollar year-over-year comparison for the full year, okay? It does play -- it does pick up, as you would imagine, throughout the year, so it's a cadence that improves as we go through the second, third and fourth quarters. And we do see that happening, okay? I think the -- sometimes, I'm a little bit fearful that we put too much weight in terms of some of the operational experience, and then everybody thinks they have to do with machine utilization and scrap and things of that nature. In many cases, it's really our decisions to relocate equipment to the east and to move lines and actually incur those costs. They're not surprises to us. They're costs that we're accruing to help benefit future productivity. What I do see is in terms of our launch efficiencies, we get a scorecard that looks -- allows us to look at every single launch. And let's say that we've got -- pick a number, 80 new launches that are coming up in -- that are significant, and we color code those. And 2 of those are red right now, out of the whole group. So we feel very good about how -- what our cadence is in terms of our readiness for launch. The fact that we shouldn't incur a lot of issues, and we're not. We're still ensuring that we deliver the quality to our customers, and that's our -- still our biggest objective as we go through this. We're not -- we're seeing a significant decline in our premium freight, where we had to incur cost to maintain delivery levels. That struck off significantly. So the cadence isn't -- I guess the improvement is not at the level that we'd like to have, but nevertheless, it's at a fairly substantial improvement year-over-year. And we expect to see that continue in the third and fourth quarter. That's one of -- that's again one of the key second half versus first half stories.","Operator","Our next question is from David Leiker of Baird.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Can you talk in the Building Efficiency business a little bit about the color in the pipeline, and where you get a request for a proposal to -- actually goes in your backlog and what you're seeing there, what kind of dynamics you're seeing there?","Stephen A. Roell","David, I'm not sure -- you're talking about the time dimension, or...","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","The pace of order activity, booking activity across that pipeline, across the different -- you track it at 7 or 8 different spots between...","Stephen A. Roell","Yes, I'm sorry. So maybe let me just talk about the pipeline itself, okay? We have a tendency to look at it 2 ways. I look at it from a vertical market perspective. So I can look to say -- and that's probably more important to me David, to be honest, than anything else in terms of what's strong and what's not. Let me go back to give you some backdrop. If you look at the data from McGraw-Hill, it was sort of interesting to me in terms of the projections I gave you earlier regarding equipment and controls. And in general, let me just tell you what they're saying. They're expecting about a 7% drop in equipment shipments this year, and this is again domestic, and they're seeing about a 15% drop in controls and fire and security products. That's what they're projecting for '13 versus '12. And then when you get into the detail, they were forecasting that that softness would incur primarily in higher ed and in the government, both federal and state, okay? So that's what they've projected from the sample and the verticals. So now we go back and look at our pipeline, and we can -- this is -- again, for those of you that aren't familiar with this term, it's really the bidding activity we have in various states, and we can look at it and get a sense by vertical market across several different business categories or contract categories. If we just look at our systems business, which encompass our equipment and controls, what we see is that softness in state. That's probably our biggest concern right now is the softness in the state government activity. We see some softness in health care. We see flatness though in higher ed, Fed and K-12, which is a good -- which is good for us. And we actually saw some decent orders booked in those same very verticals in the past month. In our solutions business, which is more tied to our performance contracting business, that's where we're seeing some pick up. We're seeing it in the federal, K-12, and then more importantly there, we do see good state business, which makes sense to us. So the state government side there is stronger. So I guess what I would tell you -- and the solutions business typically is a longer cycle sale. So going back to your other comment, we do see that. We saw a number of contracts that got pushed from Q1 to Q2. We had 3 solutions contracts we booked in the first 4 days of January. So we did see some movement there, David. But that's the only thing I can tell you. I don't see a general, what would I would call it, lengthening of contracts or decision-making in our normal systems business. It's more in the performance contract, so the very large contracts.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","So it sounds like that this backlog number probably goes lower before it stabilizes. Is that right?","Stephen A. Roell","I'm not sure -- well, it's already stabilized. I mean, it's the same as it was at the end of a year ago, which is a good point. I mean, that was a record level of backlog, and we still enjoy that level of backlog. So I think the key is maybe getting it out of backlog, not on our pipeline, but getting it out of backlog and getting it actually executed. There's probably a little bit of softness there, and that's probably why our sales volumes were softer in the first quarter, okay?","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay, great. And then there's one other item. If we look at the Power Solutions business, and shipment is up 3% and your revenues, when you adjust them, up 7%. Is all of that difference there coming from AGM mix starting to show up in the revenue line?","R. Bruce McDonald","It would be some of that, David, but I would tell you, the bulk of it is probably the pricing that we did. I mean, if you recall last May timeframe, we talked about -- we were implementing like kind of an environmentally -- we were upgrading our smelters and raising our prices to compensate for that, so that's fallen through.","Glen Ponczak","David, also Asia was up pretty significantly, a good double-digit sort of growth across OEM and service and aftermarket. So that was another component to that as well.","Operator","Our next question is from Joe Spak of RBC Capital Markets.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I just -- headed back to Automotive Experience for one second. The margins were obviously soft. It sounds like there's still some challenges in the second quarter. So to get back to the high-3s for the year, which your guidance at the Analyst Day sort of implied, it almost seems like you need to be over 5% in the back half of the year, and to be honest, that's a level we haven't seen in quite some time. So I'm just wondering for the overall company guidance, has there been a little bit of a shift maybe to some of the other segments coming in a little bit better and maybe a little bit taken out of auto?","R. Bruce McDonald","For sure. I mean, if you think about this quarter, like I said, we came in a few cents higher than we thought we would here, a couple of cents. And auto came in, was a little bit softer. The other 2 were stronger, so yes.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","But for the full year guidance, I guess?","Stephen A. Roell","A little bit [indiscernible].","R. Bruce McDonald","I guess it's probably too early to say.","Stephen A. Roell","Yes, but it's -- I would say not a lot, Bruce, at this time. No.","R. Bruce McDonald","Yes.","Operator","Our final question comes from Rich Kwas of Wells Fargo Securities.","Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just 2 quick ones. Mix in Europe. At the auto show this week, some of the suppliers were saying mix had stabilized in calendar fourth quarter in Europe. What's your sense right now, what you're seeing?","R. Bruce McDonald","When you say mix?","Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Vehicle mix. Not so much the unit volume, but just the mix of the vehicles being produced.","Stephen A. Roell","The segment sort of stuff? Is that what you mean, Rich?","Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Yes, yes. I mean, yes, exactly. Segment stuff, A, B, C, D, et cetera. It seemed like there was a pullback late in calendar -- end of calendar Q3 and through Q4 and that seems -- some of the suppliers indicated that it stabilized, so just curious what you're seeing.","R. Bruce McDonald","Well, I guess maybe the one I would comment on, and I would just say just because of our diversification over in Europe, I would say that's a real factor. But the one that's most important for us is like I was talking about earlier, the luxury segment because we have a lot more content in that. And I know there was some worries around export strength, and that's held up very well. So in North America, the market's strong here and the high-end German exports are performing well. And I know there's a lot of concern going into this year about China and that market slowing down. The exports from Germany into China have not deteriorated markedly. So maybe -- those will be the important drivers for us, Rich, and...","Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, so it kind of sounds like it's was -- it's been a nonfactor for the most part in terms of what you're seeing right now.","R. Bruce McDonald","Right.","Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just last quick one, working cap, so there were some improvement on a year-over-year basis, Bruce. You still thinking potential positive working cap benefit this year? I know you were kind of thinking neutral-ish, maybe plus or minus, but any updated thoughts?","R. Bruce McDonald","I mean, we are pleased. We didn't put anything in about our balance sheet, but we have felt good about that. As you said, the working capital outflow was quite a bit lower than last year. We typically have an outflow in Q1, the biggest thing being kind of like incentive compensation and like commission-type payments to our sales teams that typically flow in the first quarter. But yes, we feel -- I think we're still looking at plus or minus $100 million on working capital for the year. And the other thing I guess I would point out is if you did -- do look at our balance sheet, we obviously had 2 -- we have 2 normal quarterly dividend payments in the quarter because we pulled forward our January payment into December to help out our shareholders on the increased tax there. So we'll pick that up in Q2 because we wont have a dividend.","Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, and then one last one question on price for battery. That was instituted in May of last year, right? So do you fully -- you kind of half anniversary it in the June quarter and then you're done by September, right?","R. Bruce McDonald","Yes.","Stephen A. Roell","Yes, that's fair.","So just to wrap up, I just have a few comments I'd like to make. And this is really -- maybe let me address some of the second half outlook projections for us and why. I mentioned earlier, I made reference to the fact that there really are 5 things that I would point to that give us confidence in our second half, but let me just go through those. The first is, as we've described and talked about today is the auto production, and the fact that right now in the current quarter that we're in, this should be the lull and everyone is expecting, including all the analysts, that we'll see a pickup in the second half both in Europe, as well as in North America. Secondly is the margins. I think we've described the fact that at Building Efficiency we're expecting to see a nice improvement in margins for the full year. I've been very impressed and pleased with the work that Dave's team has done. They've taken some initiative here again to control cost, yet again in the event that there's softness. So we've done some good contingency planning in BE, and I feel comfortable just like we've demonstrated last year that we'll see nice pick up in margins in the second half from BE, just as you saw in the first quarter. In the Power Solutions side, we've got a couple of factors. Bruce has alluded to Florence. We think -- if you recall last year, China was a drag for us. We talked about AGM pricing and those volumes picking up. We shouldn't have the core issues, so we expect all those factors to contribute to our second half for Power Solutions. Automotive, the key there is the improvement in our execution operations, in addition to the production volumes, and we feel we're getting some good traction in terms of the improvements there, particularly in our metals business. And Bill's doing a good job of stabilizing our Interiors business.","And then finally, as you recall, we had the restructuring that we took in the third and fourth quarter, and we'll get beyond the nonqualified cost in the first half, and we'll start to see the benefits in the second half. So those are the 5 factors I would describe to you that give us some confidence in our performance and our outlook for the year, okay?","So again, thank you very much for joining us, and let's hope for cold weather all the way through the East Coast next week, okay? Take care.","Operator","This does conclude today's conference call.

The press release and all related tables issued earlier this morning as well as the conference call slide presentation can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our Web site at johnsoncontrols.com.","With me today are Johnson Controls' Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, George Oliver; and our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Brian Stief.","Before we begin, I would like to remind you that during the course of today's call, we will be providing certain forward-looking information. We ask that you review today's press release and read through the forward-looking cautionary informational statements that we've included there.","In addition, we will use certain non-GAAP measures in our discussions, and we ask that you read through the sections of our press release that address the use of these items. In discussing our results during the call, references to adjusted EBITA and adjusted EBIT margins exclude restructuring and integration costs as well as other special items. These metrics are non-GAAP measures and are reconciled in the schedules attached to our press release, and in the appendix to the presentation posted on our Web site.","Given the announced sale of our Power Solutions business, the results of Power are reported as discontinued operations. The focus of this call will be on continuing operations. GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to Johnson Controls ordinary shareholders was $0.12 for the quarter and included a net charge of $0.14 related to special items. These special items primarily relate to integration cost and discrete tax items in the quarter. Adjusting for these special items, non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.26 per share compared to $0.21 in the prior year quarter.","Now let me turn the call over to George.","George Oliver","Thanks, Antonella, and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us on our call today. What I thought I'd do is start with a brief strategic overview then turn it over to Brian to review the financial results and end with an update on 2019 guidance.","As we discussed with you on last quarter's call, 2018 was a year of significant progress for Johnson Controls, having set and achieved several ambitious goals to improve the operational performance with a bottoms-up and top-down approach. This included harmonizing our various legacy policies, establishing better processes around cash generation, better aligning our top executives to driving the fundamentals of our businesses in concluding the strategic review of Power Solutions.","Although I said it last quarter, I really can't thank our employees around the globe enough for all of their hard work, extra hours, and in many cases assuming new responsibilities. As we've entered into 2019, our goals are the same, continue to build upon the success in 2018 to further improve the operating fundamentals of our businesses and across all of our key initiatives. We have dedicated teams in place working on the power separation, and I can tell you at this point everything is progressing well, and we are on track to close no later than June 30.","We continue to see the return on investment from several years of elevated R&D spend and engineering spend as a percent of sales aimed at refreshing our product portfolio. For those of you who joined us at this year's AHR Expo in Atlanta, I am sure you walked away with a good sense with some of the new products we are bringing to the HVAC and building controls market.","New product introductions are continuing to ramp in 2019, and we are well-positioned to continue gaining share across our product categories. We have built a complete global portfolio of proven solutions to help our customers design, build, retrofit, and manage the next generation of safe, smart, and connected buildings.","As a global leader in sustainability and energy efficiency, our approach to innovation focuses on enabling our customers and communities to reduce energy consumption, lower operating costs and minimize the environmental footprint of their facilities. We achieved this with tools and technologies that make those facilities smarter by using sensor-based automated monitoring of environment and security systems, as well as data mining and artificial intelligence whether that be the latest release of our Metasys software platform, our smart connected chillers, or our cloud-based digital solutions offerings. We were able to offer compelling value propositions across all of our key verticals.","As we continue to drive top line growth, we'll remain focused on improving returns in increasing our operating leverage. We continue to strengthen our processes around large project approvals to ensure we are achieving appropriate margin rates. We have enhanced pricing desks, and have set consistent productivity metrics across sales, service and installation to drive improved performance.","Turning to slide four, orders in our field businesses increased 7% organically. And as you can see on the slide, although we are beginning to lap more difficult prior year comparisons our momentum increased sequentially. The increase in orders was driven by mid teens growth in global, commercial HVAC and mid single-digit growth in fire and security, partially offset by a significant decline in our North America solutions business. Brian will provide you with some order details in his segment review, but we continue to see broad-based strength in our order books across all three regions, and across most of our core product platforms.","Our backlog ended the quarter at $8.5 billion, up 7% organically versus the prior year, which puts us in a much better position in 2019 with strong visibility to execute on our revenue expectations. Our project pipeline remains robust and we continue to see -- expect continued order momentum across our end markets over the course of the year. Taking into consideration the increasingly difficult comps as we move throughout the year, we expect continued strong order growth in the mid to high single-digit range.","Before I move to the summary of our first-quarter results, just a quick comment on the macro environment, as evidenced by the continued strength in our orders in revenue, our end markets remained healthy. Generally speaking, we are not seeing a notable slowdown in any of our internal leading indicators as our short cycle book-to-bill trends, service growth in both small and large project bookings remain robust.","We continue to monitor global economic conditions. And although it seems clear that GDP growth rates in some key regions are beginning to moderate to some degree, we feel good about our position. We have made the right technology investments and have expanded our sale force as well as distribution footprint. We have been expanding capabilities in our service business which is over $6 billion in annual revenue with roughly two-thirds recurring in nature. In addition to leveraging our industry-leading installed base, we have developing new technologies enabling us to create new value propositions for our customers. We are focused on execution and are continuing to take our cost and drive productivity.","Turning now to slide five, let me recap the financial results for the quarter. Sales of $5.5 billion increased 6% on an organic basis led by 7% growth in products and 5% growth in the field businesses. Adjusted EBIT of $400 million grew 10% on a reported basis and 15% on an organic basis despite the anticipated pressure in our Asia-Pac business and the carryover impact of sales capacity investments driven by solid growth in segment profit as well as lower corporate expense. Overall, underlying EBIT margins expanded 60 basis points year-over-year excluding the impact of FX and M&A.","Adjusted EPS of $0.26 increased 24% over the prior year driven by solid top line performance and a modest benefit from below the line items. Adjusted free cash was an outflow in the quarter of approximately $200 million better than the historical use of cash in Q1. The cash management office continues to execute well driving improvements across our cash fundamentals.","With that, I will turn it over to Brian to discuss our performance in more detail.","Brian Stief","Thanks, George, and good morning everyone. So, let's start on slide six and take a quick look at the year-over-year EPS bridge. As you can see, segment operating performance stand at $0.08 versus the prior year quarter. This was partially offset by $0.02 of continued product and channel investments and the carryover run-rate impact our fiscal '18 sales force investment. I would also note that net financing charges provided a $0.02 benefit primarily driven by favorable interest rates and some FX gains. This was more than offset by a slightly higher year-over-year tax rate and some pension amortization and FX headwinds.","So let's move to slide seven. Buildings on a consolidated basis had total sales of $5.5 billion, which was up 6% organically. This was led by strength in products of 7% and field businesses which were 5% driven by continued strength in both service and project installation activity which grew 6% and 4% respectively.","Segment EBITDA of $590 million grew 9% organically driven by strong growth in both our field and shorter cycle products businesses despite some continued high investment levels. I would note that fiscal Q1 is typically our lowest quarter from a volume leverage standpoint given the seasonally lower revenues in our buildings business. Our segment EBITDA margin expanded 30 basis points on a reported basis to 10.8%. And as you can see in a vertical chart, this includes 90 basis points of underlying operational improvement partially offset by continued product investment as well the run-rate sale force investments and indirect channel cost expansion cost.","Now, let's review each segment within buildings. Starting with North America on slide eight, you can see that sales grew 6% organically to $2.1 billion with install activity up 6% and service up 5%. We saw another quarter of strong performance in our applied, HVAC and Controls platforms which grew in aggregate mid-single digits organically led by 5% growth in core applied, HVAC equipment installation and service. We also saw fire security grow mid-single digits led by high single digit growth and fire and our solutions business, which was up 30% and quarter and I just find out as you know that the Solutions business can be quite choppy on both in order intake and revenue standpoint quarter-to-quarter.","Adjusted EBITDA of $253 million grew 8% on a organic basis. North America EBIT margin expanded 30 basis points to 12% as we saw the benefits of volume leverage and synergy and productivity save partially offset by the year-over-year impact of our run rate sales force investments and unfavorable mix as install revenue growth outpaced service growth in the quarter, margin was also impacted by mix within the individual platforms.","Orders in North America increased 5% organically driven by applied HVAC orders of mid-teens. We do thank this benefit is partly from some equipment pull-forward ahead of prices and fire security was up mid-single digits including strength and project installation and service. This growth was partially offset by a significant decline in large orders and solutions, which as I mentioned earlier, can be quite choppy. Backlog of $5.4 billion increased 4% year-over-year.","Now let's move to EMEA\/LA on slide nine. There we saw sales of $907 million, which grew 4% organically with continued strength and service partially offset by a modest decline in project installations. Growth was positive in most regions and across most lines of business. Europe grow mid-single digits led by continued recovery in IR and HVAC, which combined a roughly one-third of the revenues for the segment.","Orders in Europe increased 10% organically led by strong demand and IR security and HVAC. In the Middle East, we saw revenue decline low double-digits as continued growth and service activity was more than offset by softness, we're seeing in HVAC project installations but this was also driven by a tough compared with the prior year, which was up strong double-digits. Latin America revenues increased mid-single digits led by strengthen our security long-term position business and solid growth in IR on fire suppression.","Adjusted EBITDA of $77 million increased a strong 17% organically and our EBIT margins expanded 70 basis points to 8.5% and this includes 30 basis points headwinds from FX. The underlying margin increased 100 basis points as favorable volume and mix and productivity and synergy save more than offset the run rate impact is other sales force investments in '18.","Orders in EMEA\/LA increased 9% led by solid growth in Europe and Latin America across both service and installation. In the Middle East, orders decline low double-digits again driven by a top compare with the prior year. Overall backlog ended at $1.6 billion up 15% organically.","So let's move date back on slide 10, sales of $613 million gross 6% organically driven by an acceleration and project installations, which grew 8% in the quarter growth and install was led by HVAC and Investor Relations. Adjusted $66 million declined 9% on an organic basis. And as expected EBITDA margin declined 160 basis points to 10.8% as the benefit of the favorable volume was more than offset by the higher install mix, run rate, sales force investments and the as expected competitive pressures in China.","Asia-Pac orders increased a strong 9% in the quarter driven primarily by service and we are beginning to see some improvement in year-over-year secured margins, particularly in service, which should benefit the latter half of this year. Overall backlog increased 12% to $1.5 billion.","Turning to global products in slide 11, sales increased 7% organically and this was on top of a mid-single digit growth last year. Sales totaled $1.8 billion in the quarter. Buildings Management Systems grew low double-digits with strength across all three of our platforms control security and fire detection. Sales across our HVAC and IR equipment businesses grew high single-digits collectively and global residential HVAC, which is you know include sales to our consolidated Hitachi JVs in Japan and Taiwan grew mid-single digits in the quarter.","North American revenue HVAC grew high single-digits benefiting from favor or weather trends and strong price realization. And our global light commercial HVAC grew mid-teens in the quarter with North America up low-teens. IR equipment revenues declined low double-digits in the quarter due to a very difficult prior year compare, which was up a strong double-digits.","Our applied HVAC equipment business grew high-teens reflecting strength in our indirect channels in both North America and Asia. We saw specially products grow mid-single digits on strong demand for fire suppression products. And this was broad-based across all regions, particularly in a APAC.","Segment EBITDA of $194 million was up 15% organically and the margin expand 60 basis points driven by higher volume leverage and mix, positive freight costs in the quarter, and the benefit of cost synergies and productivity save partially offset by our continued product and channel investments.","So let's move to corporate on slide 12, corporate expense with down 11%, the $93 million as we continue to see the benefits of our cost reduction initiatives. For the full-year on a continuing ops basis, we expect corporate expense in the range of $380 million to $395 million. This does not include any take out like the Power Solutions divestiture, which will begin post transaction close. As a reminder, overtime we expect to reduce corporate expense by about $50 million.","Moving to cash flow on slide 13, as George mentioned, reported cash flow was an outflow in the quarter, slightly above $200 million. If you exclude a little less than a $100 million of integration and transaction costs, adjusted free cash flow in the quarter was an outflow of a couple $100 million. And as you know, our first fiscal quarter is typically a cash outflow, but we will place with the continued year-over-year improvement we're seeing in the cadence of our cash generation.","For fiscal '19, we expect adjusted free cash flow conversion of approximately 95%. As I mentioned on the Q4 call, this excludes special cash outflows of $300 million to $400 million related to some special integration costs, and a $600 million tax refund that we expect either in Q4 or in early fiscal '20.","Moving to the balance sheet on slide 14, you can see that our gross and net debt increase to $1 billion sequentially as planned, which reflects a higher CP balance to support a Q1 trade working capital needs as well as a more aggressive share buyback program that we implemented. Assuming a June 30 close for Power Solutions, we expect to pay between $3 billion and $3.5 billion of its outstanding debt in Q4 with a portion of the net proceeds. This will result in a reduction of financing costs of about $25 million or $0.02 in the fourth quarter which is included in the full-year guidance that George will provide.","Our net debt to cap increased to 36.6% from 33.7% in Q4, related primarily to the share repurchases as well as a reduction in equity related to a Q1 adoption of a new income tax accounting standards. Given our current stock price, we are being very aggressive with our buyback program. We made significant progress toward our full-year share repurchase target of a $1 billion, which will be completed before the closing of the Power Solutions transaction.","In Q1, we were purchased just over $14 million shares to approximately $465 million. I would also note that we expect to utilize a portion of the power sale proceeds later in the year to purchase additional shares, which is expected to contribute about $0.03 in incremental earnings for the year. Given our planned share, we post strategy for fiscal '19. We now expect our diluted weighted average shares to be approximately $905 million for the year.","Finally, let me touch on a couple other items on slide 15, before I turn it back over to George for fiscal '19 guidance. First based upon some additional tax planning that's been done in part related to the pending sales, Power Solutions, we now expect our effective tax rates and continuing ops in fiscal '19 to be approximately 13.5%.","As Antonella mentioned, the results of Power Solutions are now reported as discontinued operations and all historical financial information is presented in the comparable basis. We are well underway with the separation activities and expect the sale to close no later than June 30, and also mentioned the Power Solution shut adjusted free cash flow in the quarter of about $100 million, which is right in line with expectations.","And lastly, all the guidance that we provide will be on a continuing ops basis. And we have provided normalized financials in the appendix for competitive purposes, so you can update your models.","And with that, I'll turn it back over to George.","George Oliver","Thanks, Brian. Before we open up the line for questions, I want to provide you with our outlook for 2019 continuing operations. Let's start by walking through the year-over-year impact of the significant items embedded in our 2019 guidance on slide 16. As I mentioned on the fourth quarter call, we expect mid-single digit organic growth and buildings, which will drive approximately $0.20 of earnings. We expect this growth to be primarily driven by improved volumes and price. We will also have the continued benefits of synergies and productivity savings in buildings in corporate, which we will realize over the course of the year they will contribute an additional $0.19 cents of earnings.","Additionally, as Brian discussed the benefit in fiscal 2019 related to the deployment of a portion of the Power Solution sale proceeds is expected to add about $0.05 of earnings. The carryover impact of the sales force investments as well as a few cents of incremental investments in our product businesses are expected to total about $0.07. As you are all aware, the U.S. dollar has continued to strengthen. Based on quarter end rates, we expect this to result in a $0.06 foreign currency headwind year-over-year.","Lastly, as you can see, there are various other items, which led to a $0.10 headwind with the most notable being a $0.03 headwind from tax and a $0.02 headwind from both pensions and amortization. All these factors contributed to our fiscal 2019 EPS guidance range before special items of a $1.75 to a $1.85. This represents growth in the range of 10% to 16%. The full detail of our guidance is included on slide 17. Lastly, as a significant portion of the benefit related to the deployment of the Power Solution sale proceeds will benefit fiscal 2020, I wanted to provide a framework for how our earnings are expected to progress as we move forward.","As you can see, on slide 18, the incremental benefit of proceeds deployed in 2019, additional share repurchase in 2020 and a reduction in corporate costs is expected to contribute an incremental $0.50 to $0.60 of earnings, which takes our fiscal 2020 EPS in the range of $2.25 to $2.45. This would be prior to any operational growth or benefits from additional capital deployments.","Recognizing that we will not receive the full benefit of our reduce share account in fiscal 2020 there will be an incremental benefit of $0.10 to $0.20 in fiscal 2021. Over the last two years, we've been merging two businesses into one and have made a significant amount of progress. During that time, we have reinvested heavily back into the businesses.","Now, it's about capitalizing on those investments with how we are going to market. We have been building backlog, which provides us visibility in our field businesses. We've been strengthening our service business, which tend to be more resilient and our short cycle products business is seeing good growth across all three platforms. We are watching closely what is happening economically around the globe and our focuses on execution, and delivering for our customers. We feel good about our position in a very attractive market, and we expect to grow our underlying operations at or above the market for industrial peers as we look ahead.","With that, let me turn it over to our operator to open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question in the queue is from Gautam Khanna from Cowen & Company. Your line is now open.","Gautam Khanna","Yes, thanks, good morning, and I appreciate the detail.","Antonella Franzen","Good morning, Gautam.","Brian Stief","Good morning.","George Oliver","Good morning, Gautam.","Gautam Khanna","I was wondering if, George, if you could just maybe directly address the capital allocation with the proceeds of the Power Solutions bin -- just to be clear, we should expect or we should model in that besides the $3 million to $3.5 million of debt repayment, it's all going to be directed at share repurchase, is that a fair conclusion?","George Oliver","That is correct. As I said, we're very much focused on executing on the strategy, delivering on the growth, delivering the operational performance, and ultimately delivering results, and our plan today is to take the proceeds from the Power Solutions sales, and as we have said, deploy those as quickly and as efficiently as we can as we -- once we complete the transactions.","Gautam Khanna","Got it, that's very helpful. And just in terms of M&A appetite, I mean, do you guys have really any interest in North American resi HVAC as an area of acquisition growth?","George Oliver","Well, Gautam, as you know we've been investing heavily back into our products over the last three or four years. We feel very good about our portfolio and the progress we've made and -- with the new products we bring into market, although we are not a leader in that space today, we feel very good about the progress we're making with the share gains that we're making and how we're positioned for the future. So at this stage, we're continuing to focusing on executing on the investments we've made and ultimately delivering the results.","Gautam Khanna","Thanks a lot, guys, appreciate it.","George Oliver","Thanks.","Operator","Next question is from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.","The next question is from Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Your line is now open.","Jeffrey Sprague","Thanks. I was speechless by that last question.","George Oliver","Good morning, Jeff.","Brian Stief","Hi, Jeff.","Jeffrey Sprague","Good morning. Hey, just a couple of things from me. First, Brian, as you may know, there's a lot of noise out there in kind of tax right now with this deductibility issue creating some uncertainty. You know, I assume your guide encapsulates all that, but can you give us a little bit of a update on what change to get you to this lower tax rate in '19 than you were previously thinking, and is there any upward risk to that rate if some of these tax law changes take full effect?","Brian Stief","Yes, so I would say that a reduction in the rate, Jeff, to 13.5% was just a function of a lot of planning that was done in contemplation of the Power Solutions sale. You know, we had guided a year or so ago that with -- tax reform is going to impact us by about 2% to 4% prior to any tax planning. And I think our tax team has done a great job of minimizing the impact of tax reforms on our rate and so that 13.5% we're really comfortable with for fiscal '19. As it relates to these proposed reqs that are out that I think you're referring to because we're a fiscal year company, Jeff, that doesn't impact us until 10\/01\/19, which is our fiscal '20 and at this point in time given the tax structure and footprint that we've got in place, we don't expect a significant impact in 2020 from those proposed reqs.","Jeffrey Sprague","Great, thanks for that. And then George, maybe just on kind of the overall price execution, maybe a little bit of an update on what you're actually seeing on price realization and kind of how your price cost dynamics play out in 2019 and how that plays into your margin outlook?","George Oliver","Sure. As you know in 2018, we made a lot of progress, we started off with a lot of headwinds and through the course of the year executed extremely well, executing on price. And as we planned for 2019, we not only took into account all of the inflationary pressures on the commodities, but also the impact that we're going to see from tariffs, and so we feel very good about the progress we've made and what we continue to make that we've got not only the inflationary pressures, but the tariffs fully covered in our plan. I would suggest at this stage, we'll see -- of the margin improvement, there's probably 10 to 20 basis points of margin improvement that's attributed to price. And I would tell you across the board, cross all of our products as well as across all of our regions we're now seeing margin accretion as a result of the strategy, the pricing strategy that we've deployed.","Jeffrey Sprague","Great thank you.","Operator","Next question is from Andrew Kaplowitz from Citi. Your line is now open.","Unidentified Analyst","Good morning, guys. It's [indiscernible] speaking on for Andy.","Antonella Franzen","Good morning.","George Oliver","Good morning.","Unidentified Analyst","So, your global products business has been quite strong with the high single digits for over a year now, I think, organic growth. Can you talk about your confidence in sustaining that elevated growth and if there's any way to think about sort of how much of it is market driven versus outcomes of everything you've been doing on your product investment?","George Oliver","Now as you know, we've been investing extremely heavily, reinvesting over the last three or four years across each one of the product platforms in what I would say is across the board we are gaining share with the investments we've made, with the new products we're bringing to the market. Brian went through the details here, but if you look at our building management solutions, a combination of all of our digital businesses, we're growing low double-digits and that's a result of the reinvestments we're not only making in our Metasys building controls, but all of the other electronic platforms that now are going to be integrated within our Metasys platform. And so we feel really good about the position that we have in that space.","If you look at the other segments in the HVAC space, you know, residential, we're seeing a nice growth across the globe, and that's a combination of what we're doing in North America as well as within our Hitachi JV. In North America, we are seeing -- I think if you look at the last year, over the last year we've had very strong double-digit growth and as we see ourselves going forward, we see that continuing. So the investments we're making there have been very, very strong. The other is in the light commercial. We're seeing very nice growth in the quarter in our light commercial business globally. That again is double digits. And then when you look at our applied business with the investments we've made not only in our chillers, but in our air handling equipment, and the deployment of that in new projects, we're seeing very nice pickup in share gain, pretty much across the globe. And so I think it's a factor of both the space -- the HVAC space is continuing to expand and with the investments that we had been making and executing on, it's given us an opportunity that within that expansion, we're enabling ourselves to be able to gain share.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. That's really helpful. And then just as a follow-up, it seems like your applied business has continued to accelerate and I know you mentioned some potential equipment pull forward here at of pricing, but are you also seeing U.S. institutional markets accelerating and how much contribution are you getting from new products like your new chiller that you rolled out?","George Oliver","Yes, so as we look at this space, we do see the institutional vertical is coming back pretty strong, and as you know that we have a very strong position in that, you know, if you look at our North America applied business, when you look at our orders, our orders are up mid-teens, and as I said earlier, a very strong sudden push [ph], and I think that again is because of the verticals we support, the investments we're making in the new products, and then our go-to-market in making sure that we're getting more than our fair share as we execute on the pipeline. Our pipeline right now is up double digits across the globe, and so as you look at our orders globally, we achieved 7% with a backlog up about the same, and with the confidence that I have in the pipeline and the way that we've been converting on that pipeline over the last three or four quarters gives me confidence that we're going to be well-positioned here to deliver on 2019 and beyond.","Unidentified Analyst","Great, thanks guys.","Operator","Next question is from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.","Nigel Coe","Hello. Can you hear me?","Antonella Franzen","Yes, we can hear you.","George Oliver","Good morning, Nigel.","Nigel Coe","Thank God, I mean, just to make clear [indiscernible] music. So that's got to be very clear.","George Oliver","We enjoyed the music, Nigel.","Nigel Coe","Thanks for the second part of the apple here. So just to just be very clear, George, you're encouraged not to bake in all the proceeds $8 billion or whatever it is from the disposable x debt reduction into share repurchases as of 4Q, 1Q next year, is that the message?","George Oliver","That is correct.","Nigel Coe","Okay, that's pretty clear. Can we just turn to -- I got two quick questions, one do you have a handle on the free cash flow profiles to new JCI? Obviously, the old JCI has a very backend loaded free cash generation. How does the new JCI look? Obviously, you had a negative in 1Q, which I think was expected but how does that then progress through 2Q and into second-half of the year?","George Oliver","Yes, I think it's going to be consistent and we will continue to be backend loaded. I mean, if you look at our building's profitability it's in the back half of the year. So I think you can look at this and assume it's going to be pretty consistent with what we've seen historically. First quarter is a cash outflow. We get most of that back plus or minus breakeven, maybe a little positive year-to-date in Q2 and then it will be the back half what we delivered, the majority of the cash to get us to the 95%, but all thanks for tracking for that right now. We're pretty pleased with how it came out first quarter.","Nigel Coe","Okay. And then, turn to China and the competitive nature of that market you pulled out, what specifically you have seen the competition, is it foreign securities, that's HVAC commercial versus residential, it sounds like it's commercial, and you've seen it mainly from local players, or MNCs and any color there will be helpful?","George Oliver","Yes. so I mean, we're making good progress in China when you look at our revenue or up low double-digits pretty much led by HVAC and refrigeration, so we're seeing good execution there, most of our footprint there is in the commercial space, very strong in the applied HVAC, we've got a tremendous position as well as we're position locally with our supply chain, with a very one of our -- let's say highest performing plants and so we're positioned well within that market our orders. When you look at our orders is up almost double-digits and in addition Nigel to making sure that we're building the install base we've been accelerating our service growth and so we're seeing orders in our services now up kind of 20 plus percent in that space. And so, not only are we continuing to expand our install base, but on top of that, being able to execute now in the service opportunities. So when we talk about margins, we did as we look at the overall region is mainly driven by the mix of install, and then the mix of the China growth relative to the overall APAC region. We are beginning to execute and accelerate service growth, which will help mitigate some of that that acceleration of install. But I feel confident that the fundamentals were ultimately driving, how we're going to be positioned for the rest of the year. We'll see continued improvement there.","Nigel Coe","Okay. George you are really the best. Thanks very much.","Antonella Franzen","Thanks.","Operator","Next question is from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Steve Tusa","I wish I had that fancy theme music\u2026","Antonella Franzen","Are you in-charge?","Steve Tusa","Yes. That's good marketing by Nigel.","George Oliver","Good morning Steve.","Steve Tusa","Good morning. The just kind of the -- I know you guys have a lot of different businesses in there. But residential HVAC pricing is obviously been very strong, can you maybe dig into what you're seeing from a price perspective on the kind of core applied side and what you expect to kind of put through for 2019 calendar in the various regions?","George Oliver","Yes, so across the board, we -- as we get into this starting out last year with my transition, we got deep into each one of the segments not only the product segments, but regionally and went about making sure across the board we had good understanding of the cost structure and the inflationary pressures coming through as well as what we could expect from a tariff standpoint. And so, Steve across the board we've been executing strong pricing in every one of our categories, every one of our regions.","Now what I would tell you is that when you look at our growth last year I believe we suggest you it's about 1% or 2% of our growth, given the progress we made across the board that's going to be elevated here in 2019 additional, percentage of our growth and I think given the work we've done, you could see similar type improvements across the other product segments as you're seeing within our residential business.","Steve Tusa","Got it. Okay. And are you seeing any pockets of competitive behavior from your domestic competitors? I know, carriers trying to come out with the new products and it doesn't seem like train is mucking it up. So any anything out of your kind of a domestic kind of North American competitors, you're seeing anybody get aggressive to get new products into the channel?","George Oliver","I mean, I think across the board, there's some, you could go through each one of our competitors and the new products coming to market. I think you would have seen it at AHRI this year that's pretty much across the board. We've been focusing on how do we create value in each one of the segments for our customers? What's, from a technology standpoint, what is going to differentiate us from the competitors, I think we're executing well, and as a result of that, when we bring these new products to the market, there's a much higher value proposition that we make to our customers, which allows us to be able to get additional price. And so, I think you would have seen that there are some other new products coming in the market. I will tell you my assessment, given the investments we're making, I feel very confident with what we're doing and how it compares to our competitors and truly believe that as we continue to move forward with these product introductions, we're going to continue to gain share.","Steve Tusa","Yes, clearly a great presence at AHRI and good nice espresso bar upstairs as well. I appreciate that late in the afternoon. One last question for you, just on kind of seasonality and anything unusual, seasonally here as you move into the second quarter, and how that should behave financially, anything moving around?","George Oliver","No, I mean, what I would say Steve is when you look at the total year. I mean, when you separate Power Solutions, the remaining company we are typically now historically been 30% for staff 70% back half. Obviously, we are off to a nice start here in 2019. I see that continuing. And so, when you look at our performance, we're going to continue to drive strong order growth, we're going to continue to convert revenue, kind of mid-single digit based on the backlog we see and how that's going to flow and then we'll continue to deliver a very strong cash flow, as we continue to execute to the year, so I don't see anything significantly different than what historically we've done.","Steve Tusa","Okay, great. Thanks for the color.","Operator","Next question is from Tim Wojs with Baird. Your line is open.","Tim Wojs","Hey, good morning, everybody.","Antonella Franzen","Good morning.","George Oliver","Good Morning.","Tim Wojs","Maybe just on the building's margins, how much of a kind of the sequential improvement that's implied for the rest of the year? Is really Asia kind of getting back to EIBT margin expansion versus, extra synergy realization or some of the investments?","George Oliver","Yes. When you look at the underlying margins that we're projecting for buildings here in 2019, it's -- was the overall it's going to be 40 to 60 basis points. And that's being driven by strong -- the pickup that we get on the volume in the mix, the strong productivity, synergies productivity that we're delivering, and that's being then offset by this is a few headwinds which we talked about which was we still have the run rate of our sales investments from 2018 coming through the first-half of this year, and that's roughly about 30 -- about 30 basis points.","And then, the other as we do have as Brian talked about some pension headwind as well as equity income that year-on-year is a little bit of a pressure, but operationally with what's coming through not only the growth what's coming through on price is ultimately is what's delivering on that 40 to 60 basis points. That's pretty broad base across each of the businesses. You know, what I would say in APAC, we had said we're going to have pressure in APAC given what we had in backlog that was going to convert the first part of this year, I would tell you that we are executing on the fundamentals, we are improving those fundamentals, we are growing the service business which is higher margin and the combination is what's going to be able to flow through the year and be able to contribute to that 40 to 60 basis points of improvement.","Tim Wojs","Okay, so it sounds like that 30 basis point headwind on investments that should taper as you go through the year?","George Oliver","That is correct.","Tim Wojs","Okay, great. And then just on free cash flow, I know the gap is closer now. It's 95% plus ex-power. What do you guys need to do internally to maybe get that in line with better than earnings? Are there any big buckets that you can tap to, to improve that metric? Thanks.","Brian Stief","Yes. I mean we have made good progress I guess just to comment on trade capital, I mean our DPO year-over-year has improved by six days. Our DSOs improved by a couple days. We are flattish relative to inventory. So if there was an area that I think we need to go to work on a bit more inventory is probably an area that we are going to be spending some more time on in fiscal '19. When you actually look at trade working capital as a percentage of sales, December 31 last year versus December 31 this year, we are actually improved by 130 basis points which is giving some of the basis for why we are moving to a 95% plus free cash flow number here. But I think we are making progress. There are certainly areas that we continue to look at across the globe. I mean we looked at our larger markets first. So I just expect gradual improvement as we move into 2020.","Operator","Next question in the queue is from Josh Pokrzywinski from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Josh Pokrzywinski","Hi, good morning guys.","Antonella Franzen","Good morning.","George Oliver","Good morning, Josh.","Josh Pokrzywinski","George, just wanted to follow-up on your comment on some of the unitary businesses and the share gains, the investment. I guess the piece that it's harder for us to see is on the distribution side and getting these products out to market. I think historically that's been one of the challenges for anyone trying to gain share. With all the new products, are you finding the ability to kind of add store fronts or add distribution points within in resi and commercial unitary?","George Oliver","Absolutely. As you look at all of the regions certainly we tailor our strategy depending on the region and where we have a strong position, where we have weak positions. We are not only putting our own distribution in place, but also other distributors that we are working with to expand our presence within the each of the key markets that is absolutely tied to reinvestments that we are making within the new products to assure that as we are reinvesting, we are positioned from a go-to market to be able to return to get the returns on that investment. So absolutely, and I think when you look at our relative performance over last year, we have been able to do what we have said relative to continuing to launch new product, expand distribution, and grow at or above the market rate.","Josh Pokrzywinski","Got it, that's helpful. And then just taking a step back on margins and operating leverage at large. We are kind of halfway through the synergy calendar at this point. I guess looking at incremental margins here understanding you can get a little tailwind from price that investment is a drag but obviously something that needs be done. How should we think about structural incremental margins here? Because it seems like some of the synergy upside you are deploying back into business and there is only another year left after '19. Is the underlying incremental margin in the business still around 20% or how should we think about that shift over time?","George Oliver","Yes, so I'd frame in up, if you start 2018, our incremental margins as you suggested in the low 20s. When you look at and a lot of that was driven because we had reinvestment in sales in the sales force ahead of our growth. And we've had historically over the last three or four years, the reinvestments in our product and technology was ahead of our growth. What you see happening in 2019 now that begins -- that reinvestment now begins to level out as a percent of revenue. And so our field businesses should be -- on a go forward basis should be in high teens to low 20s recognizing that that business is very much driven by variable labor. And in the products businesses now with the investments that we have made and the growth that we are achieving should now become more like mid to upper 20s. And so, I think as we get through the year as we lap some of these headwinds that we had in the first half with the year-on-year compares, we are going to start to see some nice leverage going forward. So I would target incremental is to be over the next couple of years kind of mid to -- kind of mid 20s plus over the next couple of years.","Josh Pokrzywinski","Inclusive of synergies?","George Oliver","That's correct.","Josh Pokrzywinski","Got it. Appreciate the color. Thanks, George.","Operator","Next question is from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.","Noah Kaye","Hi, thanks for taking the question and great to see the continued solid execution. And George, I think I would like to return to the capital allocation question for a minute. You were very clear this morning that the power proceeds will go towards debt pay down and share repurchases. And I guess my question is given that the new JCI is really about smart, safe, efficient, sustainable buildings, how are you thinking about opportunities for additions or adjacencies whether it's HVAC as someone mentioned earlier or lighting? And why wouldn't you be looking to augment the portfolio at this point if it's sort of where you think the cycle is, is it evaluation? Help us understand that.","George Oliver","Yes. I mean we are always looking at the portfolio to make sure that from an organic standpoint we are making the right investments for getting the intended returns on those investments. And what I would say is that we feel really good about the progress we made with our organic investments. And that being said, as we look at the trends, customer trends and industry trends, we are also making sure that we look forward we are making or comparing our organic investments against what can be done from an acquisition or investment standpoint. And so what I would tell you is that as we look at our position, we feel really good about our position with the work that we have done here over the last couple of years.","Now we are always looking at to make sure that as we look at the ability to be able to create value, I will tell you we are always looking to make sure that we are standing on offense and understanding the trends and what we are going to do to be positioned to be able to achieve those trends. So, at this stage given where we are, given the progress we have made with reinvestments, given the success we have had with our sales force, we are focused on executing and being able to deliver on the commitments we have made in delivering strong results.","Noah Kaye","Got it. Appreciate it. Thanks very much.","Operator","Next question is from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Deane Dray","Thank you. Good morning everyone.","Antonella Franzen","Good morning.","George Oliver","Good morning, Deane.","Deane Dray","Hey, just want to go back to slide 18, just to make sure I understand that footnote and maybe it's earnings fatigue, and you have already mentioned it, but what's the -- when you say that the $0.10 to $0.20 benefit is excluded that's coming in fiscal '21. Could you remind us what that piece is?","Brian Stief","Yes. So if you look at the overall $0.75 that we have kind of talked about historically, there was a nickel of that that's in '19 that we talked about for '19 guidance. So then we were saying that was the midpoint of $0.55 in fiscal '20. And then there is midpoint $0.15 in 2021. That's how you get to that full $0.75 we have talked about historically. And the reason there is $0.15 still coming in 2021 is because no matter what share repurchase approach we use, we aren't going to get the full benefit likely in fiscal '20. And so, there will be a carryon effect in 2021 from an EPS standpoint that will get that's really a byproduct of the whatever repurchase program approach we use whether it's open market purchases, whether it's ASR, or whether it's some form of a general combination of those. But the way we have model it now, there is $01.5 more than would come in 2021 to get us to full $0.75.","Deane Dray","Right. That was a great explanation. Thank you. And then for George, couple of times you have mentioned the service opportunity. And I heard you say that today service is two-thirds recurring. And what's the right mix? Or, what's the right ratio there in terms of optimizing the service offering from a margin standpoint?","George Oliver","Yes. So, Deane, we made strategic -- we have made service growth one of our strategic imperatives when I took over. And it's an incredible business. Like I said, it's over $6 billion globally. And traditionally, it's been more of the maintenance and repair of the installed base, getting some recurrent revenue through PSAs, doing some monitoring in the -- within the Fire & Security businesses. And what I would say is we have been incredible opportunity to takeover we have done today in the 60% to 65% is mainly contracts that get renewed for that type of work, and what we are doing today is above and beyond that we are deploying now new solutions utilizing the data, using AI, and now it enables us to be able to optimize not only the maintenance of those -- that equipment, but also beyond what we historically have done to be able to create new value propositions through new business models and leveraging technology.","So, I'm pretty excited about the progress we have made, recognize that we started at a standstill in 2017, our service growth was, I think 1% in 2017, through the course of 2018, we ramped from 3% to 4% to 5% to 6%, and then again in the first quarter here, we are all pretty strong with 6% growth. And so, it's a combination of not only getting a higher percentage of the traditional work that we get on the install-base we create, but it's also creating new business that we deploy on top of that install-base, which is more wide space for us, which is a significant opportunity for us to be able to contribute to the growth.","Deane Dray","Terrific. George, just lastly, any encouraging words for the Patriots on Sunday?","George Oliver","No comments.","Deane Dray","Come on. A guy from Worcester you think would be\u2026","George Oliver","No, go past, I guess.","Deane Dray","Okay, thank you. I got what I was looking for.","Antonella Franzen","Operator, I would like to turn the call over to George for some closing comments.","George Oliver","All right, thanks again everyone for joining our call this morning. As you have seen, we have made a tremendous amount of progress in 2018, and I think most important now is that we are building on that momentum in 2019, and certainly look forward to engaging many of you here over the next few weeks.","Operator, that concludes our call."],"12644":["Johnson Controls International Plc (NYSE:JCI) Q2 2018 Earnings Call May  1, 2018 11:00 AM ET","Executives","Antonella Franzen - Johnson Controls International Plc","George R.

Your lines have been placed on listen-only until the question-and-answer session. This conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. I will now turn the call over to Antonella Franzen, Vice-President and Chief Investor Relations and Communications Officer.","Antonella Franzen - Johnson Controls International Plc","Thank you. Good morning, and thank you for joining our conference call to discuss Johnson Controls second quarter fiscal 2018 results. The press release and all related tables issued earlier this morning as well as the conference call slide presentation can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website at johnsoncontrols.com. With me today are Johnson Controls Chairman and Chief Executive Officer George Oliver and our Executive Vice-President and Chief Financial Officer Brian Stief.","Before we begin, I would like to remind you that during the course of today's call, we will be providing certain forward-looking information. We ask that you review today's press release and read through the forward-looking cautionary informational statements that we have included there. In addition, we will use certain non-GAAP measures in our discussions, and we ask that you read through the sections of our press release that address these items. In discussing our results during the call, references to adjusted EBITA and adjusted EBIT margins exclude restructuring and integration costs as well as other special items. These metrics are non-GAAP measures and are reconciled in the schedules attached to our press release and in the appendix to the presentation posted on our website.","GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to Johnson Controls ordinary shareholders was $0.47 for the quarter and included a net charge of $0.06 related to special items. These special items primarily relate to integration costs. Adjusting for these special items, non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.53 per share compared to $0.50 in the prior year quarter. Now let me turn the call over to George.","George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc","Thanks, Antonella, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on today's call. I would like to begin this morning with a quick review of the strategic highlights in the quarter which will set the tone for this morning's call as well as what you should expect from us over the next couple of quarters. A consistent theme you will hear today is that we are building momentum across the organization.","Starting on slide 3, as we have discussed over the past couple of quarters, we have been intently focused on reinvesting for growth, transforming the sales organization, driving synergy and productivity benefits, improving free cash flow conversion, and optimizing our portfolio. Based on the results of the second quarter, I'm even more confident that the steps we have taken and the investments we have made are beginning to pay off. We saw another quarter of strong traction with respect to increasing our sales capacity. In fact, by the end of the quarter, we have already achieved our target to add 400 salespeople net of attrition. Additionally, we are seeing better than expected productivity from our new sales ads which has contributed to increased sales orders. The resegmentation of the sales force along with our initiatives to improve pricing discipline have resulted in an improvement in margins on orders secured and backlog. For example, in the second quarter, margins on new orders booked in North America increased approximately 100 basis points year-over-year, which compares to the 70 basis point improvement we discussed last quarter.","Based on the progress made to date and to better position us heading into fiscal 2019, we plan to continue to add sales capacity in select regions and businesses. Consistent with the first quarter, organic growth in our Global Products segment increased 6% year-over-year. The significant investments in capital we have deployed over the past several years into areas such as engineering, R&D, and distribution footprint continue to convert to higher Global Products sales growth, and we expect the momentum to continue as we launch new products and technology into the market.","Building service growth increased 3% in the quarter. We made significant progress expanding our commercial capabilities and strengthening operations while increasing our field technician capacity. In Power Solutions, although we have experienced a softer than planned start to the year, I am encouraged by the progress our team has made securing new OE and aftermarket business. We will see the benefits of those wins beginning in the second half as top line growth accelerates to 5-plus percent. The underlying fundamentals within the Power Solutions business are extremely strong, which will help deliver solid volume leverage as growth accelerates.","Another area we continue to see very good progress is on the synergies and productivity front. Year-over-year, we had an incremental $0.05 of savings in the quarter and $0.10 year to date, and that will increase in the second half. We continue to expect $250 million or $0.23 of incremental savings in fiscal 2018. In addition to the cost side, we continue to benefit from cross-selling wins. In the quarter, we were awarded a sizable project for our fire and controls products as well as the installation for a new mega-resort in Asia which will include multi-function and convention halls as well as two luxury hotels. This is just one example of the everyday joint efforts of our one team approach.","We are also seeing some momentum building on cash conversion, as Brian will discuss a bit later in the call. We generated approximately $300 million in adjusted free cash flow during the first half of fiscal 2018, a significant improvement versus the prior year. Clearly there is more work ahead, but as I have committed to you over the past couple of quarters, improving cash conversion is one of our top priorities.","Lastly, I wanted to comment on our ongoing strategic review of Power Solutions. Power Solutions is a strong franchise with very strong positions in proven advanced Battery technologies with long-term relationships with both OE and aftermarket customers around the globe. We continue to work closely with our external advisors, and we are making good progress. We are committed to positioning Power Solutions for long-term success and optimizing shareholder value.","Let's turn to slide 4 for a quick look at the macro environment. The macroeconomic environment generally remained favorable across most of our key geographic regions, supported by rising global GDPs. North American non-residential construction markets are growing steadily, led by the institutional verticals.","Global demand for our commercial HVAC & Controls products is strong, highlighted by continued order strength in Asia, the Middle East, and North America. The sustained rebound in oil prices continues to ease regional budgetary constraints across the Middle East, and is also driving increased demand for our fire protection and suppression products that serve the harsh and hazardous end markets globally. China remains one of the fastest growth regions. Non-residential construction starts in China remained flat overall with declines in commercial offset by double digit growth in institutional, infrastructure, and industrial verticals.","In Power, lower auto production particularly in the U.S. and Europe has put pressure on industry unit shipments year to date. The moderate weather has weakened aftermarket demand. However, China continues to outpace the market and has been a source of growth in both channels. As we look to the back half, we expect production levels to stabilize, and we are encouraged by the pace of new business wins over the last six months. Overall, the underlying fundamentals within most of our key geographies remain supportive of continued order and revenue growth momentum throughout fiscal 2018.","Turning over to slide 5, Buildings field orders accelerated again in the quarter, up 7% year on year organically with continued strong quoting activity. This compares to low single digit average growth in fiscal 2017 and 5% growth last quarter. Underlying order strength was broad-based across the three regions as well as all domains including installation and service. Our growth in backlog provides confidence in continued improvement in revenue growth.","Turning now to slide 6, let me recap the results for the quarter. Sales of $7.5 billion increased 3% on a reported basis in the quarter and 1% organically led by products and service which, as I mentioned earlier, grew 6% and 3% respectively. Adjusted EBIT of $740 million grew 4% as the impact from the Scott Safety divestiture and anticipated headwind from lower gross margins and incremental investments were more than offset by cost synergy and productivity savings.","The headwinds we anticipated played out pretty much as we expected. The conversion of our lower margin backlog in North America resulted in a $10 million headwind. Price\/cost was expected to be a $20 million headwind. We actually came in better than expected, less than $10 million, resulting from strong realization on the announced price increases. Between incremental product and sales capacity investments, we planned to spend approximately $30 million in the quarter, and we came in closer to $40 million. Despite those margin pressures in the quarter, EBIT margins expanded 10 basis points year-over-year on a reported basis or 30 basis points excluding the impact of the Scott Safety divestiture, FX, and lead.","Adjusted earnings per share came in at $0.53, up 6% over the prior year and in line with the framework we provided you last quarter. In addition, adjusted free cash flow in the quarter was approximately $600 million.","Turning to our EPS bridge on slide 7, you can see synergy and productivity savings adding $0.05 to the prior year. Volume and mix added an additional $0.02 driven by solid growth in Buildings and a mix benefit with higher growth in products and service. The cumulative benefit of synergies and volume mix was partially offset by expected gross margin pressure and incremental growth in sales investments. Net FX and other added $0.01. Overall, this resulted in $0.53 in adjusted EPS for the quarter. With that, I will turn it over to Brian to discuss the performance within the segments.","Brian J. Stief - Johnson Controls International Plc","Thanks, George, and good morning. So starting on slide 8, let's take a look at the performance of Buildings on a consolidated basis. You can see sales in the quarter of $5.6 billion increased 2% year-over-year and 2% organically, with Products up 6% and Field down 1% where we saw solid growth in service more than offset by slower backlog conversion on project installations. On the Buildings top line, a 4% headwind from M&A, primarily related to the Q1 divestiture of Scott Safety, was fully offset by the benefit of FX in the quarter.","Buildings consolidated EBITA of $630 million was flat year-over-year but up 3% excluding the net impact of the Scott Safety divestiture and FX. Buildings EBITA margin decreased 10 basis points versus prior year to 11.2%, but this includes a 40 basis point headwind from the divestiture of Scott Safety. On a normalized basis, the EBITA margin expanded a solid 30 basis points. As you can see in the margin waterfall, the combined 130 basis point benefit from cost synergy and productivity savings, volume, and mix was partially offset by 100 basis points from the expected Q2 headwinds related to conversion of lower margin backlog, price\/cost pressure, and incremental product and sales capacity investments, all generally in line with the Q2 expectations we set for you last quarter. As George mentioned, organic field orders increased by a strong 7% year-over-year with backlog up 6% to $8.5 billion.","Now let's review each segment within Buildings in more detail. Turning to slide 9, North America, sales of $2.1 billion grew 1% organically driven by low single digit growth in our commercial HVAC & Controls businesses and modest growth in our Fire & Security business. We did see our Solutions business down low single digits in the quarter. Overall service revenue grew 3% organically with installation revenue up modestly. North America adjusted EBITA of $244 million increased 7% year-over-year and EBITA margins expanded 60 basis points to 11.6%, but I would note that this includes a 50 basis point benefit due to a lost contract charge that we talked with you about in the prior-year quarter.","Excluding that benefit, the underlying margin expanded 10 basis points as the benefits of synergies and productivity, volume, and mix were substantially offset by the 70 basis point headwind from the planned lower margin backlog conversion and our sales force investments. Orders in North America increased 4% organically, including improved margins on those orders, and we saw strong order intake in both our conventional HVAC install and service business as well as Fire & Security. Backlog of $5.3 billion increased 5% year-over-year.","So let's move to slide 10, EMEA\/LA. As expected, sales of $907 million declined 3% organically given the lower project backlog we had entering fiscal 2018 in Europe and the Middle East. Europe declined in the low single digits, driven primarily by lower installation revenue in Industrial Refrigeration and HVAC. However we did see double digit order growth in Q2, led by demand for Fire & Security and Industrial Refrigeration.","In the Middle East, revenues declined mid-single digits driven by a decline in HVAC installation while in Latin America, revenues increased low single digits led by the strength in our subscriber business.","Adjusted EBITA of $78 million declined 1% and EBITA margins declined 30 basis points to 8.6% as our productivity savings and cost synergies were more than offset by the volume deleverage. Orders in EMEA\/LA increased a very strong 10%, led by growth in continental Europe and Latin America with backlog up to $1.7 billion.","Moving to APAC, sales of $586 million declined 2% organically due to high single digit declines in installation activity, but this was versus a tough compare of a 12% increase last year. This was partially offset by high single digit growth in service. Adjusted EBITA of $71 million increased 6% with related margins expanding 20 basis points including a 40 basis point headwind related to foreign currency. The underlying margin increased 60 basis points, reflecting cost synergies and productivity save and favorable mix partially offset with costs associated with our ongoing sales force additions.","Asia PAC orders also increased 10%, and I would just comment that it was up 5% excluding one unusually large order we secured in Q2. The 5% was driven by solid increases in service, Industrial Refrigeration and HVAC, and our backlog now is up 15% to $1.5 billion.","So let's turn to slide 12 and go through Global Products. Their organic sales increased 6% to $2 billion with mid-single digit growth in Building Management and HVAC & Refrigeration Equipment and low teens growth in Specialty Products. Let me provide you with a bit more color on each of these businesses. In Building Management, we saw solid growth across the board in controls, fire detection, and security. In HVAC & Refrigeration Equipment, North American residential HVAC grew revenue in the high teens despite a tough compare in the prior year of plus 19%, very strong performance by our North America residential team. Global residential HVAC which includes sales through our consolidated Hitachi JVs with operations in Japan and Taiwan increased mid-single digits in the quarter.","Light commercial HVAC was up low single digits against a tough compare in the prior-year quarter. Our VRF business in Asia saw low single digit organic growth in the quarter but we did see strong double digit growth in our unconsolidated Hitachi joint ventures in China. Industrial Refrigeration also had a very strong quarter with double digit growth while our applied HVAC distribution increased modestly as growth in North America and the Middle East was partially offset by a decline in EMEA\/LA. Low teens growth in Specialty Products was driven primarily by increased demand for fire suppression in North America and APAC. Segment EBITA of $237 million declined 6%, reflecting the impact of the Scott Safety divestiture, with related EBITA margins declining 100 basis points. However, this includes 120 basis point headwind related to Scott Safety. The underlying segment margin expanded 20 basis points to 11.6% as the benefits from cost synergies and productivity and volume leverage was more than offset by 110 basis points related to the planned product and channel investments and the 40 basis points of price\/cost pressure we've talked to you about before.","So let's move to slide 13, Power Solutions. Sales of $1.8 billion declined 2% organically as favorable price and technology mix was more than offset by a decline in unit shipments. Our global battery shipments declined 5% year-over-year with declines in both OE and aftermarket. The overall 2% decline in OE shipments is in line with lower global auto production in the quarter. Aftermarket shipments declined 6%, primarily due to Q2 weather impacts in the U.S. and Europe. We continue to outperform in the China market with units up mid-teens and continued strong growth in both OE and aftermarket.","I would also note that in Q2, we did see global shipments of start-stop batteries increase 14% year-over-year with another strong growth quarter in the Americas and China and a modest increase in EMEA. Segment EBITA of $314 million increased 4% with related margins declining 90 basis points year-over-year to 17%, but again this includes a 60 basis point headwind from FX and lead. Powers underlying margin declined 30 basis points as favorable mix and productivity savings were more than offset by product investments, start-up and launch costs, and increased transportation and logistic costs, all planned for the quarter.","As expected, we continue to see higher freight costs in Q2, while this headwind declined as we moved through the quarter, and we do not expect this headwind to be significant in the back half of the year.","Let's move to slide 14. Corporate expense was down a strong 14% year-over-year to $110 million as we continue to see the benefits of synergy savings and productivity savings. For the full year, we continue to expect corporate expense in the range of $425 million to $440 million.","Turning to slide 15 on free cash flow, we generated free cash flow of approximately $400 million in the quarter. Excluding $200 million of integration restructuring cash, adjusted free cash flow was a solid $600 million, primarily reflective of timing between the quarters in fiscal 2018. Free cash generated in the first half was essentially flat on a reported basis but $300 million on an adjusted basis. We are clearly beginning to see the early benefits of the cash management office and are on track to deliver the 80%-plus adjusted free cash flow conversion for the year.","Moving to the balance sheet on slide 16, our balance sheet position continues to improve with net debt down another $100 million in the quarter to $11.8 billion. Our net debt to EBITDA leverage of 2.5 times is now within our target range and our net debt-to-cap declined slightly to 36.2%.","Finally, during the quarter, we repurchased 1.3 million shares for approximately $50 million, in line with our normal pattern. For the first half, we have now repurchased 4.9 million shares for around $200 million and our outlook for the back half of fiscal 2018 assumes another $100 million of share repurchase as originally planned.","I would just comment in summary here that from my perspective, it was a very solid quarter from an operational standpoint, and we've got clear momentum building in each of our businesses and across all of our key initiatives as we look to the second half of fiscal 2018. So with that, let me turn it back over to George.","George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc","Thanks, Brian. Before we open up the line for questions, I wanted to make a couple of comments on the impact of tariffs and what we are seeing related to price\/cost. Starting with tariffs on slide 17, as you are aware, Section 232 steel and aluminum tariffs were enacted in March of 2018. Our direct buy of steel and aluminum totals approximately $225 million on an annual basis. All steel purchases are sourced in-country and 70% of our aluminum needs are supplied in-country. As such, the direct impact related to steel and aluminum tariffs are nominal and will be fully offset.","We are reviewing the proposed Section 301 tariffs. Given the fluid nature of the proposal, we continue to monitor developments and update our analysis. Included in the proposal are motors in various electronic components which would impact our Buildings businesses. We would not expect much of an impact at all in our Power Solutions business. As part of our ongoing assessment, we are simultaneously identifying mitigating actions to minimize any direct impact. Based on the analysis we have done so far related to our exposure in mitigating actions, we have already worked this down to a very manageable level.","The more relevant impact from the recent tariff discussions has been on raw material inflation and our price\/cost position. As I mentioned earlier, we entered the March quarter planning for a price\/cost headwind of $20 million to $25 million based on the raw material inflation we were projecting at the time. Despite slightly higher material inflation during the quarter, we exited the second quarter with a price\/cost headwind of less than $10 million with the outperformance driven primarily by achieving higher price realization.","We have announced a couple rounds of price increases so far in fiscal 2018 across various product categories and end markets. For example, as many of you are aware, we proactively announced a 5% to 12% increase in North American based unitary and applied HVAC equipment to get in front of some of the recent material inflation. We have made good progress yielding price so far this year, which will continue over the course of the year, and we expect to be in a net positive price\/cost position in the second half.","As we roll forward our outlook on price\/cost for the full year, factoring in continued inflationary headwinds and our expectations for price realization in the back half, we are currently tracking ahead of plan relative to our guidance for a $40 million headwind for the year. Translating that to a margin rate, $40 million would equate to roughly a 50 basis point headwind to Global Products margin and a 20 basis point headwind to the consolidated Buildings margin. Between the pricing actions we have road mapped in our plan and the incremental direct materials productivity, we have an opportunity to close the gap even further.","Turning to slide 18, let me take a minute to highlight a few changes to our underlying assumptions as it relates to our full-year guidance. As I mentioned earlier, our operating performance is on track. First half results played out largely as anticipated, underlying fundamentals continued to improve and we are building momentum across the organization. We have a strong and growing backlog in Buildings, and the quality of the backlog continues to improve. The changes we have made to the sales and service organizations are helping to drive increased order pipelines, and service growth has returned to more normal levels.","We are beginning to see more material returns on our investments in products with growth continuing to accelerate. And although commodity inflation is higher than we anticipated at the start of the fiscal year, we have strong pricing and productivity actions in place and we are in a position to drive positive price\/cost variances in the back half.","In Power, we have secured key new customer wins and order activity which should begin to flow through the back half. With all of this said, we are well positioned for the second half, and I am confident in our ability to deliver on our full-year commitments. We have slightly adjusted our revenue expectations for the year, factoring in additional FX and lead tailwinds, but continue to expect overall organic growth in the low single digit range for the year.","No changes to our underlying assumptions within the consolidated Buildings segment. Given the sustained rise in lead versus our initial plan, we are updating our revenue and associated margin impact for Power. Despite the volume pressures in the first half, we are on track for low single digit organic growth for the year. Given the continued rise in lead prices year-over-year, we have adjusted our lead assumption for Power from $2100 per metric ton to the expected average for the year of $2445 per metric ton. As you know, lead is a pass-through cost. The increase in lead prices will increase our top line, but has minimal impact on our EBIT dollars and therefore no impact to adjusted earnings per share. However, this does put 70 basis points of incremental pressure on Power Solutions margin rate.","Additionally, some of the headwinds we saw in Power in the first half related to transportation is an incremental 40 basis points. As Brian mentioned, we do not expect transportation costs in Power Solutions to have a significant impact on our second half performance. As I mentioned earlier, we expect Power Solutions top line to grow 5-plus percent organically in the second half which will lever very nicely. On a reported basis, we expect Power Solutions margin to be down 100 to 120 basis points year-over-year, again primarily related to the flow-through of increased lead prices. We are reaffirming our full-year adjusted earnings per share guidance range of $2.75 to $2.85 which represents a 6% to 10% increase year-over-year.","With that, operator, please open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And our first question is from Julian Mitchell from Barclays. Your line is open.","Julian Mitchell - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Good morning.","Antonella Franzen - Johnson Controls International Plc","Good morning, Julian.","Julian Mitchell - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Good morning. Maybe just a question firstly on the slide 24 with the first half\/second half bridge items. So I just wanted to double-check that we're thinking about it roughly the right way. The gross margin and investment pressures in the first half were collectively about $0.13, I think, year-on-year. So do we assume that those shrink sort of drastically in the second half as a year-on-year headwind and then you get an extra sort of $0.04 or $0.05 each from currency and extra synergies? Is that the right way to get to that $0.13 tailwind?","George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc","Yeah, so, Julian, I'll take that. When you look at our performance, we typically are 40%\/60% split first half and second half. This year, we are a little bit more skewed to the second half, about 38% on the first half, 62% on the second half.","And so as you look at \u2013 and as we planned the year, we knew we had a lot of headwinds in the first half, and those headwinds were the backlog conversion on gross margins coming through mainly in the first half and a little bit in the second half. We had the price\/cost pressure of about $40 million, most of which was in the first half, we're going to turn positive in the second half. The sales force investments were weighted to the first half as we added significant capacity within our sales channels. And the product investments also were weighted to the first half. And then when you take into account the transportation headwind that we had in Power, and then net all of that with the productivity and synergies, when you look at that, we had headwind of about $0.02 in the first half.","As you play out the year as we begin to accelerate our \u2013 we begin to convert backlog, we continue with strong product growth, we accelerate service and we start to pick up significant volume in our Power business, when you look at the overall benefit in the second half, it's about $0.13. And so the net impact of first half to second half is a delta of about $0.15.","Julian Mitchell - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Understood. Thank you. And then just within the free cash flow, as my follow-up, was there any particular color between the two segments in terms of that better free cash flow performance in Q2 or were the improvements in cash pretty even across Buildings as well as Power?","Brian J. Stief - Johnson Controls International Plc","Think it was generally spread pretty evenly across the businesses. We did see a slight increase in inventory in Power Solutions as a result of some of the lower volumes we talked about. But they did a really nice job on the receivable front in Power Solutions and as well as the Buildings performance in receivables was strong as well.","The reason that we've commented that this is really timing between the quarters is there is a little bit of pull-forward, I would say, on the collection of receivables, and we pulled forward a bit of our harmonization of our vendor payment terms in the Buildings business as well.","And I would also say that when you look at the CapEx delta between first half, second half, there might be $50 million to $100 million worth of timing there as well. But we're still going to spend the $1.3 billion for the year.","Julian Mitchell - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question is from Steven Winoker from UBS. Your line is open.","Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks. Good morning, all.","George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc","Good morning, Steve.","Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC","Hey. So I just wanted to spend some more time on the cash question. Again, obviously, there's a lot of investor skepticism or has been around the ability of JCI to drive sustained cash flow conversion improvement. And while it's early days and you just addressed across segments, George, maybe talk about the cultural shift. And I'm not sure I \u2013 I understand the CapEx dynamic that you talked about, but I don't see why you wouldn't be able, even if there was a little bit of timing here, why you wouldn't be able to sort of sustain into 2019 some of the actions that are going on now given kind of the major improvements in the organization on this front.","George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc","Yeah, so I would start, Steve, that this, as I said in my prepared remarks, this is one of the top priorities for the company, and this topic comes up in every meeting that we have and is front-and-center as far as a deliverable for all of our teams across the businesses.","And so what I would say is we're making \u2013 and we've put the accountability of the cash, we've reinforced that with all of our incentives across the business. So we definitely are going through a cultural change. This is front-and-center. And no matter what element of cash, I can tell you that wherever I go across the globe, whether it be sales leaders making sure that they're enabling and helping to collect on the receivables, whether we're looking at entitlements of inventory and pushing out production and balancing production more with our sales demand, whether it's our sourcing teams that are matching our payables in line with our contract terms, we've made significant progress.","And so I would tell you that every step of the way, we've got full engagement. We've got the accountabilities in place. We've got the incentives reinforcing that. And I would tell you we are making really good progress.","Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. George, that's helpful.","Brian J. Stief - Johnson Controls International Plc","And, Steve, on CapEx, if you look at the first six months of the year, our CapEx was about $500 million, and our guide for the year is $1.3 billion. And so I would just tell you that there's still going to be spend closer to the $1.3 billion level for the full year, but there probably has been a bit of a delay on a few projects that have moved from what were planned to be in the first half of the year to the back half of the year. But the guide is still $1.3 billion.","Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And then you mentioned last quarter, I think you had about 30 basis points in backlog margin expansion due to some of the initiatives. Where are you now?","George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc","Yeah, we're making good progress, Steve. As I said last quarter, we had booked margins about 70 basis points better. This was a big focus in North America. That's where the pressure was coming into the year. We had roughly $40 million of pressure, which was about 75 basis points on a backlog in North America that was about $5.2 billion. And so with that performance in the first quarter, we had increased the margin and backlog about 30 basis points.","This quarter in Q2, we were able to book margins about 100-plus basis points, and that brought up the margin in backlog about 40 basis points. And so that gives us a lot of confidence that, as we now project the turn of these orders in the margin, we're going to start to see a pickup in the margin rate on a go-forward basis.","Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. All right. That's helpful. I'll go back in queue. Thanks.","Antonella Franzen - Johnson Controls International Plc","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question is from Steve Tusa from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, guys. Good morning. How are you?","George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc","Hi, Steve. Good.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","I think you mentioned the applied business on revenue was kind of low-single digits, I guess, in North America in the quarter. What were the orders for your applied business in North America? Just roughly year-over-year?","George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc","Yeah, so orders, when you look at our \u2013 we track our products, our applied products as well as the revenues that are achieved in our channels across the globe. And orders were up about 5%, mid-single digits roughly across the base. We are seeing, if you look at the overall applied HVAC equipment revenue globally, we're actually up about 2%, and that includes all of our revenues achieved with the applied technology and conversion of that into projects.","And what's very encouraging, as you all know that we've launched our new chiller, and when you look at the chiller orders coming through in the second quarter, we're seeing very strong demand. And so that's across all of the \u2013 most of the regions. We're seeing very strong demand and I'm projecting that that's going to continue with the success that we've seen to date.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And as far as pricing in commercial, I mean, obviously, all you guys are doing a good job of banking on offsetting this raw material headwind in the second half. I would assume that means commercial pricing is holding up reasonably well?","George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc","Absolutely. Absolutely. You saw the price increases we've taken. I can tell you we have a regular rhythm of not only with the increases that have been made, making sure that we're getting the full yield on those increases. And what I would tell you is that we're progressing very well. And that gives me confidence that we're going, from a price\/cost standpoint as we get through the second half, we're going to have positive price\/cost in the second half.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. One last one. Seasonality on the rest of the year, should we assume that 3Q and 4Q are normal seasonally from an EPS perspective? Or is there anything that's slipping in and out of either quarter to make that performance unusual?","George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc","No. Except for some of the headwinds and tailwinds that we discussed earlier in the call, what I would say is that we have normal seasonality with volumes coming through. We are seeing good progress, as I said, with products. I'm very encouraged by the new product launches and the technology we're bringing into the market. The 6% was strong.","And a note on products, we actually had a 9% increase in Fire & Security products within the quarter. And so the investments that are being made are paying out. The service we brought within the field businesses, the importance of service and the ability to be able to create more value for our customers, at the same time being able to really drive mix. And that 3% service growth we're looking to continue to expand that as we go through the second half. And then we begin to see the turn on our installation base, and so that's where we've been a little bit behind where I'd like to be to date.","But with the backlog that's been built, we're up 6% and the margins in backlog are better. That's going to start to come through. And then in Power, we'll see the normal pick up here on the volumes in the third and fourth quarter and a lot of that is in anticipation for the next season here with replacement batteries and the like. And so I am encouraged that when you look at the year-on-year, we're going to continue to see momentum, and we'll be well positioned to deliver on the commitments.","Antonella Franzen - Johnson Controls International Plc","Steve, just the one thing I would add in terms of as you're modeling out Q3 and Q4, keep in mind that Q3 is the seasonal high for Hitachi so we typically have a higher non-controlling interest number in the third quarter.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks a lot, guys.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Jeffrey Sprague of Vertical Research. Your line is open.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Thank you. Good day, everyone.","George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc","Hi, Jeff.","Antonella Franzen - Johnson Controls International Plc","Hi, Jeff.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Hey George, just back to the idea of backlog margins. What has the experience been recently on execution of backlog, right? These are booked margins, but you've got a lot of new people and new organizations executing on projects. Has the actual experience versus booked expectation been playing pretty much as you've expected?","George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc","Absolutely, Jeff. What I would say is that we always \u2013 when we book, we always do better than what we book through execution. We've been very much focused, especially with some of the headwinds in what we're doing from a productivity standpoint, to be able to continue to bring down the cost of the conversion of the project.","And so I'm encouraged. This is something we're going pretty deep into to make sure that as we're projecting the cost of these projects with the inflationary pressure that we have seen, that we've got that grounded and then we're taking other actions whether it be through sourcing or other execution that we can not only meet the margins but continue to execute better through execution.","So I'm encouraged that that trend is continuing. Like I said, we went into the year, we had some pressure, but as we're now remixing the backlog and beginning to convert, we're now starting to see the pickup in the margin rate.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","I was also wondering, the last couple years we've seen kind of an elongated disconnect between orders and actual sales conversion. Do you see that normalizing in the next several quarters? Or is there something in the nature of the business, bigger projects? Or how should we think about order growth or backlog growth converting to sales growth the next few quarters, let's say?","George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc","Yeah, so what I would tell you is that as we looked at the backlog, there were \u2013 last year there were some larger orders that were longer cycle projects that ultimately has created the pressure as we get into 2018. What I would tell you is that through the sales excellence that we have driven across the businesses, we're now segmenting our sales team with the proper incentives. So we're getting the full mix of the overall projects. And so you have transactional projects, you've got long term, you've got upgrades, you've got longer-term developments.","And what I would tell you is that through that process with the sales excellence that we've been driving, we're getting much better line of sight to the mix of projects that we're putting into backlog. And so, therefore, you can then project on a go-forward basis how that backlog is going to convert. So I would tell you that on a go-forward basis, those two lines over a cycle will start to converge.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","And then just finally from me, you said the strategic review you're making progress. Obviously it hasn't come to conclusion or you'd have an announcement, but how do you define progress? Does that mean you're seeing avenues to do something more tax efficient? Or you're seeing more combination options than you originally conceived? What if anything does that really indicate?","George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc","Yeah, I would start, Jeff, by saying we are working closely with advisors, with our board. When we launch this, we're going to look at all opportunities and ultimately how do we position the business not only long-term but also to create the most amount of shareholder value. When we announced this, we said we would provide an update when the process was finalized. We're right in the middle of the process, working through it, and so there's not much more I can add at this point. But, certainly, as we reach a decision and complete the analysis, we'd be positioned to be able to update and communicate to all of you.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Great. Thanks a lot.","George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc","Thanks, Jeff.","Antonella Franzen - Johnson Controls International Plc","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question is from Gautam Khanna of Cowen and Company. Your line is open.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC","Yes. Thanks. Good morning, guys.","Antonella Franzen - Johnson Controls International Plc","Good morning.","George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc","Good morning.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hey. I was curious if you could expand upon the field order growth that you saw, the plus 7%, and just thinking about how much was the lift due to better pricing, if you will. Because when I look at the next couple quarters, you have fairly easy comparisons in terms of field order growth. I'm just wondering like what the pricing actions will net us just before even considering volume?","George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc","Yeah, so when you look at what we're going to be yielding here in the second half, we have been ramping up pricing not only in how we're pricing projects, but also when we talk price\/cost. It's mainly focusing on our product businesses. What I would say is in the second half, we're going to be continuing to get a lift here in margins. So on the sales orders secured, we're probably picking up 1% to 2% as far as real pricing within that backlog. And then, as we're converting, we're executing better on that and achieving better margins. And so there could be \u2013 on the overall pricing side, could be 1% or 2% impact to the overall booked orders.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC","Got it. Okay. That's helpful. Brian, I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more granularity on what we should anticipate for free cash flow in Q3 versus Q4. And then, if you can update us on the recovery timing of the tax payment related to Adient this year and next. I remember some of it moved into next year, but if you could quantify it?","Brian J. Stief - Johnson Controls International Plc","So the Adient tax payment, we received $200 million, as you know, Gautam, in the first quarter of this fiscal year. We expect the remaining portion, around $700 million, to be received either in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 or the first quarter of fiscal 2020. There really isn't an update on the timing yet. It really depends on how it goes through committee and what that process will entail.","Given the size of the refund, it's one that could move from one quarter to the other, but we're confident that we're going to get that money by the end of calendar 2019. As it relates to cash flow, first half, second half, we had $300 million outflow Q1, $600 million cash inflow Q2. I would expect Q3 cash flow to be within the range of Q2 cash flow. And then, we would finish it out in Q4, which is always our strongest cash quarter to get to the 80%-plus free cash flow conversion.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you very much. Good luck, guys.","Antonella Franzen - Johnson Controls International Plc","Thanks.","George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question is from Andrew Kaplowitz of Citigroup. Your line is open.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Good morning, guys.","Antonella Franzen - Johnson Controls International Plc","Good morning.","George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc","Hey. Good morning.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","George, if we think about the Building business over the last couple years, it's obviously had some noise, whether it be the salesforce integration or the lower margin project backlog. But it does seem like in the last couple of quarters, the noise level in the business has started to die down. So can you talk about your confidence level that JCI really is out of the woods in terms of bigger noise in Buildings quarters, and now you have good visibility into what's really going on in the overall business?","George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc","Yeah, as I've discussed here in my prepared remarks, as well as through the Q&A, we have made significant progress in getting to fundamentals of the businesses that are totally visible across the organization and ultimately is what we're focused on in driving improvement. And that starts right from the sales process and making sure that we're now all on one common system, tracking pipeline development, conversion of pipeline to orders, understanding the segmentation of those orders, large projects, small projects, service, service contracts, transactional service. And so we now have line-of-sight to how we're now taking our strategic initiatives. We're bringing those to market, and we're ultimately now converting those from a sales standpoint.","From an operations standpoint, as far as margin structure, we know exactly what's coming through our margin structure. And as a result, we've been very proactive in taking pricing actions to be able to offset the inflationary pressures we've had. And normally, we get very strong productivity which, in addition to that, contributes to increased margins year-on-year.","And then the last is the conversion of cash, as Brian talked about, getting the fundamentals across the businesses, line-of-sight with the accountability throughout every functional organization and then across each of the businesses so that we know exactly how we ultimately deliver on the cash. And so what I would tell you is that the visibility, the accountability, the incentives that are in place all position us to be able to deliver on those fundamentals and deliver on the commitments we've made.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thanks for that, George. And can you quantify how much of the new \u2013 you mentioned original equipment and aftermarket ones in Power Solutions that will help you inflect to grow 5% in the second half of the year. As you guys know, it's been a more difficult business to forecast lately. So what's the visibility there? How much do these new wins help you in the second half of the year? And how exposed is the business going to be to weather, as it always is?","George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc","Yeah, so we're certainly we're positioned well across the globe with very strong positions. We have a pretty good line-of-sight to what our customers are doing, not only in the OE base, but also as we serve the aftermarket. And so we work very closely in understanding what they're projecting on point of sale and what do we need to do to make sure that they've got the inventory to be able to achieve their sales plans.","And then as we go through that planning, we then make sure as we're executing, we balance that with the ability to pivot if we need to, depending on how volumes come through. And so what I would tell you is through the early phase here, we've done that with all of our customers, both OE as well as aftermarket, and all of that suggests that, given what I would tell you, is that with the softer demand that we saw in this last cycle, some of that converts to higher demand depending on how the weather plays out in the next cycle. And so making sure that we are positioned to capitalize on that opportunity and then working closely with each of our customers to make sure that they have the right supply, the right service to ultimately fulfill the sales for them.","Antonella Franzen - Johnson Controls International Plc","And, Andy, it's Antonella. The only thing that I would add is keep in mind that OE production decline started last year in Q3. So as we get into our second half of this fiscal year, that starts to stabilize as well.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Got it. And it's fair to say this is an unusually high amount of wins that you got in the quarter? That's kind of why you called it out?","George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc","That's correct. Absolutely.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thanks, guys.","Antonella Franzen - Johnson Controls International Plc","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question is from Deane Dray from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Antonella Franzen - Johnson Controls International Plc","Good morning.","George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc","Good morning, Deane.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey. Could we just stay on the Power Solutions topic? And George, could you just put a finer point on some of the nuances when we talk about weather? How precise can you get? Is this on a degree-day basis versus normal weather patterns? Just what is that visibility and how does that translate?","George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc","Yeah, so there's some correlation there, and what we've been working to do is try to make it a little bit tighter. But what I would tell you is the way the battery fails is you have a severe heat, and then you have severe cold. And a normal cycle in a winter, you typically have two or three cycles of severe cold. And therefore, that's what makes batteries fail. This year, when you look at what happened in the two big bases that we have within Europe and North America, we didn't have those cycles. And so therefore it did impact our volumes in those two key markets.","And so what I would tell you, Deane, that we always hope to have a nice hot spell in the summer and then two or three cold spells in the winter, and that typically is what correlates to the failure of batteries and ultimately our demand.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Got it. Well, it looks like New York is about to get its first hot spell this week. So that may bode well. And then just a follow-up. On the point regarding the better margins in backlog, I'm curious to hear what internally are you doing in terms of like the traffic cop on what types of projects will you pass on? Is it an iterative process on pricing, or it's just, hey, this business does not have enough follow-through in a potential aftermarket? But just the kind of decision-making on what projects you'll reject.","George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc","Yeah, Deane, what I would say is our goal is not to reject projects, our goal is to make sure that we're positioned with the right solution that leverages our technology and capabilities so that we can create the value that the customer is expecting, and then we ultimately get paid for that value.","So there's different levels of solutions that we bring into the market leveraging our technology. And so what I would tell you is that there's a lot more discipline upfront now relative to how we serve the customer and ultimately develop the projects that ultimately will fulfill their need. And so with that, there's incentives from a sales incentive standpoint that's incentivizing our sales teams to get that margin upfront, right, and that ties to making sure that we've got the right solution, the right product and that ultimately we book it at that rate.","And so it isn't necessarily walking away from volume, it's making sure that we've got the right proposal, that we're pricing that proposal and then ultimately converting that to higher secured margins.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","That's helpful. Thank you.","Antonella Franzen - Johnson Controls International Plc","All right. Operator, as we're at the top of the hour, I'm going to pass it over to George for some closing comments.","George R.

Roell","Okay. Well, thank you, Glen, and good morning. Let me begin by saying that we\u2019re very pleased with the results of our fiscal third quarter. The strong earnings and cash flow are consistent; in fact, they are actually higher than the guidance we provided to you in last quarter\u2019s call. We achieved those results despite the fact that business conditions remain challenging across our industries.","There was some more exception to that as the North American automotive industry, which as you\u2019re well aware of, remains strong as evidenced by the high retail activity in the month of June. In the quarter, automotive production on the continent was up 6% from a year ago. Dealer inventories are in fairly good shape and that bodes well for this quarter\u2019s production. We\u2019re currently anticipating the North American production will approximate 4 million units in the quarter ending in September, which would equate to about a 4% increase over last year\u2019s comparable period. Despite everything you read about a slowdown, in China automotive sales and production remained strong. In the quarter just entered, production will be up 10% and we expect that in the upcoming quarter that we can see an increase in production of roughly 7% year-over-year.","In Europe, production levels were slightly lower and recent industry forecasts are projecting that future periods will begin to show growth. We are still expecting that in the quarter that we are entering \u2013 that we are in right now that production will be slightly lower than it was in the comparable period a year ago.","Turning to Building Efficiency, non-residential construction demand is softer than we expected. However, we are seeing improvements in a number of markets, most notably the Solutions business, where we are, our pipeline of bidding activity has increased. We continue to see strong quoting activity and continued strength in the federal and state government markets, and Asia continues to be a point of strength for us.","We expect our backlog at September end to be just slightly below the level of the prior year as based on some of the large jobs that we anticipate being awarded in the quarter. Battery demand in the aftermarket North American and Europe was weaker than expected again. A point-of-sale tracking that we have with several retailers reflects continued soft demand. However, our shipments to OEs were up 14% North America and Europe, and that helps to offset some of the weakness in the aftermarket that I just referred to.","So there are some positive signs, but as I mentioned in our last call, our results in the second half of this year were not dependent upon near term recoveries of our markets. In April, we indicated that we were at a point of inflection, I think that was Bruce\u2019s term, and our third quarter was just that.","Let\u2019s just look at the numbers now and flip to the next slide. Sales of $10.8 billion were up 2% with Power Solutions providing that growth. Segment income of $764 million was 20% higher, with all three business units contributing double-digit increases. Net income of $535 million was up 18% and diluted earnings per share of $0.78 compared to $0.66 per share, and as of course, taking out the one-time items.","Just a couple of other general comments, with the lower top line growth we were dependent upon margin expansion, and we were pleased with 110 basis point increase in our segment income. We were particularly impressed by the improvement that we saw in both Building Efficiency and our Automotive in terms of basis point increase in their margins.","Our European Automotive business is doing profitable, that was a highlight again for the quarter. Building Efficiency orders were higher than last year reversing last quarter\u2019s trend. Power Solutions has been awarded the new business and we\u2019re in discussion with many other potential customers. We\u2019ll probably provide you with a full recap of all of our new businesses in our fourth fiscal quarter results.","Bruce is going to cover two things with you specifically, one with the strong cash flow in period and also the definitive agreement that we reached to the best of our HomeLink product line that was announced in our press release today.","In terms of future earnings per share guidance, we increased our EPS outlook for our fourth fiscal quarter to the range of $0.93 to $0.95 per share, it\u2019s a 20% increase over last year roughly. We expect all three businesses to contribute significantly in the quarter.","Last January, I talked about the factors that would help drive our second half results. And if you recall over five key elements, I just like to review those with you. The first was the fact that we would benefit from restructuring actions that we took in late fiscal 2012, and clearly that's been a factor in our improved results and our momentum in the second half. We did take some additional restructuring actions this quarter in our announcement, this beneficial primarily fall in the fiscal 2014.","Last year if you recall, we encountered high core costs in our Power Solutions business and while those costs remain high, we were able to initiate pricing actions to offset those costs.","In addition, we managed our inventory of course, more effectively this year, while still ramping up for our Florence, South Carolina smelter. The other factor was our margin expansion in BE associated with their pricing initiatives and cost containment. we saw 120 basis point improvement in Q3 in that business unit.","We\u2019re also accounting on improvements in our metals in South American operations and Automotive Seating and those clearly met our expectation. And the one item that we did rely on in terms of exterior, their outside performance was the North American production increased in North America. And I\u2019d mentioned that earlier that we had a strong quarter in North America and continues to be so in our fourth fiscal quarter.","So with that now I would like to turn over the call to Alex who will comment on Power Solutions and Building Efficiency. Alex?","Alex A. Molinaroli","Good morning, everyone. First, I\u2019ll start with Power Solutions as on Slide 7. As you can see, sales were up to $1.4 billion, this 8%, and if you adjust for FX and for lead, our sales were up 11%. Our OE volumes were the driver of that, at 16% growth and aftermarket volumes were down at 4%. We didn\u2019t lose any share, but what happened is, we still haven\u2019t seen the kinds of volumes that we\u2019re expecting due to weather. good news we\u2019re seeing some weather now. So we\u2019ll hopefully be able to update that at end of the fourth quarter.","For the overall shipments, which you\u2019ll see is that, we had overall shipments up 2%, Americas is flat. That has to do with the mix of our business; Asia is up 1% and Europe up 7%. It shows that where our mix for ROE business is. our results were favorably impacted by some very strong operational performance and a lot of that driven by the ramp up and now full operation of our smelters.","So our in-house lead recycling is now at the levels that we expected. Our segment income was up to $171 million, that\u2019s 12% up from last year this time, and one other things that I think the team has done a good job is even though lead price \u2013 cost for scrap has moderated some, it\u2019s still at very high levels and they have been able to go out and get commercial arrangement with our OE customers to offset some of the lead cost.","The last thing I\u2019d like to talk about is that there is a 3% to 4% price increase effective this quarter, this coming quarter, and fourth quarter, and we should expect to start seeing the benefits to that immediately.","If you move to Building Efficiency in the next slide, you can see that Building Efficiency continues to struggle in the top line and we talked about their backlog, but we\u2019re very proud of what they have accomplished on their bottom line and they continue to not only get cost efficiencies, but also to be successful and allow their pricing initiatives.","So for the quarter they are down 3.7%, and the revenue growth if you want to look at it by region is up in Asia 3%, but it was offset by a softness in the more mature markets.","Overall, our quarter, we have a backlog of $5.1 billion and that\u2019s down 5% from a year ago. And if you want to look at it that by region, where we are seeing the softness is in Europe, Asia, North America, and both in service and system. So the mature markets and it\u2019s pretty broad across the board where our backlog is lying.","As you know, we don\u2019t keep backlog information on our UPG business residential, so that would be a little bit different and not included these numbers. For the first time and this is really good news that we started to see orders pick up. So I don\u2019t know that we can consider a trend yet, but we\u2019re hopeful we had very, very strong orders in the month of June. I believe the June, were up 12% year-over-year, and over the quarters up 2%, and that's the first time we've seen that in quite sometime.","Let me give you some statistics of where that came from. 4% in Europe, which is a real surprise, 27% in Latin America, lot of that driven by a lot of the infrastructure that\u2019s been built in Latin America for the Olympics and the World Cup; up 1% in Asia, 1% in North America, and we saw some softness in Middle East, down 18%. But if you recall that part of the world is driven by very, very large projects. And so, if you look at it on a year-on-year basis it sometimes very difficult, but we're very happy with the fact that our orders are trending up, and not only that I would tell you that we're starting to see our pipelines become stronger and stronger, particularly where we've had the most softness in our Solutions business. So we are very hopeful.","Our segment income up to $314 million, 14% higher than 2012, and I think we are all very proud to see the sustained margin increase within building efficiencies. It's been a strong story and it continues. Steve talked earlier about the market conditions improving. I think that specifically around the federal government and the state and local governments, we\u2019re still seeing some softness in some of the institutional markets otherwise, but things have hopefully hit their bottom and we\u2019ll look to see if we start to see improvements at the end of the year.","So I'm hopefully if we're going to use terms that Bruce used last time for this business at least on the top line maybe we're going to be at a bit of an inflection point ourselves. But we're not counting on that, because they continue to work on operational improvements.","If you go to the next slide that speaks to that, I want to talk about a couple of things that are going on within the Building Efficiency business. A lot of these margin increases have had to do with pricing opportunities and some overall SG&A management. One of the things that we want to talk about is that, there are some structural changes that we\u2019re also doing within the Building Efficiency business that will allow them to become more effective.","You may or may not know, but within our North American business, we have multiple businesses that serve the market. We have a Security business. We have a Systems business, which serves the construction market. We have our Solutions business, which is performance contracting, and we have our Service business.","We are going through an initiative now in order to combine those operations from a management perspective, from a customer perspective, so that we can be more effective serving our customers while keeping the operational excellence that we have within each one of those businesses.","This will streamline our sales efforts. This will lower our cost to serve, and I think our customers have given us feedback that they\u2019re looking forward to this opportunity. This is a major change initiative, it\u2019s a big part of our business, and we have high expectations. This will drive margins, cost reductions, productivity in the near-term and growth in the long-term.","Another change that we\u2019re making and it relates directly to the fact that we\u2019re going to continue to invest in Building Efficiency is that, we separated our Global WorkPlace Solutions business, which will be a standalone business and report directly to me. We\u2019ll continue to have the synergies and pull through, as we have had in the past. But what we see is that we don\u2019t need the Building Efficiency business with all it\u2019s on their plate and the great things that they have going and the great opportunities we have in front of us focused on this business.","We\u2019re going to allow the World Services business, for those who have been following for a long time was a separate business at one point. They\u2019re focused on the things that it needs to do in order to become more successful. And we have success and that business will be driving margin improvement.","So we\u2019ll talk more in the future about that. We\u2019re very bullish on the opportunity we have to get the margins up to a level of internal, if you talk from the EBIT perspective of around 5%. So I\u2019m excited about both opportunities in the team at Building Efficiency and both GWS is pretty excited, so more to come on that.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Bruce.","R. Bruce McDonald","Okay, thanks, Alex, and good morning, everyone. So I\u2019ll start here on Slide number 10 for Automotive Experience. So you can see here a good quarter for Automotive, and from a top line perspective, we are up 4 %. If you back out exchange, we\u2019re actually up about 5%. If you look at the individual segments, Seating sales were up 6% excluding foreign exchange, interior sales were flat and electronics sales were up 2%. Again, all those numbers exclude foreign exchange.","Geographically, and we always like to look at our geographic numbers in the context to the production environment, and pleased to say that all regions we outperformed the markets. If you look at North America, talk about our sales being up 11%, and that compares to the market being up 6%.","In Europe, we are up 4%, in the downmarket where it\u2019s down 1% as Steve talked about earlier. And in China, we continue to see very strong momentum, but there, we continue to gain share primarily from some of the Chinese brands, and the sort of market shift towards the quality and our customers putting more dollars in Interiors for sales for us in the quarter. We are up 23% to $1.4 billion, again, that includes our non-consolidated businesses, and that compares very favorably to 23% to the 10% increase in auto production in the quarter from China. So good results geographically.","If you look at our bottom line, we have great results here. we\u2019ll start to see the benefit of our restructuring and cost actions here. so you can see our profitability was up 34%, $279 million. We benefited from the higher revenues in North America, operational improvements in all sort of our theaters of operations, but most notably in metals, our European business and in our Interiors business in Europe specifically.","In Europe, as Steve reported earlier, we made a profitable $11 million in the quarter, which was significantly better than the $30 million to $35 million loss that we had guided to during our Q2 call. If you really think through this what drove that improvement, when we gave our guidance, we talked about Europe production being down 3%, and the numbers came in at only down 1%. So we definitely got a lift in terms of the market environment. But the most of the improvement was just the pace of generating the improvements in our businesses in Europe, and again, Metals, our Seating business and our Interiors business all equally contributed to the favorable performance here.","In the quarter, we also know engineering costs were about $20 million higher year-over-year, when I talked through our SG&A levels later on, that\u2019s really the driver for the higher SG&A on a quarter-over-quarter basis. Margins in Automotive came in at real nice 4.9%, 100 basis point improvement versus last year, again, geographically if you look at the results in North America, 7.1% in Asia where it\u2019s 15.3%.","And as we \u2013 just one clarification here, we did note in our press release and we have it here on the slide. We didn\u2019t have a gain on the sale of some assets in automotive that was about $29 million, you can see that in our cash flow statement. That was something that we had expected more than our guidance. Well, I can tell you that most of that benefit was offset by litigation charges and other costs related to the downsizing of our business in South America.","Slipping to Slide 11 and maybe just a few comments on the divestiture that we announced this morning, so earlier today, we announced we\u2019ve signed a definitive agreement to sell the HomeLink product line to Gentex Corporation for $700 million in cash.","As many of you know, Gentex is the largest customer of this product line and very early in the divestiture process here. Gentex approached us with an offer to buy the business, the HomeLink product line. And this is a fairly easy business for us to separate, very straightforward in conjunction with discussions what we had with our financial advisors, we decided to pursue basically a two-step divestiture process of goal, with the divestiture of this product line to Gentex and markets remaining business to other strategic buyers.","We believe that following that strategy, we generate more value for our shareholders. The Gentex transaction is subject to the normal regulatory approvals. We don\u2019t expect there to be any difficulties and our expectation is the transaction should close on\/or about September 30, which is our fiscal year-end.","Regarding the remaining Electronics business, I guess, I would just say that the process, we\u2019re at where we thought we\u2019d be. We are in discussions with several strategic purchasers. and right now, we\u2019re targeting to have an announcement in terms of the sale of that business on\/or before our fourth quarter earnings call. So things are going as we expected, and we\u2019re pleased to have brought the HomeLink sale to conclusion with Gentex this morning.","Turning to the financials and maybe, just before I get into the details, you\u2019ll note that in our press release, we did have two non-operational items, which resulted in a net benefit of $0.05 in the quarter. And those were from additional restructuring charges primarily around our Automative Experience business and Building Efficiency business. Those charges, I would say are primarily around our downsizing our footprint in Europe, and with regard to Building Efficiency, it\u2019s implementing some of the organizational changes that Alex referred to in his slides.","So if we just look at the numbers here in the quarter, you can see our revenues were up 2% at $10.8 billion, again, if you would back out exchange that\u2019s actually been up about 3%. We\u2019re pleased to see strong gross profit improvement and we\u2019re up 90 basis points to 15.5%. The drivers in terms of our margin improvement were Interiors, Metals and Building Efficiency improvements that Alex referred to in his comments.","It terms of SG&A as a percentage of sales flat at about 9.1%. The benefits that we saw from our restructuring actions were largely offset by increased investments in some of our emerging market infrastructure and the higher engineering spend that I referred to in Automotive. Equity income picked up a little bit about $5 million higher than a year ago, and you can see our segment margins up 110 basis points to 7.1% in the quarter.","Slipping to Slide 13, you see financing charges were up about $8 million versus last year, that\u2019s really just higher average levels of debt. As we get into the fourth quarter, we\u2019re again going to start to see as our financing costs go down as we start to see the benefit of the strong free cash flow generation that\u2019s coming through here.","If you look at the tax rate in the quarter at 20% is consistent with our guidance and you\u2019ll see that\u2019s up from the 17% that we\u2019ve had last year. So even though, our earnings per share were up 18%, you see we did have a little bit of a headwind here in terms of the tax line.","Slipping over to Slide 14, I\u2019ll just make a few comments in terms of our cash flow and balance sheet. So we saw a very strong cash performance. We talked about this in our last call. $1 billion was our operating cash flow in the third quarter. that enabled us to reduce our net debt by about $556 million in the quarter and lower our debt to total capitalization to 31.7%, and that\u2019s about a 270 basis point improvement in the quarter.","In terms of working capital, again, we saw some good performance here. trade working capital, which we define as payables, receivables and inventory, came down to 6.5% of sales, which is about a 20 basis point year-to-date improvement. In terms of working capital, we are pleased to see we were actually, had a source, the number on the slide is actually incorrect, that\u2019s the one \u2013 it was actually $272 million. That\u2019s the one number I put together in the slide, but I made a mistake there. But $272 million is a good source of cash from working capital in the quarter and we expect to see some more cash from working capital come through here in the fourth quarter.","In terms of CapEx, $265 million, as you can see that\u2019s coming down. Our full year outlook, we\u2019re maintaining at about $1.2 billion. That\u2019s where we see the full year CapEx coming in line here. In terms of the fourth quarter, our expectation is we\u2019re going to see net debt reduction, again excluding the divestiture proceed of about $600 million to $650 million. So what we\u2019re really saying here is that, on our Q2 call, we talked about net \u2013 our debt coming down about $1 billion in the second half, right now, we see that coming down at about $1.15 billion to $1.2 billion over the back-end of the year about $150 million to $200 million better than we told you at our Q2 call.","We do have some debt maturities that are coming up, as we\u2019ve noted here on the slide. so we\u2019re going to fund $300 million of debt maturities with cash from operations here in the fourth quarter. And as we get into calendar 2014, we have $800 million of debt that comes due on our second fiscal quarter. Our thinking right now is, we will apply the proceeds that we get from the Electronics divestment to fund out those maturities.","And then lastly, just a few concluding comments before we open it up to M&A. So again, Q3 really was an inflection point for us and with our earnings here been up 18% on a year-over-year basis. I know that over the last quarter, either Alex, Glen, Dave or myself, I think we met with many of our analysts and a lot of our investors. We know that we\u2019ve not moved up to our shareholders\u2019 expectations here, and we believe that our third quarter results are an important step \u2013 another important step I guess I should say and rebuilding the confidence that that we\u2019ve had that investment communities had with the management team.","So as we look into the fourth quarter, we\u2019re very confident and the guidance that we\u2019re providing this morning. We\u2019re tightening the range in terms of our full year to be $2.64 to $2.66. Our confidence is really driven by the same things that we were talked about in Q3, same factors, many of which are completely under our control. We continue to see good, and as we continue to expect good sequential improvement in our Auto business in Europe and South America.","in Building Efficiency, if you look at our pipeline and support further improvement in Q4 orders, and for the fourth quarter, we do expect Building Efficiency to show top line growth. so we\u2019ve had several quarters of down revenue in Building Efficiency. We expect that to reverse itself here in the fourth quarter, and we expect that strong momentum that we\u2019ve had in terms of the margins to continue.","From our restructuring perspective, our initiatives are on track and gaining momentum, and they\u2019ll deliver additional benefits here in the fourth quarter. In terms of our EPS outlook for Q4, we\u2019re introducing guidance here a little bit ahead of expectations, $0.93 to $0.95, excluding any items that represents about a 21% to 23% year-over-year improvement.","And just one point of clarification, in the fourth quarter, we may elect to treat our Auto Electronics business as a discontinued operation. And so the guidance that we\u2019re providing here the $0.93 to $0.95 is inclusive of the operating results of Electronics. So if we decide to reclassify Auto Electronics as a discontinued operation, the guidance is really going to be our income from both continuing and discontinuing businesses. So I just want to make that clear to everybody. so we\u2019re not dancing that around on our fourth quarter call.","So with that, I\u2019m going to turn it back over to Glen. and I think, we\u2019re going to open up for Q&A.","Glen L. Ponczak","Great, thanks, Bruce. And so I guess we\u2019re ready to start taking questions. And I think just based on the number of calls we\u2019ve got blogged in here, we probably have a lot of folks in the queue for questions and answers. So as we\u2019ve done in the last couple of calls, if you could limit your questions to one good question and one follow-up, and if you\u2019ve got more, just get back in the queue again, and hopefully, we can get to you.","Okay. with that Phil, we\u2019ll turn it over to you for question-and-answer queuing.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. (Operator Instructions) Our first question is from Ravi Shanker from Morgan Stanley. Sir, your line is open.","Ravi Shanker \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks very much. Good morning, everyone.","Stephen A. Roell","Hi, Ravi.","Ravi Shanker \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey. So I had a question regarding the re-segmenting within BE. you did a similar line of business type reporting structure in Auto, three or four quarters ago, and then you announced the Electronics business up for sale, any read across to what's going on in BE and GWS being classified as separate business?","Alex A. Molinaroli","This is Alex, Ravi. Yeah, we expected this question. The reason we did this is exactly for what we stated. We think that both of those businesses are important to us, and we think that there\u2019s opportunity and in order for us to capitalize not only on the GWS opportunity, but as important, the BE opportunity, is really to separate the two. So I wouldn\u2019t draw the analogy between the two. It's an obvious analogy, but I think as we start changing the way we manage our business, we're not trying to signal one thing or another. But we do expect GWS to improve its performance and they know that we have some high expectations and we need to make sure that we have a business that can compete and win.","Stephen A. Roell","Yeah, Ravi, this is Steve. Just two other comments I guess. When we actually did the separation with Automotive, it was not our intent. We did the separation to divest Electronics at that time. So that wasn\u2019t part of the premise of what we did that. I guess I would add would be, if you remember what Alex talked about, Dave\u2019s got a fair amount on his plate relative to the focus on this reorganization. And we also want to look for ways to grow BE and look for different growth platforms, and so that combination is really why we are trying to take some pressure off him and get the focus on that business, while we are also growing and improving the GWS business, and John Murphy is going to be heading up that group for us. He is one of our strong managers. He is coming over and had been part of this business before, having managing the Service business or the Systems business in North America most recently along with Middle East. So John is coming over to head that up. He will be named [after the] Corporation next week. So we\u2019re putting some of our best talent into GWS as well.","Ravi Shanker \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","All right.","Alex A. Molinaroli","The last thing I\u2019ll leave with Ravi is that they\u2019ll try to read things into anything, but we have been pretty clear that we are looking at our portfolio to make sure that it all makes sense. So just don\u2019t over read anything, but it hasn\u2019t changed our message that capital allocation is important, making sure that we have businesses that can be successful is important, but I wouldn\u2019t over pivot on this.","Ravi Shanker \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Understood, thanks for detail. In Glen\u2019s words that was my good question. My follow-up is can you give us any additional detail or numbers behind the additional restructuring actions that you put in place in the third quarter? Thanks.","Stephen A. Roell","Let's go through that, we'll take that as a follow-up with you Ravi in terms of \u2013 I mean, I kind of touched on where they verged and focused. It's really focused on downsizing in Europe. And we've talked in the last quarter about as we have changed our outlook in terms of the case that we see that business that that market improving, we are de-emphasizing that from a capital allocation point of view.","We've got heavy restructuring demands to turnaround our Interiors business, and so that's where the money has gone in terms of auto. If you think about Building Efficiency, the other piece and there it's really been, we took a charge to get it started and integrating in North American business. And so we have three or four separate businesses, we\u2019re going to be combining the branches. we got management changes and things like that. So we\u2019ve taken a charge to get started with that.","Ravi Shanker \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Understood, I\u2019ll follow-up off-line. Thank you.","Stephen A. Roell","Thanks, Ravi.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question on queue is from Rich Kwas from Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open, sir.","Richard Kwas \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC","Hi, good morning, everyone.","Stephen A. Roell","Hi, Rich.","Richard Kwas \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC","On the Power margins, they were a little bit lighter than we were looking for and I think you explained about the lead cores and what not in your increasing pricing, but as you think about the fiscal fourth quarter, should we get a pretty steady uptick on a year-over-year basis when you\u2019re looking at the segment margin?","Stephen A. Roell","Yeah, I think the margins will continue to uptick. What I would tell you is we\u2019re positioned for volume and since the volume didn\u2019t happen, it\u2019s a capital intensive business, high fixed costs, and so even without the volume, we didn\u2019t get the \u2013 we got some margin improvement. If and when the volume does come through, because we haven\u2019t lost any share, what we\u2019ll see is those margins, not only the cost part of the margins, but we\u2019ll get the absorption that we haven\u2019t seen yet.","Richard Kwas \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC","What sort of type of price increase, Alex, okay?","Alex A. Molinaroli","Well, we had a price increase in the other thing. Just to note I was looking at my notes earlier that our AGM volumes were up 40% in the quarter. so we\u2019ll continue to see that grow. So it\u2019s all tailwinds. Volume would be our best friend that we could have right now.","Richard Kwas \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC","Okay. That makes sense and\u2026","Stephen A. Roell","I would just comment, Rich, I saw in your notes in terms of where you\u2019re at versus last night, if you look at the quarter, we were down a couple of million units versus what we thought in terms of the aftermarket in the quarter. And if you look, sort of did the math in terms of the contribution that we make, the high fixed costs, capital cost as Alex talked about. that\u2019s really the reconciling item.","Richard Kwas \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC","Okay, all right. That makes sense. And then just a follow up on BE with pricing, you cited that as a driver of the margin performance this quarter. And I know that had some increasing benefit, is there a timeframe where you start to compare or should the pricing initiative continue to have benefits on the BE margins as you move into 2014?","Alex A. Molinaroli","I think we're going to continue to see benefits. The pricing opportunity is different kinds of opportunities, ones as it relates to very broad base recovery and then the other is understanding the elasticity of some of our products and how they are going to market. So I think we found plenty of opportunities plus I would tell you this just things like this initiative, the North American initiative, that's going to uncover not only as much as pricing opportunities, but we are going to get a lot more leverage out of the opportunities and the customer share of wallet with the customer, and that's going to give us a lower cost to serve. So that will also show up in the margin line.","Richard Kwas \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC","Okay.","Stephen A. Roell","The only thing I can mention that Alex is the lot of the pricing actions are in our Solutions business and that\u2019s just flowing into our backlog\u2026","Richard Kwas \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC","Yeah.","Stephen A. Roell","Right now, so that will flow into revenues later, okay, into 2014.","Richard Kwas \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC","Okay, great. Thank so much.","Stephen A. Roell","Thanks, Rich.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Emmanuel Rosner from CLSA. Your line is open, sir.","Emmanuel Rosner \u2013 Credit Agricole Securities, Inc.","Hi, good morning, everybody.","Stephen A. Roell","Good morning.","Alex A. Molinaroli","Hi, Emmanuel.","Emmanuel Rosner \u2013 Credit Agricole Securities, Inc.","My question is around capital allocation. You guys obviously are starting to generate some more meaningful free cash flows and then there is obviously some potential proceeds from divestitures. And so it looks that like the proceeds from this particular divestiture are your mark towards debt repayments, but I think I would like to ask you more generally and looking forward, as you are starting to generate more free cash, what are your priorities in terms of debt pay down versus returning some of it to shareholders maybe in terms of buyback and I think you\u2019ve also more recently been much more open about the idea that looking forward you\u2019d be interested in some more potential acquisitions, where does that come in terms of priority for cash use?","Alex A. Molinaroli","Okay, well, I think the reason why we pointed to, when Bruce talked about his use of proceeds, that\u2019s sort of our near-term views of what we would use with the proceeds from HomeLink, is to pay down the cash and the debt that\u2019s terming. But what we are really doing is if you think about it, we are deleveraging our balance sheet. We want to protect our rating. That\u2019s one of our criteria. I think from the standpoint of share buyback, I think we still can find opportunities in our business to grow the growth platforms. So I wouldn\u2019t tell you that our share buybacks are really there to protect our dilutive nature of some of our options, exercises. So share buybacks are not high in our priority list, but I do think that we are looking at different ways to allocate our capital. And I think in terms of M&A, we\u2019ve talked about in the past that our priorities would be in building efficiency and that\u2019s really what we are working on right now is how we can do a better job of finding new growth platforms to complement our BE business.","Emmanuel Rosner \u2013 Credit Agricole Securities, Inc.","Okay. And I guess as a follow-up in terms of the sustainability of the free cash flow, obviously your CapEx went from $1.8 billion last year to $1.2 billion, do you view that as a new sustainable rate and even possibly lower obviously if there is some divestitures going forward or do you think that it will serve like a more of a one-time effort to where you are trying to serve. We focus capital allocation back to $1.2 billion might be too low for on an ongoing basis?","Alex A. Molinaroli","Yeah, let me help you out with this. This is Alex and then Bruce can give some more specifics. In December, we\u2019re going to talk more about this, but our businesses are changing. The Automotive business is more mature than it was in this growth period, and we\u2019ve become more selective and then as we talk about becoming more selective, that means that we\u2019re going to have a different level of capital expectations within that business. It\u2019s not that there is not opportunities there they are just not always attractive to us. So we\u2019re clearly making a conscious decision in Automotive about how much to fund that business, and so that and they\u2019ll have an impact on the growth of that business.","So that\u2019s debt free cash flow that we generate. In Power, I think we will start seeing that creep back up over time because those opportunities are there. Just right now, where we\u2019re is in a position that we\u2019re utilizing the capital that we\u2019ve already spent, but the plans are still in place to continue to spend in Power. So I don\u2019t know that we\u2019ll stay at the exact levels that we\u2019re at right now. I think this next year we\u2019ll be at low again, but overtime it will continue to come back. But what I would expect is when you see this free cash flow is that the opportunity to invest in BE, which is not capital intensive, which may show up in different ways and that's where we talk about things like some significant growth platforms around acquisitions. So the future is, a way is out, but I would just tell you that's the way we\u2019re thinking today, and Bruce, I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve got something to add to that?","R. Bruce McDonald","No, you covered it well.","Alex A. Molinaroli","Did I?","Stephen A. Roell","Yes. I think Bruce\u2019s the only comment is would be the reinvestment ratios are where the rate that we\u2019re looking at right now and targeting.","R. Bruce McDonald","Yeah, I think\u2026","Emmanuel Rosner \u2013 Credit Agricole Securities, Inc.","All right.","R. Bruce McDonald","And what you\u2019re really going to see here is, well, first of all, I guess, maybe the $1.8 billion was extraordinarily high. If you would go back and look at our historic level of investments in the backout of the last two or three years, you\u2019d find our average was less than $1 billion. So I wouldn\u2019t use the $1.8 billion as a benchmark. That was a peak. It peaked out in Auto and Alex has already talked about the facts we\u2019re going to de-emphasize that, in this and as we get into 2014, we can take a little bit of a breather in Power Solutions, because we\u2019ve got a little bit, we\u2019ve kind of invested ahead of the curve in the lithium ion in China and AGM. so we don\u2019t need to sort of restart those capacities next year. And those are the ones as the market develops, those are the three things where you would see CapEx creep up.","And then on the balance sheet side, maybe just to your first question, our target debt to equity, our debt to total cap ratio was in that 30% to 35%. so Steve touched on the fact what we\u2019re going to do with the money when we get it. but our target leverage is in that 30% to 35% range. and so we\u2019re focused on improving our operations here. we know, as I talked about in my comments that we got to re-earn our investors\u2019 trust and we think we\u2019re on the right track to do that. So we\u2019re not going to do anything large here in the next few quarters, but we are going to start to put more emphasis on finding some M&A platforms to accelerate some growth in largely Building Efficiency business.","Emmanuel Rosner \u2013 Credit Agricole Securities, Inc.","All right, thanks a lot, I appreciate it.","Stephen A. Roell","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Rod Lache from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open, sir.","Rod A. Lache \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey, buddy, a couple of things. Firstly in Building Efficiency, could you talk a little bit more about what the drivers were of that $50 million increase in earnings by business line? in other words, what are you seeing in terms of Service, Systems, GWS, and how does that look going forward?","Stephen A. Roell","Sure. Hang on one second. What I would tell you is Service has been strong and it continues to be strong. even though we\u2019re not seeing some of the top line that we\u2019ve been hoping for and maybe some of this warm weather will help out, but Services has been incredibly strong. Our Systems continues to just hang in there, but it\u2019s not having the kind of growth that it\u2019s had in the past. GWS has actually grown and continues to grow and then Asia, I think those are the places and on the year-on-year basis, we\u2019re seeing some benefit in Europe, but it\u2019s for a pretty slow\u2026","R. Bruce McDonald","Slow based.","Stephen A. Roell","Very small base, so it was kind of across the board, I would tell you that we are just seeing the kinds of programs we put in place, mostly around the margins and cost improvements benefit everywhere. Service being one that\u2019s getting a high productivity in the field.","Rod A. Lache \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","So from an earnings perspective, you are saying that Service and the improvement in the GWS were the biggest driver of the $50 million year-over-year increase. Is that right?","Stephen A. Roell","Two of the biggest, yes.","R. Bruce McDonald","Yeah.","Alex A. Molinaroli","Yeah.","Stephen A. Roell","If you look at the fourth quarter, I can give you a little bit of color on to Alex\u2019s point is going to be Service. Asia, we are counting on the fourth quarter and to some extent the Middle East, we\u2019ve got also some jobs there. But I guess, I would just tell you as I look at each of these sub segments here, every part of our BE is part of the positive increase year-over-year.","R. Bruce McDonald","Yeah, Rod, I mean, it's actually up about $40 million and just to help you out, so Services was up $17 million, GWS was up $9 million, Asia was up $5 million and other was up $7 million and what I think if you would look behind that, we\u2019ll see that's where the residential strengths came...","Rod A. Lache \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then two housekeeping things, one is what's the revenue and EBITDA specifically associated with the HomeLink business just so that we can understand what's left? And the point of clarification, the 3% to 4% increase in price that you have in Power Solutions, how does that actually rollout? I understand there is some contractual limitations and maybe your contracts with OE versus aftermarket might be a little bit different?","Alex A. Molinaroli","Yes, let me take the pricing one first, this is Alex and then I\u2019ll let Bruce comment on HomeLink. I think that our announcement is in the rears of where we\u2019ve already made the movements in the marketplace. So for the most part, we\u2019re in pretty much control. So I would expect that all this would be in place within the quarter. And hopefully, most of it in the first part of the quarter, I don\u2019t think those are going to be a whole lot of lag on this. Where we had the biggest lag on any pricing we\u2019ve done recently was when we introduced the new premiums for lead that was something that we did go back to the OEs and renegotiate. In this particular case, I don\u2019t really see much of a lag.","Stephen A. Roell","Last year, just as a comment Alex, like maybe comment last year, it moved up so quickly as we had hard time.","Alex A. Molinaroli","Yeah.","R. Bruce McDonald","Yeah.","Rod A. Lache \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Alex, that\u2019s global or is that just North America, the price increase?","Alex A. Molinaroli","Well, that\u2019s primarily North America, in the rest of the world that, we\u2019ll announce price increases, but for them, it\u2019s a little less across the board at the way that we managed the North American business is unique. So I would consider that North American.","Rod A. Lache \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, thanks.","Stephen A. Roell","Yeah. And then Rob, your question in terms of Gentex, I mean, we \u2013 as part of our discussions and our agreement with Gentex, we have agreed jointly what we\u2019re each going to say and we can\u2019t really say anymore, I\u2019d refer you to them to get the answer for that question.","Rod A. Lache \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Any color on whether it\u2019s half your electronics or it\u2019s close to I mean just general flavor for what you still have left?","Stephen A. Roell","I can\u2019t comment.","Alex A. Molinaroli","No.","Rod A. Lache \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay.","Alex A. Molinaroli","What we typically do, relatively call and we have a transaction like this. We typically, when we close, we\u2019ll provide you more detail regarding what the gain is, what the book gain is, what the aftertax proceeds are, et cetera. So we typically do at the time we close.","Rod A. Lache \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Right.","R. Bruce McDonald","The only thing that I can tell you on that, there is \u2013 we expect very minimal tax leakage, so pre-tax is largely be a minimal tax charge, so no cash taxes.","Alex A. Molinaroli","Well, I would just make a side comment because everybody else is too polite not to say it is that just the lot of the noise has been out there in the media hasn\u2019t been helpful and hasn't been true. So I guess everything on the Internet is not true.","R. Bruce McDonald","We were referring to the general press.","Rod A. Lache \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks for the tip.","Operator","Thank you. I guess we\u2019re now moving to you our next question. Our next question is from David Leiker from Baird. Sir, your line is open.","David Leiker \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co.","Good morning, everyone.","Stephen A. Roell","Hi, David.","Alex A. Molinaroli","Hi, David.","David Leiker \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co.","I wanted to try and dig to the battery base, particularly in North America, I mean, we got several quarters in row of weak demand and my mind there is three buckets behind it and if you could help clarify on where we stand and that's one market demand the number of vehicles on the road in the U.S. haven't grown for a while. The weather has been an issue. And is there an issue here with the batteries lasting longer than what, I mean, clearly they\u2019re lasting longer than what\u2019s your warranty period, but is that an overbuilding issue that presents the margin opportunity for you and just kind of fill in some color along those issues?","Alex A. Molinaroli","I'm not sure I understood the last could you clarify the overbuilding part of that question?","David Leiker \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co.","Yeah, you build a 48-month battery and it lasts 60 months, you put too much lead in it?","Alex A. Molinaroli","No, no, no, no, no. Well, we\u2019ve never been guilty of putting too much lead in the battery.","David Leiker \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co.","Okay","Alex A. Molinaroli","I still think it's been a weather related phenomenon. Now clearly batteries have become better and better and the systems in vehicles have become better and better as it relates to their own systems and the wear and tear that they have on batteries. That is all true, but what we're seeing here is a phenomenon that correlates geographically to weather. That doesn\u2019t mean that is not other factors. so eventually this will catch up. now there is some lag, if you go back in time when we had the downturn of the OE is \u2013 the OE downturn, there will be a bubble that we see and car registrations have been reasonably consistent in and out growing like we\u2019ve seen in the past. But all of our models would say that we have pent-up demand.","So I do still think it\u2019s just a matter of when not if, we haven\u2019t lost any share. and even if battery demand was being put off, eventually, we catch up to that.","David Leiker \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co.","Great.","Stephen A. Roell","So it\u2019s frustrating for you, it\u2019s even more frustrating for us. Unfortunately, we\u2019ve been out to offset that. we\u2019ve grown in our OE business and that will be even more to come and we\u2019ve secured a whole bunch of customers here recently. and we\u2019re starting to secure some customers in North America and some larger retails. we\u2019re not ready to talk about that yet. So we\u2019re also gaining share. So I think well, if it continues we\u2019ll be able to compensate a bit for it with new customers, but we\u2019re still planning for this volume to come.","David Leiker \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co.","Okay. And then just to follow-up on the battery, thanks for the numbers on the AGM, what portion of your shipments are AGM today, and has that shift happened enough to start to also become a margin driver?","Stephen A. Roell","In Europe, it\u2019s a margin driver, overall, it\u2019s not. because are still predominantly, that\u2019s a European number, and I guess what, I don\u2019t have those numbers in front of me. So I\u2019d be able to guess, let\u2019s get back to you. But it\u2019s become a reasonably significant number in Europe, in the OE business. but otherwise it\u2019s still on the margin. but it\u2019s moving the numbers. Our European business is very healthy, and that has driven a lot by the AGM business. But I don\u2019t have those numbers right here.","David Leiker \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co.","Okay, great. thank you very much.","Stephen A. Roell","Okay.","R. Bruce McDonald","Thanks, David.","Operator","Okay, thank you. Our next question is from Brett Hoselton from KeyBanc. Your line is open, sir.","Brett D. Hoselton \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets","Good morning, gentlemen.","Stephen A. Roell","Hi, Brett.","R. Bruce McDonald","Hi, Brett.","Alex A. Molinaroli","Hi.","Brett D. Hoselton \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets","I was hoping you could just briefly talk about the European Automotive business. Two things; one, production outlook particularly curtailments or extensions of summer shutdowns in Europe, and then secondly, margin progression as we kind of move through the next year or two, what are your thoughts there?","Alex A. Molinaroli","Well, I can tell you from the fourth quarter, we don\u2019t and we would know by now, but we don\u2019t see any significant production interruptions as around people lease moving things around summer shutdown. And so, there is no risk there, we would already have that announcement planned for.","Obviously, as you know in North America it\u2019s kind of the opposite. There has been a several production increases, but those have been out for a while now. And so, I would say, like there always just, Brett, there is very little revenue risk quarter out in terms of our industry. So we\u2019re not too worried about it. And then in terms of your question around the auto margin guidance, I guess, I prefer to wait on that one, I mean that\u2019s typically something that we share as our December timeframe. But we are on record, I would say and that we have given sort of trend line guidance in terms of the types of margins, the glide pass that we expect. And right now I wouldn\u2019t expect this is going to be materially different.","Brett D. Hoselton \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets","Thank you very much, gentlemen.","Stephen A. Roell","Thank you.","Alex A. Molinaroli","Next question.","Operator","All right. Our next question is from Brian Johnson from Barclays. Sir, your line is open.","Brian Johnson \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","Good morning.","Stephen A. Roell","Hey, Brian","Alex A. Molinaroli","Hey, Brian","Brian Johnson \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","Alex made a comment that I want to go back to with my main question that GWS standalone, the target is 5% margins. Want to get a sense when we think about the operating income, can we expect that similar kind of inflection or is in part you get the 5% by restructuring some of the pass-through revenues.","Alex A. Molinaroli","Yeah, I\u2019m sorry, first question, the question we had obviously is whether or not we get there too restructuring some of the revenues, that\u2019s not what we are doing.","Brian Johnson \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","No, no, no, no. It\u2019s of operational.","Alex A. Molinaroli","Okay, you are talking about pass-through versus. No, no, well, the first thing as Bruce pointed out, and I did say EBIT, that in segment income is probably 4%.","R. Bruce McDonald","Yes. I think we allocate (inaudible).","Alex A. Molinaroli","Pay for all of last year. But it\u2019s 4% still significant improvement of what we have got. And it changed the entire complexion of the business, but that has nothing to do with change in how we report the numbers. It has everything to do with how we drive our operations. And so it\u2019s very much a change program from an operational view point to leverage the scale that we have that in the past we have not been able to take advantage of scale meaning people and truck density and people density at our sites. So we\u2019ll have more information about that strategy probably in December, but it\u2019s something that, that\u2019s been well thought out. We understand what we need to do and the team\u2019s already working that problem. So I think we\u2019ll start to see that stuff and we\u2019re talking over two-year period to get that. so we\u2019ll start seeing the improvements over the next year.","Stephen A. Roell","Yeah. we\u2019ve made several references today to December. let me explain to you what we\u2019re thinking. Right now, it\u2019s our intention with our calendar year-end earnings call in October. we\u2019ll provide you with guidance relative to the first fiscal quarter of 2014. And then in December as we did last year, it\u2019s our intention in order to repeat, we did last year, which was to hold in Analyst Day in the December timeframe. So that\u2019s when Alex and Bruce and I referred to December, that\u2019s what we\u2019re referring to that date, okay?","Brian Johnson \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And that\u2019s probably answered my follow-up question, which is similarly on the \u2013 what kind of SG&A say, should we be thinking about from the consolidation within the North Americans three lines of businesses?","Alex A. Molinaroli","Yeah. I don\u2019t think we really have a number for that. I mean obviously, we\u2019ve got, we set aside restructuring to help us streamline that business. But we\u2019ll provide more color on that as we move forward.","R. Bruce McDonald","But it\u2019s a right question, Brian.","Alex A. Molinaroli","Yeah.","Brian Johnson \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, thanks.","Stephen A. Roell","We have time for one more.","Operator","Okay, thank you. Sorry.","Stephen A. Roell","Yeah, last question here.","Operator","Okay, thank you. Our next question is from Colin Langan from UBS. Sir, your line is open.","Colin Langan \u2013 UBS Securities, LLC","Great, thanks for taking my question.","Stephen A. Roell","Hi.","Colin Langan \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","Can you just \u2013 you touched on that couple of questions earlier, but on the Auto Experience, can you talk about the margin progression sequentially from Q3 to Q4? I mean you took some restructuring action this quarter. Should we still see acceleration, because you commented I think on the general trend over time hasn\u2019t changed. But should we see some improvement again next quarter or is this sort of a restructuring is kind of down in?","R. Bruce McDonald","Colin, I know there is a huge improvement on a year-over-year basis. Q4 is typically a good quarter for us, even though we do have some business shutdown impact in Europe. So I don\u2019t have the \u2013 on the top of my head, I don\u2019t have the margins for Auto in Q4. But I know they\u2019re up, but I don\u2019t know it\u2019s up as much as we have it here in this quarter.","Colin Langan \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And any color on the restructuring benefit. I mean, is that most of that done in Q3, I mean you took some more this quarter, so that would be really seeing into next year\u2019s results?","R. Bruce McDonald","Yeah, yeah. The things that we took this quarter are definitely not 2013 items. And yeah, no, but as I said in my comments, we\u2019re still gaining momentum in terms of restructuring. So there is more tailwind in Q4 than there was in Q3.","Colin Langan \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And then can you guys provide a little color on, you said there were some other charges in Auto Experience that sort of offset that gain, I mean any numbers around that would be helpful?","R. Bruce McDonald","Yeah, like $20 million. So the net of the two items like $9 million, say $0.01 a share that equates to. And like I said, the charge is related to litigation reserves and what we\u2019ve seen there is an up tick in product liability losses. And it really has to do with the period on which the ROE customers were bankrupt. So pre-bankruptcy cases what you \u2013 I think and we\u2019re not unique here, as what you\u2019re going to see is, suppliers and the OEs were generally standing shoulder-to-shoulder and when we had a product liability case, we generally paid a significantly lower amount than the OE. So we contributed to the settlement.","Now, you\u2019ve got cases where the OE is standing beside us, and we\u2019re seeing sympathetic juries awarding large sums of money and we\u2019re standing by ourselves. So I think you\u2019re going to see in the industry that trend sort of pick up. so we had some losses on that that were not normal.","And then the other item that I talked about was just related to cost associated with our downsizing in South America. So in South America, we\u2019ve talked about going from like 11 plans to three or four. and so there\u2019s some just some charges related to that downsizing.","Alex A. Molinaroli","That\u2019s good.","Colin Langan \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","And the litigation reserves that\u2019s in your North America margins still even though it\u2019s 7%?","R. Bruce McDonald","Yeah.","Colin Langan \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","All right, okay. Thank you very much.","Stephen A. Roell","Thanks, Colin.","Alex A. Molinaroli","Thanks, Colin. Thanks everybody for calling. Dave Urban and I are available of course, for the rest of the day for your follow-up questions. and I\u2019ll turn it over to Steve for some concluding comments.","Stephen A. Roell","Yeah, just real quick. Okay, I mean, I think we are very pleased with the quarter. As Bruce mentioned, I think we gained credibility back. but we understand we\u2019ve got ways to go here. We got great momentum in our businesses, and I think the fact that we expect strong earnings across all three of our reported businesses. but really as we talked, some like responded to questions. it goes beyond that. We\u2019ve got good growth and good prospects into the subsets of all three. So we feel very good, because it is an awful lot of our legs. and thank you much for coming on and we look forward to the call at the end of Q4, and having a record year. Thank you very much.","Alex A. Molinaroli","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes the conference. Thank you all for participating.

If you have objections you may disconnect at this point.","I will now have the meeting over to your host, Mr. Glen Ponczak, Vice President Global Investor Relations at Johnson Controls. Sir, please go ahead.","Glen Ponczak","Thanks, Abby [ph], and welcome everybody to the review of Johnson Controls fourth quarter fiscal 2015 earnings. If you have not already received it, you can get the slide presentation at Johnson Controls.com. Click the Investor link at the top of the page and scroll down to the Event Calendar section and you'll find the PDF there.","This morning Chairman and CEO Alex Molinaroli will provide some perspective on the quarter followed by Executive VP and Vice Chairman, Bruce McDonald, who will review the business results, and then Chief Financial Officer, Brian Stief, will review the company's overall financial performance. Following those prepared remarks will open the call for questions to end the top of the hour.","Before we begin I like to remind you and refer you to our forward-looking statements disclosure that's in the news release and also the slide deck. We remind you that today's comments will include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual results to be materially different than those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. These factors include the potential impact from a planned separation of the automotive experience business and business operations after these results, required regulatory approvals that are material conditions for the proposed transaction to close, the strength of U.S. automotive economy, automotive vehicle production levels, mix and schedules, energy and commodity prices, currency exchange rate and cancellation of or changes to commercial contracts as well as other factors discussed in Johnson Controls' most recent annual report on form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2014 and Johnson Controls subsequent quarterly reports on 10-Q.","The company assumes no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this presentation.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Alex.","Alex Molinaroli","Good morning, everyone. I want to jump right in to slide number four. It is a busy slide, but we have been busy and I think it's indicative of all of the things that we have going on and the pride that I have in of our people. So our fourth quarter we continued most importantly with our ongoing improvement in each one of the businesses and our EPS guidance. We've made significant progress across our portfolio transformation. As we remake this company and ultimately as we create two great companies, once we spin our automotive business.","In the face of some real headwinds in each one of our businesses and the company as a whole we've achieved margins in the quarter and margins for the year we've never achieved and I'm incredibly proud of our entire team.","If you look at our slide four you'll see our improvements in our margin for the year is 120 basis points and our EPS improved 14% to $3.22. The slide also does a really good job of putting into context the ongoing transformational actions that we've taken up to this point. It goes back a couple of years since we began this journey and then specifically in the fourth quarter you can see we completed the sale of GWS and consummated the Hitachi joint venture.","And of course the largest and most significant action that we currently have and that we've had under way is the spin of our automotive business which is planning to be spun off on October 1, 2016.","If you move on to slide five, a couple of more data points already discussed: our segment margin improvements and our EPS gain but probably more importantly is the underlying health of the individual business operations. If you adjust for FX our segment sales were up 5% and our income was up 16%.","Slide six. I've already talked about our record fourth quarter and key portfolio actions. I'd like to point out that these business improvements aren't happening just because everyone at Johnson Controls is working harder. We continue to work smarter. We're utilizing the principles found within our Johnson Controls operating systems and we continue to focus on managing the anticipated cost structure and the new operating models that will be necessary to run the remaining Johnson Controls and also our new automotive company independently. We are doing this simultaneously while we are able to achieve our results.","I'd like to talk a little bit about our end markets in China. Bruce will talk more about this it will be happy to answer any Q&A but we do have good news. By the time we got to the end of the fourth quarter in China automotive market we were able to see that the dealer inventories began to get depleted and that sales began to move and we are actually feeling much better as we move into the fiscal year as it relates to China sales and so what we saw as a tough quarter began to get a lot better as the months went on in July, August and September.","One of the important things that I've had an opportunity to see in some of the pre-reports is I'd like to talk about our VE backlog. We actually have a slide on that but first, I want to give you a takeaway. In the core of our business of selling equipment and controls through our branches is growing and because of the changing nature of our business one of the things that's become more and more important for us is that as we become product and distribution dependent our backlog - and I will give you more color on this in a slide or two - is becoming less and less of the most important metric. Certainly our sales are important, but if you look at revenues they've continued to increase even though we have a backlog that's been under pressure. It has to do with the mix of our business.","I'm also incredibly excited to talk about the fact that we have our Hitachi deal done and simultaneously we have already released our VRF product, one of the leading VRF products in the world. We've already put ourselves into a leadership position in China and in Asia and now, we've released that product for sale and have already begun selling the product in North America.","If you look at our battery business specifically, if you want to look across the region, but if you look at our AGM sales we will talk about that in more detail but essentially we are selling every battery that we can make and those sales are incredibly robust.","Moving on to slide seven. On slide seven you can say we've put it into the quarter's perspective. We've had another strong quarter and if you look at our 150 basis points of margin improvement within our segments, it's something that we continue to be proud of and I guess the context I would like to keep that in is that we've done this quarter after quarter over the last couple of years and we continue to see improvements in all of our businesses and our ability to execute.","On slide eight, it's a complicated slide but I think it's really important because it seems to be one of the things that is giving people pause about where we are in our performance and our continuing here. I'm actually very pleased about what's happening with building efficiency. If you look at our building efficiency orders, Europe and Asia were down and we expected that but what we are really surprised at is at the end of the quarter and in September - which is usually a very large month for us for the Federal Government; there were some political realities that were the case and still the case specifically in September around the continued resolution - all orders for the Federal Government business in North America were down 37%. That all actually really happened in the month of September.","Hopefully some of this work will come back over the next few months and that assumes a constructive resolution in Congress around the federal budget, but this one is out of our control. As you think about us and you think about our orders moving forward, our pipeline is robust. We expected to have a much different set of numbers. The Federal Government continued resolution discussion and challenged us with something that caught us by surprise that was outside of our control.","If we look at it and take it in context, orders and branches were up 4%. If you look at our pipeline, that's 4% over the year if you look at our pipeline, going forward, we still continue to see single digit growth in our pipeline moving forward.","The other thing that's important to note is that in the past, backlog was always an important measure of our business and building efficiency. And it was because our dependency on our branch and projects business.","As you all know, people that have followed us in the past, three quarters of our future sales usually came through our backlog and it was a good predictive measure. Since we've made our acquisition of ADTI, we've increased our distribution sales and now with the inclusion of Hitachi joint venture moving forward, that backlog information as we become less and less connected certainly correlates and it's important to have a backlog. But it will be less important as we talk about our sales moving forward.","Our truck way sales were up over 4% for the year our distribution sales were up, the ADTI sales were also up. All of those things are not reflected in our backlog.","You can see that if you look at the disconnect between our sales number or our actually revenue number and what our backlog numbers were in the past.","One thing that's not on the slide that I would really like to point out is that the pull-through activity that's happening with CB Richard Ellis, something we probably should bring more focus on in the future and I think it's something that should become a topic, is something we are pleased with. It's actually started quicker than we thought. It actually began before we even closed the deal. A lot of that probably won't flow through our backlog either because it's dealing with individual customers and individual facilities. But we're seeing a real uptake in orders in a very large pipeline and backlog of opportunities.","I'd like to talk a little bit about our growth opportunities and just give you some examples.","If you go to slide nine, we are in the midst of launching many, many products expanding our channels. I'd like to talk about a couple of our products that we've introduced over the last quarter. Specifically, around our residential and light commercial business. You see the Champion LX series. We also upgraded and enhanced our flagship security product offering which is the P2000 Access Control System. And we've also launched some online tools for our residential contractors to help them be more effective and efficient and able support the consumers more effectively.","End power solutions, we announced a new plant to be built in China in Shenyang, six million units and we debuted in Frankfurt a new generation of advanced start stop products that include both active in lead acid and lithium ion chemistries.","In China we also signed an MOU with DAIC to support them and their partners for their growing needs for start stop batteries.","Finally we recently formally announced our lithium ion distribution energy storage solution. We've already have presold and actually installed some of these systems and it's a launch we're actually leveraging the technology that we have from building efficiency with the distribution resources we have. I'm sorry, with the technology at power solutions and leveraging the distribution that we have at building efficiency.","Moving on to slide 10 and automotive, lots of new products and launches. If you look at some of the product launches we have within our automotive business we continue to provide new products for our customers, personalization products that are becoming more and more important for new a generation of customers.","We've launched our BMW 7 series in the Czech Republic, our core product portfolio and our mechanism family, very important part of our strategy moving forward. Our T-3000 recliner and our Hydro adjuster being released globally for multiple customers.","And then Frankfurt we unveiled a new seat in interior technology talking about the future when we talk about autonomous driving. Obviously autonomous driving and the new technology going into vehicles will play a big part of our seating business in the future.","Lastly before I turn it over to Bruce, I'd just like to point out that we have an incredible momentum in each one of our businesses. And we're going to continue to focus on our operational excellence through our Johnson Control's operating system, improving margins, lowering our cost and increasing our quality.","And we will do that in the same time we go through our automotive spend activities. Our pipeline of investments is strong, and if I think about what's happening with our ACE separation, and you'll get more color on this when we see you in December. We're on track, on schedule, on task and this time next year we'll be talking about two powerful new companies. So I think that overall if I look at our progress over the last two years, we're well on our way to be the - to = be a leading multi-industrial company.","With that, Bruce? You take this from here.","Bruce McDonald","All right. Well thank you, Alex. And I think as I go through the business operations you're going to - what you're going to see is despite the fact that we've had a lot going on from a portfolio perspective, that our business leaders and all the people at the company have really been focused on delivering solid year-over-year results here.","So if we start on slide 12, we were really pleased with building efficiencies results here in the fourth quarter. You can see sales of $2.9 billion were approximately the same as they were last year. Though stripping out foreign exchange, we had organic revenue growth of 5%.","In North America Systems and Service, our business was up 6% year-over-year and we saw good strength in our Branch business, though that was offset by some of the softness in the Federal Government business that Alex talked about earlier in his comments.","We finally saw - we've been talking a lot this year about the Middle East. We finally ran up against some more favorable comps, so Middle East business were up nearly 54%, Asia was level with the prior year, Europe was down 3% and Latin America, which continues to be very, very soft, was down 16%.","If you look at our segments earnings in the quarter, $351 million. We're up 5%. And as we've noted here on our slide, backing out foreign exchange, it was up 8%. The year-over-year improvement would really be due to higher volumes and favorable price and product mix. The margins, which was a real strong story in the quarter, up - were up to 12.1%, a 60 basis point improvement versus last year.","I would point out that this was the first quarter where ADT - the ADT acquisition has been in both sets of numbers, so that business, you'll recall, closed in June of last year. So this quarter we had a clean comparable quarter from a year-over-year basis, so the incremental benefit of ADT isn't what drove the numbers here. It was really just business performance.","And then lastly I would just note for the full year, BE margins were up about 70 basis points, so I think we're pretty pleased that despite the fact that we saw some currency headwinds and some of the markets didn't recover like we thought they were going to going into this year, the business delivered segment margin improvement of about 70 basis points, which was about 20 basis points better than the guidance that we gave at the beginning of the year for building efficiency.","Turning to slide 13, in power solutions for the fourth quarter, our sales were down 6%. Though again adjusting for foreign exchange, we saw organic growth of 3%. In terms of unit shipments in the quarter, we're up about 1%. Europe and North America were each up 1%. Asia was up about 4%.","AGM continues to be a huge benefit and you can see our growth is accelerating here in the quarter. We were up 44% to just under 2.9 million units. And then if you look at our mix between aftermarket and OE, aftermarket was up about 1% globally and OE was up 2%. Segment income in the quarter, you can see nice improvement, up 5% to $340 million. And again if you took out the impact of foreign exchange, we would've been up about 11% on a year-over-year basis. And an exceptionally strong margin performance in the quarter, up about 200 basis points to 20.2%","I would just caution folks that, that's not - that level of margin improvement, while we're pleased with it, it is not something that's sustainable. So we don't see our business continuing to sort of grow at that level. So the 160 basis point improvement for this year, we sort of went into the year guiding to 50 basis points to 60 basis points of improvement on a year-over-year basis. The power solutions team, in the face of some of the headwinds that they had around foreign currency, I mean just did a great job for us.","And then lastly on page 14, I'll just talk a little bit about automotive. As Alex mentioned in his comments, our interiors joint venture closed at the beginning of the quarter on July 2, so this is the first quarter that we are reporting our automotive results showing interiors as an equity investment, in other words our interiors business is de-consolidated.","So when you look at our sales and we'll will see this for the next three quarters, our sales were down 21% in automotive, though if you were to back out the impact of foreign exchange and the de-consolidation of interiors, our organic growth in automotive was 3%. That is slightly lower than the industry production environment where we're up about 5% in North America and Europe. The reason for that really being some business discipline and recording process primarily in North America.","In China, you will see, and here you'll see a bigger number now we're talking about our sales being up about $2.3 billion, up about 27%. That's because we are now picking up the Chinese portion of the Yanfeng joint venture here. If you were to sort of adjust for that what you would see in China was our underlying sales were down about 3% and that compares a little bit favorably to the industry production environment which was down about 5%.","Spending a bit time on our interiors joint venture which closed in the quarter I would say we were pleased with how that business has started out. The numbers are looking pretty good there, from a topline perspective. I looked at the sales in the quarter, about $2 billion, so they were down about 2%, 2% or 3% versus the prior year. Though if you looked at that by region you'd see quite a different story. In our interiors business North America was up 14%. Europe was at about 16% really as a result of some of the new business launches we had. And then China was down 16%. So pretty mixed picture from a topline perspective in interiors.","In China, it has been a hot topic lately. I know there's a lot of comments about what's going on in the market and I thought maybe I could share some perspective. I personally was in China three times in the last four months so maybe I could just comment on some of the things we're seeing and some of the discussions that we are having with our partners and customers.","First of all, I would tell you the passenger car market, which is where we tend to compete, is holding up better than the other overall market. Though in the quarter it wasn't a big difference, about down 4% versus 6%.","We have very little content on the light commercial vehicles so we are primarily exposed to the passenger car side. Many of our customers cut production in the quarter significantly more than sales, which led to inventory de-stocking. We continue to see the SUV and luxury car segment doing very well on a year-over-year basis and right now the market is in a little bit of a transition where the Chinese own brands are picking up shares at the expense of some of the transplant customers.","I would also commend our joint ventures on doing a great job in flexing their cost base down in light of lower production and to give you a feel for that, if you were to look at our China seating business in the quarter, the equity income was a $5 million year-over-year decline. So even though our sales were down 3% the impact to our bottom line here at JCI level was about five million. So a nice job flexing the cost base.","And then lastly as Alex talked about we did see production improve sequentially throughout the quarter and as you sort of look at this dealer inventory level stabilizing here and with some of the benefits that we expect to see as some of the government incentives kick in on small vehicles. We do see double-digit scheduling, production schedule increases ramping up here into the first quarter of last calendar quarter here.","So I'm pretty optimistic that the worst is behind us here in China and we're going to start to see modest to mid-single digit type growth.","Lastly I'll just comment on segment income, which was up about 4% after adjusting for the adverse impact of foreign currency in the quarter. If you look at the margins, our margins were about 6%, 120% basis points higher than last year and here we are really starting to see the benefit of some of the restructuring actions that we've taken over the last year or so. And then the benefits we're getting in our plans from the introduction of Johnson Control's outputting system.","Maybe I would just point out, I've seen in some of the early notes a little bit of confusion around the margins, and what the segment margin expectation was in automotive and maybe just give a little color there.","As it relates to interiors, we showed segment income of about $10 million, which was down I think from $40 million the prior-year. Just a few things I would point out there. What you are saying in that line item is the after-tax income from our Yanfeng joint venture. Previously, that number would have been a pre-tax number, so that's worth about 15% or 20% is sort of the effective tax rate in that joint venture.","We've also got about $10 or $12 million of separation related cost in the JV. So that's the cost of setting up new IT systems and things like that. And then lastly what you see in that line item is the wind down cost that we have with some of the retained plants. That's a loss and we expect that's going to continue for the next three to four quarters.","So overall, a solid performance from automotive. A solid performance from all three of the businesses and with that, Brian, I'll will turn it over to you and the financials.","Brian Stief","Okay. Thanks, Bruce, and good morning everyone.","As you saw the press release and as outlined in the appendix to today's slide deck, the Q4 results from continuing operation include five significant non-operational items which resulted in a net charge of $1.04 in the quarter. And I'd like to touch quickly on those five items.","First of all we had a non-cash mark-to-market pension and post-retirement charge of $422 million. The way to think about that and I think we've mentioned this before about half of that roughly relates to the fact that we had to adopt some new mortality tables in the pension calculations and that caused right at about $200 million impact tax.","And then there was also with the August and September investment returns, we got hit hard in those two months and we ended up for the entire year having about a $200 million difference between expected investment returns and our actual returns. So all a 420 charge.","Secondly, we had a restructuring charge in the fourth quarter just short of $4 million that related primarily to the automotive business and then some non-cash impairment charges we took as well.","The third item would be a gain from the formation of interior's joint venture that Bruce referred to. That net gain was $145 million. Interiors is reported in our continuing operations but we've excluded that 145 from what I'll talk about this morning.","We also have as we have in prior quarters the transaction integration and separation cost associated with all of our portfolio actions that we're taking.","And the last item would be net tax expense charge that was taken as a result of the tax effects of the previous four charges or credits that I mentioned as well as planning around foreign cash repatriation that was done in connection with a couple of the transactions.","So as I talk through the financials this morning, I'll exclude those items from my comments and also remember that in the current year, GWS has been reported as a discontinued operation and we've done that on a comparable basis in fiscal 2014 and you may recall as well, electronics as a discontinued operation in 2014 also.","Last item that Bruce mentioned was the formation of the auto interiors joint venture which was formed on July 2. So we de-consolidated that in the quarter and we now maintain a 30% equity interest in that venture. So as I go through the income statement movements I will refer back to the impact of the interior de-consolidation.","So overall, fourth quarter sales were down 12% at $8.7 billion, but that was due to the de-consolidation of the interiors business which was $900 million and unfavorable foreign exchange of $600 million really across all three of our businesses and that was primarily the euro.","Excluding the impact of those two items, consolidated sales were up 3% and up across all three of our businesses.","Gross profit for the quarter was 19.6% which is up 160 basis points from last year. We really see the continued benefits of the shift in product mix as well as the ongoing benefits we are seeing in the Johnson Control's operating system initiatives.","SG&A was down 12% year-over-year. Again this was due primarily to foreign exchange and the de-consolidation of the interiors joint venture, and we also had some benefits from certain of the cost reduction actions that we've taken beginning in the fourth quarter here and as we move into fiscal 2016.","Equity income of $105 million was 14% lower than last year, and that was due to the fact that in the prior year, we did have an equity interest gain related to one of our joint ventures. In the current year, the Interiors joint venture income of $10 million that Bruce referred to, which is an after-tax number. That was offset by some shortfalls and certain of our Chinese Auto Seating joint ventures.","Overall, fourth quarter segment margins were 10.7% or 150 basis points better than 2014. So really strong operational performance across all three of our businesses.","During turning to slide 16, financing charges of $73 million were $7 million higher than the prior-year quarter. That was really the function of average debt levels were a bit higher this year throughout the year.","As far as the tax rate, both 2014 and 2015 have an underlying tax rate of roughly 19%. And if you look at income from - attributable to non-controlling interests, that's down $12 million, and that really relates to some of the reductions that we've seen in earnings at our Automotive consolidated joint ventures as well as the deconsolidation of the Interiors business.","So overall, EPS of $1.04 is a record, up 7% versus the $0.97 of a year ago.","Turning to page 17, I'd like to just spend a few minutes on some balance sheet and cash flow highlights, and then spend a couple minutes also on our Q1 guidance for fiscal 2016. So during the year, we executed share repurchases of $1.4 billion. In that $1.4 billion, of that, $400 million was in the fourth quarter. And we also paid throughout fiscal 2015 about $700 million in dividends to our shareholders. So at this point in time if you look at our share repurchase program, we've executed on about $2.6 billion of our $3.6 billion authorized level.","GWS divestiture proceeds in the quarter were at $1.4 billion. And if you think about where we really use that cash, we had about $400 million in tax audit settlements. And just as a point of reference, that $400 million that was paid really closed out about 33 or 34 open tax years in the United States, Germany and Mexico. And it's going to be - it's a positive thing as we move toward the Auto spin as well.","We also made some voluntary pension contributions of about $400 million, and of course, the Hitachi joint venture that Alex referred to that closed on October 1, that was about $550 million in cash. So that's kind of the way to think about the GWS divestiture proceeds.","As we move into 2016, our balance sheet remains strong, with net debt to cap of 36.7%, which is about 400 basis points better than last quarter and comparable to 35.7% that existed at the end of fiscal 2014.","Net debt is $6 billion at 9\/30\/15 and reflects a net debt reduction in the quarter of about $1.3 billion. And our adjusted cash flow for the year was about $1.4 billion as we've outlined in the appendix to the deck.","Capital spending of $1.1 billion was $200 million below plan, and that was primarily due to timing and some deferred projects at Power Solutions and BE.","As far as fiscal 2016 guidance, our strong fourth quarter provides us good momentum as we enter the year, and we expect earnings per share in Q1 of $0.80 to $0.83, which is up 8% to 12% from $0.74 last year. I would point out that this guidance, consistent with our practice this year, does exclude transaction, integration and separation costs. And I would just note that given the size and complexity of the AE separation and spinoff, the separation costs in fiscal 2016 will likely be significant and we'll provide some more color around a range of those costs in the December meeting. Also in the December analyst meeting, we will provide more details on the full year guidance.","And with that, Glen, I will turn it over to you.","Glen Ponczak","Great. Thanks, Brian.","Abby, I think we're ready to take calls here. I don't know how many are in the queue here, but just so that we give more people a chance, if you can keep it to a main question and a follow-up. And then if you've got more, get back into the queue, that would be helpful. And, Abby, we're ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","Our first question is from Robert Barry. Your line is now open, sir.","Robert Barry","Hey, guys. Thank you. Good morning.","Alex Molinaroli","Morning, Robert.","Bruce McDonald","Good morning.","Robert Barry","Yeah. I guess I wanted to start on the Building business in North America. I mean it looks like the orders slowed. I guess a lot of that was the government. The comps also got a lot tougher. So maybe can you just update us on how you feel about the momentum and kind of the key nonres verticals for the Nonres Applied business? And specifically on that government piece, I mean things are looking a little brighter on a budget deal. I mean how much line of sight do you feel you have to a kind of book of government business that could flow through if in fact things move forward with the contemplated deal?","Alex Molinaroli","Yeah. That's a great question. Well first, I hope it came through in my comments. It was a very frustrating - literally because of the - because of when the end of the fiscal year happened. I believe it was like over the weekend, a lot of this came to light at the very, very end, as it relates to the continued resolution and what that meant to the different agencies we do business with. They actually didn't realize that they were going to be curtailed because of the uncertainty. So you're right, the budget looks like it's going to get resolved. We're not sure what the resolution exactly is going to be. We would expect some of these projects to come back soon. But we also know that some of them may not come back right away because a lot of these projects are the type of projects that come at the end of the year when agencies find that they have additional funds in their budget. So I think it's going to be a mixed bag of us being able to get some of these projects in earlier than waiting for the end of the year. But it certainly wasn't something that we expect.","The good news on any of this, if there's any, is that these projects typically are very large and very, very slow moving, so that's not going to have a real huge impact on us this year. But it was disappointing because we have such a strong pipeline and such a lot of momentum in that business. The team was just really deflated when they were kind of dealt this curveball here over that weekend. But the pipeline is as strong as it was when we talked about it two quarters ago. And last quarter, what we see is secured pipeline. It looks very strong, particularly in all - in the institutional vertical markets. We continue to add salespeople, and so I think what we're going to - we'll continue to see growth.","I would consider - I think what I hope everyone takes away from this is this is not a change. What this is was something that was just something we couldn't predict and for us we do an awful lot of business with the federal government, so it was a significant blow to us. But I'm just as strong, if not more bullish because if you look at where, we talked about one quarter, and then two quarters and three quarters and I think we're - our line of sight is over the next couple quarters, we should continue to see strong orders.","Robert Barry","Gotcha. And maybe just a question on the Power business. Really two questions. If you could address the slowdown in the growth in the aftermarket? And then on the margin in Power, can you kind of bridge that gap between the guide of 50 bps and the 150 bps that you did? And to what extent specifically was there any change in planned investment spending that caused that much stronger performance in Power? Thanks.","Alex Molinaroli","Yeah. Yeah. I don't know that it was planned investment spending. I do think that what we can't predict at the end of each and every quarter is when - how our customers are going to order - get it where they get ready for - as they get ready for the winter months. What I would expect, in fact I was with one of our customer yesterday, is what I would expect is that some of the profits that we saw in this quarter may have been in a different year next quarter, so I think it's a little fungible quarter-to-quarter.","But as it relates to the slowdown in the aftermarket, I think what our team is seeing overall - let's use North America I guess as the best proxy. Is they're seeing a 3% to 4% growth. And in fact our team would tell you right now they're struggling to get batteries to be prepared for the winter. We're really concerned about our service levels so absent whatever is going to happen with the weather I can't really control that. Our biggest challenge right now is to make sure that we do have batteries to be prepared. So I think that's good. And then AGM as far as where we are on that is we are capacity constrained. We're building as fast as we possibly can and hopefully we have to get through the allocation. All in all a positive","Brian Stief","Yeah.","Bruce McDonald","I think one point around the investment, we are opening up our plant in China, our partnership AGM batteries out of China. So there is going to start to be some heavier investment in China next year versus this year around some of those new capacity adds.","Alex Molinaroli","That's true. Yeah. I did see actually - that's a good point, Bruce. I did see in some of the forecast that we have some launch costs in China specifically and as we start to use our global network for batteries, we probably are going to have some additional expense cost as we move batteries around versus capital cost.","Robert Barry","How much of a headwind is that?","Bruce McDonald","We'll talk more in December.","Alex Molinaroli","Yeah.","Bruce McDonald","We'll give you more detail around...","Alex Molinaroli","Yeah. I really don't - I really - I guess with the numbers I saw, I really don't know if I got to the root cause of it. It's not something that to be concerned about.","Robert Barry","Okay. Thank you","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from Julian Mitchell. Your line is now open, sir.","Julian Mitchell","Hi. Thank you.","Alex Molinaroli","Hi. Good morning.","Julian Mitchell","Good morning. Just a question on the segment margins within building efficiency. You had a good increase in Q4 and through the year. Just wondered if you could parse out at all how much of that was driven by price net of raw material costs? And how the hedging works and what kind of benefit you think you'll see in Q1 from that effect?","Bruce McDonald","Yeah. This is Bruce here. You kind of broke up a little bit. I don't have - and we usually don't like to talk about pricing versus commodity but commodities would have been a benefit with them trending down throughout the quarter but I would say equally that's not unique to Johnson Controls and so our competition would've been faced with the same tailwinds there and that tends to be reflected in how people look at quoting. So I don't think it's a big deal. I mean I think probably the best way to think about it is we've pretty consistently said that we see our glide path in BE margins around 50 basis points a year. When sales tend to be soft, we tend to do a little bit better job because we don't have to sort of ramp up resources in advance of new business.","We are adding salespeople. I mean I think we talked about that a little bit on our last quarterly call but it would really be and if we have flat topline performance, we can do a little bit better than the 50 basis points. When we start to see it turn, you probably see a little bit worse than 50 basis points. So that's kind of the best way to think about it.","Alex Molinaroli","I'd just add to that. I think in the fourth quarter the building efficiency team did a pretty good job of addressing early on some actions it was going to take from an SG&A standpoint and there was a benefit in the fourth quarter from some of those actions that they were able to accelerate versus some of the other actions that relate to the restructuring charge we took in the fourth quarter likely won't happen until sometime during fiscal 2016. So there was a bit of a benefit there as well.","Julian Mitchell","Thank you. And then just my follow-up question is on the Asian business within building efficiency. Yeah. The revenues were flat at currency orders down slightly. I think China is a pretty high-margin business for you in that segment so maybe just give some color on not the auto side but what you're seeing on the building side in China right now.","Bruce McDonald","Yeah. So let me give this a little bit of that. I don't want to call victory. Bruce's conversations around the automotive business I think is something because of our unique relationships that we have. We probably had more visibility into exactly what's going to happen. I can tell you we got more positive comments but I would call it anecdotal versus something that in automotive where we would see something more structural happening. So the phone calls have been better. The anecdotes have been better but I certainly don't think we're out of the woods yet in China as it relates to the building business. Now all that being said, remember we just went through the Hitachi","joint venture. So our presence in China has changed dramatically. We have a new party at Hycincs in China. We participate much more broadly in the market and I think we have the opportunity to see some increases because of that new participation and new products that we can cross sell. But we haven't really identified that. So I think that we may be able to do better than the market as we move forward because we have new products that we can sell through with multiple channels","Julian Mitchell","Right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Emmanuel Rosner. Your line is open.","Emmanuel Rosner","Hi. Good morning, everybody.","Alex Molinaroli","Good morning","Emmanuel Rosner","Wanted to ask you first about the automotive spin off. So if I heard you right I think it's scheduled for a about year from now, which obviously is a decent amount of time. I was curious if you could just give us some color on I guess what does the process look like? What do you have to accomplish in order to be able to get that done? Why does it take so long? But also, how do you reassure clients and customers, the auto makers in particular that about the future? I mean, some of your sitting competitors seem to imply that they are taking advantage of the uncertainty and they're getting more business as a result. So what can you do over that time period to sort of like make everybody more comfortable?","Alex Molinaroli","I'm going to turn this over to Bruce because he's so deeply into this, but I just want to address that last piece as it relates to what our competitors may or may not be saying. I'm not privy to that but I think that that's probably - I actually think that our position with our competitor is probably more about the fact that the way we manage the business today, not about who we're going to be tomorrow. Because if you think about how we manage the business today, we've very selective in the way that we allocate capital and how we compete within the Automotive business, particularly the Seating business in North America and Europe. That doesn't necessarily mean the way that Bruce and his team will run it in the future. So I think that when you hear our competition talk about it it's probably less to do about the spend and more to do about the fact that as a whole Johnson Controls has had a capital allocation strategy that may have benefited. That's the only way that I can relate to that comment.","But as far as how they spend is going and why it takes so long I think Bruce probably has a couple of facts that he can give you.","Bruce McDonald","Well, it's taking longer than I would like to happen but I think just to sort of walk you through sort of the main work streams. First of all and probably the most complicated is the separation and establishment of new corporate entities. So unlike say a divestiture where we're pretty used to say carving something out and selling it and have had a fair amount of experience over the last couple years doing that. Here we have to do all the separation work but also set up the corporate functions starting from scratch. And so that's a big work stream. The IT systems are always a challenge and again, we're used to sort of separating them out and automotive tends to be fairly separate here at Johnson Controls. There's not a lot of co-mingled systems or assets. But again, on the corporate side, we have to set up brand new systems from scratch. So that's kind of - what really drives the timing.","I think if you look like we have, Emmanuel, in terms of how long some of these spinoffs tend to take, as we looked out in the market, we've seen sort of nine month would be a quick one, 9 or 10 months to 18 to 24 months would be a slow one. And we tend to be I think given the size of it nearly $20 billion, 35 countries, we have 225 plants, 75,000 employees. So in the scheme of it I would say we're a large complex separation and I think the timetable that we've established is pretty aggressive given the complexity. I mean, I would say it's on the shorter end of normal and it's on the much more difficult than normal.","Emmanuel Rosner","Okay. That's helpful. And then just my follow up on automotive again. I guess the margin came maybe a little bit lower than we would have expected. And I realize there's a lot of moving pieces now because obviously the denominator is just a consolidated sales but on the numerator you have the consolidated earnings, you have now the interior earnings, you have the China earnings that are not consolidated. Can you maybe give us directional comment on how the performance for margins was for these different pieces? North America and Europe filling up down and then China filling in the interiors?","Alex Molinaroli","Yeah. I don't have it on the top of my head. I think and maybe we can follow this one up, Emmanuel, but I'd say just look at that seating margins were up 90 basis points in the quarter, 5.9% versus 5% last year. Interiors, in my comments I talked about some of the noise that's in their around the wind down cost, the fact that it's flipping from pre-tax number to post-tax number now. The fact that we've got cost to set up the new joint venture flowing through those numbers. So you're quite right, there's a lot of noise. We do intend next year to continue to show seating and interior separate.","And I think as we sort of hit our stride on getting the JV set up here, I think it's up to us to maybe do a bit better job educating folks on what the interior piece of it is going to look like, because I think that's where the confusion is coming about. I think the street had auto margins being about 70 or 80 basis points higher than we came in at. And I think that was because they sort of looked at last year's segment income in interiors and figured that would repeat. And that's where you see the 30 million year-over-year delta. So I think there is a lot of moving points and it's something that we can do a better job, and we will in Q1.","Bruce McDonald","Yeah. I think one of the things that we'll do as part of the December analyst day is we'll kind of unpack both the consolidated and unconsolidated automotive sales and related margins. So we'll get into that in a bit more detail in December.","Emmanuel Rosner","All right. Thank you all.","Bruce McDonald","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Richard Kwas. Your line is now open, sir.","Rich Kwas","Hi. Good morning.","Alex Molinaroli","Hi, Richard.","Bruce McDonald","Good morning.","Rich Kwas","Alex, I wanted to touch base on your comment about backlog. So GWS wasn't included in backlog, and resi and the light commercial stuff. And you're implying that backlog is going to be less relevant. But if I look at the business as a whole, GWS wasn't part of it. So why is backlog less relevant going forward here? I understand the ADT piece. That's now in the business. That's not part of backlog. But it just seems like from an institutional standpoint, your mix hasn't changed all that much. So it still should be pretty relevant. So I just wanted to get some additional color from you on that.","Alex Molinaroli","Yeah. I guess what I would say is first off, as I thought about GWS, I never really thought about it in the context of being part of the BE and the construction projects. What I mean by that is that the way that we're going to market, the way that we're selling our products, whether it be ADTI, whether it be our Hitachi products, whether it be our strengthening of the other products that go through distribution not only in North America but around the world, we've gone through a place where 75% of our business used to be backlog ex, not including GWS. Just separate GWS out. Now it's something that's around 50% or less and probably continuing to be less and less.","And so what I just wanted to say is that over time, we're going to have to make sure that we don't - that we continue to give you the information that you want to see around our projects and our projects business moving forward. But our projects business moving forward will continue to be important, but it won't be the dominant part of our business in the future. And so that's really what the comment means. In fact, you can see our ongoing sales have continued to increase adjusted for FX, and our backlog has been under pressure. And so I'm just pointing out that that's becoming more and more disconnected. That's it.","Rich Kwas","Okay. So is that more kind of differences in how you've gone to market here in the past year or so with new opportunities and what not?","Alex Molinaroli","Absolutely. I think it speaks to when we talk about having multiple channels, multiple ways to getting to the market and serving the market more broadly than just the complex market and becoming much more of a product company. I think all of these things, this whole conversation is really an outcome or an attribute of how we're going to go to market and what kind of products we're going to sell. We'll become more and more talking about our product sales and less and less pivoting on the contracting part of our business. That's all.","Rich Kwas","Okay. And then [indiscernible]","Alex Molinaroli","Not that we're restricting the [indiscernible].","Bruce McDonald","We're not getting rid of it. I don't want to go over it. I'm just saying the mix is changing. That's all.","Rich Kwas","Okay. And then just broadly speaking on M&A, there's been some speculation around the business that would fit the power solutions here recently and you talked about trying to expand your scale in the midmarket light commercial residential, et cetera. How are you thinking about this right now with the transactions? There's still work to do with some transactions but how are you thinking about the landscape right now and where you see capital deployment going here within the next year or so?","Alex Molinaroli","Great question. So we're going to talk about - this is a good pivot to talk about our December analyst day. We're going to have, you know, all of these conversations are going to be in real detail because one of the things you should expect from us is that I don't think we've done a great job. I do think our capital allocation strategy has become much more robust in the last couple of years but I think philosophically we need to talk more about that. We'll do that in December. How are we going to make these decisions? What process and insight analytics and what metrics are we going to use? Not only what parts of our business need to be levered because they have strength as it relates to adding geography and technologies but also where we have gaps and how we would do that and what kind of metrics we'd be?","Because I've gotten a lot of feedback from individuals I'm sure, you also, to make sure that we continue with a disciplined capital allocation strategy and we'll talk about that in December. So I think that you should keep that in mind understanding that we know that we need to add capabilities and take advantage of some of our portfolio to make it stronger. We also have realized that we need to make responsible capital allocation choices. More in December.","Rich Kwas","Okay. Thank you.","Alex Molinaroli","Thanks, Richard. We have time for one more, operator.","Operator","Okay, speakers. Our next question is from Ryan Brinkman. Your line is now open, sir.","Sumit Agarwal","Hi. This is Sumit for Ryan. Thanks for squeezing us in. I just want to go back to the sleeping margins. You've seen a good increase in the margins. I'm just curious where are you on the restructuring savings and should we be expecting that margin improvement to be sustainable or are the margins going to flatten out going in FY 2016?","Bruce McDonald","Yeah. It's Bruce here. I think it would be normal for us here in December. We'll give our margin expectations by business for all three of our businesses in December. So that's - and sort of hold off on that.","Sumit Agarwal","Okay. Can you just share your thoughts on where you are on the restructuring process in terms of the getting savings there?","Bruce McDonald","Restructuring for the company?","Alex Molinaroli","For seating.","Sumit Agarwal","For the seating. Yeah.","Bruce McDonald","Yeah. Well it plays right into the margins so I think we'll just leave that until the December meeting.","Sumit Agarwal","That's fine and just a follow-up. Thanks for your comments on the China market regarding automotive. Just curious, again, if you're seeing any delay in new programs or new launches coming to the market because of the slow down or is that really something that's not playing out at all?","Alex Molinaroli","I think I would say not so much on any launches at this point in time but I do think there are a couple of OEs that are rethinking or possibly going to defer some capacity increases.","Sumit Agarwal","Okay. Great. Thanks for taking our questions. Thank you.","Alex Molinaroli","Thanks very much.","Bruce McDonald","Thank you.","Glen Ponczak","So thanks everybody. Couple closing comments, Alex?","Alex Molinaroli","Yeah. Just a couple. I mean, first, it's become an enjoyable broken record to thank our employees for everything that they've accomplish over the last quarter and now you got the opportunity to thank them for what we've accomplished over the last year. It's quite outstanding. I certainly don't want to leave anyone out when I think about whatever our employees accomplished in each one of our businesses. They performed extremely well in each one of our geographies depending on what they've faced. They face with different challenges and opportunities and I think we've got opportunities. We've exploited them and I think where we had challenges we went over to mitigate those challenges.","And then if you look at our corporate teams and our teams that are supporting our portfolio transformation, not much can be said except I think each one of these transactions and each one of the things that we've accomplished I feel absolutely proud of what we've been able to make happen, not only from the standpoint of the time that it took to do it but the outcomes. We hopefully get to see everyone in New York in December. I think it's going to be an important meeting, one of the most important meetings we've ever had in New York because we're going to talk about the remaining Johnson Controls and our strategy moving forward. So we'll bring more and more clarity around that. We're going to give you details around the automotive spin, which I think there is a need for everyone to understand that so it can help you put the right values down in your models as you move forward.","And once again I just want to thank you for your interest and hope you have a great day. Take care.","Operator","Thank you. And that concludes today's conference.

Then followed by Bruce McDonald, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, who will go through a more detailed business review and -- of the business results. That will be followed with questions and answers, and we will end the call at the top of the hour. And with that, I'll turn it over to Steve.","Stephen A. Roell","Okay. Thank you, Glen, and good morning. First of all, for those of you that are on the East Coast, that are joining us on the call or listening to this on a replay, we hope that you and your families are safe and that life gets back to normal as soon as possible.","We considered postponing this call, but based on our other conflicts and the fact that we thought we could get a lot of information out to you this morning, we opted to continue and go through the call with earnings.","Well let's start about -- with fiscal 2012. It proved to be a very challenging year. And while we achieved record sales and earnings, we were not able to reach the levels of performance that we had set for ourselves, nor that we had communicated to our shareholders coming into the year. In the last 2 weeks, I'm sure you've had an opportunity to listen to a variety of earnings reports and most of those are focused on the deteriorating business climate and the uncertainties that lie ahead. I want to spend just a few minutes to recap 2012 and in doing so, provide some context for our performance or our outlook for fiscal 2013. My comments are not intended to be an excuse for our performance. We have a history of overcoming market challenges, and we're disappointed we were not able to do so this year.","Let's start with the global automotive production industry, what took place. We benefited from the stronger-than-expected North American auto build and the continued strength of the Asian markets. By contrast, as I'm sure you're all well aware, the European auto build continued to weaken and particularly hit us hard in the second half of the fiscal year. In terms of our Building Efficiency segment, coming into the year with higher backlogs and industry projections from both Global Insight and Dodge that forecasted a recovery of -- in the global markets, we expected our nonresidential segments would provide a good basis for growth. Unfortunately, the domestic institutional markets, which we've talked about in the past, those are the education, health care and public sectors, in terms of the market, they all declined over 15% in our fiscal '12. We did gain share, but we did not foresee the magnitude of the weakness in those markets. Then, we have one, if not the mild -- one of if not the mildest winter in our history, depressing battery retail activity, in our shipments to our aftermarket customers. On a positive note, we did continue to see good growth in our China markets for both Automotive and the Building segments.","So beyond the external factors, we did struggle all year to improve our operational performance in our global Metal and Mechanism business. We have the work streams and improvement areas identified, and I described those to you in detail in last quarter's call. We certainly underestimated the time it would take to achieve the benefits associated with those action plans. On a positive note, when the building markets did show signs of not recovering early in our fiscal year, the business did take the necessary actions to preserve margin improvements that we had targeted coming into the year, and I believe that you saw those significant ROS numbers in the last 2 quarters.","Turning to the numbers themselves. Sales totaled $42 billion, up from $40.8 billion last year. If we exclude FX, that's an increase of roughly 6%. Segment income was $2.6 billion, and those of you that can view the slides, I'd like to direct your attention to the right side. Our Building Efficiency ROS was up 70 basis points year-over-year, with a strong second half showing. Power Solutions overcame the disruptions in China, the lower volumes, the higher core cost to improve margins by 140 basis points, due to its vertical integration investments, its AGM volumes and the continuing general cost control. So those 2 businesses exceeded the margin targets that we communicated at the beginning of our last fiscal year, despite some of these challenges that we faced. Automotive Experience margins were lower due to the operating issues in Europe and the depressed conditions in that market. Our EPS of $2.59 per share was 5% higher than the $2.46 for last year.","So we do have some comments for you regarding 2013. Our Analyst Day is scheduled for December 19 in New York. At that session, we're going to provide you with our detailed guidance for the year. And each of the Presidents will provide with their outlook and longer-term strategies. We do expect that the challenging macro environment will persist. The global automotive market outlook is mixed right now. North America's expected to continue to grow, but at a slower rate than in 2012. I'm probably a little bit more up -- bullish than most in, regarding China, but we're planning on slower growth in that market as well. And in Europe, we see double-digit declines in the industry build. There's not much evidence of a recovery in the global construction market, so we're assuming the markets continue to be sluggish. We ended the year with a record backlog, but our pipeline activity is mixed and the sale cycles appear to be extending. The European economy will provide challenges across all of our businesses in 2013, while in Asia, we expect slower growth, but we still see good growth, projecting that the weather patterns of the last year do not repeat, and that there will be a moderate improvement in North American aftermarket battery sales.","Specific to Johnson Controls, we anticipate continued margin expansion across all of our businesses. We have some headwind with an increase in our effective tax rate, which Bruce is going highlight for you, that essentially we're going to be increasing our effective tax rate to 20% as our -- going to be our guidance to you. We'll benefit from the restructuring activities and the associated savings that were announced last week in the improvements in our Metals and Interiors operations.","Our customers are aware of a change that we've made in our Automotives organization, but effective October 1, we separated the Seating and Interiors and Electronics businesses. Now internally, we really did that, probably starting back in the March -- excuse me, in the May through June time frame. The reasons we did that was pretty fundamental, and that is that, if you look at those businesses, the business models, the capital intensity, the manufacturing footprint requirements are very, very different. And we also wanted to bring more full distribution [ph] to those segments. Beda Bolzenius will continue to lead the Seating business, which includes the component activities of metal trim and foam. Will Jackson will continue to lead our efforts of Pricing -- in Pricing, Business Transformation and Innovation. He's assumed the responsibility, as well, for Interiors and Electronics. Both Bill and Beda will present their strategies at the New York Analyst Meeting in December. And then from a reporting standpoint, there will be more segmentations on our filing starting in the first quarter. We'll be breaking out our business essentially into Seating, Interiors and Electronics, and going away from the geographic breakdown that we've historically provided to you.","Finally, I guess what I want to stress in this slide is that we will -- that we continue to make investments to support our strategic plans. Our strategies are very much intact regarding the emerging markets, our innovation strategies, our advanced battery technology, expanding our Controls offerings.","And then, sort of ironic, now we're going to switch back and talk about Q -- the quarter just ended. In our fourth fiscal quarter, the sales of $10.4 billion were slightly higher than last year when adjusted for FX. Our segment income of $726 million was 2% less than last year, while net income was comparable to a year ago's quarter. EPS of $0.77 was slightly higher than the $0.76 of last year, and in line with the guidance we provided to you back in July. Now we're going to turn it over to Bruce, who's going to review the segment information for the quarter, and some of our thoughts regarding 2013. Bruce?","R. Bruce McDonald","Okay, thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Before I get into the sort of detailed business results, I just want to provide a little bit more color on some of the nonoperational items, which we booked in the quarter, which would -- which netted to a charge of $0.78. So there was really 3 items. One was the $245 million restructuring charge. The second was a noncash, mark-to-market pension and retiree medical charge, both of those items that we've sort of previously highlighted in the Street in a filing last week. Then we had a nontax charge of $35 million related to the restructuring of our Power Solutions facility in Shanghai. As -- I'll provide a little bit more commentary on some of those items later on when I get to the financial section here, but as I talk through the business results, I'm going to exclude the impact of these items and items of a similar nature that impacted our 2011 comparable quarter here.","So just turning to Slide 8 for Building Efficiency. From a financial perspective, Building Efficiency delivered a very solid quarter here, especially when you consider the state of the markets. If you look at the sales, they were down about 7% to $3.8 billion. If we back out the impact of foreign exchange, it's about a 4% reduction. And we feel good about that, given the headwinds that we saw in pretty much all of our markets. On a geographic basis, we saw good revenue growth in Asia where our businesses were up 7%. GWS was up 2%, though when you look at the rest of our businesses, they were down more than the -- these 2 segments were out delivering a net reduction overall. If you look at the North American market in particular, it was down in aggregate about 8%, really driven by softness in discretionary service work in our Solutions business that has the most exposure to the institutional markets, as Steve referred to in his comments.","In terms of Residential, I think we noted in our press release, the Residential revenues were up about 9% and unit shipments were up about 8%. On terms of our backlog, you can see we're up about 3% to a record level of $5.2 billion. If I turn into our orders for the quarter, they were actually down 10%. And if you take out foreign exchange, orders were down 8%. If you look at the orders on a geographic basis, kind of a mixed bag here. Middle East was up 78%. That's a really choppy number that's impacted by the timing of large orders. So we can see that number really fly around significantly, up or significantly down, depending on the timing of big contract awards. In Asia, in aggregate, our orders were down 1%. In North America, our orders were down 13%. And if you sort of look at the segmentation within North America, our Systems business was down 5%; our Service business was down 7%; and our Solutions orders, the Energy Solutions orders were actually down 30% in the quarter. And then just rounding things off in Europe, we're down 22% and 26% in Latin America. In terms of our segment income, great performance here, we're at $327 million, excluding items, it's up 15%. Steve commented on the 160 basis points of margin expansion that we saw in the quarter of 8.6%. I would say that was primarily attributable to improvements in our service business, where our margins -- where our profitability is up 62% and in our North American systems business, where profitability is at 22%. We also saw good improvement in our Global Workplace Solutions business, though these were somewhat offset by a deterioration in Europe and the Middle East.","If you really look at the underlying drivers of our profitability improvement, it's really attributable to improved labor utilization. We're starting to get the payback of some of the technology investments that we've made in our North America Service business. And clearly, our restructuring and cost reduction initiatives are paying dividends for us.","Turning to Automotive Experience. I guess I would say our results for the quarter were a disappointment and came in a little bit lower than we had expected. Really, the main issue for us in the quarter was lower-than-anticipated commercial recoveries. If you look at our sales, we're up about 3%. If you exclude foreign exchange, in North America, sales were up 13% versus the market of up 15% in Europe, sales are down 5%, versus the industry of down 3%. You can see in China, we had very strong performance there where we continue to gain share with new joint ventures. Our sales were up 21% to $1.3 billion. And that would compare against the estimated Chinese passenger car production that was up 8% in the quarter. So a good, strong share growth in China again.","If you look at our segment income for the quarter x items, it was down 34% to $159 million. We saw good improvement in both Europe -- sorry, in both North America, and -- which was up 57%, Asia, which was up 18%, though the improvements that we saw here really offset by losses in our European business. The real drivers for our European performance would really be around the lower production levels that I talked about before, the deterioration in our South American operations and commercial recoveries, that's really where it hit us here, in the European side of the business. Overall, you can see our margins in Automotive Experience were 3.2%, or about 150 basis points lower than last year.","Geographically, if you look at our margins, North America was at 6%, which is up significantly from 4.3% last year. Asia, it was 14% -- 14.6%, up 200 basis points year-over-year. And Europe, we ended the -- we finished the quarter here with a loss of 3.1%, which is down from an income level of 2.9% in the corresponding quarter. If we look at Europe from a full year perspective, our ROS was a little bit worse than we kind of -- were anticipating here, we actually had a full year loss of about $48 million, and we had hoped to come in around the break-even level.","Turning to Power Solutions. Our sales, our reported sales were flat. If you sort of adjust for foreign exchange and the impact of lower lead pass-through sales, our underlying sales were up 8%. If you look at unit shipments, as we know it on the slide here, up 4%, split evenly between the aftermarket and the OE. We continue to see soft demand in the North American aftermarket. If you just look at the North American aftermarket volumes, they were up about 0.3% in the quarter. So we're not seeing the recovery in the volumes that we had in -- that we think should be coming through to us.","In terms of segment income, up 11% to $240 million. Results were favorably impacted by good operational performance, the benefits associated with increased level of in-house lead recycling and then some the of the pricing actions that we took earlier in the year. If you look at the results for the quarter, however, we -- they are partially offset -- the benefits were partially offset by higher lead core acquisition costs, as we are building our feedstock inventory for a Florence, South Carolina facility. Those costs were starting to trend lower, but we do expect those to be a headwind for us as we go into the first quarter of fiscal 2013.","Before I get into the financials, maybe just a brief comment on the pension and retiree medical accounting change that we adopted this quarter. Because this is a change of accounting methodology, we -- we're required, under U.S. GAAP, to restate all historic periods in a consistent manner. So we've done that. If you look at the -- all the information that we've put in our press release, in our -- in the financials that we put out here, you'll see those numbers in both periods. So we've revised our prior year's statement presentation. I guess I'd comment, really on -- there's 2 significant impacts that this change is going to have on us on a go-forward basis. The first would be, that in every year, in the fourth quarter, the mark-to-market, our pension and retiree medical liabilities. And as you'll see in the footnotes to our financial statements in each of 2011 and '12, we recorded significant charges, which were largely associated with the rapid decline in global interest rates. Secondly, if you look at our annual pension expense, we'll no longer be amortizing historic losses, and we've just put a slide in here to really highlight what the impact is on this year and last year's fourth quarter and full year earnings per share pre and post this charge. The other comment I would make for any of our employees that are listening, is this is just an accounting change, it has no impact, whatsoever, on the funding or the benefit levels that we continue to provide under these programs.","Turning then to the financials on to Slide 12, just a bit more color than Steve talked about in his summary comments. But overall, revenues declined by 4%. If we back out foreign exchange, it's actually up 1%, and the real driver there would be the Euro. You can see that for the quarter of this year, the Euro rate was $1.25 versus $1.41 in the corresponding period last year. Gross profit was down 50 basis points, about a level that's similar to where we were in Q3. We saw the benefit of slightly higher revenue in some of our cost reduction initiatives, offset by both higher input costs in the Power Solutions business and the costs associated with some of our launch difficulties in Automotive Experience.","On the other hand, if you look at SG&A as a percentage of sales, we decreased by 60 basis points to 9.3% of sales. This is the year-over-year decrease here is really our -- it reflects our focus on rightsizing our cost structure in light of the current market realities. If you really look at the SG&A reduction by business, the biggest area of improvement is clearly in Building Efficiency, where we're seeing the benefit of some of the recent restructuring initiatives. We're continuing -- even though our SG&A levels are declining here, we are continuing to increase our investments in some areas that are going to deliver long-term growth. And those would be our innovation initiatives, the emerging market infrastructure and other key new business development programs. In terms of equity income, you'll see we're actually down slightly, but I guess I would just remind people listening that the 2011 numbers were particularly strong in the quarter last year. Our equity earnings were up 32%. So it's -- our business is continuing to operate at a strong level. The year-over-year reduction really would be attributable to higher investments that we're making in some of the new joint ventures in our Automotive business in China.","If you look at our segment margins, up 10 basis points to 7%, versus 6.9% last year.","Turning to Slide 13. If you just look at the items below segment income, financing charges of $62 million were up 12% versus prior year. The higher financing costs are really associated with elevated borrowing levels, associated with our acquisitions in 2011 and the increase in our capital investment that we had in 2012. In terms of our underlying tax rate for the quarter, it was just over 16%, which was consistent with our third quarter rate, and a reduction of about 19% where we were last year. And that really, the only item that we have falling through the adjusted tax line here, is impacting the rate, is a different mix of geographic income, specifically lower earnings in Germany and the U.S. versus where we thought we'd be.","In terms of income from noncontrolling interest or formally minority interest, you'll see that charge is down. That's really reflecting the buyout of our minority partner in plastic that we did in Q3. That's worth about a $20 million annual benefit, or about $0.05 a quarter. And then lastly on diluted earnings per share, we came in at $0.77 or $0.01 higher than where we were last year.","Turning to Slide 14, I'll just make a few comments on our balance sheet. And if you look at the fourth quarter, we had a very strong growth, 35% in terms of our cash flow generated by operations, nearly $800 million. You'll note on our cash flow statements that we've included in our press release that we've revised our presentation to provide a little bit better visibility on our pension funding, and -- which was previously sort of massed within our working capital sections. So we've clarified that on our statement, and you can see that for the full year, our pension and retiree medical contributions were about $414 million. If you look at the level of contributions that we made with our -- in our plans this year, combined with strong asset performance and just to put that into context, our U.S. plan returns this year, we're just a shade over 20%. Unfortunately, these were almost -- these were completely offset by the reduction that we had to take in our discount rates. So our discount rate, on a global basis, dropped by about 110 basis points, which leaves us with our plans at about 81% funded, or a net unfunded pension liability of about $1.2 billion.","In terms of working capital performance, we continue to focus on -- that's an off-scenario focus on us, and I'm pleased to say that if you look at our full year performance, we really look at trade working capital, which is inventory payables and receivables. And if you look at those 3 items in particular, our trade working capital as a percentage of sales fell to down -- by 10 basis points to 6.7%. On the other hand, you'll see it on a -- from a non-trade perspective, we did have a use of working capital in the year. And that really is higher levels of income, tax and the VAT receivables, particularly outside the U.S. Those on a year-over-year basis grew by about $320 million, and that just reflects it's just taking longer to get our tax returns processed and our VAT receivables out to some of the financially distressed sovereigns, so...","In terms of working capital investment for the first time in several quarters, we saw a year-over-year decline, so we're down about 6% this quarter to $398 million. If you look at our full year capital investment, we're at $1.8 billion. And as we've talked about before, for 2013, we do see our CapEx levels trending down to the $1.4 billion to the $1.5 billion level. In terms of our balance sheet, we ended the year with a -- in a strong position. We repaid about $250 million of debt in the fourth quarter and we ended the year with debt-to-total capitalization of about 33%, which is up marginally from where we were at the end of last year.","On Page 15, I'll maybe just make a few comments on our restructuring activities. And as we recall, during our Q3 call, we did talk about the fact that we're going to take further charges here in the fourth quarter, so maybe I'll just provide a little bit more color on what we've done here. Just really putting our actions into context, we do remain concerned about the overall situation in Europe and the fact that many of Building Efficiency's markets aren't yet showing signs of improvement. And that's really what the -- what our restructuring charge is really seeking to address. We took a charge of $245 million, about 20% of that is noncash. If you look at where the actions are focused, it's really on -- it's rightsizing our European operations in both Automotive and Building Efficiency. In addition, we intend to discontinue lead-processing operations in our Shanghai Power Solutions facility, and we're looking to downsize some of our Building Efficiency operations in South America. Those would be the focus areas for the charge here. You can see that as on -- we've indicated on the slide, we expect to be significantly complete with this program by the end of 2014, and we're looking at net saving in 2013 of approximately $120 million as a result of these charges.","And now maybe to turn to Slide 16, and I'm -- I'll just finish up here in terms of some color, some additional color, on 2013 and our outlook here. And I guess, sort of as Steve mentioned in his remarks, I guess we'd sort of characterize the macroeconomic environment as challenging. Our first half, we see as being particularly so. We really don't anticipate what we're going to see a tickup in business confidence, which really impacts our Building Efficiency order flow to improve and -- especially here in North America until we see some resolution to the U.S. fiscal cliff. In terms of the European automotive market, we're planning on the basis of that market being down 10%. And at that level, we'd be at nearly a 20-year low in terms of vehicle production in that geography.","In terms of Latin America and Asia, we do expect to see continued growth there, but it's going to be at lower levels than we've experienced over the last few years. And I guess, as we indicated earlier, we will have a more detailed commentary on our outlook here at our Analyst Meeting on December 19. But from a headline perspective, what we're sort of flagging here is that we see 2013 earnings as being flat to up slightly, with our first half EPS being down significantly. A couple of the headwinds, or a few of have the headwinds that we face in the first half would be, we do expect to see lower revenues and that's really going to be as a result of both lower, declining orders that we're seeing in Building Efficiency, a challenged market in Europe. And just to sort of size Europe, for those on the call here, Europe represents just under 40% of our total revenue. We also have some currency headwinds that we're facing in the first quarter in particular, and we continue to experience an uncertain demand in the North American aftermarket.","We do have, and if you look at our restructuring charges, we do have, within our guidance here, approximately $0.08 to $0.10 of nonqualified restructuring-related costs, and we also have a higher effective tax rate at 20%, versus an average rate of 18% in 2013. We do expect to see some improvement in our European Automotive operations, though the benefits are going to be skewed towards the latter part of the year, really owing to the fact that we expect to see the volume weakness that I've referred to earlier. And then lastly, throughout the first and, to some extent, the second quarter, we will have slightly higher levels of core acquisition cost that are expected to be behind us by midway point in 2013.","And so with that, Glen, I'll sort of wrap up, and we'll open it up to Q&A.","Glen Ponczak","Corey, we're ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Brian Johnson of Barclays, you may ask your question.","Brian Arthur Johnson - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I -- two questions around the 2013 outlook. One is a little bit of housekeeping. The $0.08 to -- 2 things around the housekeeping. $0.08 to $0.10 EPS impact, is that spread through the year, or is that first half loaded?","R. Bruce McDonald","It's primarily first half, Brian.","Brian Arthur Johnson - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And does this guidance -- where does it bake in some of the pension accounting that you've been talking about?","R. Bruce McDonald","It's within there.","Brian Arthur Johnson - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And so is there a year-over-year pension impact?","R. Bruce McDonald","Yes, it would be -- well, if you look at the impact, the positive impact from the pensions, about $0.08 in 2012. It'll be less than that going into 2013, because we've -- in it -- we've got lower discount rates, and we have -- we're bringing down our planned return on assets as well. So it is a benefit of -- it's -- I'm not going to get into what specific number, as I don't have that with me, but it's less than $0.08.","Brian Arthur Johnson - Barclays Capital, Research Division","But not significant. I guess the real question then is, it sounds like you're being a little, I -- we think appropriately conservative on European production, fiscal first half. But really, what is the pace of the operational improvements, at what point can we separate the macro impact from what we were hoping to see in terms of some reengineering improvements? And just how is that likely to proceed during the year? Because if I look at the first half, it seems like you're saying softer B revenues, certainly North America looks better. So is it, I guess, A, is it the true that most of the weakness is coming from Europe in first half; and B, kind of how does that pace improve through the year?","R. Bruce McDonald","Yes, I mean, maybe to help you out there, I think if you look at our profitability challenges in what we report as Europe, I would really be -- it would be really be 3 things, okay? First of all would be, we've talked about South America. That's probably the smallest issue. That's a business where this year, we probably lost $40 million to $50 million, and I'd say, we expect to see that halved next year, okay? And that wouldn't be a first half, second half thing, I mean that's certain to -- we're on an improving trend line there. Second would be our Interiors business in Europe. And I guess I would tell you that whilst we do expect some improvement there, just the length of the time that it takes to address from our footprint, and when we'll see a bit of an improvement in our European automotive operations next year, but that's really going to be more of a 2014 step up. And then in terms of our Metals business, I mean this would be the one, and if you looked at Metals overall, we -- we've got, roughly, a 4% negative ROS in that business, and our goal is that by the end of the year, I want to exit the year with that business at a run rate of like a 2% to 3% ROS, close. So that's kind of what the improvement program that we have in place there drives to.","Stephen A. Roell","Brian, little bit more color to that last one, in terms of the sequencing of that, why it'll take place in the second half. Last call in, back in July, I talked about a couple of the work streams that we're focused on. One of them is operationally-based, one is purchasing-based. And so what we're doing is we're moving our Metals purchasing to the east, #1. And secondly, in our -- in terms of our operations where we're actually going and using some of the new processes that we inherited from Hammerstein on how we, as an example, how we merged the track, the 2 pieces. So we're changing processes, as Bruce mentioned, we're moving our -- moving footprints to Mexico, moving to Hungary, doing things in the U.K. So that's why those are going to build up momentum as we go through the year.","Brian Arthur Johnson - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And in terms of what you're assuming about customer pricing, put in context, Lear indicated its European seating businesses was about 3.5%, and obviously they don't have interiors and maybe not as much metals. But they didn't seem to report the same kind of pricing pressure that you had. Is that because the pricing is more on interiors? Or is it because the way you sequence customer recoveries between calendar third and fourth quarter?","Stephen A. Roell","Yes, that's interesting. I -- there's a couple of things, I guess. First of all, I would tell you, I think the customer recovery requests are getting stronger, getting higher, we'll start with that, okay? I think that claims processing is being extended, the way it has been, let's say, over the last 2 years. So you got 2 factors. You got 1 where, there's a request for more price down and that's difficult in some markets where markets are sluggish. The claims are taking -- that's part of our issue in the fourth quarter. We should have actually had better results with some of our claims processing and recovery from the -- the customers actually got delayed. We also did some things in our Q4, Brian, where we actually, with 1 global OE, we negotiated a settlement for not only '12 but all of '13 at the same time. That's the kind of environment that we find ourselves in. I think that there's tremendous pressure on the number of OEs in terms of profitability, and I guess it's not a -- I wouldn't distinguish between Seating and Interiors, and I wouldn't distinguish between Europe and North America. Most of these are being resolved on a global basis.","Operator","Chris Ceraso of Credit Suisse, you may ask your question.","Christopher J. Ceraso - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Have you thought about maybe exiting the Interior business? I know Lear did that years ago, and now your separating out the results between Seating and Interior. It just seems like that market is too crowded, there's a lot of material risk, and it's just tough to make money in that business. And most customers, correct me if I'm wrong, are less interested in sourcing the complete interior. So what's your latest thought on staying in that business?","Stephen A. Roell","We aren't separating it out because we want to dispose of it. I think it's clearly, we want to bring a new focus on it. We recognize its capital investment intensity is much different. And so we want to focus on the returns. We think there are ways to be profitable in this business. There are players in interiors who are. And we -- Chris, I guess to your comment, I would concur with you that complete Interiors is not something right now that the customers are looking at. But it's an important market for us, in terms of our technology, it's important for us in terms of how we partner around the world with some of our customers. So we are committed to it, and we believe that we can achieve reasonable returns or we find ways to exit.","R. Bruce McDonald","Yes, Chris, maybe just to help you out, if you actually look at our -- the returns in the interior business, we -- it's a very profitable business for us, both in China and North America. Our real issue's in Europe, specifically. And I think it is fair to say that there are some product areas within our current portfolio that we're looking at, with a view to possibly getting out of if we can't improve the pricing. But our challenge in Interior's really European-centric, not global.","Christopher J. Ceraso - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then, within the rough guidance for '13, have you factored in the expected losses from your acquisition of A123, and how much do you expect that business to lose in 2013?","Stephen A. Roell","No, we've not. And it's a little premature to be talking about A123. There's still a lot of things that have to take place and occur in that business, so no, there's no fact- -- we've not factored anything relative to that transaction in 2013, yes.","Christopher J. Ceraso - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just a big picture, like 1\/2 or 1\/3 or whatever, however you want to frame it, can you just give us an idea of how much of the better second half '13 performance do you think is macro, i.e. recovery in orders and building or autos, versus how much is company-specific self-help restructuring?","Stephen A. Roell","Let me frame it a different way, if I could, Chris, okay? If I look at some of the internal things we can do, let's think about the restructuring savings that we identified for you, that's internal. The improvement in our Metals operations, that's internal. The avoidance to some of the cost we incurred last year, relative to the China disruption, that's internal. On top of that, we really don't have any headwinds to speak of in launch cost in 2013, in engineering recovery. Commodities, while they're going to be higher, is not a big issue. So if I look at it, we can point to a lot of things that are within our control that we can -- that I would say are positive. On the negative side, it's a macro environment. And that's really where our uncertainty regarding the European build, being concerned about maybe the North American, certain of the North American and global construction markets. So I would say macro issues are what's causing us to be concerned. Our internal -- the things we can control internally, we feel very good about.","R. Bruce McDonald","I would add to that, I think, it's -- we're not, I think, going over what you're asking about, getting to the bottom of here, Chris, is we are not forecasting that in the second half of the year, the economy is going to improve, and that's going to pick up. I think, for us, it really isn't going to be a factor in Automotive, and it potentially could be a benefit for us in Building Efficiency. But we'll see that, the signs of that coming through our pipeline and order activity. And right now, we don't see any reason to believe it's going to get better in the second half.","Operator","Joseph Spak of RBC Capital Markets, you may ask your question.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Sorry if you -- I did sort of lose connection for a little bit, but just on the pace of margin of improvement in Europe. I mean, is it possible that we can get to a breakeven point by the end of 2013, in Europe?","R. Bruce McDonald","Well, yes, I would say so. I think -- we'll -- I think when we have our Analyst Meeting in December, I'm going to kind of hold off on that one. I think we'll -- we would -- I mean, clearly, we -- we're going to provide a lot more detail around the cadence of our operational improvement and what we're doing to really address our Metals challenges. And when Bill Jackson is presenting interiors, I mean, clearly, the turnaround in Europe will be front and center there. So I don't expect -- I mean, if you sort of look at our overall European business today, like I said, it's at a 0.5% loss for the full year, and we don't -- we aren't forecasting that we're going to exit next year in a loss-making position.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then can you just remind us, you're moving to seating interiors and electronics. Are -- is that fairly evenly split among the geographies? Or is -- it sounds like maybe Europe's a little bit overexposed to interiors and electronics?","R. Bruce McDonald","I actually don't know the answer to that off the top of my head. I think what we will do, though, is we won't wait until January to provide some -- we're going to free and kind of give out to the Street some information, like saying, Here's this year's numbers, and here's the sort of restated numbers on a comparable segment basis. We'll get that out earlier to help people do their modeling.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then finally, with just the restructuring in Europe and Auto. I mean, it sounds like it -- most of the restructuring you guys have announced thus far is probably in interiors. Is there more that can be done on the seating side, or do you need to sort of wait to see how automaker capacity shakes out there?","R. Bruce McDonald","Well, I've -- it isn't all in Interiors. I guess what I -- what would probably be accurate to say is, if you looked at facilities that were closing, there's not really a lot of them in right at this point in time. It's more a question of new volumes are going down, so we have to take our headcount levels down.","Operator","Matt Stover of Guggenheim, you may ask your question.","Matthew T. Stover - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","Couple of questions. First, you may have gone over this in the commentaries, so I apologize if you -- if we're going over trod land, but if we look at the change in the weakness in the backlogs in the Building Efficiency business in North America, do you think that this would change meaningfully after some sort of resolution with regards to election, the fiscal cliff, or does this portend sort of weakness throughout '13 and into '14? And I have a follow-up question.","Stephen A. Roell","Well, it's interesting, we look at the backlog, just to go back to what Chris talked about. The increase we see in the backlog, is in Asia. But if I look at, Matt, if I look at the institutional market, okay, and I'll try to address your fiscal cliff comment, if I look at where demand is held up or it hasn't, orders in the quarter, orders for the year, in pipeline, the softness that we've seen in the institutional markets, patterns that in both the educational, the K-12 and higher ed and health care. Where our data is vastly different than the market, is we continue to see reasonable growth in state and local government, and good growth in federal. So we have not seen a fall-out yet on the federal side of the marketplace. That's the best way I can describe it to you. I think that, that's been our history here for a couple of years, where the government side of the businesses has held up very well, and provide a good growth opportunity.","Matthew T. Stover - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","I mean, how about in the overall market? Or do you get a sense of folks are withholding in terms of next year, just kind of concerned about that one?","Stephen A. Roell","I don't think it's the fiscal cliff, I think it's other things, okay? I think there's just a great deal of uncertainty, and there's not a lot of demand. I mean, there's not a lot of growth in the underlying economy. There's a lot of cash on the balance sheets. There's a lot of need for them to look at ways to reduce their cost, and energy efficiency's a good one. So I think that -- it's mixed. Let me give you a few more tidbits here. If -- when we talk about the pipeline, some of the areas that we have seen picked up recently is some of the solutions activity, bidding activity. And that's the one that Bruce described, where we saw the orders off so far in the fourth quarter, but activity's trying to pick up again. We just talked to our Asian management yesterday in China, and they're actually seeing some, I wouldn't say a strong demand, but they feel there's good demand out there in China yet. The area that we probably get the best sense for the economy is what we call our project work within our Service business. Our truck base is okay, Matt. We still grew truck base. But the service work that we get associated with that, that salesforce, is what -- where we probably get a sense where people are holding back. They're not doing small projects. Those are [indiscernible] of the projects.","Matthew T. Stover - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then the other question is on the automotive side, the commercial recovery. Can you give us a sense of what the value of that impact was for the fourth quarter? And is that a question of the recovery gets pushed out in the first quarter or is just the recovery gone?","Stephen A. Roell","Our recovery's not gone, but it get pushed out, whether it's the first quarter, but then -- it's not what we're going to see, a sudden recovery in the first fiscal quarter. I said that those are things are just getting pushed out in general. And so things we would've recovered in the fourth quarter, probably push in the first, first gets pushed to the second. So I think it's just a function that the -- and this is consistent with -- when you listen to other calls from the auto suppliers. There just has been a tendency to see commercial claims push. And just a function of the economy, I think. And they're...","Matthew T. Stover - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","No, I understand that. And that's just sort of typically what happens, but I'm trying to describe that with the outlook for the first and second quarter given the deltas in production rates. Because holding the volume constant, if you're delaying recoveries that would've occurred in fiscal Q4 for you folks into the first quarter of next year, and then comparing and contrasting that to significantly down versus last year. I'm just trying to balance it.","R. Bruce McDonald","I guess Matt, keep in mind, I would say our first quarter, which is calendar Q4, is not and never has been a very good in terms of commercial claims, because our -- mostly our customers are year-end. So most of the time, we don't do very well. So there's little to no chance that some things that maybe we thought we were going to recover in this quarter, that we'll get them in Q -- in our first quarter.","Stephen A. Roell","It looks like that.","Operator","Rich Kwas of Wells Fargo, you may ask your question.","Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Building Efficiency, Steve. So last year, you took some restructuring activity, and I guess you cut some SG&A out earlier in the calendar year. You got some benefit from that. How are you thinking about margins for Building Efficiency? And I understand you're going to be doing a lot more detail in December, but how should we think about the benefits you've accrued so far from some of the actions you took earlier in the year?","Stephen A. Roell","Well, 2 things. First of all, some of the actions we took in the first half of the year will still have benefits and provide year-over-year -- just by themselves, year-over-year benefit in the Q1 and Q2 of our fiscal year. I think our focus right now, with Dave and the team, is primarily trying to protect our continued margin expansion by looking at contingency efforts in case volumes do soften further. So that's really where our focus is right now. But there -- definitely we expect margin expansion to continue to be in fiscal 2013.","Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And that's even kind of considering that's a tougher quarter environment right now?","Stephen A. Roell","That's correct.","Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then on the restructuring, the $120 million in savings, Bruce, what's the risk you don't get that? I assume that's not a run rate, that's an actual number for the full year, but what's the risk that the, that to your payback gets extended a bit, given everything going on in Europe right now?","R. Bruce McDonald","Well, keep in mind, Rich, I said that's net, right? So I -- actually, we have about $0.08 to $0.10 of nonqualifying, we think costs that we can accrue, like moving tools and inventory banks, and those types of costs that are headwind for us, it's in the first half of the year in particular. So if you take the gross, the gross savings, it's a much stronger pace of payback. I guess, I would -- if I was looking at the items that we have there, we got a pretty good track record of delivering on the savings. There's nothing -- I would tell you that the riskier things in the past have tended to be where we're closing some plant and moving it into a brand new location, and there's very little, if any, of that in there. So I think it is, it's just standard, sort of headcount-related reductions to move volumes. It's the Power Solutions facility in China that's been idle for some time, and we're paying the workers. So that cost goes away. I think it's very low risk.","Stephen A. Roell","We've got great oversight. We've got people who report to Bruce who are dedicated to tracking this. And it's -- from that standpoint, I think the surety of it and our ability to view it, what's transpiring, and if there are any issues, we know them early. I think it's pretty good, Rich.","Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then one last one. What was the dollar number in terms of the cost headwind for the quarters this quarter?","R. Bruce McDonald","Rich, I don't have that figure off the top of my head, but I guess, I could -- would tell you it's sort of in that -- as we go into this current quarter, it's probably in the $15 million to $20 million range. So it's trending down, it was like, I think we said $40 million in Q3. So it's somewhere in between there.","Operator","Colin Langan of UBS, you may ask your question.","Colin Langan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Could you just remind us of the timing difference between, it seems like Building Efficiency's sales are down, but the backlog is up and the orders are down. So with the backlog and orders are kind of a -- what kind of time frame lead are they indicative of?","R. Bruce McDonald","Yes, I think, if you look at our backlog, it typically would flow through, and it sort of would depend. In the equipment side, it's shorter, 9 to, say, 9 months on average. On the controls side, it's -- it could be 15 or 18 months, would sort of be typical. I think one of the reasons, Colin, you can't sort of put the 3 of them together is there is some of our business that doesn't go through the backlog. And that would be like our truck-based Service business. It would be the Residential business, so those...","Stephen A. Roell","GWS.","R. Bruce McDonald","GWS. So those aren't flowing through the -- that sort of standard model that you're referring to.","Colin Langan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. So but from the backlog, where you should normally see 9 months out, some benefit is normal?","R. Bruce McDonald","Yes. But I think the best -- I mean, if you want to look at, sort of forward visibility, I'd say the best thing to focus on is the orders, because if we, if our order intake, like we said in the quarter, is down 10%, it's just -- and -- or turns negative, it's just a matter of time until our backlog's going to turn negative. And backing it up, we really talk about our pipeline, our quoting activity, and that -- that will be the first thing that we see start to pick up, we're hoping, as Steve indicated, we are seeing some signs of recovery there. But the time it's taking to, quote, \"to win,\" is being extended right now. And I would say that, that is, just -- that it's a factor of there being a lot of uncertainty in the marketplace. People are being cautious before we decided to go ahead with some of our programs.","Colin Langan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And any color on -- you have Europe, you're expecting Europe to be down double digits. Is that more first half weighted? I mean, is that reflected in your view for the first half earnings being a lot worse? Or is that pretty much even throughout the year, a 10% decline?","R. Bruce McDonald","It's pretty much even, Colin. I mean, you may have seen there's a recent IHS, I think the last IHS numbers for Europe were better than that. But if you take our -- we're talking about our fiscal year. If you adjust for our fiscal year, we're right on top of IHS, so we expect to be down here in Q1 and down for the full year. And that's kind of been a change for us, up until about, really, this quarter. We've outperformed the market there, because the -- particularly because of our German customers have been strong, and were tend to be underrepresented at, in Fiat and French customers.","Operator","Ravi Shanker of Morgan Stanley, your line is open.","Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","If I can ask a follow-up on the guidance. Steve, you'd said that -- you delayed your Analyst Day because you said you wanted more clarity on macro and the fiscal cliff and elections and those kind of things. So and you've given us some preliminary guidance now. Have you gotten more visibility into 2013? Or is this kind of a level of guidance that you're pretty comfortable achieving, kind of, unless the macro gets significantly worse or something?","Stephen A. Roell","Yes, I think it has. I think, if you go back in time, you go back to July, we made this decision, we thought that there was, that the market was really starting to weaken, or that some of leading indicators that we had, and yet it wasn't being reflected that any forecast or projections or EPS changes, okay? I think if you look at this quarter, now we recently have some reality that set in, regarding just how difficult the environment is, not just in the U.S., but also the fact it's slowing and then also Europe. So I think that we do have more clarity. I think that we've seen order rates now for another 90 days. We've seen the opportunity to watch what's happening in the building markets, a better feel, certainly for what we think in Europe. So it did give us a lot more clarity. We still have analysts who haven't adjusted their forecasts since July. We're 90 days, 90 days-plus, and 40% of our analysts haven't really adjusted their numbers yet. So I think that we just wanted, really, for the analysts and the Street to get a better sense for the economic environment, the climate that we're really operating in. So I do think we have a much better discussion than we'll have now, given the economic realities that we see in the marketplace.","Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Got it. And also, can you help with a little more color on the segmentation change in Auto. I don't know why you're going away from the geographic split towards the business-wise split. And is that kind of how you're thinking about internally, also, that you're looking more individual businesses? And does that risk taking away some of the focus away from Europe, which clearly is the area you need to pay the most attention to right now?","R. Bruce McDonald","Yes, I'd say, I wouldn't read a lot into that, this change, Ravi. I mean, under the SEC guidance, we're required to represent segment data that reflects how we manage the company. And when we make a change to the way we manage the company, we have to go back and relook at our segments with our auditors. And so this is a change that we need to make. In no way will this impact our focus on Europe, and it's also -- we're also not going to go radio silent in terms of how our business is doing in a geographic basis either.","Stephen A. Roell","Yes, please realize that. I think going back to my comments, Ravi, the primary focus is the fact that these are much different businesses in the context of their capital intensity, the business models, the footprints, everything else. And for that reason, we just had to bring a better focus to that -- to the capital and returns on this business. And that's why we're doing it, and that's what we explained to all the customers. They understand. So we'll find a way to make sure that -- we're not trying, in any way -- to be transparent with our European results of that, that'll clearly be there, it'll be there in 2 ways. We'll talking about it within Seating, as is pertains to our Metals operation; and we'll be talking to it about Interiors, specifically, okay?","Glen Ponczak","Okay, thanks, everybody, for participating. Dave and I will be available to take phone calls for the balance of the day. And stay safe out there, for all, everyone on -- in the East Coast. Take care.","Operator","This concludes today's conference.

Your lines have been placed on listen-only until the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] This conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]","I will now turn the call over to Antonella Franzen, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Antonella Franzen","Good morning, and thank you for joining our conference call to discuss Johnson Controls fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2017 results. The press release and all related tables issued earlier this morning as well as the conference call slide presentation can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website at johnsoncontrols.com. With me today are Johnson Controls Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, George Oliver; and our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Brian Stief.","Before we begin, I would like to remind you that during the course of today\u2019s call, we will be providing certain forward-looking information. We ask that you review today\u2019s press release and read through the forward-looking cautionary informational statements that we\u2019ve included there.","In addition, we will use certain non-GAAP measures in our discussions, and we ask that you read through the sections of our press release that address the use of these items. In discussing our results during the call, references to adjusted EBITA and adjusted EBIT margins exclude transaction and integration costs as well as other special items. These metrics are non-GAAP measures and are reconciled in the schedule attached to our press release. All comparisons to the prior year are on a combined basis, which excludes the results of Adient and includes the results of Tyco, net of conforming accounting adjustments and recurring purchase accounting. GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to Johnson Controls ordinary shareholders was $0.93 for the quarter and included a net benefit of $0.06 related to special items. These special items primarily related to mark-to-market pension and postretirement gains and discrete tax items partially offset by restructuring, impairment and integration costs. Adjusting for these special items, non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.87 per share compared to $0.76 in the prior year quarter.","Now, let me turn the call over to George.","George Oliver","Thanks, Antonella, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on today\u2019s call. Let me begin with a look back at our first year as a combined company. And the message that I hope you walk away with is although our financial results came in at the low end of where we would have expected in fiscal 2017, we made significant progress on the integration of a historic merger with Johnson Controls. I\u2019m extremely proud of the work our teams around the globe have done and what we have accomplished throughout the year. We completed a major reorganization of our operating structure across the globe, most recently in North America. We made significant strides in aligning our cost structures, generating $300 million in incremental cost synergies and productivity savings, driving 90 basis points of margin expansion for the year.","Despite the substantial amount of integration taking place, we also maintained rigor around optimizing our portfolio and capital structure. We completed the spin-off of Adient and divested ADT South Africa and Scott Safety as well as several other small noncore assets. We redeployed the proceeds from those divestitures into paying down a substantial portion of the merger-related TSARL debt. Additionally, we pursued opportunistic share repurchase in an effort to offset the coming dilution related to the Scott Safety transaction, and we finished the year with approximately $650 million of share buybacks.","That said, as we have identified on the right side of Slide 5, there are areas in our performance where we need to improve as we move forward: accelerating organic growth in orders and Buildings, expanding gross margins in Buildings, improving free cash flow conversion and consistently delivering on our commitments.","If we turn to Slide 6, I\u2019ll tie those areas of improvement to the changes we have already implemented to enable us to put shareholder value creation at the forefront of everything we do. First, as you may have seen in a press release this morning, we announced a change in our General Counsel with the departure of Judy Reinsdorf. I\u2019ve worked with Judy for well over a decade. She was instrumental in my time as CEO of Tyco and has been a crucial voice throughout her transitional role for the past year here at Johnson Controls. I\u2019d like to sincerely thank Judy for her many years of service and wish her all the best. I\u2019d also like to take this opportunity to welcome John Donofrio to the team who\u2019s joining us from Mars Incorporated. With this and a few other recent appointments, our senior leadership team is coming together and will be held accountable for driving execution.","Beginning in fiscal 2018, we plan to change our compensation incentives to be more closely linked to our performance and aligned with shareholder expectations. Specifically, we plan to tie compensation incentives to the key performance areas that we are focused on: organic revenue growth, EBIT growth and free cash flow conversion. When it comes to accelerating organic sales and orders growth in the field businesses, tracking sales capacity and sales productivity metrics are essential. Growing the field businesses requires a strong and expanding sales force by business and by region with continued productivity. It sounds simple but demands intense focus and consistent monitoring by our business leaders, including myself.","With the combination of reorganization of the Buildings businesses, we have remixed the sales force and reinvested in areas of growth. For the full year, we were short of the increased capacity required to accelerate growth. However, in the fourth quarter, we enhanced the process and achieved net adds of 50 salespeople. As we move forward in our new structure, we are targeting 400 net sales adds in fiscal 2018, which will be core to accelerating orders in organic revenue growth. This investment is in response to a strong positive feedback from our customers with respect to how our technologies and solutions are helping our customers enhance their businesses. This will put a bit of pressure into the first half of the year as the new salespeople ramp up, but the increase in capacity will ultimately drive improvements in execution and higher growth. As we move through the course of fiscal 2018, we will keep you posted on our progress.","Additionally, not all revenue growth is created equal. And similar to how I operated at Tyco, we will be focused on profitable growth. This starts with going after the right projects, remaining disciplined on pricing to ensure that we are being paid for the value that we provide to our customers and rigorous project management down to driving change orders. With the installed base we create, it is critical that we continue to accelerate our service growth, which enhances our margin profile.","As we look at the underlying fundamentals of our backlog, there is some gross margin pressure we expect to see as the backlog turns in our North America field business. To put this in context, the size of backlog in our North America field business is $5.2 billion, and I would say we are entering the year with roughly 75 basis points of gross margin pressure. We have put in place a more strict approval process for large installation projects and are realigning the incentive compensation structure for the entire sales organization. We plan to weight sales incentives more towards gross margins and sales growth so that we can ensure our teams are targeting more profitable growth.","With more discipline on price, sales productivity, project management and service acceleration, we expect to drive both improved margins and increased profitability. When it comes to improving free cash flow conversion, we had an intense focus in the fourth quarter to ensure we met the expectations set. I, together with Brian, established a weekly meeting to drive the importance of this metric and closely monitored our free cash flow generation. Additionally, we are in the process of establishing a cash management office reallocating internal talent to solve some of our working capital challenges and focus solely on achieving the targets we have set out. While we saw improvement in our free cash flow generation in the fourth quarter, we know we have a lot more work to do to increase our cash flow conversion. As we move forward, we will also be more selective in our CapEx spending, focused on high return projects and reducing our reinvestment ratio.","In terms of capital allocation, you can expect us to remain disciplined when it comes to returning cash to shareholders with a near-term focus remaining on opportunistic share repurchases and overtime, a more balanced approach between accretive M&A and buybacks. We have leading market positions and are strongly positioned to win across our core businesses. That said, we will continue to look at the portfolio both within Power and Buildings, ensuring we are allocating resources in areas where we can generate the highest returns and divesting businesses that are noncore. ","With all of these key business fundamentals I have discussed, we have established discipline and accountability from which we set grounded expectations. We know where performance needs to improve. And as a management team, we are entirely focused on executing on the actions I have outlined. I am humbled and honored to be leading this organization, and I want to reiterate that this team is intensely focused on driving execution and creating shareholder value. My personal mission as CEO of Johnson Controls is to lead with clarity, simplicity and confidence, and my intent is that those same values permeate beyond the executive management team throughout the entire organization. I remain confident that, with the organizational changes over the past year, we are well positioned to lead the evolution of Building Solutions and battery technologies.","Turning now to Slide 7. Let me recap the results for the quarter, and Brian will provide more detail in a few minutes. Overall, another quarter of solid earnings growth with strong EBIT margin expansion driven by continued progress on synergy and productivity actions. Sales of $8.1 billion increased 4% on a reported basis in the quarter. Excluding the impact from divestitures, FX and lead pass-through, sales increased 2% organically, led by strong performance in our Power Solutions business as well as our Global products business within Buildings.","Adjusted EBIT of $1.1 billion grew 10%, driven by cost synergy and productivity realization. EBIT margins were up 80 basis points year-over-year on a reported basis or up 110 basis points excluding the impact of FX and lead.","Turning to our EPS bridge on Slide 8. You can see synergy and productivity savings adding $0.09 to the prior year, in line with our expectations. Volume and mix added $0.01 and strong volume in Power Solutions was partially offset by increased logistics and distribution costs, hurricane disruptions and price cost pressure. The lower effective tax rate year-over-year also added $0.02, and strategic investments were an incremental $0.01. Overall, this resulted in a 14% increase in adjusted EPS year-over-year.","Just a quick mention on synergies and productivity on Slide 9. As we have been detailing for you throughout the year, synergy and productivity savings came in at the high end of our original $250 million to $300 million range or $0.27 in 2017. As we look to fiscal 2018, we are planning for an incremental $250 million in savings.","With that, I will turn it over to Brian to discuss the performance within the segments.","Brian Stief","Thanks, George, and good morning. Let\u2019s start with our new segment structure within Building Technologies & Solutions on Slide 10. As you can see, Buildings has two main components: Building Solutions and Global products. Building Solutions, which has annual revenue of about $15 billion, is our field business and direct channel. We operate in a regional structure and report 3 segments: North America, EMEA\/LA and Asia Pacific. Global products has $8 billion of annual revenue and will be reported as our fourth segment within Buildings. This is our indirect channel with its sales through distribution and storefronts. I will speak to the new segments as I go through the results for Buildings.","Now let\u2019s get into the details of the quarter on Slide 11. Total building sales in the quarter of $6 billion declined 1% year-over-year on a reported basis. However, excluding the impacts from FX and divestitures, sales grew 1% organically. The impact of the hurricanes, the earthquake in Mexico and some final sales-related purchase accounting adjustments impacted sales growth by approximately 60 basis points in the quarter.","So let\u2019s start by unpacking the 1% organic decline in Building Solutions, which again represents our project and service-based field business. In North America, our largest region, sales declined low single digits. Our fire and security field business, which comprises about half of the revenue in North America, is relatively flat year-over-year. HVAC and controls installation and service activity, which typically accounts for about 35% to 40% of sales in North America, grew low single digits. However, this growth was more than offset by a decline in large projects within our solutions business, which declined low double digits in the quarter. And I\u2019d just point out that about half of that decline was driven by weaker sales to the U.S. federal government. Turning to EMEA\/LA, we saw low single-digit growth in the quarter. Growth in Europe was led by solid project activity in fire and security. In the Middle East, sales inflected to positive growth in the quarter driven by HVAC. Latin America also grew low single digits with balanced growth across fire and security, HVAC and controls. In Asia Pacific, organic growth was flat in the quarter as strong growth in service was offset by lower project installation spend year-over-year, particularly in China.","Turning to global products. Sales increased 3% organically year-over-year with growth across building management, HVAC and refrigeration equipment and specialty products. Building management, which is about 15% of global products revenue, includes controls, security and fire detection, and we saw a nice growth across all 3 of these product lines. HVAC and refrigeration products, which comprises about 65% of global products revenue, includes unitary and applied HVAC equipment and products, our Hitachi joint venture products, as well as industrial refrigeration and marine equipment.","Within these businesses, resi and light commercial HVAC grew low single digits where a low single-digit decline in resi HVAC was more than offset by low teens growth in light commercial where we saw a significant growth in our national accounts business. I would point out that the resi HVAC decline was impacted by a tough prior year comparison with fiscal \u201816 Q4 growth north of 20% as well as lower cooling degree days. For the full year, our resi HVAC business grew high single digits organically, benefiting from new product launches in the spring of 2016. Our applied business grew in the mid-single digits range in the quarter with strong performance from North America and larger projects in the Middle East. ","Finally, we continue to see solid growth in our Hitachi joint venture as well as a pickup in our industrial refrigeration businesses led by the improving natural gas and food and beverage markets. The remaining 20% of revenue in global products is specialty products, which includes fire suppression and Scott Safety. This platform saw low single-digit growth in the quarter and, as you know, Scott Safety was sold to 3M in early October.","So let\u2019s turn to EBITA. Buildings grew 5% year-over-year in both the reported and adjusted basis to $904 million with margins expanding 80 basis points year-over-year to 15.1%. This growth was led by cost synergies and productivity savings, partially offset by price cost pressure as well as continued investments we\u2019re making in new products in our channels. Over the course of 2017, we launched 14 new chiller products globally and expanded our factory direct distribution business by adding 17 new storefronts across North America. And I just point out that for the full year, Buildings EBITA margin expanded 50 basis points.","So let\u2019s turn to Slide 12. Orders grew 2% organically year-over-year, led by the 5% growth in our products business. Field orders were flat as high single-digit growth in Asia Pacific was offset by a low single-digit decline in North America and EMEA\/LA. Backlog of 8.5 billion at year-end grew 4% year-over-year on an organic basis.","So let\u2019s move to Power Solutions. Sales of 2.1 billion increased 18% year-over-year on a reported basis, but this includes a significant tailwind from lead pass-through. Excluding lead and FX, sales grew 9% organically, led by strong shipments to the aftermarket channels across all regions. Global battery shipments increased 5% year-over-year with aftermarket unit growth of 8%, partially offset by a 5% decline in our lease shipments, which is consistent with the lower auto production in our two biggest markets, the U.S. and Europe. China rebounded nicely versus last quarter with total shipment growth of nearly 40% with strength across both OE and aftermarket. Global shipments of Start-Stop units increased 30% led by strong growth in China and the Americas. EMEA Start-Stop units increased 7% due primarily to strong aftermarket growth, which is more than offset by a low single-digit decline in OE.","Segment EBITA of 431 million increased 4% on a reported basis or 5% excluding the impact of FX and lead. Power\u2019s margins declined 260 basis points year-over-year to 20.2% on a reported basis, but this includes 170 basis point headwind from lead. Excluding the impact of FX and lead, Power\u2019s margins declined 80 basis points. In the quarter, leverage and higher volumes, favorable mix and productivity savings were more than offset by ongoing product investments, start-up and launch costs and increased logistics and distribution costs, including the disruptions related to the hurricane. For the full year, Power\u2019s margin declined by 60 basis points to 19.5% on a reported basis, but this includes 150 basis point headwind for lead. Excluding the impact of lead and FX, Power\u2019s margins expanded a strong 100 basis points for the year.","Moving to Slide 14. Corporate expense was down 25% year-over-year to 107 million, benefiting from continued synergy and productivity savings as well as a lower compensation expense versus the prior year. For the full year, corporate expense was 465 million on an adjusted basis, better than the 480 million to 500 million guidance range we provided last December. I am pleased with the progress in reducing our overall corporate expense, and we expect to see continued improvement in fiscal \u201818.","Now let\u2019s turn to free cash flow on Slide 15. In the quarter, we generated $1 billion in reported cash flow. Excluding 100 million of transaction and integration costs in the quarter, adjusted free cash flow was 1.1 billion. This out-performance versus the 900 million Q4 target we provided in July resulted primarily from the strong Q4 volume growth in Power Solutions, which allowed us to work through a portion of the inventory build from the end of the third quarter, and we also saw a reduction in receivables across our businesses.","As George mentioned, we are in the process of establishing internal cash management office. This team will be dedicated to improving our overall cash management and forecasting process and will report directly to me. This team will be comprised of individuals from corporate, treasury, our shared service center groups and the business units. This area is one of our top priorities for fiscal \u201818, and we remain committed to delivering adjusted free cash flow conversion of 80-plus percent, which excludes net onetime cash outflows of $800 million to $900 million related primarily to integration, restructuring and income tax payments. Let me stop there just for a second and give you the components of the onetime items.","We\u2019ve got restructuring and integration costs of roughly $500 million, which is probably $100 million higher as a result of us accelerating or pulling forward some of these actions to Q4 of \u201818 versus fiscal \u201819. Secondly, we\u2019ve got about $100 million of executive severance and the [Indiscernible] unfavorable arbitration award that occurred in the fourth quarter. We\u2019ve got the $50 million worth of Scott Safety tax payments. And then we\u2019ve got about $350 million, which is broken into two buckets in the tax area. One would be $200 million outflow related to a Mexican tax law change regarding they\u2019ll no longer accept consolidated filings in Mexico. There\u2019s a deconsolidation that\u2019s required, that will cause $200 million of cash outflows in the first quarter of fiscal \u201818, and there were some specific tax planning in the U.S which was $150 million outflow.","So in aggregate, that\u2019s about $1 billion. And as you may recall, 200 -- originally, we thought $300 million was going to be the tax refund in the first quarter of fiscal \u201818. That number is now $200 million, but the $600 million that we expected in 2019 has now increased to $700 million. So essentially, where we are now is we\u2019ve got about $1 billion worth of cash outflows and $200 million related to the tax refund in the first quarter, which gets you that $800 million number. And again, I just point out that as we move into \u201819, we now expect $700 million of tax refunds related to the Adient tax that was paid in the first quarter of \u201817. Similar to recent years, we expect our adjusted free cash flow to be much more weighted to the second half of the year with an outflow in Q1 and our largest inflow in Q4.","Moving to Slide 16. We ended the year with a net debt-to-cap of 39.3% versus 41.2% at June 30. During the quarter, we again took advantage of the low interest rate foreign debt environment and issued $310 million of yen-denominated five year notes and $175 million euro-denominated one year note. During the quarter, we used the strong cash flow generation as well as the debt issuances to repay $1 billion in commercial paper and $150 million bond maturity. Additionally, we repaid $165 million in TSARL debt with Tyco-related cash flows. As everyone knows, the Scott Safety sale to 3M closed in early October, and we repaid $1.9 billion of TSARL debt with the net proceeds from this transaction. These payments, along with the proceeds of the ADT South Africa sale in the second quarter of this year, reduced our original $4 billion in TSARL debt to a current balance of $1.8 billion.","During the quarter, we repurchased $225 million in stock or about 5.5 million shares. For the year, we repurchased just under 16 million shares for $650 million. I\u2019d also mention that we completed another $150 million of buybacks during the month of October. And as we move through fiscal \u201818, we will, at a minimum, buy back stock to offset the impact of option dilution.","On Slide 17, we provided details in the appendix related to the Q4 special items, all of which have been excluded from our adjusted results. And as I mentioned earlier, the building segment change was effective in the fourth quarter, and we -- and the revised fiscal \u201817 quarters are provided in the appendix as well. And just finally, the House U.S. tax reform proposal was released last week, and the Senate proposal is expected shortly. Interest deductibility and repatriation taxes on foreign earnings will be headwinds for us, but we are in the early stages of reviewing the overall pluses and minuses [to Johnson Controls] as well as other available tax planning opportunities.","So with that, let me turn the call back over to George to review our fiscal \u201818 guidance.","George Oliver","Thanks, Brian. As I mentioned earlier, we have made significant progress over the past year related to the merger integration, but we still have plenty of work to do. Fiscal 2018 will be a year of change. We will intensely focused on driving execution.","Turning to Slide 18. We expect total sales to be in the range of $30.1 billion to $30.7 billion. Based on current exchange rates, this includes a $265 million tailwind related to changes in foreign currency as well as a $70 million tailwind related to lead prices. Additionally, the impact of recent divestitures are expected to be a $700 million headwind to sales. We expect overall organic sales growth to be in the low single digits.","Going through our expectations for Buildings and Power, let me start with Buildings. Based on current backlog, we expect organic growth in the low single digits as we begin to ramp our sales capacity in fiscal 2018. From an adjusted EBITA margin perspective, we expect the benefit from synergies and volume growth to be partly offset by gross margin pressure within our North American field business backlog, which I spoke to earlier, as well as continued incremental investments in our products and channels. Overall, we expect adjusted EBITA margin expansion in Buildings of approximately 10 to 30 basis points, including a 40 basis point headwind related to the divestiture of Scott Safety. Underlying margins are expected to increase 50 to 70 basis points.","In Power Solutions, we expect organic sales growth in the low to mid-single digits, driven by volume growth in the aftermarket. We expect volume mix and productivity benefits to be offset by higher lead prices and incremental investments including launch costs. We expect adjusted EBITA margins to be relatively flat on a year-over-year basis. As Brian mentioned earlier, we expect to see continued reductions in corporate expense and are targeting an incremental 5% to 9% reduction, which would bring our adjusted corporate expense down to a range of $425 million to $440 million. Overall, we expect adjusted EBIT margins to increase 30 to 50 basis points to 12.2% to 12.4%, which includes a 30 basis point headwind related to the divestiture of Scott Safety. Underlying adjusted EBIT margins are expected to increase 60 to 80 basis points.","As we move to the below-the-line items, we expect to see a tailwind to interest expense related to the pay down of the TSARL debt from the Scott Safety proceeds. This decrease is expected to be mostly offset by an increase in variable interest rates. In total, we expect net financing charges to be in the range of $460 million to $475 million. Additionally, we have seen very nice growth from our joint ventures, particularly Hitachi over the last few years and expect to see our noncontrolling interest increase to $200 million to $210 million. Based on these items, we expect adjusted EPS to be in the range of $2.75 to $2.85, which represents a 6% to 10% increase in earnings per share versus fiscal year 2017. As Brian mentioned, we expect adjusted free cash flow conversion of 80-plus percent, which includes CapEx of up to $1.3 billion.","Consistent with prior years, we expect our earnings per share to be stronger in the second half of the year due to the normal seasonality of our businesses. We expect our quarterly EPS cadence to be similar to last year with a slightly lower percentage of earnings in the first quarter, given the ramp-up of our sales force and lower margin backlog in Buildings and the lead price movements in Power.","With that, let me turn it over to our operator to open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research. Please go ahead.","Jeff Sprague","George, just first on the portfolio and maybe putting Power aside, which is a whole other discussion. You\u2019ve only been in the CEO seat for 2.5 months or so but obviously, you\u2019ve been evaluating the portfolio as COO all along. I wouldn\u2019t expect you to name names on what might be a candidate to be divested, but can you give us a general assessment of your view? Is there 5%, 10%, 15% of the portfolio that\u2019s kind of a question mark in your mind? Just some way to kind of frame how you\u2019re thinking about that. And if you do have some additional thoughts on Power, would love to hear them, too.","George Oliver","So what I would say, Jeff, starting out is certainly over the last couple of months the opportunity to really take a fresh look at the portfolio, I\u2019ve been working very closely with the business leaders and really understanding the core businesses, adjacencies and complementary type businesses. We\u2019ve got incredible platforms in both Power Solutions and Buildings. But as we look at the portfolio that there are opportunities for potential divestitures where we could take those proceeds and double down on some of our core businesses. And as I\u2019ve always demonstrated in the past, as we do this, we certainly will continue to focus on how do we create the most long-term shareholder value in the remix of the portfolio.","So what I would say is starting out here, just with the type of businesses that you\u2019ve seen us looking at here, in that kind of high single-digit, mid- to high-single digits potentially as some opportunities here that we see that are kind of outside of our core that would raise capital and be able to position us to be able to double down from an investment standpoint in our more core HVAC and building system businesses within our Buildings portfolio.","Jeff Sprague","Mid- to high-single digits within Buildings not relative to total?","George Oliver","That is correct.","Jeff Sprague","Yes. And I was wondering also, just shifting gears on tax and cash flow and the like, really kind of a couple questions, or related, anyhow, for Brian. How do we get comfortable that it\u2019s Mexico next year and it\u2019s not something else the year after, so to speak? And I wonder if you could just elaborate a little bit more on the magnitude of pressures you see on U.S. tax reform relative to your initial analysis.","Brian Stief","Yes. So let me start with U.S. tax reform. And I think the two areas that I commented on providing the most headwind are probably the limitations on interest deductibility as well as the repatriation taxes on foreign earnings. And we are in the early stages, Jeff, of taking a look at the implications of the proposal, and we\u2019ll see what comes out from the Senate as well. But those two items certainly do put pressure on our effective rate in the mid-teens where it is today. But I\u2019d also say that until we really sit back and study all the provisions of it, we really aren\u2019t in a position today to comment on what the ultimate effect will be because I\u2019m sure there\u2019ll be tax planning opportunities that we\u2019ll have in front of us as well. So I think this is one we\u2019re going to probably just have to keep front and center with you and everyone on the call. And the more information we get and as ultimately the regulations come out, we\u2019ll address it at that time.","As far as your comment on Mexico, the calculations that were completed on the specifics around deconsolidation of Mexican returns, I mean the tax law changed, just to give you a little bit of color here, was that in Mexico, no longer can you file a consolidated return and get group tax relief, but you\u2019ve got to file individual returns. And that payment is required to be made for us in our first quarter of fiscal \u201818, and we didn\u2019t finish the calculations on what that net payment was going to be after unpacking all of these individual returns until just recently. And so the one thing I would point out there is that the payment that we\u2019re going to make of $200 million, the way these regulations are working in Mexico, we will recoup that payment over a period of time of up to seven years. So it\u2019s something we\u2019ll get back over time, but it was a onetime payment that\u2019s large enough that we called out in our commentary here.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Tusa of JP Morgan.","Steve Tusa","So just wanted to kind of dig into these first half margin dynamics. You said you\u2019re adding some new salespeople. The backlog margins are down. So can you just give us some color on kind of how that -- at a higher level, just perhaps in an operating margin level, how that will play through here in the first half to make sure people are kind of level set on the expectation as these costs and this lower margin revenue rolls through?","George Oliver","Sure. So let me start with North America. As I said, we have about $5.2 billion in backlog there. And as that flows through, there\u2019s probably about 75 basis points of headwind in that and combined with the investments we\u2019re making in the sales and we\u2019re making good progress there, that certainly is going to create some pressure in the first half as we\u2019re ramping up the orders and that begins to convert to revenues. So that\u2019s the -- that\u2019s one big part of it. And then the other is when we look at our reinvestment, we are -- last year, we had about $0.06 of reinvestment mainly into our products. And that\u2019s beginning to really start to show performance as we look at our products organic growth, and that will continue here through \u201818. And we\u2019re estimating somewhere around $0.06 or $0.08 of reinvestment into our products. Those are the two large pieces as we think about 2018 guidance. Brian, maybe you want to comment?","Brian Stief","I would just comment on Buildings, that\u2019s correct, George. And then when you look at Power Solutions given the spike up that we have seen in lead over the last few months here, there\u2019s probably a bit of headwind as we look at just Q1 impact. But as we\u2019ve kind of commented on before, when it spikes like that, we can have an individual quarter impact based upon the arrangements we\u2019ve got with our customers to pass on those lead increases over the course of the year that tends to normalize, and we wouldn\u2019t expect that to be a big number for the year. But there could be a little bit of an impact in Q1 from the spike in lead prices as well, Steve.","Steve Tusa","Got it. So when I look at this kind of EPS growth trajectory for the year, $0.06 to $0.10 off of the $0.48 in 1Q -- or sorry $0.53 in 1Q \u201817, I mean will you be growing earnings here in the first quarter?","George Oliver","Yes, I think the way to think about this is we\u2019ve historically been around 20% in the first quarter. And then it\u2019s probably been maybe slightly less of that in the second quarter. And so I think, for the first quarter, you can probably dial it in maybe a little less than where we\u2019ve been before, but that\u2019s kind of the general guidance we\u2019d give.","Steve Tusa","Okay. And then one last question for you. The whole comp discussion around what you\u2019re getting paid for, I guess it\u2019s EBIT, organic growth and conversion, is there any -- so if like tax rates go up and your net income is impacted by that and your free cash is impacted by that, that doesn\u2019t impact your -- the kind of incentive package you guys have. Is that correct?","Brian Stief","On the AIPP side, that\u2019s correct. On the long-term side, it could have some impact. But the short-term bonus here, it would be 1\/3 on EBIT growth, 1\/3 on organic revenue growth and 1\/3 on free cash flow conversion. And then there could be some modifiers that might also address things like EBIT margin improvement to ensure that we aren\u2019t just chasing revenue dollars, that we\u2019re chasing profitable growth.","Steve Tusa","And that\u2019s adjusted conversion?","Brian Stief","Correct.","Operator","Your next question comes from Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets.","David Lu","This is David Lu on for Deane. So on the cash flow for 2018, could you parse out sort of what the increase or the ramp-up from 2017 and 2018 will be? Is it more on the working capital side? I know you gave some color around CapEx, but how should we think about the different buckets that leads to the sequential increase in cash flow?","Brian Stief","Yes. So CapEx is going to be still in the range of about $1.3 billion -- up to $1.3 billion. The way to think about that is if you look at where we are this year and adjust for the items that we talked about in the third quarter, what happened in the fourth quarter here, we were able to flush through about $100 million or so of the inventory build that we saw at the end of the third quarter in Power Solutions, and we also saw about $100 million reduction in receivables. So if you recall at the end of the third quarter, we talked in terms of a couple of hundred million dollars in inventory we thought we could take out and $100 million worth of receivables. So $200 million to $300 million, we were able to take out in the fourth quarter here. So there\u2019s really $100 million more that we expect in the inventory side. And then I would tell you that would get you up to that 80% plus range. And beyond that, it would be the additional effort that our cash management office team is going to put in place to continue to drive trade working capital improvements and look at payment terms and billing terms to our customers. So right now, we\u2019re looking at around 80% plus.","David Lu","Great. And then for my follow-up, can provide an update on the nonresidential sector either in the U.S. or globally, how has it trended? How do you expect it to trend in 2018, is it accelerating or decelerating? Just any color around that would be great.","George Oliver","Yes. So when we look at our nonresidential, we get pretty good presence across all the regions. If you break it out into regions, North America is going to -- as we said, we see lots of opportunity there. We\u2019re expanding our sales force here to be able to capitalize on that. If you look at the metrics, there has been plus or minuses here recently, but we\u2019re starting to -- we still see a very strong pipeline for growth and that\u2019s what we\u2019re ultimately positioned to do to accelerate orders through the course of the year and then begin to turn that as we go through the year. Regionally, when you look at EMEA\/LA, our businesses in EMEA\/LA, we\u2019re actually performing pretty well. We\u2019ve seen some nice progress in Continental Europe offsetting some little bit of pressure we\u2019ve had in the U.K. And as we plan for 2018, it\u2019s still going to continue to grow low single digits. Latin America has been pretty strong for us in -- with the investments and the expansions we\u2019ve been making there. That\u2019s been a bit better than the EMEA region. If you look at -- in Asia Pac when we look at our business there and the investments we\u2019re making, we see nice progress here in 2017 with the new products that we\u2019re bringing into that market and the footprint expansion. And so I would say that we are continuing to look at kind of mid-single digits opportunity there with the market continuing to play out as we expected and then with the investments we\u2019re making. So overall, a fairly solid position as far as a market standpoint. And then with the investments we\u2019re making, we\u2019re going to be positioned to capitalize on that on a go-forward basis.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz of Citi. Go ahead, please.","Unidentified Analyst","This is [indiscernible] on for Andy. So Building Solutions was down 1% in the quarter and orders were flat. So can you talk about your outlook for Building Solutions business within the low single-digit organic growth for Buildings overall?","George Oliver","When you look at our business here, let\u2019s looks at fourth quarter in Buildings, we are seeing some nice progress in our products businesses pretty much across the board. And that\u2019s an output of some of the fire and security markets coming back and those businesses performing well in the fourth quarter. And then with the investments we\u2019ve been making in HVAC and controls and the regionalization of some of those products, we\u2019re beginning to see the pickup, and that also would include the work we\u2019ve been doing with Hitachi. So we see that with those investments continuing in 2018. When you look at the field businesses, that\u2019s where the pressure has been. We were down about 1%, and that was driven by our performance solutions business in North America as well as we did see some timing of some of our projects in Asia, we saw a little bit of slowdown there, but we got a very robust pipeline of opportunities and we\u2019re seeing the orders coming through there. So don\u2019t believe that that\u2019s a longer-term concern. So when you look at what we\u2019re doing from a sales capacity standpoint, where we fell short in 2017, we\u2019ve now, over the last few months, picked up our activity in being able to add salespeople not only driving projects but also service. And so as we now project what that\u2019s going to mean, we\u2019ll see accelerating orders through the course of the year and start to see better conversion of the backlog that we have in place. Backlog was up 4% year-on-year so that does give us confidence that we\u2019ll begin to see the acceleration of revenue through the course of 2018. And while we\u2019re driving increased secured orders, that also gives us confidence that, as we plan for 2018, we\u2019ll be in a much better position to continue that acceleration of growth.","Unidentified Analyst","And then in terms of synergies, can you talk about any progress you\u2019re seeing on the revenue synergies with any cross-selling opportunities that continue to progress?","George Oliver","Sure. I mean what\u2019s happening is we -- within our business, we have very strong relationships with the customers that we\u2019ve served historically, whether it be HVAC controls or whether it be fire and security. And we\u2019ve seen nice progress here in the first year with pipelines, pipelines developing and then the conversion of those pipelines across the board. And what I would tell you is most of these projects are in -- it\u2019s anywhere from less than $1 million to $5 million or $10 million. These are customers that have expansion that -- they\u2019re executing on expansions that we\u2019re bringing in, our combined capabilities to truly differentiate how we can serve their needs within the new space, and we\u2019re starting to see some really nice traction. And so on a go-forward basis, when we originally laid out the longer-term plan, we did say that the first year was going to be about securing orders and that the second and third, we\u2019d start to see the conversion of revenue. So that\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen. We\u2019ll start to see a pickup of the -- now that we\u2019re beginning to see orders, we\u2019re going to start to see the acceleration of the turn of those orders into revenue here in 2018.","Brian Stief","And I would just comment, I would just add to that, that we\u2019ve got -- there is a lot of momentum that we\u2019ve got in the back half of this year. So we aren\u2019t seeing benefit in \u201817 from the revenue pull-through. But given the third and fourth quarter activity, we\u2019ll get some benefit on the top line in \u201818.","Operator","Your next question comes from Rich Kwas of Wells Fargo. Go ahead please.","Rich Kwas","On CapEx, so up to 1.3 billion, what does that imply for the Power CapEx? I thought there was some expansion of facilities in China. So what\u2019s the latest on that?","Brian Stief","So for Power Solutions next year, we\u2019ve got 500 million in the plan, and that would include the construction of the facility that will be part of our Bohai Piston joint venture. The other facility that we\u2019ve talked about in China will be starting late in \u201818, maybe even into \u201819. So the second facility in China will probably not have a big impact on the cash flows in fiscal \u201818.","Rich Kwas","So Brian, I know as we think about \u201819, is this still kind of the peakish year for CapEx as you look out the next couple of years or is there still bit of a ramp in \u201819?","Brian Stief","No, I would say this is the peak. I mean, I could see depending upon levels of the Buildings investments, I would say that we\u2019re probably looking at the 1.3 billion being a peak. I mean, it would have to be something very opportunistic for us to not have a peak at the 1.3 billion. Even at that level, we end up with the reinvestment ratio that\u2019s 1.4, 1.5, something like that. So we\u2019re working to get that down into the more 1.1, 1.2 range.","Rich Kwas","Okay, good. And then just on the synergies, so 300 million for \u201817. It was better than expected. The guide includes 250 million. Is that a conservative number? Or is it a reasonable number? I mean, how should we interpret that, considering you had upside last year? And I know there\u2019s moving parts with regards to projects and whatnot, but how do you feel that in terms of potentially delivering some upside to that later in the year?","Brian Stief","I\u2019d say we guided 250 million to 300 million last year. We ended up at the high end. I would tell you the 250 million is a number that\u2019s pretty much what we\u2019ve got road map for fiscal \u201818. I mean as we go through the year, could there be some upside? Maybe. But right now, we\u2019ve got the teams focused on the 250 million, which is exactly what we\u2019ve got in our trackers, and we\u2019re working toward delivering that. So I think that\u2019s where we are, Rich.","Rich Kwas","Okay. And then quick last one. What\u2019s the lead price assumption for the year?","Brian Stief","2,100.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gautam Khanna of Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.","Gautam Khanna","Congratulations, George, on the new job. So two questions. First one, if you could expand upon why pricing in the backlog\u2019s softer in North America. Is it a function of chasing worse projects or is it just the demands conditions warrant that? And if you could just expand that comment to pricing in the applied market abroad as well? And as a follow-up, Brian, will adjusted free -- will actual free cash flow, all in, in 2019 exceed adjusted free cash flow? And if so, by how much, given the $700 million Adient tax recovery? Any color there on both of those questions?","George Oliver","Sure, Gautam, I\u2019ll take the margin pressure. As I said in my prepared remarks, the incentive systems that were in place were incentivizing purely sales in the past. And what we\u2019ve done, we\u2019ve changed that now on a go-forward basis that its sales and margins. So we weren\u2019t consistently applying that concept across the board. And so over the last -- it\u2019s really been over the last 18 months, there certainly was a deterioration of book margins. And as a result, that backlog then plays out over the course of 18 months, and you\u2019ve got pressure in gross margins. ","That all being said, we\u2019ve got the discipline in place, the accountability that\u2019s going to ultimately drive improvement. And then with all of the other cost actions that we\u2019re taking, we\u2019ll get benefit also in addition to the pricing to be able to improve that gross margin through the course of the year. And so -- and then the other element is service growth. As I talked about, making sure that we\u2019re getting the right mix of service growth, which as you know is higher profit growth within those field businesses, we had -- it was very low single-digit growth in 2017. I believe, and we\u2019re working across the board to accelerate that service growth, which is going to be a very attractive part of the business on a go-forward basis. So it\u2019s really those two elements that contribute to the overall margin rate. And I have confidence with the actions that we\u2019ve taken that we will be positioned to execute well on that.","Gautam Khanna","Pricing outside the U.S. as well? Just on pricing outside the U.S. as well?","George Oliver","Yes. So we\u2019ve been -- we have had a little bit of price cost as it relates to some of the HVAC equipment, and you\u2019ve seen that with some of our competitors. We\u2019ve been very disciplined around price and continuing to put a lot of intensity and driving out cost. And so what I\u2019d say is the price cost in the fourth -- it was in the fourth quarter, it was about $20 million or 30 basis points within our building segment, we\u2019re going to see a little bit more of that in the first quarter. But based on all of the reviews and the details I\u2019ve seen, with the price actions that have been taken, with the other cost actions, that we\u2019ll start to see that improve in the second quarter and beyond within 2018.","Brian Stief","Gautam, so on cash flow for \u201819, I mean it\u2019s a bit early to talk about \u201819, but I guess I\u2019ll give you my thoughts as we sit here today. That $600 million refund from the Adient tax payment is now $700 million that we\u2019re going to get in \u201819. And I think we\u2019ve talked in the past, we hope to get that in fiscal \u201819. Whether it\u2019s fiscal \u201819 or calendar \u201819 really depends upon how quickly we can get it through a joint committee because, given the size of the refund, it\u2019s got to go to joint committee. But obviously, we\u2019re targeting to get it in fiscal \u201819. So that $700 million, when we look at the other onetime items that could be out there, it\u2019d be restructuring and integration, and I would expect those to be well below that $700 million number as we move into fiscal \u201819, there\u2019s probably a bit of a wildcard, right? Relative to tax reform and what that might mean. I guess we just need to sort through that. But I guess the short response is I would expect adjusted free cash flow or reported cash flow to exceed adjusted free cash flow in fiscal \u201819.","Operator","Your last question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski of Wolfe Research.","Josh Pokrzywinski","Just to continue on some of the comments that you guys made on the margin pressure, gross margin pressure in the backlog. George, I think at Tyco, you went through a similar phenomenon when you took over there trying to bring up backlog margins and enhance some bidding discipline. I think there was a period of time where that selectivity showed up in growth. Is that something that you guys are anticipating in the current outlook? Is that something that over the next couple of quarters could be kind of a slow or uneven handoff as you just work that through the system?","George Oliver","Not at all. We\u2019re doing both. I mean -- I think what\u2019s different is that during that period of time, maybe the markets weren\u2019t as strong. And when we did the selectivity, it resulted in a net decline obviously with margins significantly improving. What I would tell you in the current environment is the market is pretty strong. We\u2019re adding salespeople, talking to our customers. We\u2019re getting a lot of good feedback that there\u2019s a lot more we can do for our customers and making sure that now we got the capacity to go after that and staying focused on projects that ultimately create the most amount of value. And then certainly from a price standpoint, we get the proper return for the projects that we actually deliver. And so I think it is different than what we went through in Tyco. Some of the same principles apply. It\u2019s more focus and discipline and making sure that the incentive systems are aligned to ultimately what we\u2019re trying to achieve both in growth as well as margins.","Josh Pokrzywinski","Got you. That\u2019s helpful. And just a follow-up on the cash flow, it seems like the mix of growth that you guys are projecting for \u201818 between more growth in Asia, more growth in Power or Asia on the -- or on the building side, those would be, I guess, your lower cash generating businesses since Asia has Hitachi, if that\u2019s a big component of the growth and obviously Power is a working capital consumer. Is that something that factors into maybe a suboptimal mix of cash flow growth this year and that could normalize something better than 80%? I\u2019m just trying to calibrate. It seems like the mix of growth is not your best case scenario for free cash generation.","Brian Stief","I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to impact it in a big way. I guess the way to think about this right now is we\u2019re looking at the Buildings business globally. Target\u2019s about 85% free cash flow, and Power Solutions is around 70% today with the growth investments we\u2019re making. I think as we work through some of the growth investments that we\u2019ve talked about on this call at Power, I think moving toward the 90% target we\u2019ve got in 2020, that\u2019s still where we\u2019re headed. But I don\u2019t think the mix that you\u2019re referring -- the geographic mix you\u2019re referring to is going to be a -- is going to impact that in any significant way.","Antonella Franzen","Operator, I\u2019d just like to turn the call over to George Oliver for some closing comments.","George Oliver","Thanks, Antonella. And again, thanks, everyone, for joining our call this morning. As I mentioned earlier, I\u2019m even more excited about the future opportunity as we look at 2018 and beyond and certainly look forward to engaging with many of you here over the next coming weeks. So, operator, that concludes our call today.","Operator","That concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"12648":["Johnson Controls International plc (NYSE:JCI) Q2 2019 Earnings Conference Call May  1, 2019  8:30 AM ET","Company Participants","Antonella Franzen - VP and Chief IR and Communications Officer","George Oliver - Chairman and CEO","Brian Stief - EVP and CFO","Conference Call Participants","Nigel Coe - Wolfe Research","Jeffrey Molinari - Cowen & Company","Jeffrey Sprague - Vertical Research Partners","Steve Tusa - JPMorgan","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Inc","David Lu - RBC Capital Markets","Tim Wojs - Robert W. Baird","Josh Pokrzywinski - Morgan Stanley","Operator","Welcome to Johnson Controls Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] This conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time.","I will turn the call over to Antonella Franzen, Vice President and Chief Investor Relations and Communications Officer.","Antonella Franzen","Good morning and thank you for joining our conference call to discuss Johnson Controls second quarter fiscal 2019 results. The press release and all related tables issued earlier this morning as well as the conference call slide presentation can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our Web site at johnsoncontrols.com.","With me today are Johnson Controls' Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, George Oliver; and our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Brian Stief.","Before we begin, I would like to remind you that during the course of today's call, we will be providing certain forward-looking information. We ask that you review today's press release and read through the forward-looking cautionary informational statements that we've included there. In addition, we will use certain non-GAAP measures in our discussions, and we ask that you read through the sections of our press release that address the use of these items. In discussing our results during the call, references to adjusted EBITA and adjusted EBIT margins exclude restructuring and integration costs as well as other special items. These metrics are non-GAAP measures and are reconciled in the schedules attached to our press release, and in the appendix to the presentation posted on our Web site.","Given the sale of our Power Solutions business, the results of Power are reported as discontinued operations. The focus of this call will be on continuing operations. GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to Johnson Controls ordinary shareholders was $0.26 for the quarter and included a net charge of $0.06 related to special items. These special items primarily relate to integration cost in the quarter. Adjusting for these special items, non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.32 per share compared to $0.26 in the prior year quarter.","Now let me turn the call over to George.","George Oliver","Thanks, Antonella, and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us on today\u2019s call. Let me start with some of the high level strategic highlights from the quarter, beginning on Slide 4.","We delivered another quarter of solid results with continued improvement across a majority of our underlying fundamental metrics. The investments we\u2019ve made throughout the sales organization and into new product development, combined with our ongoing efforts around commercial excellence, continue to drive strong organic top line growth across the board. We continue to grow our service business. A key element of our overall strategy in enhancing value for our buildings customers. And as I will share with you in just a second, these efforts are increasingly being acknowledged by our customers.","With the exception of Asia Pacific, margins were higher in each segments as we remain focused on driving productivity optimizing our cost structure and improving our pricing discipline across our product categories as well as in our project businesses. Operational leverage is improving, which will become more evident over the next several quarters as the pricing we\u2019ve built into the system over the last 12 months fully matures and raw materials and tariff impacts have stabilized.","Although we were impacted by some timing of orders being booked in the quarter, our order pipeline remains robust, still tracking in the mid to high single-digit range for the year. And our backlog continues to built with an attractive mix of service and balanced profile of short and long cycle project activity. With this as our backdrop, we remain confident in our outlook for the second half of fiscal 2019. ","Regarding Power Solutions, we announced the closing of the sale this morning about 60 days ahead of schedule, which allows us to accelerate the return of capital to our shareholders. As Brian will discuss with you later in the call, we've updated our assumptions with respect to the timing of the use of proceeds. And those assumptions and now reflected in our updated 2019 guidance.","I'd like to thank Joe Walicki as well as the thousands of Power Solutions employees around the globe, and wish them all the best as they started their journey under the stewardship of Brookfield. I'd also like to thank our separation team who were putting countless hours over the past several months in order to bring this transactions to a close, truly a tremendous effort. Looking forward, we will continue our journey as a pure play building solutions provider with a commitment to enhancing value for our customers with integrated solutions that create more intelligent, efficient and sustainable buildings and infrastructure.","We are committed to driving execution and we are well-positioned to continue investing for growth across the portfolio. As a case in point, I wanted to highlight a few examples of how our strategy is playing out in the recent months. Let me start with an example that represents the core of Johnson Controls legacy as a sustainability company. We have had a long-standing relationship with the University of Hawaii and are in the process of executing the second phase in the University's multiyear energy efficiency and renewable energy project, which envisions the entire university system panning 10 campuses across the state becoming a net zero energy consumer by 2035.","We were awarded our first energy performance contract back in 2010 and are proud to continue our partnership with the expectation of producing a substantial amount of energy savings over the next 20 years and hoping the University achieve their goal of being one of the first higher education campuses in the nation to be free of the need to rely on fossil fuels.","The middle picture on the bottom of the page is Bee\u2019ah's iconic new headquarters building currently being constructed in the UAE. For those of you who are not familiar, Bee\u2019ah is one of the Middle East pioneering developers of sustainable solutions. Just last week along with our partners at Microsoft and Bee\u2019ah, we announced a joint agreement to collaborate on what will be one of the most sustainable and smartest buildings in the Middle East wholly powered by renewable energy sources with zero net energy consumption and a LEED platinum rating.","Importantly, this building will come to represent a global showcase for artificial intelligence capability and smart building solutions. It is expected to be the first building in the region and one of the first in the world to have fully integrated AI capabilities. Leveraging the Johnson Controls digital vault, which is our proprietary cloud-based data analytics solution, along with our data enabled EDGE devices and software, Bee\u2019ah will have a completely integrated system with capabilities to optimize energy efficiency, comfort, safety and sustainability as well as enable the building's occupants to increase productivity.","We are extremely excited to have been selected to participate in this groundbreaking project, which allows us to demonstrate our preeminent position as a leading smart and sustainable building solution provider. In mid April, we officially opened our new 900,000 square foot state-of-the-art rooftop center of excellence in Norman, Oklahoma, which has been the primary design, manufacturing and testing campus for ducted HVAC business for nearly 50 years.","This expansion project represents a multiyear investment effort aimed at upgrading our innovation and manufacturing capabilities, specifically for our high-efficiency rooftop HVAC business. We've added almost 400,000 square feet of additional laboratory and manufacturing space and renovated an existing 150,000 square feet of office and meeting spaces. This new capacity provides us with the full capability to conduct on-site complex system development and meet regulatory compliance, performance, safety and reliability standards for units up to a 150 tons. This will allow us to increase our speed to market, provide unmatched quality assurance for our customers and supports the development of the industry-leading energy-efficient technology.","Turning to orders on Slide 5. As you can see from the chart, we're lapping more difficult prior year comparisons. Orders in our field businesses increased 2% organically, due to some timing in both the current and prior year periods that are skewing the results. Importantly, our project pipeline remains robust, still tracking in the high single-digit range. Based on our historical conversion rates, I\u2019m confident in achieving a mid to high single-digit order growth rate in the second half despite the increasingly difficult comps.","Brian will provide you with some order details in his segment review, but we continue to see broad-based activity across all three regions and across most of our core product platforms. Our backlog ended the quarter at a strong $8.8 billion, up 6% organically versus the prior year, which not only supports our second half revenue assumptions, but also provides visibility into 2020. Generally speaking, our end markets remain healthy with no notable slowdown in any of our internal leading indicators as our short cycle book-to-bill trends, service growth and both small and large project bookings remain robust.","Turning now to Slide 6. Let me recap the financial results for the quarter. Sales of $5.8 billion increased 6% on an organic basis, led by 7% growth in products and 6% growth in the field businesses. We continue to see solid growth from our service businesses across the globe, which were up 5% in the quarter. Our project business is also performing well with installation revenue up 6% in the quarter.","Adjusted EBIT of $469 million grew 10% on a reported basis, which includes a headwind from FX of just over $20 million in the quarter. Excluding FX, adjusted EBIT grew 16% on an organic basis, driven by solid growth in segment profit as well as lower corporate expense. Overall, underlying EBIT margins expanded 70 basis points year-over-year excluding the impact of FX and M&A. Adjusted EPS of $0.32 increased 23% over the prior year driven by solid top line performance and a modest benefit from below the line items.","Adjusted free cash flow of approximately $200 million in the quarter brought us back to slightly positive for the first half, which is consistent with our normal seasonal pattern and our expectation we laid out to you on the Q1 call. We\u2019ve made significant progress in this area over the past year and we are well on track to reach our targeted 95% conversion for the year.","With that, I will turn it over to Brian to discuss our performance in more detail.","Brian Stief","Thanks, George, and good morning, everyone. So let's start on Slide 7 and look at our year-over-year EPS bridge. As you can see operational performance including synergies and productivity contributed about $0.10. And this was partially offset by $0.02 of continued product investments and the carryover run rate of our fiscal '18 sales force additions. We also saw some other items create $0.02 worth headwinds related primarily to FX, and its below the line items. But as George mentioned, overall EPS in the quarter was up 23%.","So moving to Slide 8, let's take a look at buildings on a consolidated basis. Sales of $5.8 billion increased 6% organically led by continued strength in our shorter cycle product segment, which was up 7% and 6% growth in our field businesses where we saw continued strength in service and project installation, which were up 5% and 6%, respectively. The continued strength in our field business is a reflection of the strong backlog we've been doing over the past several quarters.","Total segment EBITDA of $671 million grew 11% organically, driven by strong growth from our field and product businesses as well as ongoing productivity and cost synergy save. Total segment EBITDA margin expanded 50 basis points on an organic basis to a 11.6%. And as you can see in the waterfall underlying operational improvement contributed about 100 basis points and this was partially offset by the product investments and run rate sales force additions.","Now let's take a look at each segment within building, starting with Slide 9 North America. Sales of $2.2 billion grew 5% organically, driven by continued strength in both install and service, which were up 5% and 4%, respectively. Both applied HVAC & Controls and Fire & Security continue to outperform growing in the mid-single digits. Our solutions business declined low single digits this quarter, but as you know this business can be a bit choppy quarter-to-quarter on both in order intake and revenue basis.","Adjusted EBITDA of $259 million grew 7% on an organic basis and EBIT margins expanded 20 basis points to a 11.8%. We saw the benefits from synergy and productivity save as well as modest volume leverage partially offset by the run rate sales force investments and some unfavorable mix on selected platforms. Orders in North America increased 2% organically and orders for applied HVAC were up low single digits overall, reflecting a year-over-year decline in equipment orders. This was due primarily to the timing impacts of some price increases in both years.","I would point out that on a year-to-date basis, HVAC equipment orders were up low teens. Fire & Security field orders were up low single digits in the quarter, while our solutions business saw order growth in the high single-digits. Backlog of $5.6 billion increased 5% year-over-year. I will just also point out that our current North America order pipeline supports in mid to high single-digit order growth in Q3.","So let's move to Slide 10 and EMEA\/LA. Sales of $878 million grew 4% organically with continued strength in service, which was up 5% and a return to growth in project installation, which was up 4%. Growth was positive in most regions and across most lines of business.","In Europe, we saw mid single-digit growth led by mid single-digit growth in our Fire & Security business, which accounts for about two-thirds of our revenue in that region. And we saw low double-digit growth in our Industrial Refrigeration & HVAC businesses. Orders in Europe increased mid single digits organically, led by strong demand in IR, security and HVAC.","In the Middle East, revenues declined low single digits as continued growth in service activity was more than offset by softness in HVAC project installations, and in Latin America revenues increased high single digits led by broad-based strength across most platforms. Adjusted EBITDA of $81 million increased 17% organically and EBITDA margin expanded 60 basis points to 9.2%. This included a 40 basis point headwind for FX. So similar to Q1, underlying margins increased 100 basis points as the favorable volume and productivity and synergy save more than offset the run rate impact of our fiscal '18 sales force additions.","Orders in EMEA\/LA increased 3%, led by solid growth in Europe and Latin America across both service and project install. In the Middle East, orders declined in a low teens rate driven by continued pressure we're seeing in applied chiller end markets. Backlog ended the quarter at $1.7 billion at 9% organically.","So let's move to APAC on Slide 11. Sales of $628 million grew 12% organically, led by accelerating project installation activity, which grew over 15% in the quarter. We also saw strong growth in our core HVAC and BMS platforms with overall low teens growth in China. Service growth expanded 7% overall and I would note that it was over 20% in China.","Adjusted EBITDA of $76 million increased to 11% on an organic basis and we saw adjusted EBITDA margins flat at 12.1%, which was slightly better than we were anticipating due primarily to the higher volumes. Favorable volume leverage was offset by the higher install mix, run rate sales force investments and the ongoing margin pressures we continue to see in APAC. Asia PAC orders increased 1% with low single-digit growth in project installation, partially offset by a modest decline in service. Backlog is up 8% year-over-year to $1.6 billion.","So global products on Slide 12 increased 7% organically top line, despite a difficult 6% per year comparison to $2.1 billion. BMS grew double digits with continued strength across all platforms. Sales across our HVAC and IR equipment businesses grew mid single digits collectively and we saw global residential HVAC grow low single digits in the quarter.","North America residential HVAC revenue grew a 11% despite a tough high teens growth comp in prior year. And this was benefiting from higher -- from favorable weather trends, strong price realization and the continued expansion of our distribution footprint. Global light commercial HVAC grew mid teens in the quarter with North America up low teens, as we continue to see strong growth in our key national account business.","IR equipment revenues declined high single digits in the quarter due primarily to very difficult high teens growth rates in the prior year. And then finally our applied HVAC equipment business grew mid teens, reflecting strength in our indirect channels in both North America and Asia. Lastly, specialty products grew double digits on strong demand from our fire suppression products with broad-based growth across all regions, particularly in APAC.","Segment EBITDA of $255 million was up 13% organically and products EBITDA margin expanded 60 basis points as the leverage at higher volumes, favorable mix, positive price cost, and synergy and productivity save were slightly offset by ongoing product investment.","So let's move to corporate quickly on Slide 13. Corporate expense was down 8% year-over-year to $104 million. And for the full-year, we continue to expect corporate expense to be in the range of $380 million to $395 million. Free cash flow on Slide 14. Reported cash flow was roughly $100 million in the quarter, which if you exclude the integration and transaction costs, adjusted free cash flow was approximately $200 million. Year-to-date adjusted free cash flow was slightly above breakeven, which is in line with our expectations for the year and our normal seasonal patterns for the buildings business. We remain on track to deliver 95% conversion for the year.","Moving to the balance sheet on Slide 15, you can see our net debt to cap increased sequentially to 37.7%, which primarily reflects the borrowings to support our share buyback program we talked with you about in the first quarter call. We remain aggressive on share repurchase through the first half and we completed $533 million in the quarter to get to our $1 billion share buyback for the first half.","Before I turn the call back over to George, let me update you on the close of the Power Solutions transaction as outlined on Page 16. The net proceeds from the transaction are now $11.6 billion, which was $200 million better than our original projections as we were able to bring our cash taxes down by approximately $200 million. Our intended use to these net proceeds remains unchanged with a debt pay down of $3.4 billion and $8 billion plus of share repurchases.","As you saw in our press release this morning, we did announce a debt tender offering in the amount of $1.5 billion, which we expect to complete in early -- by early June. The other $1.9 billion in debt reduction will occur via normal pay down of debt maturities and commercial paper pay down over the course of the next several weeks. This debt pay down will result in $40 million of interest save in fiscal '19 with a run rate annualized benefit of over $100 million.","Additionally, we noted in the press release this morning that we intend to launch a share tender for up to $4 billion with a price range of $36 to $40 a share. All pertinent details will be filed in a formal offer document later this week. On a final point, I would just like to indicate to you that given the size of the share tender in Q3, it will have a significant impact on our weighted average share count, particularly in the fourth quarter on a standalone basis. As a result, some of our quarterly EPS will not equal the full-year guidance midpoint that we provided in the 1.85 to 1.95.","As you know, our full-year guidance is based upon a weighted average share count for a 12 months, which is now expected to be 880 million shares. And just to frame this for you, in the first quarter, we had $0.26 EPS, in the second quarter we had $0.32 EPS, for the third quarter we expect to have in the low $0.60 EPS, and in the fourth quarter we expect to be in the mid 70s. If you add those up, you end up at about $1.95 and again that is going to be higher than the midpoint of the guidance we gave because of the impact of the fourth quarter share account as a result of the share tender. So finally, we're committed to reduce our corporate costs by about $50 million by the end of fiscal '20.","And with that, let me turn the call back over to George.","George Oliver","Thanks, Brian. Before we open up the lines for questions, just a quick update on our 2019 guidance starting with our EPS walk on Slide 17. The only change to our bridge versus what we shared with you last quarter is the EPS benefit associated with the use of proceeds related to the Power sale. With the earlier close, we've updated all of our assumptions with respect to net interest savings associated with our planned debt reductions as well as the reduction in share count, we should be able to achieve with our planned share tender.","There are no changes to any of our operating assumptions or other below the line items. The additional $0.10 benefit from use of proceeds results in an increase to our adjusted EPS from continuing operations range to $1.85 to $1.95. This represents year-over-year EPS growth of 16% to 23%. Just to reaffirm some of the details of our underlying operating assumptions on Slide 18, again you will see there are no changes with the exception of the two items we\u2019ve a boxed for you.","And just a few final comments before we get to your questions. We are encouraged by our performance year-to-date and feel very confident in our outlook for the second half. Our end markets due remain healthy. Our competitive position is strong and we are well-positioned. As we close an important chapter in the history of Johnson Controls with the Power Solution sale, we're extremely excited to capitalize on the opportunities we have in front of us as one of the industry's leading building solution providers.","With that, let me turn it over to our operator to open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Thank you. The first question in the queue is from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.","Nigel Coe","Thanks. Good morning and congratulations on closing the deal early.","Brian Stief","Thanks, Nigel.","George Oliver","Good morning, Nigel.","Nigel Coe","Good morning, guys. I\u2019m not that familiar with the modified Dutch auction process. Maybe just why $4 billion, if you kind of push up to $8 billion, could it not have been up to closer to the $8 billion number. And then, does -- once it's closed, does that in anyway restrict you on further repurchases in the open market, ASRs or deal flow?","Brian Stief","So as it relates to the modified Dutch auction, I mean, the way that process works, that will be launched this week. And as I mentioned, it's got a floor price of 36, and it's got a top end price of 40. And as the book gets built over the next 20 business days or so, we would expect that tender to be completed sometime in early June. As far as the amount of the tender itself, I mean that was -- there's a lot of discussions with our -- among the management team here and outside advisors regarding what the right limit is for going into the market and buying back shares at this time. And I think $4 billion was a number that we all landed on. I would just point out that there's an opportunity for us to upsize that by $500 million should we decide to do that. So right now I think in terms of $4 billion to $4.5 billion, but our initial play is going to be at the $4 billion level and we'll see how demand plays out. And your second part of the question, Nigel? I\u2019m sorry it was what?","Nigel Coe","Yes, Brian, so thanks for the detail. Just -- does it in anyway bind you from a time period on further repurchases, so M&A any restrictions following the close of the deal?","Brian Stief","No, not at all. Not at all. There's -- the implications of the tender really provide us more optionality after the tender is complete to decide if we move forward share repurchases what approach we may use.","Nigel Coe","Great. And then just my follow on is, George, here, obviously, you\u2019re expressing a high degree of confidence in your end markets and the order flow. Turning to your short cycle businesses within products, I mean, in '15, '16 we did see some pressure from channel from oil and gas pressures in some of the businesses. Have you seen any signs of pressure in some of the shorter cycle businesses?","George Oliver","Not at all, Nigel. If anything, we\u2019ve seen a very robust market within these businesses. If you look at our -- mainly in our Fire & Security product businesses, we are up low teens and that\u2019s across both all three of the key platforms here, fire detection, security as well as in specialty products with our fire suppression business. In addition, that\u2019s supported with the field up above mid single digits and that's pretty much broad-based across the globe. So there's really no signs right know on the short cycle metrics that would suggest that there's any significant slowdown here.","Nigel Coe","Great. Thanks very much.","Operator","Next question is from Gautam Khanna with Cowen & Company. Your line is now open.","Jeffrey Molinari","Good morning. This is Jeff on for Gautam. Thanks for taking my question here.","George Oliver","Good morning, Jeff.","Jeffrey Molinari","So a quick one on the Power proceeds. What's baked into your guide assumption as far as the debt reduction? Is it the $1.5 billion or the $3.4 billion? And also what about -- which -- what repo assumption is baked into that guide, the math like a tender dollar amount for '19?","Brian Stief","Yes. So the debt pay down, so $11.6 billion is net proceeds. Debt pay down is $3.4 billion. The $1.5 billion is actually a tender that's part of the $3.4 billion to buy back that debt. The remaining $1. 9 billion will be taken out over the next several weeks through either normal maturities of debt or commercial paper pay down. So $3.4 billion of debt which will generate $40 million a save this year in annual run rate of a $100 million. As far as the share repurchase, what\u2019s baked into the guidance we've given you is $4 billion in a tender that will be taken out by early June. And then the remaining $4.2 billion we had to make some assumptions relative to what we were earning to calculate our guidance based upon. So we've assumed the remaining $4.2 billion for now will be put on our balance sheet in some intro on -- some interest earning investment. And then as we make final decisions on what approach in share repurchase we\u2019re going to use, we will update the guidance accordingly.","Jeffrey Molinari","Okay. That\u2019s clear. So any -- that would be incremental. And then maybe one on order pipeline, if I may. So you mentioned Q3 orders are tracking mid to high single digits. Can you kind of dissect that a little bit by HVAC product like unitary, applied, resi, kind of which is the strongest or just any color there would be helpful? Thank you.","George Oliver","Yes, when you look at our -- if you just look at what played through in Q2 is that strong product growth and that\u2019s been pretty much across the board, double-digit growth in our building management systems. Mid to upper single-digit growth in our HVAC platform, and as we talked about in our specialty products, we had nice double-digit growth. So that\u2019s continuing. When you look at our field and our installations as well as service, it's broad-based across all of the domains with the project pipeline that\u2019s been building and what we\u2019ve been able to convert here in the quarter and what we see in the pipeline to convert here in the third and fourth quarter. So it's -- obviously, we are performing very well in HVAC. When you look at our HVAC businesses across the globe, I would say that we are beginning to really accelerate our performance and then with that we're seeing the volumes come through. That is putting a little bit of -- from a mix standpoint at the gross margin level, a little bit of pressure on our business, but overall we\u2019ve been performing well. So just to sum up, I would say, it's broad based. It's across all domains, across all regions and a nice split between both project based business as well as service business with service grown above 5%.","Operator","Next question is from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Your line is now open.","Jeffrey Sprague","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","George Oliver","Good morning, Jeff.","Jeffrey Sprague","Good morning. George, you made a comment in your opening remarks about I think operating leverage really picking up or kicking in the higher gear or words to that effect in the back half. I just wondered if you could elaborate on that a little bit more right from our seat, kind of the observed incremental just that the segment levels 28%, which is solid underneath that its actually better, right, with the currency and other noise. But it's not clear to me from the guide that we would observe much more than high 20s, maybe it's 30-ish or so in the back half. But any other color on all those dynamics, the leverage, how price cost is playing through and how to think about how that scales up into the back half will be helpful.","George Oliver","Let me start by saying that when you look at our incremental margins today, Jeff, they were actually in the low 20s and that\u2019s before productivity and investments. So when you look at the mix of that, it's really driven by high teens within our field businesses and upper -- mid to upper 20s in our product base businesses. And so on a go forward basis, when we look at what we're doing both from a pricing standpoint and productivity standpoint, we are -- we\u2019ve a roadmap to get those businesses on the incremental margins to mid 20s. And that's driven by getting our field businesses up to 20% plus in our product base businesses, up to 30% plus over the next couple of years. Now recognize when you look at our price -- pricing activity this year, we made significant progress. Last year we got behind and for the year we were negative. I think it was roughly about $35 million. Now with all of the actions that we took in the second half of last year and then we\u2019ve continued that this year taken into account not only the inflationary pressures, but also the tariffs, we feel very confident that through the course of the year that\u2019s going to continue to accrete margins pretty much across the board and very confident of that. So when you look at the year, we are going to continue to grow kind of mid single digits across the board. That levers nicely. So it's -- when you look at the total year, it's about 30 basis points of leverage. It's about 60 basis points of productivity in synergies that somewhat offset with the reinvestments that we're making, that kind of the business through sales force as well as technology. We do have a little bit of pension headwind and that nets us to being able to achieve about 40 to 60 basis points for the year across all of the businesses.","Jeffrey Sprague","Great. Thanks for that additional detail. And then just back to redeployment, as I\u2019m sure you know, HVAC consolidation speculation has been ramped for the better part of six months or so. Can you just update us on your view on that? It would seem going ahead with plan A on the tender and the debt reduction would be a fairly clear indication that in the near-term you don't see an opportunity there, but I don\u2019t want to put words into your mouth. Just what do you see kind of the optionality moving forward for this pure play building efficiency company that you\u2019ve created.","George Oliver","Yes. So, I mean, when I look at where we are, it's been as I\u2019ve communicated multiple times, we are very much focused on execution. We have an incredible portfolio that has historically underperformed. We are beginning to accelerate our performance, beginning to get more consistent performance, delivering on our commitments and as I said there's tremendous runway here as we continue to improve. And that\u2019s been the focus. And so when we announce that we were going to redeploy the proceeds not only in the debt pay down, but also the buybacks it's believing that we\u2019ve got a lot of opportunity here in front of us. We did announce the $4 billion tender. And as Brian mentioned, we'll see how that plays out and we have every intend here to continue with the plan that we have to buy back up to roughly $8.2 billion in buybacks. Now relative to the industry, certainly a lots of speculation. I\u2019m not going to speculate on it. Certainly, when I stepped up to take over, we recognize that the building space is a very attractive end market and we had tremendous opportunity to reinvest and be able to deliver on growth. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on doing. And as you\u2019ve seen others, they\u2019re doing similar, right? They\u2019re streamlining their portfolios and positioning to do the same. But at this stage, I think we have a tremendous opportunity with the investments we've made and the continued investments we're making to be able to deliver a strong performance.","Jeffrey Sprague","Great. Thank you for the color.","Operator","Next question is from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Steve Tusa","Hey, good morning.","Antonella Franzen","Good morning, Steve.","George Oliver","Good morning, Steve.","Steve Tusa","Can you maybe just talk about what you're seeing in China. You put up some pretty good growth there. Obviously, the order slowed a little bit, but maybe just delve into a bit of the dynamics there on HVAC?","George Oliver","Yes, let me start, Steve, by saying it's roughly about 6% of our total revenues and it's broken out into about two thirds in the field and a third in products. And so we were -- this is something we\u2019re watching closely, because as things with all of the trade discussions and maybe seeing a little bit of the slow down we were concerned for the year. I think through the course of second quarter, we are feeling a little bit better that I think as Brian went through the segment, we are seeing good order growth, good pipeline development. And then from a revenue standpoint, we actually did better than what we originally thought and how we converted revenue in the quarter. And so we still want to make sure that we\u2019re watching this closely to make sure that with the investments we're making there, that -- they\u2019re going to play out as planned. But at this stage and the other part I notice from a service standpoint not only is it important to get higher market share in the install base, but we've been very much focused on getting the service revenues. And so right now it is ramping up. It's about a third of our revenues in China. We see this as a big opportunity going forward, especially as we -- if we were to get into a down cycle, this would be a very attractive segment for us.","Steve Tusa","Thanks for that. Also just following up on Jeff's question, how do you view the market share dynamics of commercial? I know there is really only three major applied guys -- applied suppliers in the U.S. But obviously applied is kind of a loose term, if you will, it's customized work. I mean, when you kind of look at the market structure, do you look at it as three major players in the U.S and pretty consolidated or do you look at it as there's various verticals within, in which there are kind of a range of solutions that compete in those markets. Does that make -- does that question make any sense whatsoever?","George Oliver","Yes. Let me give it a shot. Let me start with the residential, because I think it builds into the commercial. Residential is a space that we\u2019re obviously not in the top two or three. And this is based that we\u2019ve been reinvesting in North America with new product and as well as expanding our distribution and that\u2019s playing through pretty nicely. Our residential North America business was up 11% and that\u2019s to a tough prior year comp.","Steve Tusa","Right.","George Oliver","And a lot of that not only is the technology and the product, but also of course would be the pricing increases that we've seen here over in the last 12 to 18 months. Now if we talk about commercial, this is where we\u2019ve been relatively strong and then there are three key players here in this space. Certainly that we had over the last decade had underinvested. Over the last two or three years, we\u2019ve significantly ramped up that investment. And I believe with the products that you see coming to market now are going to be very well-positioned to be able to gain more of that share. A big focus, our strength here is in national accounts, so there might be some segmentation of the market with how we serve customers. But I think when you look at our commercial HVAC equipment, it's up 13%.","Steve Tusa","Yes, I guess, I\u2019m just asking about market structure. I guess a very simple way to ask it a little bit -- put it a little bit more of a finer point. Is it consolidated or am I -- are we looking at it the wrong way? Should it be segmented in a, hey, there are various solutions for these buildings, and so it's not as saturated or consolidated as it would look when we just talk about a chiller, which is basically Carrier, York and Trane, right? That\u2019s kind of what I\u2019m asking.","George Oliver","Well, I mean, when you look at the commercial space, what I would say, it's similar. When you look at the landscape within the market, its similar to the applied space we have five or six key players. Now there's differing footprints and different product mixes within that, but there's mainly five or six key players within the commercial space.","Steve Tusa","Okay. Would you consider that that saturated and consolidated or not?","George Oliver","I\u2019m not going to -- I mean, at this stage I think I\u2019m not going to speculate, Steve, relative to each of the players in the market positions. But what I would say is that we're focused on the investments we're making and making sure that we've got the right footprint in how we go to market to be able gain market share and grow within the key end markets that we\u2019re serving.","Steve Tusa","Okay, fair enough. Thanks a lot.","George Oliver","All right.","Operator","Next question is from Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Your line is now open.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Hey, good morning, guys.","George Oliver","Good morning, Andy.","Antonella Franzen","Good morning.","Andrew Kaplowitz","George, despite the slowing in field order in the quarter, you obviously seemed quite positive about your pipeline. You made a comment in the presentation, I think for the first time around your field backlog that you now have some visibility into fiscal '20? Could you elaborate on what that means? Do you have enough projects now in backlog where you feel that field sales growth has a good chance of continuing to grow in the mid single-digit range in 2020?","George Oliver","Yes, let me start by saying that when we book projects, on the short end, they turn within three to six months or some can be multi-year. Our average project turn is somewhere around depending on the mix, it's typically about a year. So we are now building a pipeline, as I said, we\u2019ve a very strong pipeline. Pipelines were up high single digits. We continue to add sales force. Now we\u2019re maintaining our sales cost as a percent of revenue now, because we\u2019re getting productivity with the sales force that we had added last year. So in line with that, we continue to expand our sales force. We are going after this pipeline, converting the pipeline and what we are turning now, we have some projects that will support the second half, but there is -- a lot of the projects that we are executing today that will set us up with backlog for 2020. And so, that\u2019s what gives me confidence that as we continue to execute through 2019 that we will see that -- we will see continued progress here as we are setting up 2020.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Okay, George. At this point though in the year, you would say above the average visibility into the next year versus what you've seen?","George Oliver","Absolutely. I mean, we have -- we are halfway through the year. Like I said and with the pipelines that we have, all of our pipelines attract across the board now. We can see that by segmentation, by region, by install, by service and through our regular reviews, monthly reviews, I'm very encouraged in our ability to be able to continue to support the execution through the second half of 2019, but even more important now, setting up for that continuing in 2020.","Andrew Kaplowitz","And Brian, I just wanted to ask you about cash flow. Obviously, you\u2019ve kept the guide at 95% conversion. Seasonally, we'd expect a bigger ramp up in the second half of the year. You talked in the past about needing to go after pockets of inventory that you have in your business, maybe standardizing cash collection in some of your smaller markets and collecting more from your JVs. So can you give us the confidence level that you have to get more cash out of your business in these areas, and how important are they to reach the goal for the year?","Brian Stief","I think if you look at last year and the third quarter, our free cash flow, adjusted free cash flow was $0.5 billion. We are expecting about $600 million in Q3 of this year. And then last year Q4 was about $900 million and we're expecting -- I'm rounding number here, $1 billion, $1 billion plus in Q4 of this year. So with those numbers, we deliver the 95% free cash flow. I would tell you from the standpoint of improvements that we are making, if you look at year-over-year trade working capital as a percentage of sales, we\u2019ve made a 40 basis point improvement in March of last year to March of this year. And I also look at things sequentially and sequentially we've gone from 12.1% at the end of the first quarter to 12% at the end of the second quarter. So, we are seeing improvements in trade working capital as a percentage of sales. Now having said that, if I look at trade working capital globally and where we've made progress with our cash management office over the last 15 months or so, I would tell you that payables, we standardize terms with our vendors. I think we've got things in really good working order in most major locations as it relates to payables. When I look at inventory, I would say there's probably a couple of pockets, one in Japan, one in North America that we need to go to work on. But we are talking huge numbers. It's probably $50 million to $100 million of opportunity. And the area that I think we really can continue to improve on is accounts receivable and we've kind of got all hands on deck on that as we speak and we are going to see that gradually improve and actually that improvement is what\u2019s driving some of the year-over-year improvement that we are going to see in the back half of this year versus the back half of last year. And then the last thing I'd say relative to joint venture dividends, we continue to have conversations with our joint venture partners, regarding whether or not we take out current dividends or reinvest those in the business and we will update you as we move through the rest of the year. Most of those conversations take place in the back half of our fiscal year with decisions made at that time. So we are hopeful that over the next several months here, that we can get some positive developments relative to our joint venture dividends as well. But that\u2019s all kind of baked into our 95% guidance we provided.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Appreciate all the color. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Next question is from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","David Lu","Good morning, everyone. This is David Lu on for Deane. I just have one question. I know you mentioned orders tracking on mid to high-single digits for the third quarter, but did you see any level of pull-in of customer spending from the second half of the year into the first half to get ahead of tariffs or price increases? Any material impact there?","George Oliver","No, I think we saw a normal flow in the quarter and we track these year-on-year, but nothing unusual or significant as far as that.","Antonella Franzen","David, the only thing we talked about last quarter remember is in North America we did see some pull-forward from Q2 to Q1, but nothing from second half into first half.","David Lu","Got it. And then if I can just sneak one more in. Any update on tariff headwinds? I know the list three tariffs kind of stay at the 10% range, but you were projecting for I think 130 to 140 of total headwinds between 2018 and 2019. Could we potentially see some upside from lower cost increases here?","George Oliver","That\u2019s about the range that on a 2-year basis the impact that we are seeing, and as I've said earlier that, we are well positioned from a pricing standpoint to offset those. Certainly, we\u2019ve been planning our supply chain so that on a go-forward basis, we can mitigate some of that. But our plan right now is we are planning for these tariffs and that\u2019s what ultimately is in our guidance.","David Lu","Great. Thank you very much.","George Oliver","Thank you.","Operator","Next question is from Tim Wojs with Baird. Your line is now open.","Tim Wojs","Hi, everybody. Good morning.","Antonella Franzen","Good morning, Tim.","George Oliver","Good morning, Tim.","Tim Wojs","Just wanted to go back to pricing and just try to -- George, is there a way to kind of frame what pricing in backlog and your orders is right now versus what might be running through the P&L or what that looked like maybe a year-ago?","George Oliver","Yes. So, the easiest way to frame it up is a year-ago pricing on our revenue was -- impacted our revenue by 1% to 2% and then pricing this year is going to be 2% to 3%. And so, think about it as an order of magnitude what\u2019s coming through on price. And so that is in our product businesses, it's shorter cycle. So you see the realization quicker. You will see realization on service increases quicker and then the one that's been more of a -- of a cycle time impact is the work we are doing around our installation project-based business.","Tim Wojs","Okay. Okay, great. And then, I think you had mentioned this, but I missed it. On the gross margins is -- I think they\u2019re down slightly year-on-year, year-to-date. Is that really more a function of mix relative to price cost or anything else that\u2019s kind of running through there?","George Oliver","Yes, the two areas that we\u2019ve had the pressure, let me start with APAC. It's been -- mainly we\u2019ve been foreshadowing that here this year because of what we had in backlog. That\u2019s going to play out in the second half of the year, but with the work we are doing that will begin to improve and we will see that in 2020. The other is the mix of -- when you look at North America -- when you look at the domain together, we are performing in HVAC very well, and at the gross margin level, that's less in Fire & Security. But other than that, we are getting price and margin expansion across all domains and across all regions in the plan as we execute on the second half.","Tim Wojs","Great. Well, good luck on the second half. Thanks.","Antonella Franzen","Thanks.","George Oliver","Thanks.","Operator","Next question is from Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Josh Pokrzywinski","Hi. Good morning, guys.","Brian Stief","Good morning.","Antonella Franzen","Good morning, Josh.","George Oliver","Hey, Josh.","Josh Pokrzywinski","We\u2019ve covered a lot of ground on the quarter, maybe shifting gears thinking about where we are at in the cycle. I think one of your competitors yesterday -- I will put words in their mouth a little bit, it seems like we are in a bit of a golden age for HVAC and kind of building investment in general that between energy, efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions that folks are just spending a lot more and putting a lot more attention on that, which seems to favor the JCI portfolio. Within that, do you feel like you are winning your entitlement or have you seen new entrants or kind of new product lines pop up in the space? First question there.","George Oliver","So, you are absolutely right. The opportunity that we have around sustainability and energy reduction does play to our strengths. I highlighted a couple of examples that we\u2019ve recently won. We are executing with the University of Hawaii and the other is a new project that is all focused on sustainability and being the smartest building in the Middle East. So the reason why we are well positioned not only do we have leadership HVAC, which as we know is a significant consumption of energy, but that combined with our building management systems and our ability to optimize not only the equipment, but beyond the equipment, the rest -- the use of the building is what ultimately delivers on the vision of our customers. And so what I would tell you is that in our building management systems, we had double-digit growth. I mean we are at low teens in the quarter. And that's the way that we serve the market today. What\u2019s happening is, as we move forward, those capabilities are converging. It's enabling us now to use our digital vault, which is our proprietary cloud-based data solution to be able to deliver on what I would say is entitlement of energy reduction. And so for us, I think in spite of the cycle, that\u2019s going to be an attractive space for us and one that we are well positioned.","Josh Pokrzywinski","Got it. So you don\u2019t see anything competitively changing or new entrants or anything like that?","George Oliver","No, what I would say is that it's a combination of having leadership product, having technology platforms and then having a footprint in the key markets that you're serving that is close to customers and being able to take their vision with ours and convert it into what the next generation solution is going to be and that\u2019s what we are doing.","Josh Pokrzywinski","Got it. And then just to pivot a little bit off of that, how pleased are you today with your mix, George? I think looking at some of the other folks in the HVAC landscape or in the buildings landscape, you do a bit more your own installation and you have kind of a wider range of service from the super high-end stuff to I think the things that would be maybe a bit more locally competitive. Within this kind of new regime for building investment, do you think JCI's organization does too much, too little, the right amount as it pertains to kind of product mix and what that ultimately means for operating leverage?","George Oliver","So let me just simplify it. When you look at the portfolio, we are about -- say about 40% installed, about 35% or 30% service and about 25% product. And what I would tell you is the investments we are making product is to put ourselves in a leadership position across each of the platforms. I think we are making great progress. We are now where we would like to be, but we are on track to the plan that we\u2019ve got in place with the reinvestments. And if you look at our -- and that is core not only for our direct channel, but also making sure that we leverage all distribution to lead the industry. The second is our field based businesses. We\u2019ve got an incredible footprint across the globe and it's not only leveraging the product, but also our technology platforms that enable us to bring compelling solutions that ultimately drives sustainability, energy reduction and ultimately efficiency for the customers that we serve. And while we\u2019ve done well, especially during the cycle is that we\u2019ve had significant growth in our installed business, creating that installed base and what I\u2019ve been doing here since I've taken over is, put a big focus on service, that are field-based businesses we have significant opportunity to expand our services and how we service that installed base. And so that is an another area that we believe that we can -- there's a lot of room to grow. It's very attractive from a margin standpoint and it's going to be a key contributor to our long-term success.","Josh Pokrzywinski","Great. Thanks. I will leave it there.","Antonella Franzen","Great. Operator, I'd like to turn the call over to George for some closing comments.","George Oliver","So, thanks again all of you for joining our call this morning. As I said earlier, our end markets remain healthy. We are strengthening our competitive position, and I believe we are well positioned not only for the remainder of this year, but setting up 2020. We are very excited now with the sale of Power Solutions to capitalize on the opportunities that we have in front of us and truly position Johnson Controls as the industry's leading building solutions provider. So on that, I look forward to seeing many of you soon, and operator that concludes our call.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s call. Thank you for your participation.

Sir, you may begin.","Glen Ponczak","Thank you, Pat. Well, good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. Before we begin in the call today, I'd like to remind you that Johnson Controls will make forward-looking statements in this presentation pertaining to its financial results for fiscal 2012 and beyond that are based on preliminary data and are subject to risks and uncertainties. All statements other than statements of historical fact are statements that are or could be deemed forward-looking statements and include terms such as outlook, expectations, estimates and forecasts.","For those statements, the company cautions that numerous important factors such as automotive vehicle production levels, mix and schedules, energy and commodity prices, the strength of the U.S. or other economies, currency exchange rates, cancellation of or changes to commercial contracts, changes in timing or levels of investments in commercial buildings, as well as other factors discussed in Item 1A of Part 1 of the company's most recent Form 10-K filing, which was filed November 22, 2011, could affect the company's actual results and could cause its actual consolidated results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statement made by, or on behalf of, the company.","In a few moments, I'll turn it over to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Steve Roell, who will give us an overview of the quarter and some of the market conditions. After that, Bruce McDonald, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will do a more in-depth review of the business results and provide an overview of the financial performance in the quarter. That will be followed by questions and answers, and we will end at the top of the hour.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Steve.","Stephen A. Roell","Okay. Well, thank you, Glen, and good morning, and thank you for joining us on the call. This morning, in our third fiscal quarter results, we reported that earnings were up 50%, record levels for the period. And I just want to start by expressing my appreciation to the JCI employees, that listen to this broadcast, for their contributions to our results. But I also want to quickly acknowledge that we fell short of the guidance that we provided on the call just 3 months ago, and we'll go through some of the details that led to that.","But during the quarter, there were many times where we were confident in our ability to achieve that 20% growth that we projected. But ultimately, the slowdown in the European market and the escalation of lead cost in our Power Solutions business were just too much to overcome. Now, I guess, I would just as a comment here tell you that, that the shortfall from the guidance we provided to you, we could easily explain just by -- simply by the Power Solutions business shortfall in lead. And I'll explain to you what that is in just a second.","If we look at the numbers, in terms of the results, sales of $10.6 billion were slightly higher than last year. If we adjust for foreign exchange, our growth was 7% year-over-year. As the slide indicates the impact from a standpoint of pure dollars was about $515 million just due to FX.","Our segment income increased 14% to $615 million. That yielded net income of $466 million, a 15% increase. These are all non-GAAP numbers. We think these are the more accurate numbers to look at. EPS was $0.64 per share. You can see there how they compared to the $0.56 a year ago.","Now let me turn to the market conditions that are impacting our business and how they're likely to affect our upcoming quarter. In general, I guess, I make the statement that we've seen demand slow across several of our industries and geographic markets. Clearly, the one exception has been the North American auto market, where production was up 27% in the third quarter. But I think even that good news is tempered by the most recent outlook for the current quarter, our fourth fiscal quarter where production growth is expected to slow to about 4%.","The European market, auto market in the quarter continued to soften with industry sales declining 5%. And that pressure, as you can imagine, is expected to continue.","And turning to the Building side, nonresidential building markets are not recovering at the rate that we had originally anticipated. And we've had to align our spending and cost structure accordingly. I think we've talked about that throughout the fiscal year. I think Dave and his team have done a great job of doing that, as evidenced by their improvement this quarter. But just turning back to the industry, domestic growth in the first 9 months for us has really been concentrated in state, local and federal government sectors, as well as the commercial buildings, airports and life sciences.","But the institutional sector of education and healthcare, where we have a very strong presence, has declined. And I know some of you that follow the building market are probably familiar with the Dodge Report, and its projected that the institutional market will contract 10% in calendar 2012. Again, for those of you who also follow that sector recognize that the Architectural Billings Index has stagnated the last 3 months after being up 5 months prior to that.","International building markets, we continue to see good growth in Asia and the Middle East. The Western Europe remains depressed, particularly in Southern Europe, and I think you all understand what's happening there.","I want to go back down and explain to you what we saw at -- in the Power Solutions business relative to lead. We normally don't talk about lead. We haven't had to talk about junk batteries again for a long time. We saw something that was very uncharacteristic; we haven't experienced in some time, and that is just a lack of retail activity at the aftermarket where we are dependent upon collecting what we call junk batteries or cores. Now we need that -- those cores and junk to be able to recycle those to produce new batteries and provide those to our tollers and also to supply our smelters.","That demand, or I should say that the lack of retail, which has been really uncharacteristic across-the-board in North America has resulted in a shortage of cores. We haven't seen that before. And as a result, we had to go through and actually pay up to get that -- to get the cores we needed to meet our tolling arrangements, as well as to start up our smelter operations.","I'm going to tell you that year-over-year, that impact is roughly $40 million. So if you dollar out -- put a dollar or a percent share on that, that will explain almost the entire shortfall that we didn't expect coming into the period. It's a timing issue. We know the cores will come. We know that as soon as retail picks back up, we'll see that in the fall and winter, so we expect that not to continue -- extend beyond the current quarter. We are seeing it continue in the month of July and that\u2019s part of our concern about the fourth quarter forecast.","But I wanted to just highlight that, that issue of buying cores and at the prices we had to pay, is a $40 million decline in earnings year-over-year in that segment. And that really was not expected in our forecast when we provided you the guidance in -- back in April.","But there certainly are a number of our businesses that are performing exceptionally well. Most notably were the 5 business categories that comprise our Building Efficiency segment, where each of them achieved double-digit earning increases. In total, that segment, as you saw, was up -- income was up 28%. We believe we're gaining share by virtue of the backlog growth that we saw in the orders that we\u2019ve had this quarter.","I'm also encouraged by the bidding activity. We talk oftentimes about our pipeline, and I continue to see that pipeline improving, which may be contrary to what you would expect. And I even see it improving in some of the institutional sectors that we monitor.","I also expect Building Efficiency to show margin improvement again in the fourth quarter. We've guided that all year that we said it would be in second half. I think you saw that happen in a big way in Q3.","Contrary to what you're hearing from some other markets and industries regarding China, I would have to tell you that China is performing -- our markets there are performing very consistent with what we expected as we are coming in the fiscal year. I'm talking primarily around Building Efficiency and Automotive Experience. Bruce will highlight some of the increases we had. But at this point in time, we see the China market performing and holding up well for us.","In the near term, higher temperatures are driving HVAC service demand; that did not happen in June. We're hoping to see some of that in July and August. We're seeing the shortening battery life, certainty from the higher temps, which will bode well for us in the upcoming year. And certainly, it's supporting our growth in the residential air conditioning markets, which again, Bruce will highlight for you.","In recognition of some of the market conditions, we opted to take a $52 million restructuring charge in Q3, primarily to reduce our staffing in Europe and building efficiency in automotive. We're currently planning to take further action in Q4, and again, a lot of that or a high proportion of it is tied to what we see in the European market softening in the view that, that market is going to remain soft for the midterm.","And certainly, we faced in -- it has basically caused us in Q4 to lower earnings guidance to the 0 to 5% growth. The factors that prompted us to change our projections come -- from the previous guidance are as follows: First would be the weaker battery demand early in the quarter and the higher lead cost. I mentioned to you that what we saw in Q3, we've seen continue in the month of July. We're seeing increasing weakness in our European businesses. It's difficult to get improvement in the automotive metals business in Q4 because of the shutdown period and lower production levels. And in general, I think we're just to the point where we're seeing things like commercial negotiations extend longer in automotive. So it's just a number of factors and we looked at those, and said it's time for us just to go back and let's be a little more conservative and if they come fine, but we're having difficulty forecasting the timing of some of these issues. And so we thought it best just to lower the guidance, and we'll see. But I do want to come back and also highlight our midterm and long-term views.","The next slide really covers that. I want to just go through that real quickly with you. The things we've talked about in the past that drive our stock and drive our performance are still intact. We have a strong position in SLI batteries; we have the ability to drive higher margins. We\u2019ve talked about the vertical integration investments we're making, and again, those are all on track, and we believe they'll be -- they'll bode well for us in 2013 and '14.","Investments we're making in AGM battery technology to support our customer demand for Start-Stop vehicles continues to gain momentum. We're well positioned and market leaders in all the emerging -- in the emerging markets in all 3 of our businesses. Higher automotive margins via our seating metals strategy. We believe that, that's still a core strategy and key to us as we drive to a core product portfolio and standardization. And finally, Building Efficiency with its market share gains through it's -- our ability to help our customers improve energy efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas footprints. So those are again the factors we've talked to you about that are the core to Johnson Controls and our long-term strategy and value, and we believe those are all intact. We just have to deal with some of the headwinds in the near term.","So with that, I want to have Bruce go through and highlight some of the third quarter by-business results. Bruce?","R. Bruce McDonald","Okay. Thanks, Steve. Well, good morning. As you'll note in our press release, we did have a couple of nonoperational items this year and last year and I'll maybe just talk on those. So for this year, they netted to a charge of about $0.03. And as Steve indicated in his comments, some $52 million of restructuring charges. And we also had some nonrecurring tax benefits of $22 million, which reflect valuation allowance releases in certain foreign jurisdictions associated with improved levels of profitability.","In the year-ago quarter, you'll recall we had a $0.04 charge associated with the acquisition of Keiper. And so as I really talk through the 3 business segment here, I'm going to exclude these items from my comments.","So starting off with Building Efficiency. I'd say, overall, superb quarter here, especially when we look at the state of the major markets that they participate in. Sales were down 2%. If you back out foreign exchange, we are actually up about 1%. We saw good revenue growth in both GWS, which was up 7% in Asia, up 7%. Again, those numbers are without foreign exchange, although this was largely offset with softness in Latin America, Europe and the Middle East.","In aggregate, if you look at our North American businesses, I mean, I'm talking about our systems and services business that focus on the nonresidential markets, we were down about 2% in the quarter. Residential was a bright spot for us. That's one of our higher-margin businesses. And you can see on our slide, we've talked about the fact that our revenue was up 24%. On a unit shipments basis, we're up about 20%. I guess, what I would note, if you look at the mix within our residential business, what you're seeing is the sales of the lower efficiency-type products are doing exceptionally well. If you look at the higher end, the energy efficiency furnaces and air conditioners, well, those volumes are comparable to year-ago levels. So really seeing, I guess, a trading down phenomenon in the residential space. But nonetheless, it's good to see the volume start to finally improve after several years of sluggish demand there.","Look at the segment income, up 28% at $264 million. If you look at our margins here, we're up about 160 basis points to 6.9%. And as Steve mentioned in his comments, all 5 of the business segments within Building Efficiency reported double-digit margin improvement with GWS and North America kind of leading the way here, up 86% and 49%, respectively.","If you really look at what the drivers were there, we saw better labor utilization of our service workforce. We started to see the benefits of some of the technology investments that we've made in our North America services business. And also several of the restructuring initiatives that we've taken over the last few quarters, a dividend for us in the third quarter here.","Turning to Power Solutions. We had a tough quarter, as Steve mentioned in his remarks, really reflecting the weak demand outlook, particularly here in North America. If we looked at our point-of-sale data from our customers, what we're seeing, our sales to our customers are down 2% or 3%. What we're seeing at point-of-sale, unfortunately, here is volumes being down 8% to 10%, particularly in May and June and as we start into July here. So we've got a little bit of an inventory buildup in the channel, the aftermarket retail channels here in North America. And that, combined with the lead, are 2 factors that are going to carry over here in the fourth quarter. So we're hoping that, that inventory bulge kind of blows through here in the fourth quarter. The lead issue is a one-quarter phenomena, so we're hoping we get back into the Q1 of 2013 more in balance here.","If you look at the revenues, down 2% -- or sorry, up 2%, excluding foreign currency. Unit shipments were -- had a good performance in OE side, North America really leading the way, but in aggregate, up 4%; aftermarket, up just 2%. Looking at the segment income, down 9%. There\u2019s where we really saw the impact of the spent cores in terms of the impact on our results. It has kind of exasperated for us here as we start up the launch of our South Carolina smelter in this quarter. I guess, I'd just remind folks that in Power Solutions, we're on LIFO basis. So we have to think about the startup of the facility. We have to buy roughly one million units at the current prevailing market rates, which are extremely high. Unfortunately, when we bookkeep that, we put them into inventory at our long-ago historic cost. And that really drives a charge in the quarter. And as Steve said, if you look at the second -- third quarter here, the impact is about $0.05 a share just from this lead issue.","Turning to Automotive Experience. We did deliver a solid quarter here, although I would acknowledge it was below our expectations, really due to the deteriorations that we're starting to see in the European market and the weaker euro. Look at our sales increases by territory. We saw sales up overall, 7%, 13% if you sort of back out foreign currency. And there's where you really see the impact of our backlog flowing through the revenue line.","If you look at it geographically, in North America, we are up 31% against a 27% industry increase. If you'll recall, that number seems very high. If you really look behind the details, what you see is the Japanese customers really bouncing back from the depressed levels associated with the tsunami last year.","Europe, if we take out currency, we were flat versus a 5% lower industry production level. And in Asia, we're up 24%. And as Steve said in his comments, we were pleased to see our results in China do well for us. For automotive, if you look at our sales, which are primarily through nonconsolidated joint ventures, we're up 24% to $1.2 billion. And you kind of need to compare that against passenger car volume, which in the quarter we\u2019re up about 13%. So again, good strong outperformance in all 3 of our geographic territories versus the market.","Turning to segment income. We're up about 18% to $202 million. We did benefit from higher volumes in North America and Asia. But this was partially offset by Europe where we swung back into a loss position in the quarter. If you look at the issues that we're facing in Europe, we did start to see some of the impacts of lower volumes. If you listened in to our earlier calls, we've largely been insulated from that because most the deterioration tended to be in the French and Italian markets where we would say we have been underexposed. But now we're seeing more broad-based reductions in production, and that's starting to impact us like the rest of the sector here.","We also would acknowledge that within our European numbers, we roll off South America, largely because that market is dominated by European OEs. And that business has turned from a profitable position in the year-ago period to a loss-making position. That swing for us on a quarterly basis was worth $0.02 or $0.03. And so that's a market that we\u2019re going to need to focus on rightsizing. And we would acknowledge that we're having a little bit -- we're trailing behind in terms of the operational improvements, the pace of them. Those are metals and interiors businesses in Europe.","Nonetheless, if you look at our margins, we did manage to expand margins in the quarter by 110 basis points. And you can see on the slide here, I've kind of indicated what the return on sales was by geography.","Turning over to Slide 11 and focusing on the income statement here. As we sort of referred to, sales were up 2% to back out the impact of the euro, which has gone from $1.44 last year to $1.28 this year. Our top line improvement would have been a very respectable 7%. You can see our gross profit, a little bit of pressure versus last year, down 50 basis points. Here, we're really seeing the benefit of higher revenues in our cost reduction initiatives, but it's offset by our business mix. And by that, I mean, automotive being a bigger piece of the pie this year versus last year. Auto has a lower gross margin in our 2 businesses. Well, that's a bit of a headwind here. This is where we also see the impact of the lead input cost flowing through and some of the launch difficulties that we're having in Europe.","SG&A, we were pleased to see a 60 -- or 90 basis point reduction in our SG&A expenses, down to 9.4% of revenue. This decrease really represents the focus that we've had on rightsizing our cost structure in light of the current market realities. And if you really look at the SG&A expenses by business unit, really, Building Efficiency is where we're seeing the most traction, and we've gotten the benefit of the recent restructuring initiatives.","We also point out that we did go into this year with a plan to increase SG&A spending in some of our -- to support some of our key growth initiatives. And that would be areas like innovation, our Emerging Market infrastructure, new product development. Those initiatives we're protecting, and we are dialing some of those back. But if you look at those types of things, we are spending more money on a year-over-year basis than we did in the prior year.","In terms of equity income, a strong increase, 25% to $70 million. This is really due to 2 things. One, the fact that we've consolidated our hybrid joint venture. That's a business of losses in the prior year, that's now fully consolidated. It doesn't flow through this line. The other factor here would be improvements in profitability in our automotive joint ventures. And so if you look at our segment margins here at $615 million -- or segment income, I'm sorry, we saw a nice segment margin improvement of 60 basis points to 5.8% versus the 5.2% last year.","Turning to Slide 12. If you look at financing charges, up about $16 million, very comparable to sort of the year-over-year increases we've been seeing the other few quarters of this year. The higher level of interest expense really associated with higher borrowings to finance the 2011 acquisitions that we made and higher levels of capital expenditures.","In the quarter, you can see our underlying tax rate was about 16% versus about 18.5% last year. That reduction really is a fact -- is attributed to the fact that we have a revised mix of where our income is flowing on a geographic basis. So we -- generally, you could sort of take away here. We're making more money in lower tax jurisdictions and less money in higher tax jurisdictions, most notably the U.S. where we've been -- where we're taking a hit on the battery and the lead side.","If you look at the income attributable to noncontrolling shareholders, in the past, this has been a bigger year-over-year charge. What I'd point out here is we, in the quarter, we did purchase substantially all of our minority partners in Plastech for $120 million. That is going to bring us about an annual benefit of $20 million on a run rate basis, so we got about $5 million improvement here in the quarter associated with that buyout. Then lastly, in terms of our diluted earnings per share, it came in at $0.64, which is an improvement of 14% versus last year.","Let me just make a few comments now on the balance sheet. We're pleased to see our cash provided from operations, $619 million, that was a 70% improvement over last year. You can see CapEx came in at 22% higher at $447 million. If you look at the CapEx number for the company, we continue to believe our full year number is going to be around $1.7 billion. That would imply a pretty significant reduction here as we go into the fourth quarter.","Our outlook for the fourth quarter is about $300 million. So the difference, the sort of headwind that we've had all throughout the year of CapEx being way up versus prior year levels is going to flip around here in the fourth quarter, and it's going to be somewhere between $150 million, $160 million year-over-year decline. So that's going to be a source of cash for us as we go into the fourth quarter here.","In some of the earlier notes, I did see some comments about the year-to-date cash outflow position that we've taken. And I guess, I would just remind folks that if you do look at our year-to-date numbers, we have about a $400 million outflow associated with discretionary funding of our Pension Plans. And that shows up as a use of working capital. So, yes, it's a cash burn, but on one hand, we're really just taking part of our money that we would otherwise use to reduce debt and better funding our pension plans.","At the end of the quarter, our net debt-to-total capitalization was consistent with where we were at the end of the second quarter of 34%. We still have a strong balance sheet, and we do expect to see some further deleveraging here in the fourth quarter which should position us pretty well as we go into 2013.","A few comments on the pension and our pension and retiree medical plans. We continue to improve the net funded position. We expect to end the year in the 90%-plus funded rate. That\u2019s really as a result of pretty good asset performance this year, but also the $400 million of discretionary funding that I talked about earlier.","Over the course of the last year, we've also taken a look at adopting mark-to-market, a pension accounting methodology. This is a methodology that I'm sure many of you are familiar with on the call here. But a number of large companies have adopted this change, and we believe when you really look at the fundamentals here, it's a simpler and more straightforward methodology that improves financial transparency. So we're going to make this change in the fourth quarter, and we'll book sort of a year-to-date retrospective charge in prior period numbers. So we end up from an accounting perspective, restating prior-year numbers so that we show the impact of the catch-up in our first reported period; then we'll show all comparable periods on a like-for-like basis.","If you kind of try to model out what the impact of that would be on 2013, we will see a reduction of our pension expense associated with some of the amortization of prior year losses. However, if you look at the lower discount rate that we're going to be facing in 2013, combined with a reduction that we're going to take in our discount rate as we -- or sorry, a reduction in our expected planned return on assets rate that we're going to take as we derisk our pension plan, those are largely going to offset the impact that we don't expect to be material.","So if you really -- I guess really just putting this in perspective, for the last few years, we've kind of been on a path to insulate our financial results from the volatility of pensions and pension accounting. Some of the things that we've done, we've invested about $1.5 billion in discretionary pension contributions. We've closed and frozen the majority of our global defined-benefit plans, and we've adopted a number of more conservative investment strategies to derisk our investment returns, and so, you really need to look at this accounting change in light of all that. It's another step in that process.","The other thing I would just point out for our employees that might be listening to the call, is this is just an accounting change. It has absolutely no impact on our funded levels or the benefit levels that we pay to our current and future retirees.","Lastly, I'd like to just talk a little bit more about some of the -- some of our restructuring initiatives. We did take some small charges here in the third quarter, and we expect to do more in the fourth quarter. And if you really look at the focus of those, it's going to be on properly aligning our headcount to the sort of market realities that we currently face. We're going to continue with divesting some smaller non-core assets, and we've had a number of those flow through on a year-to-date basis. We do expect to make some footprint changes in certain geographies. And we're going to do some consolidation. And that would be both in some of our manufacturing activities, but also in some of our back-office functions.","We do expect to continue to invest in our key strategic growth initiatives, and we're hopeful that these actions, combined with some of the growth initiatives that Steve talked about in his section, are going to enable us to deliver a solid, improved profitable into 2013, even in light of the market environments that we sort of currently face.","Then lastly, just on an informational item. We are going to host our Analyst Meeting in New York again, although we're going to change the timing here from what has typically been in the October timeframe to December or January. And really, the key thing here is in pushing it back to this time, we're going to be a lot closer aligned to when some of our peers report, but we also are kind of in a real unique situation where there's a lot of uncertainty around fiscal and monetary policy, particularly in the U.S., but also in Europe. And it's very difficult for us to forecast the economic climate we're in when we've got GDP growth that could swing 4, 4.5 percentage points based on the outcome of some of the legislative changes that we're facing here. So that's really what's driving us to push our timing back to the December, January timeframe.","With that, Glen, I will open it up for questions.","Glen Ponczak","Great. Pat, we're ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Chris Ceraso with Credit Suisse.","Christopher J. Ceraso - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","A few items. I guess, first, on the battery business. Maybe we can talk about why you don't think these pressures continue past Q4. Do you have -- bought up all the cores that you need, or you're just expecting there'll be more cores available and therefore, the price comes down?","Stephen A. Roell","It's the latter. There'll be more cores. In fact, we expect there are going to be a lot of cores. That would be the normal situation. It's just a function that we have to go into production almost this early to be able to meet the demand. We level our production, and so we're actually at almost full production here from July through the end of the year just to be able to meet the stocking required by the aftermarket. And we think it'll be -- even though, like Bruce described, there's probably a little bit of a pent-up inventory at the aftermarket right now, it's not significant, and so we expect that because of the hot weather and what it\u2019s doing to the chemistry in the batteries, which it destroys them. And maybe for those of you that are on the phone that don't know that industry, the shortest lives of batteries are in the high heat districts like Vegas and Phoenix. And so the hot heat we're seeing throughout the Midwest and the East and the South is, in fact, weakening the batteries or shortening the battery life. We expect there to be therefore a flood of cores by the fourth quarter. It shouldn't continue beyond that. This is just very unusual, Chris.","Christopher J. Ceraso - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","It's somewhat contingent then on an increasing replacement demand, but you think with the heat that, that should happen.","Stephen A. Roell","Or just the normal seasonal pattern will do it, too, okay?","Christopher J. Ceraso - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then also on the batteries, there was -- the weakness in volume overall outside of any kind of weather issues, was any of that attributable to price hikes that have been taken in that market?","Stephen A. Roell","No, I don't believe so. I don't sense that at all. Yes, it's pretty consistent amongst the -- if you sort of look at some of the competitors who have reported sort of similar numbers there.","Christopher J. Ceraso - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And I have a few questions on the pension. The guidance for Q4, that does not include the change to your pension accounting, right? That's just a pure change based on the fundamentals?","R. Bruce McDonald","That's correct.","Stephen A. Roell","That's correct.","R. Bruce McDonald","Nor does it incur any -- nor does our guidance include any restructuring.","Stephen A. Roell","Yes, just aberration.","R. Bruce McDonald","Because we really haven't sized that yet, Chris.","Christopher J. Ceraso - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Right, okay. And then along the lines of derisking and changing the pension around, have you thought about offering buyouts or shifting to third-party annuities like we've seen from some of the OEMs?","R. Bruce McDonald","We're looking at offering buyouts to deferred vested but that's probably something that we're maybe a year away from.","Christopher J. Ceraso - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just lastly, on Europe auto, can you maybe sketch out what the path is to improvement here? I mean, you had done these acquisitions and those were supposed to help the margins in Europe, and that hasn't happened. Has that been because the volume is low? Are you feeling, now that you've got more vertical integration, you're even more susceptible to volume? Maybe just help us understand what exactly is happening in Europe and how and when it gets better.","Stephen A. Roell","That's fair, Chris. Let me try to -- this is a question I expected from probably most people on the call here, so I want to take a minute to answer this question appropriately. First of all, let me dispel something. The performance that we have for the Keiper transaction is just exactly what we expected. It's contributing the way we thought. So it's not the Keiper. Issues that we're having are pretty well concentrated in 2 businesses, as we've described. It's the metal operation prior to the acquisition and the business that we're awarded under the old product schemes, okay? And interiors continues to be a drag. But let's talk about metals, which is the one that -- where we expected the biggest improvement and haven't been able to get there. We have 6 different operating, I'll call them, work streams that we're focused on where we've identified and have mapped, I'll call it that, use your comment, Chris, probably hundreds of millions of dollars in the next 18 months. And they had to do with improvement in operations; they had to do with purchasing; they had to do with commercial negotiations. And let me just go into some of how -- what they are in detail and then I'll come back and tell you why timing is an issue for us. There's some things we can get our hands on right away. There's some purchasing opportunities that we have around steel tubes, around motors that we can get our hands on in relatively quick timeframe, meaning over the next 12 months. There are commercial claim processes; there are change processes that we'll get over the long-term and the medium-term. There are some things that we know we're going to benefit from in 2013, such as lower launch cost, and we're going to be shedding containment cost. That's probably a $50 million year-over-year improvement that we can see today just based on the activity that we have. There are some things that are probably over the medium-term, and these you'll understand as I walk them through with you. They would include things like how we design for manufacturing, how we standardize our product lines, how we deploy best practices and best processes. As an example, Hammerstein has an outstanding process that they use for both marrying their tracks and how they stamp rails. And we're deploying them across our product lines. Footprint optimization, what we can do to improve our machine utilization, our labor productivity. Those are all mapped in what we call a tracker. We have -- I'm not going to give out a number, but there are hundreds of millions of dollars we have tracked. What we're trying to do now is refine what we can get to in the near term quarter-by-quarter in fiscal 2013. These are all mapped and expected to be able to happen by mid 2014. So what I'm trying to do is provide some refinements so I can come back and give guidance to our shareholders what that rate of improvement is in the next 6 months, the next year and then more quarter-over-quarter guidance. That\u2019s what I guess I would come out and tell you. So it's a blend of near-term things we know we can get our hands on and there are some things that we need to do to improve the long-term position of the business and standardize our product lines, improve our machine utilization. That's all taking place. And so it's not the new acquisitions. It is the business we were awarded back in 2009 and '10 that we're trying to improve and to making sure that we have the foundation in place and the fundamentals in place to ensure that improvement continues into '14 through '16.","Operator","Brian Johnson with Barclays.","Brian Arthur Johnson - Barclays Capital, Research Division","So just drilling down a little bit more into the European auto experience. It sounds like the improvement program is in metals. It's not in Hammerstein or Recaro, so it's in the existing metals business. To what extent though -- I guess, a couple of questions, a, is interior still a drag there? We've seen Visteon being unable to sell its business due to pressures in the European interiors markets. And then secondly, while you're reducing costs, the OEMs are, themselves, running into profit pressures. What's your confidence in being able to hold on to these cost reductions in light of pricing pressures and seating? And how are you thinking about that as part of the improvement plan?","Stephen A. Roell","Okay. Let me take a shot and I'll let Bruce come in also. I guess, if you go back to interiors, we still have plans that are a drag. We have product lines that are a drag, and we're actually looking at exiting some product categories, Brian. I think that the market conditions haven't changed. Interiors is a sector which has got overcapacity. And I think most players in that marketplace, whether it be Visteon or some of our other competitors, are -- it's not a new phenomena. The industry has been struggling for some time, okay? I believe that we've got Bill Jackson focused on that business, and that's where -- that's what he's focusing right now. We believe that we'll get some improvement because of that in terms of how we approach the OEs as a standalone business, okay? That's number one. In terms of your comment about the OEs, you're absolutely right. There is some additional pressure, and it's spotty. It's select OEs. We have turned back business where we weren't able to meet the cost reduction request that we were given. We continue to have a strong book of business. But I do think that our job is to protect that. We've been in investment, and it's our job to protect the investment and the margins that we acquired. And so from my perspective, the only way to do that is to be somewhat resistant on price reductions requests. And if that shrinks our business, so be it. I'm managing that business for returns right now.","Brian Arthur Johnson - Barclays Capital, Research Division","What -- and just kind of within the quarter, given that production was only down 5%, it looks like your incremental margins were -- decremental margins were very high, x currency. So I see the improvement path. But what was sort of the step back vis-\u00e0-vis on a year-over-year or sequential basis in the business? Was it just volume, or were there other things that popped up?","Stephen A. Roell","Well, remember, too, Brian. In that European number, there's also the South America swing into a loss and...","Brian Arthur Johnson - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. So it's really the South, so that's part of that?","Stephen A. Roell","That's part of that, yes.","Brian Arthur Johnson - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And is that an improvement plan there or is that just waiting for a better macro real?","Stephen A. Roell","No, it is an improvement plan we have to put in place. Bruce referenced that.","R. Bruce McDonald","I mean, if you kind of look at the South America situation, I mean, it's, in many ways -- I mean, it's obviously, a lot smaller for us. I mean, just the size of South America piece within -- our business now is like 500 million to 600 million to on an annual basis. But if I look at kind of the market fundamentals, it's very tough. You've got -- markets have softened. Currencies have significantly weakened, and the auto industry there is often more susceptible to import components, imported components, which puts a lot of pressure. Labor inflation is extremely high and some of the government policies, particularly in Argentina is tough. And so I think as we are looking at what we can do to improve the situation down there, but we're in a pretty tough market right now, and that's not likely going to change in 2013. Now there are some things that we can do to improve our current position, but our outlook for 2013, is we will have a loss there. It will be smaller. We are going to take some actions, but we've got to ride that out.","Operator","Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley.","Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Steve, if I can ask you, why -- if you can give us any more color on why you delayed the Analyst Day. And if there are any particular milestones or data you're looking for that will help you kind of form your outlook for 2013, or is it more of just giving your restructuring and your operations a little more time to improve?","Stephen A. Roell","No, I think it's the former. I think, really, we're just trying to get a better sense for what kind of environment we're going to be operating in. I mean, the other thing we could have done is walk in and said listen, on these assumptions, this is what we think. We just think that we'll have a better chance to refine those assumptions. I think, in general, the investment community will have a better chance to also be focused on 2013. I truthfully think that we're concerned that oftentimes we go out and, really, I say people, there hasn't really been a strong focus on 2014 at that point in time because there's very few companies that have gone out and really talked about it. And so I think we just feel that we're better equipped to give you guidance for Q1 in the fall, talk about maybe some of the things we\u2019re seeing and the assumptions that we're beginning to focus on for 2013, and then come back and give you better -- we just think we can provide better information. We certainly know last year that was the case. And last year, things were a lot more stable than they are today. But clearly, those 3 months would have been significant for us in terms of understanding what environment we are in.","R. Bruce McDonald","Yes. I think, Ravi, if you look at the numbers right now between the contents board and the major banks, including your firm, I think what people have right now is GDP growth in North America next year of somewhere in the 1.5% to 2%. I think there's pretty tight cluster there. And those numbers are coming down. And on that basis, I think, we'd feel pretty good providing what we think is going to happen in our businesses. But if you then look at the -- between the sequestration-related spending cuts and the exploration of the Bush tax cuts, which are big items, and quantify those, those add up somewhere between 4%, 4.5% of GDP. So now that takes your 1.5%, to possibly minus 3%, and that's a very different economic picture here in North America. It\u2019s unlikely we're going to know the answer to that between now and when our normal Analyst Day would have been, which is early October, but we just elected to push it back here a couple months.","Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Understood. Just looking at BE in the quarter, your margins were much better than we expected. Can you help quantify how much of that was some of the SG&A and cost initiatives that you had? And how much of that was driven by just the improvement in resi?","R. Bruce McDonald","Yes, I would say if you kind of look at residential and last year, we -- within our Building Efficiency numbers, we had a large -- we had a onetime benefit in residential. We had a onetime hit in our Latin America business that's largely offset. But if I strip that out, and what you would see in the residential is we did see a nice pop-up in profitability, but the fact that the mix moved to a lower margin product, our profitability was little changed from an ROS point of view. So that really didn't drive it. The big area for us was in service. North America service, we saw a nice improvement in our profitability there. Sort of think about last year, it was kind of cool, especially in the early start of the cooling season. Really saw the benefit in margins there, which was labor utilization and the pricing improvements that we saw that came with the -- our IT investments in that business. That was the sort of biggest driver.","Stephen A. Roell","But, Ravi, I think the fact that all 5 segments were up in BE, we just explained to you, it really was broad-based.","Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Got it. And finally, Bruce, you pointed out that the FCF should be viewed x the pension contribution. Can you just help us with what cash flow will look like in the fourth quarter? You've had some pretty big cash-generating fourth quarters in the past. Is it going to be something similar, or do we expect something similar like...","R. Bruce McDonald","No, no, we expect to see a very strong Q4. We aren't making any -- we're sort of done from a discretionary pension point of view. So we won't have anything there. As I said in my comments, our capital expenditure is going to be in the sort of $300 million range. That's a big reduction versus the run rate that we've had for the last 3 quarters, and it's a big improvement versus what we had in the fourth quarter of last year. We do have some -- expect our working capital levels are going to improve by a couple of hundred million, and we have a few sort of smaller non-core assets and properties that we're selling. So we expect pretty strong improvement in the fourth quarter.","Operator","Peter Nesvold with Jefferies.","H. Peter Nesvold - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","So I just want to talk about the Power Solutions business for a minute. This is not an area where I'm an expert, but we've heard some channel perspective that believes that JCI's move towards vertical integration is actually helping to drive up lead prices, that a lot of the third-party smelters that you would have historically sold to are kind of out in the market, trying to secure lead and therefore, pushing that up. Do you think that's accurate? Is that part of what's happening here? And if that's true, why does it -- why would it reverse out so quickly?","Stephen A. Roell","No, that's not what's happening. And I think it's more a factor that the activity in retail, as I described, I think, is the bigger issue. The fact that they're just -- and we've talked that -- we've looked across 4 or 5 different aftermarket customers and it's the lack, of course, coming back. That's what's driving up the prices. We're not -- we haven't ramped up enough at this stage in our own internal smelting to really drive that up.","Operator","Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank.","Patrick Nolan - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","This is Pat Nolan on for Rod. Can we just go back to Europe for a second? I know you talked about the metals business, but you also highlighted the new business launches from 2009 and 2010. Prior to this quarter, you were expecting that most -- the most difficult launches were largely behind you, and we were going to see the containment cost start to taper off. Is that not what occurred in the quarter? Can you help us frame what was the run rate of containment cost in the quarter versus where they had been running? Are the launches basically getting -- are the launches tracking worse than you expected?","Stephen A. Roell","No, I don't think launches are tracking any worse from what we expected. I think some of the containment costs that we had on the prior launches where we had expected to shed, we probably haven't shed those costs as quickly, Pat, okay? But there's nothing there to point to in the new launches, okay?","Patrick Nolan - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","All right. I mean, can you give us any kind of framing of where your containment costs are tracking in the quarter?","Stephen A. Roell","Do we have that number, Bruce?","R. Bruce McDonald","I don't. Yes, I don't have that handy. I mean, we can follow up with you, Pat, on that. As Steve said, it wasn't a down. It wasn't a variance, okay, versus what we thought. I mean, we -- like I said at the last call, we have 3 or 4 problematic launches. Those are flowing through as we expected. They were in mainly in the Europe side of our business versus the North America. You kind of saw in our North America numbers, we were kind of depressed last quarter and the quarter before because launches there, those snapped back, profitably snapped back there nicely. But maybe one other comment I'd add on Europe that we haven't talked about is, not a big issue for us, but it's something that we are worried about is the sort of distresses that we see in our supply base. And we do have some headwinds associated with that, and that's the area that as things -- if things deteriorate more there, it's going to become a bigger and bigger headwind for the industry, not just Johnson Controls.","Stephen A. Roell","Pat, just let me comment on, not to what you just said, Bruce, but I do think that, that one thing that we've really done well in the last 6 month is get our hands around our launches, in terms of our launch teams. I mean, I think we've staffed them adequately, I think we've got tremendous oversight, and they aren't as complex. I mean to be honest with you, there were some extremely complex launches and product configurations. So I feel better about what we used to describe. But to your point, Pat, I would hope to see some prior -- some better and faster improvements in our ability to reduce our containment cost. Our quality is good, and we're getting high marks from our customers on our quality. It's just a function we've got to shed some costs, okay.","Patrick Nolan - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And you -- prior to this quarter, you were expecting the European margins to get above 3% in Q4. Can you just give us an update on that? That seems like a pretty big bridge from the negative 1.5% to this quarter.","Stephen A. Roell","Yes, that's fair. That's fair. And I think if you look at and part of the reason why -- we're not going to hit the 3%. Part of the reason why I think we're -- we are more cautious, and I went back and tried to -- maybe actually quantify this. If we look at some of the delta in Q4, I would attribute as much as $0.03 to $0.04 to our -- or just our thoughts regarding commercial claim resolutions to this timeframe. One of the earlier questions from, I think was from Brian, had to do with OE resistance. And I don't think it\u2019s resistance as much as they're just slow walk-in claims and things of that nature. And in the past, we would have always had a very strong fourth quarter in terms of claim resolution. I think we've had it baked into our forecast, but that's not going to happen, I'm sure. It could happen, but we've assumed that it does not. And that's our biggest delta in terms of our margin assumptions for Q4.","Patrick Nolan - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Got it. And just lastly on the lead impact, the $40 million you saw in Q3, is the inventory -- bigger build in Q4 bigger so that $40 million could be a bigger number?","R. Bruce McDonald","No, it's going to be, I would say, in the $30 million to $40 million range.","Stephen A. Roell","Yes, it could be -- and it could be less because we think this thing could -- this thing should start to improve by September. October, November, December, it's real obvious if it's going to, okay? And, in fact, to some extent, we're surprised we're still seeing it in July.","Operator","Rich Kwas with Wells Fargo Securities.","Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Question, a broader question on Europe. IHS came out with their forecast the other day for calendar year to be down 6. I know there's a lot of skepticism out there regarding that number. It sounds like you\u2019re a little skeptical on that. I know you're on a different fiscal year end. But, Steve, what are your thoughts there? Do you think there's a lot of downside risk to that forecast?","Stephen A. Roell","I think it's what we're trying to get our hands on, Rich, okay? I -- we've sort of been trying to revise our forecast as we get information from the marketplace, okay? So we're trying to watch our major exposure. We're broad-based with the German customers, along with Opel and Ford. As Bruce mentioned, we don\u2019t have a lot of exposure to the French. But I think we're looking at the mix, trying to understand what's taking place. We're trying to guess what's happening in -- the fact that U.K. and Germany is holding up at that, they're still growing. We're still trying to figure out if that's going to continue. But my sense is that I'm more worried about the level of decline that could happen in the South. I think France is the one I'm most concerned about. I think Spain, we've already -- probably we're down there already. But I think Italy and France will be the 2 markets, Rich, that I'm most concerned about. I don't think I want to comment yet in terms of whether I agree with the minus 6, okay?","Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, all right. And then on the Building Efficiency side, very good margin performance this quarter. It sounds like -- should we expect similar rate of improvement year-over-year for the fourth quarter?","Stephen A. Roell","At this point in time, I can -- best guess I can give you at this point in time is that they're going to improve at least 100 basis points in the market in Q4.","Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just looking at -- I know that we're going to be a few months away from getting an outlook for '13. But, Steve, the sustainability of this margin improvement, how comfortable are you with that, or is that kind of in flux right now as well?","Stephen A. Roell","You're talking about within Building Efficiency?","Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Yes, within Building Efficiency.","Stephen A. Roell","I think that's where we'd like to get a better handle on. I think -- let me go back. I think we have a very good handle on our cost structure as we go into 2013. The thing that's going to be important for us -- and I'm only going to give you leading indicators, okay? We would hope to come out of this quarter with our backlog up 6%, 7%, 8%, if not, more. That's the key, Rich. That's what I need to see. And probably the category that we need to see it in is in the what we would call the solutions business or performance contracting. It's something that's lagged the last 4 or 5 months for us. The data we have from our field is saying that they expect that to recover here in Q4. That's the one we're watching. That will be the key, whether we're up 4% or whether we're up 8%, 9%, that then will dictate whether we get the margin right next year, okay?","R. Bruce McDonald","So, Rich, one -- maybe just a little bit more there. Just -- I would just keep in mind, when we went into this year, what we talked about for building efficiencies about 50 basis points of margin expansion. And we -- if you look at where we were in Q1 and 2, we were sort of flattish or down slightly. And we talked about the fact that we are fronting some of our investments in like Panoptix and things like that. So we're pretty comfortable with our outlook here for the fourth quarter that will be -- will get that 50 basis points and maybe another 10 or 20. But the path for improvement for building efficiency because so many of our investments are in SG&A, that glide path, we're not backing away from. So we're not going to be up 120 basis points next year. It's going to be that 50 to 60 basis points. That's our trend line.","Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, understood. And then last one from me on FX. Are you assuming current trends \u2013 current conversion rates in the guidance for fourth quarter?","R. Bruce McDonald","Yes. We use 122 here for the fourth quarter.","Operator","Sanjay Shrestha with Lazard Capital.","Sanjay Shrestha - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","First question is on the Building Efficiency side. So this is a very impressive improvement on the GWS side. Was there anything onetime in the quarter here, or what kind of lead to that 86% improvement in the operating margin there?","R. Bruce McDonald","Yes, I know there isn't anything of a non-recurring nature there. I mean, I would -- it is a big improvement, but I would still temper that with the fact that if you look at the absolute margin level in GWS, it's still below where we'd like to see. So it's bounced back strongly, but it's still not in that -- in the sort of 2.5% to 3% range that we expect.","Stephen A. Roell","I guess I would just make a statement in general though about Building Efficiency. There really were no unusual items this quarter. This was one of the cleanest quarters. The quality of that earnings is very, very strong.","Sanjay Shrestha - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Okay, okay. That's great. And one quick follow-up then, guys. So when we think about your Power Solutions, right, clearly, lead price is sort of what it is, and you guys are saying it's going go away, hopefully, by one quarter. Now as we think 12 months out, right, so with this incremental benefit from lower prices, how do you think about how that business grows when the aftermarket comes back? And where does the margin go because all the drag is sort of now going to be behind you guys after a quarter. How should we think about that business in 12 months out?","Stephen A. Roell","Yes, let me start, and then Bruce, you jump in, okay? I guess twofold. Let me explain volumes first. Whenever we've seen the type of January through March period where we had depressed volumes due to weather, typically, it has continued slightly depressed again in the quarter that we're in today and then up, and then it pops in the fourth quarter. That's going to be interesting to see if that happens. So -- but regardless, this is going to normalize. It always has. And so I hate to talk about weather extremes, but we do expect a very, very strong fiscal 2013, start in terms of volumes. That's number one. Number two, in margins, we've guided higher margins partially because of some things we've done. We've invested in vertical integration, and that's a big one for us. We also have, we believe, some improvements that we'll have from some cost that we incurred last year in China that will be year-over-year. So as we think of 2013, we expect the margins to improve in power, primarily because of higher volumes, better utilization, vertical integration and then avoidance of the Chinese year-over-year softness, okay, that we had and cost that we incurred last year.","Operator","Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just to quickly follow-up on Power Solutions, and I'm glad you mentioned China. I know that -- I think the plant partially reopened. So I'm just trying to think a little bit of margin trajectory in the fourth quarter from the third quarter and the different headwinds. Clearly, the lead issue still -- lead is still is an issue. But shouldn't the pricing come up a little bit and then also some more cost savings from China. So do those totally offset, or is it still a net negative headwind from lead?","R. Bruce McDonald","I guess, we will see the negative headwind, but when you look at the year-over-year delta, so we do expect to see some margin expansion here in the fourth quarter in power. I wouldn't say that China would be a big part of that. But the biggest issue is going to be the pricing. We did announce pricing here in the current quarter that we're in, some of it went in, in May; some of it went in June. So if you just look at the benefit that we get -- in the fourth quarter where we\u2019ll get and we have it implemented across-the-board. So we get the whole benefit here in the fourth quarter; that is going to enable us to offset some of the headwinds that you're referring to and we\u2019ll get back to that path of margin expansion here in the fourth quarter.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just to be -- the $40 million headwind this quarter, I mean, it was -- is the majority of that because you were ramping up South Carolina? Like had you already been ramped up...","Stephen A. Roell","No. None of it was.","R. Bruce McDonald","That South Carolina ramp up really starts -- is a Q4 issue, not a Q -- and so if you think about that, say, $40 million we talked about in lead in Q3. In Q4, we said $30 million to $40 million. You probably should think about 1\/3 of that is going to be because we ramp up the new facility, and 2\/3 of it will be the high cost of cores.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Can you talk about what your, I guess, internally-sourced lead goes from to once that facility is fully ramped up?","R. Bruce McDonald","Well, it's -- the recycling centers are -- roughly speaking, give us a benefit of about $50 million a year at current lead levels. So that's kind of the delta that we'll get from South Carolina.","Stephen A. Roell","But Glen, I think we have all our smelters up. What is our internal source of our leads right now?","Glen Ponczak","50% of our\u2026","Stephen A. Roell","\u2026is there, okay? That's probably from what it was 2 years ago. 15% before we built the 2 smelters, okay?","Glen Ponczak","So we're going to have to cut it off there, Steve. Final comments?","Stephen A. Roell","Sure. Yes, just a couple quick ones here. I -- first of all, we apologize for the fourth quarter results that we're projecting here, okay? We, hope we have conservatism built into them but believe me, our people are -- have not given up. We will do everything we can to deliver results on the fourth quarter. We're focused on fiscal 2013 where we feel our fundaments are good. We're just trying to understand the macroenvironment that we're operating in. Don't read any more into the delay in the Analyst Day than the fact we want to provide you the best information we possibly can. We'll do what we can in the call at the end of Q4 to sort of tell you what we see in the environment, how we're thinking, and give you some of -- maybe some of the assumptions that we're thinking about on a preliminary basis. So we'll try to give you at least the stage setting for what we see, okay?","So, again, thank you very much for the call and again, we feel very good about our long-term fundamentals, and we're just frustrated by the near-term as you are, and we apologize for that.

Your lines have been placed on listen-only until the question-and-answer session. This conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time.","I will now turn the call over to Antonella Franzen, Vice President of Investor Relations, you may begin.","Antonella Franzen - Johnson Controls International Plc","Good morning and thank you for joining our conference call to discuss Johnson Controls' second quarter 2017 results. The press release and all related tables issued earlier this morning, as well as the conference call slide presentation, can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website at johnsoncontrols.com. With me today are Johnson Controls' Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Alex Molinaroli; President and Chief Operating Officer, George Oliver; and our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Brian Stief.","Before we begin, I would like to remind you that during the course of today's call, we will be providing certain forward-looking information. We ask that you view today's press release and read through the forward-looking cautionary informational statements that we've included there.","In addition, we will use certain non-GAAP measures in our discussions, and we ask that you read through the sections of our press release that address the use of these items. In discussing our results during the call, references to adjusted EBITA and adjusted EBIT margins, exclude transaction, integration, and separation costs, as well as other special items. These metrics are non-GAAP measures and are reconciled in the schedules attached to our press release.","All comparisons to the prior year are on a combined basis, which excludes the results of Adient, and includes the results of Tyco net of conforming accounting adjustments and recurring purchase accounting.","Now let me quickly recap this quarter's results. Sales of $7.2 billion in the quarter, increased 3% year-over-year on a reported basis, excluding the net impact of FX, M&A and lead pass-through pricing, sales grew 2% organically.","GAAP loss per share from continuing operations attributable to Johnson Controls' ordinary shareholders was $0.16 and included net charges of $0.66 related to special items. These special items were primarily composed of a non-cash tax charge related to the announced divestiture of the Scott Safety business, transaction, integration and separation costs as well as restructuring and impairment charges. Adjusting for these special items, non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.50 per share compared to $0.45 in the prior year quarter.","Now, let me turn the call over to Alex.","Alex A. Molinaroli - Johnson Controls International Plc","Thanks, Antonella. Good morning, everyone. So, if we start on slide 5, I'd like to talk about the overview of the results and some of the commitments we've made over the past few months, both at our Annual Meeting, our Investing Meeting and then also at our Analyst Call.","So, we had strong quarter earnings at 11% year-over-year growth and is at the top end range that we provided you at $0.48 to $0.50. And a lot of that came from our continued focus on our productivity and the integration efforts. If you go back and look at the commitments that we made as an organization, I think that we couldn't be more proud of our employees and it both came from productivity driven through our Johnson Controls operating systems initiatives along with the merger synergies.","And in fact, we've seen around a $70 million benefit for the quarter, which is accelerating, so we're very pleased with what we're seeing and I just want to thank our employees. It would be very easy for our employees with all that's going on to not stay focused on the task and we've been able to generate the synergies and the cost savings which will bode well for the future.","It leads me to the organic growth, particularly within buildings. We're starting to see the acceleration of our organic growth, particularly in our field businesses and once again that's where we're doing most of our integration efforts, so that's a strong signal to us that we're going to continue to see growth throughout the rest of the year and gives us confidence.","I'd really like to also point out and George will go through this in a little more detail, we had really strong strength in our HVAC businesses, particularly our light commercial and residential businesses. We outpaced the market and most of that has to do with launches of new products and the investments that we've seen over the past few years. And we're seeing some stabilization within the legacy Tyco fire protection products businesses and that bodes well for the future also.","The other thing that happened within the quarter is some of our strategic portfolio actions. Specifically, we closed the sale of ADT South Africa and we announced the divestiture of Scott Safety to 3M. Both of these are very important as it relates to those businesses within the legacy Tyco organization being able to sell those assets is important as it relates to the TSarl debt which as you recall was a $4 billion debt that was put in place to facilitate the transaction between Johnson Controls and Tyco, and accelerating that repayment of debt is going to be good for us moving forward. Related to that, is the share repurchase program of $500 million which is an increase from the previously announced $200 million to $250 million share repurchase program, that's already in place. So, that takes us up to $750 million for the fiscal year. So, the Scott Safety transaction will not be dilutive.","If you go to page 6, I'll go a high overview of the numbers before I turn it over to George. If you look at our net sales of 3% reported and organic of 2%, buildings was up 3%. I talked earlier about driven mostly by our field organization and power is off 1%. And that was mostly a seasonal view, particularly because of some of the weather and restocking along with strong orders that we received a year ago, in China, when we first opened our new plant.","And from a results standpoint, if you look at the impact of lead, it's pretty important because if you pull out lead, which was up significantly for the quarter, we had a 7% increase excluding both foreign exchange and lead, and there was a significant impact to our bottom line, I mean, to our top line and also impacted our margin. So if you adjust for that, we had a 7% increase in earnings driven by real strong performance in our Power Solutions business.","And that leads us to the 60 basis points improvements in overall margins. The integration of our Buildings business as it accelerates and we get more and more confidence, we're going to see the bottom line continue to improve. And now that we're starting to see the organic growth within our Buildings business, gives us an awful lot of confidence to tighten our guidance for the year, which Brian will talk about, which is the 13% to 16% range, later in the presentation.","So with that, I'm going to turn it over to George, he'll talk about the merger activities and also some more specifics around the business performance.","George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc","Thanks, Alex, and good morning, everyone.","Before I get into a detailed review of the businesses, let me start with a quick integration update on slide 7. Over the last few months, the Buildings organization has gone through an impressive amount of change, and we've made a considerable amount of progress towards aligning the new leadership structure in the most optimal way possible with a focus on accountability for growth. We now have the management teams of our operational structure substantially in place and we'll now focus on building out the team structure over the next several months.","Another area we've discussed with you is the need to substantially pay down the merger-related TSarl debt. As Alex referred to earlier with the announced divestiture of Scott Safety and sale of ADT South Africa, we will be able to make a considerable reduction to the $4 billion of debt. This will enable us to move more quickly on some of the heavier lifting restructuring and synergy actions.","I wanted to take a minute to thank the team and the thousands of employees of both Scott Safety and ADT South Africa. I have had the pleasure of being involved with both of these businesses for over a decade, including my tenure as President of the Tyco Global product segment. It's never easy to part with such great leaders and colleagues, but I am confident they are in good hands and that both businesses will continue to be successful in the future.","Before I get into the progress we've made on the cost side, I thought I'd highlight a couple of key cross-selling wins in the second quarter. We had a major win in the New England region to supply an array of building solutions in a new distribution hub being built by one of our large airfreight delivery customers. In this situation, our legacy SimplexGrinnell sales team leveraged their strong relationships in the region to provide a lead to a legacy Johnson Controls team. Working together, the two teams were able to secure contracts for the fire alarm system as well as the HVAC and building control system.","In the institutional space, a legacy Johnson Controls Account team in coordination with the sales teams across SimplexGrinnell and Tyco Integrated Security submitted a joint bid for a fully integrated solution multi-phase expansion project at a major university in Texas. As a result, we were awarded the contract for the first phase providing our Metasys building automation system, York air handling units, Simplex fire alarm system, as well as access control and video surveillance. Not only is this phase a great win, we're well positioned for the next phases of the project.","Both wins are great examples of how our teams are coming together to collaborate and provide integrated solutions that solve more complex customer problems.","Turning now, to the cost synergy side. We continue to run ahead of plan in Q2, delivering roughly $70 million or above $0.06 in year-over-year savings. This is roughly $20 million in incremental savings over last quarter and is slightly ahead of our internal targets.","Given the progress we've made year-to-date we now expect to achieve synergy and productivity savings at the high end of the $250 million to $300 million range I provided to you in December. With roughly $0.11 achieved through the first half, we now expect $0.07 in the third quarter and $0.09 in the fourth quarter totaling around $0.27 in savings for the full year.","As I mentioned last quarter, the integration of two large organizations requires a lot of heavy lifting, commitment and leadership. Not all decisions are easy, but we have a strong team, leading the process, ensuring we execute on decisions made and we move forward to the next step.","Both the integration team and the businesses continue to be guided around four main objectives; grow, integrate, change and operate. We're making great progress and I couldn't be more proud of how the teams have come together and what they have accomplished over these past eight months as a combined company. I look forward to keeping you updated on our continued success.","Let's turn now to a review of the businesses starting with Building Technologies and Solutions on slide 8. On a reported basis, Building sales grew 1% over the prior year to $5.5 billion in the quarter, as 3% organic growth was partially offset by the impact of FX and net M&A activity. The 3% organic growth was led by solid growth in our field businesses.","When you look at the Field side of the business, which represents about 65% to 70% of total Building sales, organic growth was up 4%, with underlying growth across most regions, led by strong growth of over 3% in North America. When we look at the pieces within our Field business, we saw another strong quarter of organic growth in our applied HVAC business, which continued to grow in the mid-single digit range.","Fire and Security, the legacy Tyco Installation and Service businesses grew in the low single-digit range led by mid-single digit growth in North America. Some of the areas within our Field businesses have put pressure on our organic growth rate in the first quarter, stabilized in the second quarter including both performance contracting and industrial refrigeration.","Looking now at our Products business, which represents remaining 30% to 35% of Buildings. Sales declined just under 1% organically year-over-year, a sequential improvement from the 3% decline we saw last quarter.","We continue to see very strong growth in our residential and light commercial HVAC business, which grew at a high-teens rate organically, benefiting by a significant amount of new product launches, something we expect will continue into 2018.","The strength in U.S. residential and light commercial HVAC was more than offset by a mid-single digit decline in our Hitachi business, simply related to the timing of shipments, which we will see come through in the third quarter.","Additionally, our Fire and Security product businesses are stabilizing. The mid-single digit, year-over-year decline we saw in the first quarter has moderated to a 1% organic decline in the second quarter. On a sequential basis, Fire and Security product sales are growing. We've seen encouraging signs that the short cycle industrial markets have bottomed and we would anticipate some inflection across the businesses in the second half. Buildings' EBITA declined 1% year-over-year to $628 million. The segment margin decreased 30 basis points year-over-year to 11.3% as strong synergy and productivity savings were more than offset by planned incremental product and channel investments as well as mix during the quarter.","Turning to orders and backlog on slide 9. Total Buildings orders increased 2% year-over-year organically, driven by a 3% increase in Field orders, partially offset by a 1% decline in our quick-turn product orders, which as I mentioned earlier was already felt within our product sales growth in the quarter, given the book and ship nature of that business. In terms of order activity we saw continued momentum in the U.S. market with stable growth in non-residential construction verticals year-over-year. We had a strong quarter of order activity with solid growth in our commercial and institutional verticals.","As we have discussed before order growth in our Field business is lumpy, and can be impacted by the timing of large projects. The legacy Tyco business included a very large order in the prior year, which impacted the year-over-year comparison in Tyco orders by 3 percentage points. Backlog of $8.3 billion increased 6% year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and M&A.","In summary, we continue to make significant strides in improving the fundamentals of the business. We are streamlining the organization, investing in our product and service innovation and driving commercial excellence. As a result of these initiatives, coupled with our order pipeline and backlog, we are well-positioned for increased growth in the second half of this fiscal year as well as strong margin expansion.","Turning to Power Solutions on slide 10. Sales increased 7% year-over-year on a reported basis to $1.7 billion driven by the impact of lead pass-through, which benefited powers top line by roughly 8 percentage points.","Organic sales were down 1%, driven by warmer weather in both North America and China, which negatively impacted aftermarket demand. In addition, we had a tough prior year comparison in China associated with the timing of the initial volume build in our Chongqing plant.","Overall, total global unit shipments decreased 3% year-over-year driven by aftermarket shipments, which declined 3%. Global start-stop shipments continued to expand with a 36% increase year-over-year, including another quarter of significant growth in China and the Americas.","Power Solutions segment EBITA of $303 million, increased 7% on a reported basis or 12% excluding foreign currency. Power's margin expanded 10 basis points year-over-year on a reported basis including a 220 basis point headwind from the impact of higher lead costs. Underlying margins excluding the impact of lead, increased 230 basis points year-over-year, driven by productivity benefits as well as favorable product mix, primarily related to higher Start-Stop battery shipments.","Now let me turn the call over to Brian to walk through corporate and the consolidated financial details of the quarter as well as our outlook for third quarter and remainder of the year.","Brian J. Stief - Johnson Controls International Plc","Thanks, George and good morning, everyone. Turning to slide 11. As you know, beginning in the first quarter, we're now reporting corporate as a standalone segment and for the second quarter corporate expense was $2 million lower than last year and as expected I think, we talked during the first quarter call that there was going to be a sequentially higher Q2 corporate costs than Q1 and that really related primarily to some indirect tax items and some IT related costs.","Having said that, for the full year we now expect corporate expenses will likely fall at the lower end of our $480 million to $500 million range that we provided at the Analyst Day.","Moving on to slide 12. As you saw in our release and as Antonella mentioned our Q2 results do include a number of large items again this quarter that we're treating as special non-GAAP adjustments. And, I'd just like to touch on those for a second.","The first item relates to our ongoing transaction and separation costs that was roughly $138 million. We had some restructuring and impairment charges in the quarter of $99 million about two-thirds of that related to severance, and we had some mark-to-market pension and some non-recurring purchase accounting adjustments that aggregated $35 million. And then, the large item in the quarter was about a $457 million, non-cash tax charge related to the announced divestiture of Scott Safety. And I would just give you a reminder here that, that is a non-cash book charge and the actual cash tax charge when that transaction closes, later in 2017, we still believe that will be in the range of $50 million. I'll exclude those items as I go through my comments, but those items aggregated $0.66 a share for the quarter.","So, turning to the highlights on slide 12, overall, second quarter sales were up 3% to $7.2 billion. And if you exclude the impact of FX lead and M&A, organic sales were up 2% versus last year and as George mentioned backlog year-over-year is up 6%, which bodes well for some momentum going into the second half here. If you look at gross margin of 31%, it was down 40 basis points for the year that was primarily, or for the quarter, that was primarily driven by higher lead prices and some unfavorable Buildings mix that George referenced, and that was offset by leverage on higher volumes, as well as some JCOS productivity savings we saw come through in Q2.","SG&A levels were comparable to the prior year, up about 1%. This product, channel, and sales force investments were substantially offset by cost synergies. Equity income of $53 million, was 33% higher than a year ago and that was primarily due to strong performance in our Hitachi and Power Solutions nonconsolidated JVs. For the quarter EBIT was up 5% with the overall EBIT margins up to 9.8% which is 20 basis points positive versus 2016, which is in line with our expectations and if you will exclude foreign exchange and lead, these margins were up 60 basis points year-over-year.","Turing to slide 13, net financing charges of $116 million in the quarter were slightly higher than last year, due to higher debt levels and as I think most of you know we did in the latter part of the second quarter issue $500 million worth of U.S. notes and $1 billion of Euro notes in connection with some of the other funding needs we have for the rest of the year.","Excluding special items, our effective tax rate of 15% continues to compare favorably to our prior year rate of 17% and we did see a drop in income from \u2013 attributable to non-controlling interest, down about $11 million compared to last year and that really just relates to the timing of the Hitachi entities as well as some underlying tax rates in those entities. So overall, we had a solid second quarter, which was at the high end of our guidance at $0.50 which was up 11% versus the $0.45 a year ago.","Turning to slide 14, just a quick Q2 EPS waterfall relative to last year, you can see we had a $0.06 benefit related to cost synergies and productivity savings in the quarter, which was slightly better than the $0.05 expectation we had on our call at the end of the first quarter, also we saw the benefit of reduced intangible asset amortization associated with the sale of the Scott Safety business and treating that now as an asset held for sale. And there was a $0.01 benefit related to our tax rate. Offsetting these items, were incremental product and channel investments in our businesses of $0.02 and a $0.01 impact of foreign currency.","Turning to slide 15, on free cash flow as we did at the end of the first quarter, because of the significance of the one-off items that we have and the choppiness in free cash flow during fiscal 2017, we wanted to provide a reconciliation for you of the reported cash flow to adjusted cash flow and you can see this quarter, we had about $100 million of tax payments and $100 million of our ongoing integration and transaction costs.","Our second quarter adjusted free cash flow was a solid $300 million and we continue to target adjusted free cash flow conversion of around 80% for the year. Moving to our balance sheet on slide 16, we saw a net debt to capital ratio pretty consistent at around 40%. And as I mentioned earlier during the quarter we did issue about $1.6 billion of fixed rate long-term debt, $500 million in the U.S. at a rate of 4.5%, and \u20ac1 billion at 1%.","These proceeds were used to repay outstanding debt, which is primarily commercial paper, and the proceeds will also be used for general corporate purposes. The financing costs in the second half of the year will be higher than our first half, given the increased debt levels as well as the generally higher interest rate environment as we move into the second half.","In the second quarter, as Alex mentioned, we also increased the original share repurchase program that we had of $200 million to $250 million by $500 million bringing the total for fiscal 2017 up to around $750 million.","Turning to slide 17, just touching on a couple of things here, noteworthy, as it relates to divestitures. We've talked already about the Scott Safety sale to 3M and I've got a specific slide that I'll go through some of the specifics on that and additionally we completed the sale of ADT South Africa for about $130 million. Second in line with our expectations, we'll continue to have certain special items in the second half of the year along the lines of those listed on the slide.","And then the final thing, I wanted to point out is, we talked about on the first quarter call, the reorganization that was taking place at our buildings business, which will result in a new segment reporting structure for the company and given some of the complexities associated with the IT requirements to get really the underlying plumbing, if you will, in place to report in our new segments. We will now be doing that in the fourth quarter and at the same time we announce our year-end earnings, we will provide the quarterly results on the new reportable segment basis for fiscal 2017. So you've got that information for comparability as you move into fiscal 2018.","So let's talk a little bit on slide 18 about the Scott Safety divestiture; $2 billion purchase price, I think as you know is based on a 13 times trailing EBITDA multiple and we still believe the net proceeds will be in the $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion range. If you take that plus the $130 million of proceeds from the ADT South Africa sale plus the cash flow that we expect from the Tyco business in fiscal 2017, we will have paid down the $4 billion of TSarl-related debt at probably the $2.4 billion to $2.5 billion level.","So, we're going to end up after we get the proceeds from the Scott sale. So, by the end of calendar 2017 say, we are going to probably be down to $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion in TSarl debt outstanding. So, real positive development there. As it relates to the loss of the Scott EBIT, which is $0.07 dilutive that is going to be more than offset by the interest savings and the pay down of the TSarl debt, as well as the share repurchases that we've talked about.","Moving to slide 19, we've got a waterfall again here of EPS guidance for Q3. And just as a reminder, and we've talked about this before, but we're really now entering the second half of this year, which is our seasonally higher earnings period and I guess think in terms of probably 40% in the first half and 60% in the second half. Our guidance for Q3 is $0.70 to $0.73, which represents a 15% to 20% improvement year-over-year, and again that excludes some of the special items that we talked about previously.","As far as comparative to fiscal 2016 Q3, you can see in the waterfall that our growth will be driven by $0.07 of cost and productivity savings, volume and mix will deliver $0.03, and the lower tax rate will deliver $0.02 year-on-year. And then, the headwinds that we have going into Q3 would be the continued investments that we make in our business for us $0.01 and we also have FX that's a bit of a headwind for us estimated at $0.01 as well.","So moving to slide 20, full year guidance, a couple highlights before we talk about full year guidance. We are taking our organic growth for the full year down from 2.5% to 4.5%, which is our original guidance. We're now taking that to approximately 3%. Having said that, we still are going to reconfirm our margins at 80 basis points to 110 basis points. And then, the other thing I would just comment on is, as we talk through the amortization benefit we're getting for the held for sale accounting for the Scott business that is essentially being offset by an increase in net financing costs for the quarter. So those two kind of neutralize each other.","So with all of that, we've tightened the range for our full year EPS guidance from $2.60 to $2.75 down to $2.60 to $2.68, and that still represents a 13% to 16% increase year-over-year.","So with that, Antonella, we can it open up for questions.","Antonella Franzen - Johnson Controls International Plc","Great. Thanks, Brian. Operator, if you could please open-up the line for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session in today's conference. Our first question comes from Gautam Khanna from Cowen & Company.","Your line is now open.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC","Yes. Thanks. Good morning, guys.","George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc","Good morning.","Antonella Franzen - Johnson Controls International Plc","Good morning.","Alex A. Molinaroli - Johnson Controls International Plc","Good morning.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC","So, just on the second half walk at Buildings, clearly we need fairly substantial margin improvement, certainly north of a 100 basis points at Lux. Can you talk about some of the drivers, I mean, obviously there is volume leverage, you have lower investment sequentially in Q3. But, maybe comment on the profile of the backlog you've been booking, is that actually accretive to the mix or to the margins that you're currently showing? And maybe talk a little bit about some of these projects that you've been booking and whether those are coming in at above segment average margin or any color you can give on why we should have confidence in the second half margin ramp at Buildings? Thanks.","Alex A. Molinaroli - Johnson Controls International Plc","So, I'm going to turn this over to George cause he's into the details, but I just give you a sense for the back half of the year, particularly with legacy Johnson Controls. What I would tell you is that, the leverage on the volume is going to be the biggest single thing, but you also have to remember particularly in legacy Johnson Controls, the HVAC business itself is the service business is high margin and the volumes there are much different than they are in the winter season. So, you're going to get two things that are going to be incremental. George could talk about the backlog, I don't think there is anything significantly different about the backlog but there is going to be a lot more volume running through there.","George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc","Yeah, Gautam. I think to understand the third and fourth quarter, I think we need to drill into the second quarter and then I'll walk you to what you can expect here in the third and fourth quarter. So in the second quarter, the guidance we provided was for a modest increase in the margin rate in the second quarter. And so what happened was, when you look at the margin that came through we're getting tremendous productivity in costs savings as it relates with the synergies, that's coming through, that's 50 basis points. The investments that we're making both 30 basis points and when you drill into that, I would tell you across the board we're getting great traction with those investments.","Whether it be in the applied space with our chiller investments, whether it be in the DX space with the work that we're doing in resi and in small commercial, in the control space with our launch of Metasys 8.1 and there's the Verasys platform. And then across the Fire and Security businesses with the new investments we're making where in spite of the pressure that we've had with the heavy industrial, high-hazard we continue to make great progress there.","The second piece is that we had a project, a very large project that we took a significant charge here in the second quarter that has impacted our margin rate by about 20 basis points. And then the last, I think, is most important as we project third and fourth quarter, is the unfavorable mix, which is about 30 basis points.","And when you think of that mix, our growth, the 3% growth that we achieved in the second quarter was driven by install. And as you know the install revenues come through at a lower margin. And that, at the same time, when our product business was down about 1%. So as you project going forward and that was roughly 30 basis points which drove the 30 basis point decline in total.","So as you project the third quarter and fourth quarter, we have inflection in our products, we see continued momentum in the legacy BE product businesses. We start to see, we \u2013 sequentially we are seeing growth in the Fire and Security product businesses and they'll continue to accelerate in the third quarter and fourth quarter and so that is good mix coming through.","And then as the Alex talked about, seasonally we start to get our pickup in service revenues in the third quarter and fourth quarter which is good mix. And then with the, just the nature of the business being higher volume in the third quarter and fourth quarter, we get nice leverage on that volume. And so as we look at now third quarter and fourth quarter, we're positioned to deliver about a 90-basis point improvement in margin rate. And that ultimately supports the overall margin rate that we projected for the company for the year.","Brian J. Stief - Johnson Controls International Plc","Understand one more thing that, that...","Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC","And that 90 basis points that...sorry, go ahead.","Alex A. Molinaroli - Johnson Controls International Plc","So I was just going to add one more thing that the Hitachi sales were down for the quarter. We have line of sight to some orders that are seasonal that last year, we saw in one quarter and now we're going to see in the third quarter. So I also think that we have some pretty good confidence around the Hitachi business also.","Operator","Your next question comes from Nigel Coe from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks. Good morning, guys.","George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc","Good morning.","Antonella Franzen - Johnson Controls International Plc","Good morning.","Alex A. Molinaroli - Johnson Controls International Plc","Good morning.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","So I just want to kind of pick up where Gautam left off. So, as we go into second half year, I think you've threaded the bridge quite nicely, the down 30 basis points. So it looks like synergies will be picking up to maybe 60 basis points, 70 basis points, maybe 80 basis points in 3Q and 4Q. Hopefully, no more charges. So that goes away. Is there enough growth in products to get us to a positive mix in the second half of the year? And then on Alex's comments about Hitachi picking up in 3Q, my understanding is that Hitachi is a lower margin business. So why does that help margin?","George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc","Yeah, Nigel, let me start with Hitachi. So starting there we do see from a second quarter to third quarter last year, we had a timing of shipments that ultimately now this year has pushed to the third quarter. That's going to give us a nice lift within the legacy BE product portfolio. When you look at products in total, just pure volumes, and that starts with the \u2013 the demand that we see in the \u2013 in the order rates that we're seeing across our \u2013 across all of our product businesses accelerate in the third quarter and fourth quarter.","And as I've been \u2013 we've been talking about in the legacy Tyco product businesses, we've seen sequential improvement continuing every quarter. And although, we have been \u2013 we went from mid \u2013 down mid-single digits in the first quarter, down low single digits in the second quarter, we're going to inflect here in the third quarter and fourth quarter. We're seeing continued acceleration with the end markets recovering that we support. So, that gives us a lot of confidence with that mix coming through, as well as service. When you look at the \u2013 the service business across both sets of businesses coming together.","Think about it this way. We've got a tremendous field organization, that now has come together, that have a combination of customers that they are serving and now we can take our combined capabilities to be able to do a lot more for the customers that we serve. And we're already seeing some of that traction come through. And so, we are very confident that we're going to see an uplift there with that mix in the third quarter and fourth quarter, typically, it's a seasonal high for us. But above and beyond that, we believe that with some of the revenue synergies that we see, we're going to be able to capitalize that in the second half. And that again would be very positive mix to the overall portfolio.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks. Thanks, George. And a quick follow on, on the product side, down one (39:00) you saw in 2Q. How did that look ex-Scott Safety? Was it \u2013 was Scott accretive to that number? And then, is there anything non-cyclical going on in terms of retail or in terms of residential where there might be some market share loss, so some (39:16) structural pressures in those markets?","George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc","No, Nigel. As we look at all of our product businesses, we've been performing and continuing to maintain and grow share across all of the segments. So there is no concern there as far as losing share.","When you look at the type of product businesses, there was similar type pressure within the Scott Safety as it relates to the heavy industrial, high-hazard business. Recall that we had bought the IST Business, which gave us a bigger portfolio, bigger footprint into that end market, that has been somewhat pressured here short-term. But again, we're beginning to see a very nice pipeline of orders or activity in orders coming through, and that will also inflect here in the second half of the year.","Antonella Franzen - Johnson Controls International Plc","And Nigel, the only other thing I would point out is, remember our \u2013 the legacy Tyco retail business actually sits in the field, and that is continuing to perform well.","Alex A. Molinaroli - Johnson Controls International Plc","And Nigel, this is Alex. I thought I would use it \u2013 since you ask about share, we talked about growth in products because one of the things that's, may not be clear, as we looked at how we put out our numbers, and as we pull together the organization \u2013 and I mentioned it, but I just wanted to put a little finer point on it.","Our Light Commercial and Residential businesses are performing extremely well and outperforming the market, and as I look at what's happening with our peers, and we're just \u2013 I'm really proud of what the team is doing, and we're seeing the same thing in our Applied business.","So, our HVAC businesses are really doing well, and then I think then as the volumes increase seasonally, that's going to drop to the bottom-line. So I just wanted to make sure that didn't get lost because of how we're reporting the numbers here.","Operator","Speakers, our next question comes from Jeffrey Sprague from Vertical Research. Your line is now open.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Thank you. Good morning or good afternoon. Hey, just a couple of things, lot of talk about comparisons as we work through all the moving pieces. I get the seasonal lift H1 to H2, it does seem that the comparisons of legacy Tyco especially but even JCI BE organically are a bit harder as we move into the back as particularly the June quarter. This is as you look at kind of the backlog conversion, just kind of wondering your confidence level really in that 3% organic growth number, for the June quarter and maybe you can give us some color on how that splits between BE and Power?","George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc","As far as the growth or the...","Antonella Franzen - Johnson Controls International Plc","The organic growth.","Alex A. Molinaroli - Johnson Controls International Plc","Organic growth.","George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc","So, Jeff, just to go through each of the segments, so when you look at Buildings and what we're seeing not only in the \u2013 we're building a very strong pipeline. We're beginning to convert at a higher rate that pipeline and that's positioned us to continue to accelerate the revenue that we achieve. Now remember there was a large shipment last year in Hitachi that moved from second quarter to this year's third quarter, that's going to be a significant contributor to the pickup in organic growth this year.","And then with what we see coming through based on what's been booked, we see continuing at or above the rate that we're currently at in the third quarter and being able to continue to accelerate in the fourth quarter on that conversion that gets us to roughly, it's roughly 2.5% for the \u2013 roughly, kind of mid \u2013 2.5% to 3% for the year within the segment.","So, we're feeling very good about our ability to be able to execute on that. In the Power business it really depends on how the lead fluctuates and how it's reported. But at the end of the day, we're right now seeing a roughly mid-single-digits in the third quarter. We typically have our seasonal high in the fourth quarter and based on what we see today, that's going to be very strong in the fourth quarter. So as we look at the total year, we're still in the 4% to 6% range for the organic growth in Power. So overall we feel very good about the activity that we see, how we're converting the market activity and ultimately the position that we're in to be able to deliver on the second half.","Alex A. Molinaroli - Johnson Controls International Plc","Yeah. Just on Power, for a lot of you, it might be your first cycle through Power. So, you may not have lived through this, but a lot of the seasonality is something that happens, it's not something to worry about, what you worry about is if we lost any share, and we haven't lost any share, in fact we've gained share and then when you think about the growth in the emerging products around AGM that's really going to bode well for the future.","So I think our confidence level is high. We can't control sometimes the quarter to quarter seasonality, but I think the team there, when we talk to them, they feel pretty good about the rest of the year. As it relates to Buildings, I mean I think George hit it right. I feel good about the progress we're making and I think that the fact that we're starting to see the orders come through certainly within the field and then just going to come through in the products, I think we'll start seeing the leverage. And I think that shows up and it's tightening the range.","Brian J. Stief - Johnson Controls International Plc","I would just add this, Jeff, to summarize what George said, I mean, when we look at Q3, we've really got Buildings around 3% as it relates to organic sales growth and I think Power Solutions is probably in the 4.5% to 5% range and when you put those together, we're in that approximate 3% organic growth for Q3 and based upon what our teams have told us and us looking at opportunities, we think that's very doable at that 3% level for Q3, so.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Great, thanks for all that color. Then separately, on just TSarl obviously you have stepped up now and done some share repurchase, but given that you've knocked that down so hard, is your urgency on further reduction somewhat diminished, and can we see maybe a stronger pivot to share repurchase in say 2018 whereas at least I was thinking maybe it was a 2019 story on share repurchase?","Brian J. Stief - Johnson Controls International Plc","Yeah. That's still something we're going to have to look at, Jeff. I mean, technically, the answer is until that entire $4 billion is paid off, you have to have pretty robust procedures and controls in place to ring-fence that debt. There may be a practical level at which time you look at it and say if it's down at a certain level, you don't necessarily need to be as strict with the rules. But I would tell you that if we get that down to $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion at the end of next year, we've always kind of looked at 2018 as being further pay down. And once that gets down to less than $1 billion, I think we probably have a little bit more flexibility relative to share repurchase. But I would just tell you that's something we haven't fully analyzed yet. But the good news is, the pay down of the debt is coming at a much faster rate than we had anticipated quite honestly six months ago.","Operator","Speakers, our next question comes from Deane Dray from RBC. Your line is now open.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc","Good morning.","Antonella Franzen - Johnson Controls International Plc","Good morning, Deane.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, I would like to get a little more color on this Texas University integrated win because this is really part of that whole holy grail of integrated building services that you're working towards. So the idea of like, were these separate bids or bundled bids? How many points of contact did you have during this process from the customer side and what do you do with regarding any product subsidies, one business subsidizing the other in this process and how do you referee those?","George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc","Yeah. So, we're going through a major integration of our field force in North America, and certainly, we're going to be positioned as a leader across all of our domains. And what's been nice is, while we're going through that process, the teams are working within their current structures in how they're continuing to serve customers. And while we're integrating all of our systems and processes, have found ways to be able to leverage the customer base that we serve today. And then, as new opportunities are coming up, we're getting kind of first look on those opportunities with the other domains that we are not serving those customers with. And that is simple as that. That's what this was. We have a strong relationship in one of the businesses, working with this customer, and then have gone forward to say, this would \u2013 this is what our total capabilities are and what we can ultimately do. It came through one bid opportunity that we put all of our capabilities together. And because of that, we can maintain our fundamentals, while we're getting the additional growth by putting all of our capabilities together. So, we're seeing this, a lot of this activity, across our entire field, and that's what's building a pretty robust pipeline of opportunities that we're beginning to covert.","Alex A. Molinaroli - Johnson Controls International Plc","Hey, Deane. What I would say is that this is going better than we thought. And, just to put it in simple terms, you talked about one project because we highlighted it. But there are, we're tracking these things, all the way here because it's an important part of why we did this, and things are happening quicker than we thought. And then George is a little bit modest because we've adopted an organizational change particularly in North America where we're bringing people together. And so, a lot of the \u2013 kind of the underlying question about, how hard is this to work together, a lot of those barriers are already broken down.","So, I am really bullish on this. And in fact, it was a big strategic question a year ago, would we get the pull through and the cross selling that we expected and I tell you it's going to be better than we thought.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Got it. And then just as a follow-up on the Scott Safety divestiture. Just give us a sense are there more non-core divestitures that you're looking at? I mean, when I look back at the South Africa decision that makes complete sense you did this several years ago with exiting South Korea, those are special situations you really can't leverage the brand, it's a different set of security laws.","But within the portfolio are there more divestitures that you're looking at?","Alex A. Molinaroli - Johnson Controls International Plc","Well, Deane, we certainly are going to tell you everything that we're doing. But I would just say that we're looking across our portfolio as our strategy gets tighter and tighter around being a leader in Buildings and Energy, it helps us understand, what are some of the opportunities there.","Because what we want to make sure is we invest in the businesses that makes sense for us. When you think about the Scott Safety business, what a great business that is. It's a fantastic business. But you know, it's probably not at the right place when you think about where we want to invest going forward.","So I guess, the short answer is we're continuing to look, I think that what we've done so far is right on point. And I know that legacy Tyco folks will open up their portfolio, certainly at Johnson Controls we're doing the same thing. Now, we have a different framework, because we're a combined company and we certainly are taking a relook at some things that maybe, we haven't thought about in a while. So just kind of leave it with that unless you have something to add, George.","Operator","Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities","Hi, good morning.","Antonella Franzen - Johnson Controls International Plc","Good morning.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities","Good morning. So, you gave some good detail on the improving mix from here in Buildings. So I guess if we look at Power Solutions, you had double-digit underlying profit growth again year-on-year, same rate as in Q1. So obviously mix is a good tailwind there in the first half. Maybe clarify, how confident you are that those mix tailwinds can persist in the second half? And I just wondered related to that, if there is any kind of guidance now for the year on the ex-lead margin in that business?","George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc","Yeah. So Julian, what I would say in Power Solutions, we've done a really nice job driving productivity, continued productivity, as well as we're benefiting from the mix, the higher mix of the AGM. And so that has enabled us to offset the 220 basis points of headwind that we had on lead and being able to offset that for the quarter and deliver a margin rates that were up 10 basis points. As you project the year, we're going to see continued mix there with continuing increase in AGM shipments and that'll continue with all of the capacity we put into place and over the next few years that will continue. And we're still getting very strong productivity.","So overall, for the year, when we project the margins, I think it's \u2013 we're going to be modestly down for the year. But overall, that's really a factor of the lead pricing.","Brian, I don't know, if you want to comment?","Brian J. Stief - Johnson Controls International Plc","Yeah. Julian, I think, it really is a function, with the lead prices where they are now, there will be pressure on reported margins. But if you look at our margins ex-lead, we should see positive improvement year-over-year there. So with the volatility in lead, you really need to look at those margins, as you know, ex-lead and those should be up year-over-year.","Alex A. Molinaroli - Johnson Controls International Plc","So Julian, the last thing I'd just add to this, if you look at it on a long-term basis, there's two things that are going to end up happening, underlying. First is, our AGM mix will continue to add as a positive to our margins and then we're going to continue to launch capacity particularly in China and as we go through the launch of some of these China plants, it will be a little bit lumpy as that happens. So those are the two things, I mean there's obviously lots of other things as it relates to timing, but if you think about our business moving forward, overall margins will improve, but as we add capacity there will be some lumps in this as we go.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities","Thanks. And then just my second question would be, maybe more for Brian. You gave a little bit of color on the sort of aggregate part of the gross debt, at the end of this year, the calendar year. Maybe, when we think about other factors like cash restructuring charges and the moving parts around cash taxes, is there any update you could provide on the net debt or net leverage level you expect 12 months from now at the company?","Brian J. Stief - Johnson Controls International Plc","Well, I think the leverage that we've talked about historically has been 2% to 2.5% and I think with the choppy cash flow we've had in 2017, you really need to look to 2018 to see what type of balance sheet flexibility we're going to have. But, I think once we get out of this year, as I mentioned, we still target 80% free cash flow conversion, but that's on an adjusted basis, right. So we're going to need to get into fiscal 2018, kind of get our feet underneath us a little bit relative to a year that's a bit more normal. And, I think with the cash flow in fiscal 2018, we're going to be in a position where we can further pay down debt and improve our leverage position.","Now, the one thing, I'd point out as we look at fiscal 2018 and 2019, the term debt payments that we have coming due are pretty nominal. It's really into 2020 before we start seeing any term debt repayments of any significance. So, we've got a lot of flexibility as we look at 2018 and 2019 and our cash flow gets to a more normalized position.","Antonella Franzen - Johnson Controls International Plc","Operator, we have time for one more question.","Operator","Next question comes for Steve Tusa from JPMorgan Chase. Your line is now open.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks for slipping me in here.","George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc","Good morning.","Antonella Franzen - Johnson Controls International Plc","Good morning.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","You guys called out $0.01 of amortization in the second quarter bridge, where is that in the third quarter bridge? Because, I still think you got a, it's probably a benefit year-over-year \u2013 bit of a benefit year-over-year still?","Antonella Franzen - Johnson Controls International Plc","Yep. It fully offsets with the net financing charges in the third quarter that's why you don't see it on the bridge.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. So, it's not a discrete item like it was called out in this quarter. And then just building efficiency. So, you guys talked about I think 50 basis points of productivity but for the year or for the total Co. you had, the productivity was higher than that. Was there \u2013 what kind of \u2013 can you just like maybe explain precisely a little bit more around what kind of offset that or is there just a little bit more around, I guess the mix headwinds you had in the quarter? More specifically what types of \u2013 what part of the business that was in?","Antonella Franzen - Johnson Controls International Plc","So, Steve, you're referring more to in Buildings, the mix headwinds that we were talking about?","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah. I guess, I'm just trying to figure out why productivity didn't read through more in building efficiency. Is it, is there greater productivity somewhere else maybe at corporate or in the battery business maybe? I would have thought the productivity would have been higher there.","Antonella Franzen - Johnson Controls International Plc","Yep. So, when you look at the productivity and you look and you see where that sixth sense of synergies and productivity is, you have a piece going through Buildings that George had referenced early of about $30 million and then the rest of it remember you have some through Power because they're having productivity as well because it's synergies and productivity and you also have a piece of that going through corporate. So it's going across all three of those.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Got it. So, it's a little more than just kind of the pure acquisition synergies, so some of the base stuff that they were doing at Battery prior. And then just one \u2013 one last one.","George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc","Just for everyone's knowledge, if you remember, we are now talking about productivity and merger synergies as one bucket. It kind of goes all...","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Right.","George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc","...the way back to the EPG conference. That's \u2013 that's really our \u2013 if you want to go with the framework we're using, it goes back to EPG a year ago, and it's the framework we've put in place.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","That makes a ton of sense. And then, just lastly, this $10 million hit on the contractor project this quarter. What precisely type of project was that? Was that in old JCI, old Tyco? I would assume it was an install job.","George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc","Yeah. So it's in the legacy BE portfolio in North America, very large project that working with the customer we had accelerated the execution of that project and took on some additional charges. And so, with that, we'll continue to work with the customer and it's hard to predict ultimately what we'll recover. But at the end of the day, it's being positioned to deliver on what we've committed to the customer that we're serving, and took some additional costs in the quarter.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks a lot, guys. Appreciate it.","Antonella Franzen - Johnson Controls International Plc","Thanks. I'd like to turn the call over to Alex now for some closing comments.","Alex A. Molinaroli - Johnson Controls International Plc","Sure. Thanks, everyone, for joining us. I just would like to recap a couple of things. One is, if you look at the businesses, if we're going to see growth this quarter, it's good to see that the Buildings business getting on track. And I feel like we're going to gain some momentum. And underlying that, we got some stabilization in our products business, the fire protection products business, and some real strong growth in our HVAC businesses, particularly in our light commercial, residential, and even our applied equipment. So, we think that'll continue and then the other part around our merger cost synergies we're more and more bullish. We've gotten through the corporate piece of this and now we're moving into the Buildings part of it and it's going well. In the meantime, the sales synergies, and I referred to that earlier, that's secured, that we're seeing through the cross-sell opportunities is a real opportunity. I mean, this is not something that is an abstract. We see the projects, we see excitement and our customers are really embracing this opportunity. So, it's going to be a tailwind for us in the long run. And so, we're pretty confident we have the right strategy. We look forward to talking about this over the next few months with everyone, but things are getting clear and clear and the teams are coming together.","So, I just want to leave it at that and I'll talk to you soon.","Antonella Franzen - Johnson Controls International Plc","Thanks. Operator that concludes our call.","Operator","Thank you. That concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation.

[Operator Instructions] This conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time.","I will turn the call over to Antonella Franzen, Vice President and Chief Investor Relations and Communications Officer.","Antonella Franzen","Good morning and thank you for joining our conference call to discuss Johnson Controls fourth quarter fiscal 2018 results. The press release and all related tables issued earlier this morning as well as the conference call slide presentation can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website at johnsoncontrols.com. With me today are Johnson Controls\u2019 Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, George Oliver; and our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Brian Stief.","Before we begin, I would like to remind you that during the course of today\u2019s call, we will be providing certain forward-looking information. We ask that you review today\u2019s press release and read through the forward-looking cautionary informational statements that we\u2019ve included there.","In addition, we will use certain non-GAAP measures in our discussions, and we ask that you read through the sections of our press release that address the use of these items. In discussing our results during the call, references to adjusted EBITA and adjusted EBIT margins exclude restructuring and integration costs as well as other special items. These metrics are non-GAAP measures and are reconciled in the schedules attached to our press release, and in the appendix to the presentation posted on our website.","GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to Johnson Controls ordinary shareholders was $0.83 for the quarter and included a net charge of $0.10 related to special items. These special items primarily relate to restructuring and integration cost in the quarter. Adjusting for these special items, non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.93 per share compared to $0.87 in the prior year quarter.","Now let me turn the call over to George.","George Oliver","Thanks, Antonella and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today. Let\u2019s get started with a high level review of what we have accomplished over the last 12 months starting on Slide 3. 2018 was a year of significant progress for Johnson Controls. We executed on our commitments and exited the year with strong momentum. We made significant strides on all of our target metrics and key initiatives. And I will touch on a few of those in just a minute.","We executed a disciplined approach to capital allocation, have been paid down nearly $2.6 billion in debt and returning excess cash to shareholders, including $300 million in share repurchases and almost $1 billion in dividends. We established the cash management office and challenge the team to drive operational improvements by establishing sound fundamental processes and metrics across the organization, which resulted in a 30% increase in cash from operations year-over-year and improved free cash flow conversion to 88%.","We changed our annual and long-term compensation incentives to better align with shareholder priorities. And lastly, we have made significant progress over the past several months related to the strategic review of Power Solutions. We have assessed multiple options and are now in the final stages of that review as we weigh all possibilities before reaching a final decision. We will provide an update when complete. While I am very proud of what the team accomplished this year there is still a lot of opportunity ahead of us. And we are taking action to make sure we capture it.","Turning now to our scorecard on Slide 4. In the interest of time, I won\u2019t spend a lot of time on each item listed here on the slide, but these were eight major commitments that we made to you at the start of the year and how we performed against each of those. Contributing to our successes here is our effort to better align senior leadership with driving execution and creating a performance culture. Over the course of the year, we focused on setting more grounded expectations with increased transparency and increased accountability.","Just to touch on a few of these themes, you will notice the top floor all pertain to improving the organic growth trajectory within buildings. In 2018, we delivered 5% organic growth in aggregate across our Buildings platforms, which compares to our original guidance of up low single digits. One of the major drivers of the upside was improved execution in our service businesses across all of our regions, which is the result of the work we began in 2017 to expand our commercial capabilities, strengthened operations and increase our service technician capacity.","Service revenues grew 4% for the full year, and we exited with Q4 growth of 6% with momentum continuing into next year. We set an exceeded an aggressive target to increase our global sales capacity in Buildings, adding 950 sales people net of attrition representing roughly an 11% increase on the existing salesforce. Additionally, by applying our commercial excellence principles, we were able to improve sales productivity for both the new and veteran salesforces.","The combination is visible in the 7% organic order growth performance across our field businesses this year. Against a backdrop of healthy end market demand, orders for our service equipment and install businesses should see continued strength in 2019. You will notice two yellow checkmarks on organic growth in Power and underlying EBIT margin expansion. In both cases, we came in at the low end of our original targets.","On the margin front, although we are at the low end of what we communicated to you at the start of the year, we navigated through an accelerating inflationary environment and offset all with $30 million of costs with incremental price in 2018. We also continue to reinvest in our businesses, primarily through engineering and R&D within our products divisions, but also the incremental costs and under absorption associated with the salesforce additions I just mentioned. Lastly on free cash flow, we exceeded our target for 80%-plus conversion at 88% for the year, driven by solid performance and underlying cash from operations as well as a disciplined CapEx reduction.","Turning over to Slide 5. Buildings field orders continued to accelerate in the quarter up 9% year-over-year organically. Underlying order strength in the quarter was broad-based with all three regions up high single digits or better. We are seeing continued strength across most of our core product domains, including bookings for installation and service. Orders for large applied systems grew low double digits in both North America and EMEA\/LA. I am very proud of the work our teams have done over the course of this year, driving 7% organic order growth for the full year.","Our project pipeline remains robust and we expect continued order momentum across our end markets as we look into 2019. Backlog ended the year up 8% at $8.4 billion. With the combination of a solid backlog position and strong order growth expectations, our visibility into 2019 has improved and gives me confidence in our outlook for continued growth in field revenues next year.","Turning now to Slide 6. Let me recap the financial results for the quarter. Sales of $8.4 billion increased 3% on a reported basis and 6% on an organic basis with 8% in growth in Buildings and 2% in Power. Adjusted EBIT of approximately $1.2 billion, grew 4% on a reported basis and 9% when adjusting for the impacts of the Scott Safety divestiture, foreign exchange and lead. Favorable volume and mix as well as the benefit of cost synergy and productivity savings more than offset incremental organic investments back into our business.","Overall, EBIT margins expanded 10 basis points year-over-year on a reported basis or 50 basis points excluding the impact of the Scott Safety divestiture, FX and lead. Underlying performance was led by Buildings, which expanded core margins by 60 basis points in the quarter. Adjusted free cash flow in the quarter was approximately $1.3 billion, which brings the full year to $2.3 billion, representing 88% conversion.","Brian will discuss our performance in more detailed later in the call, but I would like to recognize the cash management office as well as the numerous dedicated individuals throughout the organization who put in a tremendous amount of effort this year. Significantly improving our cash processes and positioning us to deliver a sustained strong free cash flow.","Slide 7 bridges our EPS growth year-over-year with respect to some of the items I just discussed, as well as the number of other small items, which impacted us during the quarter. Adjusted earnings per share was $0.93, up 7% over the prior year.","With that, I will turn it over to Brian to discuss the performance within the segments.","Brian Stief","Thanks, George, and good morning. So starting with Slide 8, let\u2019s take a look at performance of Buildings on a consolidated basis. You can see that building sales in the quarter of $6.2 billion increased 8% organically with our products revenues up 9% and field up 7% and that was really led by a strong 6% growth in service and accelerating growth in project installations, which were grew 7%.","Divestitures, primarily the sale of Scott Safety were a 3 percentage point headwind and FX was about 1 percentage headwind. Buildings consolidated EBITA of $939 million grew 11% organically with strong growth in both our field and shorter cycle products businesses. Buildings EBITA margin expanded 10 basis points to 15.2%, which includes a 50 basis point headwind from the divestiture of Scott Safety and FX. So on a normalized basis, our margins expanded a solid 60 basis points.","As you can see in the margin waterfall, synergy and productivity save and favorable volume leverage and mix contributed 120 basis points, which includes positive price cost in the quarter. And this was partially offset by 50 basis points of planned incremental product and sales capacity investments. As George mentioned field orders increased 9% organically and our backlog is up 8% to $8.4 billion.","Now let\u2019s review each of the segments within Buildings. So turning to Slide 9 in North America. Sales of $2.3 billion grew 8% organically as we saw project installation activity accelerating 10% were service growth up 4%. We saw another quarter of solid performance and applied HVAC and controls platforms, which grew mid-single digits organically, led by an 8% growth in core applied HVAC equipment installation and service. Fire and security grew high-single digits with balanced growth across each platform, led by mid-teens growth in security project installations. Our solutions business, which is only about 10% of North America\u2019s revenue, grew high teens on a relatively easy prior year compare just as a reminder, this business can be a bit choppy for an order and revenue standpoint on a quarter-to-quarter basis.","So if you look at North America adjusted EBITA of $336 million, it grew 7% year-over-year, and EBIT margin was flat at 14.5% as we saw the benefits of volume leverage and synergy and productivity save being offset by the planned salesforce investments and an unfavorable mix as we saw installed revenues grow at more than twice the rate of service in the quarter. Orders in North America increased to strong 8% organically, driven by applied HVAC orders up low-double digits, and fire and security orders up mid-single digits. Backlog of $5.4 billion increased 6% year-over-year.","So moving to EMEA\/LA on Slide 10. Sales of $948 million grew 6% organically with continued strength in service, which was up 8% and we saw an inflection and project installations plus 4%, which had been soft as we worked off the lower backlogs as we entered 2018.","Growth was positive across all regions and across all lines of business with the exception of the Middle East HVAC business. Europe grew high-single digits driven primarily by a rebound in Industrial Refrigeration and HVAC and orders in Europe, increased high-single digits organically in Q4 led by strong demand in IR, HVAC, fire suppression and security.","In the Middle East, revenues were up slightly as continued growth in service was mostly offset by continued softness in HVAC project installations. In Latin America, revenues increased high-single digits led by strength in our security monitoring business, in addition to solid growth in controls and fire suppression.","Adjusted EBITDA of $103 million increased 8% on a reported basis, with 15% organically. And EBITDA margins expanded 60 basis points to 10.9%. But again, this includes 30 basis point headwinds from foreign currency. The underlying margin improvement of 90 basis points was a result of favorable volume and mix and the productivity in synergy save, which was again offset by salesforce investments. Orders in EMEA\/LA increased 10% with solid growth in all regions across both service and project installation. And our backlog ended up at $1.5 billion, up 9%.","So moving to Slide 11 on Asia-Pac, sales of $689 million, grew 4% organically driven by strength in service. Project installation revenue grew a modest percent for strong growth in fire and security and IR, offset by continued weakness in HVAC. Adjusted EBITDA of $105 million, declined 4% year-over-year. And adjusted EBITDA margin declined 90 basis points to 15.2%, where we again saw the benefit of productivity save, cost synergies, and favorable volumes more than offset by salesforce additions and underlying margin pressure.","As we highlighted for you at the end of Q3, we did expect to see some margin pressure in Q4 related to the highly competitive environment in China, but we do expect our margins to stabilize in the early part of fiscal 2019 and expect overall modest margin expansion throughout the year fiscal 2019. Asia-Pac orders increased 8% driven primarily by service orders, which are up 20% in the quarter. And our backlog increased 11% to $1.5 billion.","So turning to global products in Slide 12. Our sales increased a very strong 9% organically to $2.2 billion with high-teens growth in Building Management Systems, high single-digit growth in HVAC and Refrigeration Equipment and low double-digit growth in Specialty Products. In BMS, we saw strong growth across our controls, fire detection and security businesses. Sales across the HVAC and Refrigeration Equipment grew high-single digits, global residential HVAC, which does include our consolidated Hitachi's JVs in Japan and Taiwan through low double digits in the quarter.","Our North American residential HVAC revenues grew just over 20% in the quarter, which was aided by a relatively easy prior year compare, but we did see the favorable weather which drove higher replacement demand and we gained market share with new product introductions as well as the expansion of our distribution footprint. We also saw strong price realization in the channel during the quarter.","Global light commercial HVAC grew low-single digits led by mid single-digit growth in North America, despite a real tough mid-teens prior year compare. IR equipment revenues grew mid-single digits in the quarter, led by high-teens growth in North America and our applied HVAC equipment business grew low double digits reflecting strengthen our indirect channels in both North America and Asia. And finally, our low double-digit growth in Specialty Products was driven by an increased demand for fire suppression, with broad-based growth across all of our regions.","Segment EBITA of $395 million was up 3% on a reported basis, but up 18% if you exclude the impact of the Scott Safety divestiture. Our reported segment EBITA margins of 60 basis points include 100 basis point headwind related to Scott Safety. So our underlying segment margins expanded 160 basis points in the quarter, the 17.8%, where we saw the higher volume leverage and mixed positive price costs in the quarter and the benefits of cost synergies and productivity save, partially offset by the planned channel and product investments we've talked to you about in the past.","So let's move to Slide 13 and talk about Power Solutions. Sales of $2.2 billion increased 2% organically on a tough prior year compare, and this was driven mostly by a decline in unit shipments, primarily in our aftermarket channel. Total battery shipments declined 1% year-over-year with shipments to OE customers up 5% and aftermarket shipments down 2%, and I would just note that on a comparative basis, we shipped a record number of batteries in Q4 of last year after a relatively soft Q3.","Our growth in OE shipments outpaced global market growth and also reflects several new business wins that we expect to continue as we move forward. In addition to tough prior year compare shipments to the aftermarket channel were impacted by about 1% percentage point related to Hurricane Florence. Global shipments of start-stop batteries increased 20% year-over-year, with strong growth in the Americas, China, and EMEA.","Segment EBITA Power of $424 million decreased 2% on the reported basis and 1% organically. And margin declined 80 basis points year-over-year to 19.4%, which included a 10 basis point headwind for FX. So Power's underlying margins declined 70 basis points, which is reflective of the continued pressure around transportation costs, some unfavorable volume and mix, lower fixed cost absorption in our plants. And those items were offset by some favorability and productivity save. I would point out that freight costs do remain elevated and we expect some continued pressure in the near-term in transportation costs as we work to offset these incremental costs through pricing, as we renew agreements with our customers.","On Slide 14 corporate expense was down 11% year-over-year to $95 million and again, we make good progress on the synergy and productivity saving front. So let me turn to Page 15 and talk about cash flow. Our reported cash flow was $1 billion in the quarter and if you exclude the planned integration and restructuring payments and a non-recurring tax payment of about $300 million, our adjusted free cash flow was a strong $1.3 billion in Q4. For the full year, adjusted free cash flow was $2.3 billion, which is up roughly $1 billion over the prior year, and as George mentioned represented free cash flow conversion of 88%.","For the full year, we delivered significant improvement in cash from operations and also reduced our CapEx spend by about $200 million relative to our original plan of $1.25 billion and as we go forward, we'll continue to use a very disciplined CapEx approach. If I look forward to fiscal 2019 adjusted free cash flow conversion will approximate 90% and that guidance excludes special cash outflow items of about $300 million to $400 million and also excludes the $600 million tax refund that we expect either in late fiscal 2019 or early fiscal 2020.","Turning the balance sheet on Slide 16. Our balance sheet position continues to improve with net debt down nearly $1 billion sequentially in the quarter to $10.8 billion. Our net debt to EBITDA leverage is 2.2 and our net debt to cap declined to 33.8%. During the quarter, we repurchased 1.2 million shares for $45 million and for the year, we repurchased 7.7 million shares for $300 million in line with our original plans.","Additionally, as we look to 2019, we're now in a better position to return more cash to our shareholders. The Board of Directors has approved an additional $1 billion share repurchase authorization, which is in addition to the $900 million that remains in prior authorizations. We do expect to complete approximately $1 billion of share repurchases during fiscal 2019.","And finally, let me just touch on a couple of other items on Slide 17, before I turn it back over to George. I'd like to give you a quick update on U.S. tax reform, as you know, our original assessment was that the effect on our fiscal 2019 rate could be in the range of up to a rate of 16% to 18%, and as we work through the details of the provisions of the new tax code, we now expect our effective rate to be 16% in fiscal 2019, which compares to the 13% rate in fiscal 2018.","And then lastly, as we mentioned on the third quarter call, we've got a new revenue recognition accounting standard that will become effective for us in the first quarter of 2019. The impact of the standard on buildings is not significant, but for Power Solutions, even though there's not a significant impact on EBITA. There is an impact on revenue and as a result, there'll be a gross-up in sales which will impact our EBITA margin rate by 200 plus basis points.","We have provided in the appendix to the deck normalize financials for the quarters for Power, so you can update your models with the new information. So with that, I will turn it back over to George.","George Oliver","Thanks, Brian. Before we open up the line for questions, I want to provide you with our outlook for 2019. Let's start by walking through the puts and takes embedded in our 2019 guidance on Slide 18. As Brian mentioned, our tax rate for fiscal 2019 increases to 16% from the 13% effective rate reported in fiscal 2018, and this equates to a $0.12 headwind year-over-year, which normalizes our fiscal year 2018 EPS to $2.71.","We expect mid single-digit organic growth, which will drive approximately $0.28 of earnings and we expect this growth to be primarily driven by improved volumes and price. Additionally, we will have the continued benefit of synergies and productivity savings, which we will realize over the course of the year that will contribute an additional $0.23 of earnings.","As you are all aware, the U.S. dollar has continued to strengthen, based on recent rates, we expect this to result in an $0.08 foreign currency headwind year-over-year. Additionally, the carryover of the salesforces investments, as well as a few cents of incremental investments in our product businesses are expected to total about $0.07.","As you can see there are various other items which net to $0.07 headwind in fiscal 2019. All of these factors contributed to our fiscal 2019 EPS guidance range before special items of $2.90 to $3.05. This represents growth in the range of 7% to 13%, adjusting for the impact of the increased tax rate. The full details of our guidance is included on Slide 19.","Our guidance is based on strong underlying EBIT growth of 8% to 12%, driven by strong top line performance in synergy and productivity benefits. While we are pleased with our 2018 results and continuing momentum into 2019, there is still a lot of opportunity ahead and we remain focused on driving execution.","With that, let me turn it over to our operator to open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from the line of Nigel Coe from Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.","Nigel Coe","Thanks. Good morning, George and Brian, and Antonella.","George Oliver","Good morning, Nigel.","Antonella Franzen","Good morning.","Nigel Coe","Right. So I'm sure this is a question, you don't really want to address, but I think it has to be asked at least. I'm sure you were hoping to have an announcement about the outcome of your portfolio review that the lot of press reports around potential bidders for that business. Can you maybe just talk about, how you narrowed the range of options for Power? And if you have maybe just address that and alternatively, is everything still on tape?","George Oliver","Yes, what I would say, Nigel. We've gone through a very thorough process and have been assessing multiple options. I would tell you, we've been very disciplined in making sure that whatever the outcome is that we're going to be positioned to be able to create the most shareholder value. A little bit disappointed around the timing, but it's something that we can't control. What I would say that we have made significant progress. There are a significant number of considerations that we've taken into account. And what I believe is most important now is making the right decision versus keeping to a set timeline. We are evaluating all of the multiple options before we reach the final decision, as I said all options are still on the table.","Nigel Coe","Okay. I'll leave it there, maybe there'll be other questions then. And maybe just turning into the cash flow outlook for 2019, maybe this is for Brian, maybe just talk about, what CapEx number is in there? I'm sorry if I missed that in your prepared remarks. And then the one-timers, the $3 million to $4 million of one-timers, can you just maybe just talk about those? Are there discrete tax items in there as well?","Brian Stief","So the guidance at 90% free cash flow for fiscal 2019 has in it, roughly $1 billion of CapEx. So on a comparable level with where we ended this year, Nigel. And as far as the special items for fiscal 2019, that represents really a lot of the integration costs and restructuring that we've taken as part of the whole JCI Tyco integration, if you recall the $1 billion and save over the four-year period, we've commented that was probably about a dollar for dollar cost to save and that really reflects the remaining portion of the cost to deliver the $1 billion. There are not any unusual or non-recurring tax items in that amount.","Nigel Coe","Okay. And then just a quick one on top of that. The cash tax rate is that going forward, is that going to be similar to the GAAP tax rate?","Brian Stief","It will be certainly closer than it's been in the past, I think 2019 could be quarter-to-quarter, may be a little choppy. But for the year pretty normalized and then when we get to 2020, it should be back very close.","Nigel Coe","Okay. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Julian Mitchell from Barclays. Your line is now open.","Julian Mitchell","Hi, good morning. Maybe just the first question on the Buildings margin guidance, I think you've guided that to grow about 40 bps to 60 bps in fiscal 2019. If I look at the Q4 margin performance, you are up about 60 bps, excluding Scott Safety and I would have thought that maybe with less investment spend, maybe less price cost headwind, your margin improvement may accelerate from Q4. So maybe just help us understand what are some of the offset, is it tariffs or mix or something?","George Oliver","Yes, Julian. We've made a lot of progress here when you look at the overall margins and when you look at the aggregate of what we're forecasting here for 2019. What we'll see is very nice progress on the price cost within our products business and that's coming through as you've seen here in the last couple of quarters.","And then within our field businesses, when you look at the field businesses, we've got the headwind of the salesforce investments that we've made through the course of 2018 and that becomes in \u2013 especially in the first half of this year, some headwind on the margin rate. And so if you look at the overall margin rate, we pick up about 30 basis points on volume with the continued strong organic performance, we pick up about 60 basis points of price \u2013 I'm sorry, productivity and synergy save. And then that's being offset with the reinvestments that we have, the little bit of a headwind that we have from the salesforce expansion that we made, and then some incremental investments here in products.","As we go through the course of the year though, as we position now through 2019 and into 2020. You'll see those headwinds subside because now that we've got the growth machine working. We've got the orders now at a rate that we believe is well above the market. We're now driving our service growth and with the investments we've made in products, that's ultimately what's going to drive the growth and the overall margin expansion longer-term. And so there is a little bit of headwind here in 2019, but we feel good about the 40 to 60 basis points that we've guided here for our Buildings business here in 2019.","Julian Mitchell","Thanks. And then just my follow-up question would be \u2013 apologies if I missed. But any clarity you could give on the impact of tariffs. Maybe just what you saw the fiscal 2018 impact from tariffs was on a gross or net basis, what you're assuming it is for fiscal 2019 and maybe just any detail on how it affects the two segments differently?","George Oliver","Julian. When we looked at this, in total, for the total years, so we started to get hit with the 232s in 2018 and then subsequent to that the 301s, when you put order of magnitude across both, it's roughly about a \u2013 I'm going to say roughly about a $130 million, $140 million, and we saw about half of that come through in 2018. And I would tell you from a pricing standpoint as you all know, we got behind the price cost curve early in the year in 2018. We've been very aggressive with price through second, third and fourth quarter.","We're in very good position right now from a cost standpoint taken into account, all of our inflationary costs including tariffs that on a go-forward basis here, we're going to start to see price cost being positive throughout the year, with the work that's been done from a pricing standpoint. So we feel that we've taken all of the 301s even the full \u2013 when you look at the 301s as it relates to China, all of the potential headwind that that would potentially create, we packed that into our cost base and we've taken the pricing actions to be able to offset that.","Julian Mitchell","Very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from Andrew Kaplowitz from Citigroup. Your line is open.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Hey, good morning guys.","George Oliver","Good morning.","Antonella Franzen","Good morning.","Andrew Kaplowitz","George, field and installation picked up nicely in the quarter to 7%, helping you get to overall field revenue growth of 7%. Are if the point, given your increased salesforce, where you can feel revenue growth can basically match field backlog growth, and installation growth at the same time. Can you sustain that mid single-digit growth that you saw? And separately, just on the applied HVAC product acceleration, are you seeing new products really starting to gain traction or is it just a strong institutional markets there?","George Oliver","So let me start with the overall \u2013 the backlog, the work that we've done this year within our salesforce and how we built the backlog. All of that has been broad-based across our field businesses, across HVAC, Industrial Refrigeration through, across our Fire & Security businesses. So I would tell you it's been globally very much broad-based. Now with that backlog, we've also been able to accrete the book margins. So we've been booking better margins in backlog and that's what ultimately is going to support the margin expansion, as we go forward here through 2019 and beyond.","Now when you look at the growth rates, so we got an 8% backlog going into 2019, that is what gives me tremendous confidence that as we go through 2019, the guidance that we've given is firm, because as you look at where we started 2018, we started off with a backlog, I believe it was somewhere around 2%. And then we ultimately were able to accelerate through the course of the year to be able to get to the 5% Buildings organic growth.","So in regards to your question, I absolutely believe that you'll start to see the organic revenue growth in line with the order growth that we're achieving, you started to see that in the fourth quarter and through 2019, you'll start to see those two lines converge, on the installation side. What I'm very excited about is service, from a service standpoint, we've been expanding service. We're trying to expand service as rapidly as we're expanding our install business. As you all know, that's where we get significant improved margins and across the board, we've expanded our not only our commercial teams, but also the fulfillment capabilities to be able to drive service.","Recall, that we were \u2013 modest growth in 2017, like 1% or 2%, we were able to ramp up 3% to 4% to 5% to 6% during the quarters in 2018, and that gives me confidence we're going to see the orders that we've been able to achieve in service, begin to convert to stronger revenue here in 2019 and beyond. So in regards to that, I do believe that through the course in 2019, you'll be able to see the convergence of the organic revenue to what we've been able to achieve from an order standpoint. Now, the second question?","Antonella Franzen","HVAC.","George Oliver","On the HVAC, when you look at our HVAC performance, I couldn't be more excited about the progress we've made relative to \u2013 with the new products that we brought into the market and then the expanded distribution that we've put into place across the globe. If you look at a couple of segments, our North America residential HVAC equipment revenue was up 21%. Now I would say that, that's to an easy compare from last year. But overall, when you look at whether it'd the favorable weather that Brian talked about, the channel expansion that we've made, the price realization, that gives me tremendous confidence here that we're gaining share and making a lot of progress with the new products we've launched. When you look at light commercial, when you look \u2013 we were up about mid-single digits, but that's to a much tougher compare from last year where we were up double digits.","And then when you look at our global applied HVAC equipment business, we've launched a lot of new products in that space, we're beginning to see the pickup with those new products. Now globally, we're roughly at mid single-digit growth. But I would tell you in North America, the success of the products and the expansion that we've had, is driving double-digit growth in North America. So I'm very pleased with the progress we're making in that space.","Andrew Kaplowitz","George. Just a quick follow-up on Power Solutions, if you look at the volume mix component in your margin markets slips, I think plus 30 last quarter to minus 80 this quarter, obviously slower growth this quarter, so little bit more under absorption. But how much of the change was warrants related disruption in the quarter. And does that impact go away in Q1 this year?","George Oliver","Yes. So that was part of our challenge that we had with a little bit of volume and then the margin pressure that we had. I would tell you that most of it was driven by the mix. So when you look at our Power Solutions business last year, the compare we had a record year of volume fourth quarter of 2017. In 2018, our OE volume was up 5%, and then our aftermarket volume was down 2%. So that was a significant impact to the margin rate, organically, we showed 2% overall, and that was driven by price and mix. But then when you look at the mix between OE and aftermarket is what drove that margin pressure. That in addition to all of the headwinds that we've had with our transportation and logistics was \u2013 couldn't that has been offset, we had strong productivity, but if Power offset is the productivity that we achieved during the quarter.","What I see going forward is more balanced mix, as we project the volumes here, as we get into 2019. We are seeing some decent volumes, given that this is our strong season, and I am encouraged based on the volumes, I see coming through, and that I think that will normalize the margin rate on a run rate basis, as we go through 2019.","Brian Stief","I would just add to that. I think the way to think about the impact of the hurricane and Power, it was probably, roughly a $0.01 in the quarter impact to us.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Appreciate it. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Steve Tusa from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Steve Tusa","Hey, good morning. How are you?","George Oliver","Good morning, Steve.","Steve Tusa","Just a question on the CapEx. How much this year will be battery CapEx? And then how much are out of the billion is battery next year?","Brian Stief","I would look \u2013 I think in terms of probably a third of the CapEx will be Power Solutions and two-thirds Buildings and corporate.","Steve Tusa","Okay. And that's going to be kind of consistent for next year or the Buildings CapEx stays flat and most of the reduction is kind of the sustainable reduction is in \u2013 is on the Power side? Most of the change?","Brian Stief","It's going to be pretty consistent Steve, between 2018 and 2019. So one-thirds, two-thirds.","Steve Tusa","Okay, got it.","George Oliver","Just a comment on that. When we look at CapEx, what we're going through is we're being very disciplined. I mean, we are investing, we are supporting the growth that we're achieving, and we're making sure that all of the capital expense that we incur is truly aligned to being able to achieve this accelerated growth. So I can assure you that from a payback standpoint, we're well positioned with these investments.","Steve Tusa","Yes, absolutely. I\u2019m just curious. So when you kind of look at the improvement in conversion. Is that coming \u2013 I\u2019m just trying to kind of discern, is that \u2013 part of that is from battery CapEx coming down obviously, as you guys are discipline on that business, correct? Is that kind of how we\u2019re looking at it?","Brian Stief","Yes, I mean, I think there\u2019s probably, when you think about Buildings CapEx versus Power CapEx, there\u2019s probably 10% to 15% difference in conversion between Power Solutions and the Buildings business. So\u2026","Steve Tusa","Okay.","Brian Stief","Yes.","Steve Tusa","Got it. And then just anything around quarterly sequencing when it comes to kind of seasonality of the year? Anything on cash or EPS that we should be aware of?","Brian Stief","No, I think historically, we\u2019ve been about 19%, 20% EPS in the first couple of quarters, probably just short of 30% in the third quarter and then low 30%s in the fourth quarter, based upon the plan that we put together, we don\u2019t see any major shifts from that Steve.","Steve Tusa","Great, that\u2019s super helpful. Thanks for the color.","George Oliver","Yes.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from Deane Dray from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Deane Dray","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","George Oliver","Good morning.","Antonella Franzen","Good morning.","Deane Dray","Just want to follow-up on Steve\u2019s questions on CapEx. And George you emphasize a point about staying disciplined on CapEx. There were some projects that got deferred. Just give us a sense of what were those projects? And are they being added into 2019 or are they canceled altogether?","Brian Stief","Yes, when we did the review, I mean there were certainly things that came out. But there was nothing that was deferred into 2019. I mean, we did it strictly as George mentioned on a return on invested capital basis, and if it didn\u2019t have the payback, it\u2019s something we\u2019re not going to move forward with. So I don\u2019t think you should view the reduction in CapEx in 2018 as something that closed into 2019. 2019 will be evaluated on a stand-alone basis between the businesses.","Deane Dray","Got it. And then on the salesforce investment, George it be interested in \u2013 since it has had such an impact across your businesses. Could you talk a bit about how the new sales folks have been deployed the businesses to geographies? And at what point do they become productive? You made a comment earlier about salesforce productivity and you measured the veteran versus the newer folks and what\u2019s baked into your assumptions into 2019?","George Oliver","Yes. So, right out of the gate, Deane, as I took over last fall, this was front and center and we immediately embarked on putting some type processes around sales and putting the discipline and getting the right targets and getting the right incentives, and most important is segmenting the market and how we serve the market. And so when you look at our salesforce, we\u2019ve got multiple segments, you have enterprise selling, you have HVAC equipment, you\u2019ve got fire security, you\u2019ve got long-term contracts, you\u2019ve got short-term service.","And so getting that right was very important. And so we did that across the board. And then we said, where is the market growth? How we\u2019re going to compete? Where do we need to add? What skill sets do we need? And so by doing that, we\u2019ve been adding through the course of the year, like I\u2019ve said, we netted 950, and then within that making sure that as they\u2019re ramping up within each one of their segments, that we have an expected level of production during that ramp up in every segment is a little bit different and how it works. But what I would tell you with the discipline, with the process, with the accountability, with the incentives, we\u2019ve been exceeding the ramp up in each one of the segments.","And so I have a lot of confidence here based on the output, we\u2019re still expecting here from an order standpoint to be high-single digit order growth again through the year as we\u2019re getting our salesforce up to speed. But I can assure you \u2013 and then through the process it also allows us to be able to address low performance, to make sure that, that we\u2019re getting high quality sales people coming in, we\u2019re giving them the right targets, they\u2019re ramping up appropriately and ultimately delivering on the expectations of the reinvestment we\u2019re making.","Deane Dray","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Gautam Khanna from Cowen. Your line is open.","Gautam Khanna","Yes. Thanks, good morning, everyone.","George Oliver","Good morning.","Antonella Franzen","Good morning.","Gautam Khanna","George, I was wondering if you could give us some context for the consideration of exiting Power Solutions. The math, when we look at it, looks like it could be dilutive if it were sold, assuming reasonable multiples. I\u2019m just curious, how you balance the potential for dilution versus the right portfolio long-term, how do you make those trade-offs?","George Oliver","Yes, so we\u2019re looking at all of that. So as you look at a business and the fundamentals of the business, the ability to be able to create value, short and long-term, we\u2019ve taken all of that into account. And as we\u2019re looking at not only continuing to run, I mean this is an incredible business with a market-leading position that is in an attractive vertical and it will be for some time and we\u2019re focused on how do we continue to deliver value with that. And then making sure as we look longer-term that we can position it to be able to create the most amount of shareholder value.","And it also factors in as we look at the portfolio and how the overall portfolio is performing, how do we continue to be positioned with optionality within Buildings, so that we can continue to strengthen our Buildings position because we do have an incredible platform there that I believe both with the combination of our strong product technologies and capabilities combined with our channel that we\u2019re positioned extremely well now to be able to capitalize in that space.","So we take all of that into consideration, we\u2019ve gone through thorough reviews as we\u2019ve gone through the process, we made a lot of progress, there\u2019s been a lot of learning in some cases, but it\u2019s making sure that we do what\u2019s right, not only for our investors, as well as for the employees that are part of that business.","Gautam Khanna","That\u2019s helpful. I appreciate it. And just a quick follow-up on, you mentioned the applied business in North America, it looks really strong. Where do you think we are in that cycle? I mean, how many years left do you think we have of kind of this mid-to-upper single-digit or perhaps double-digit growth? And maybe what\u2019s the underlying market growth you think and how long might we actually sustain that?","George Oliver","Yes. All of the indices that suggested this continued expansion, whether it be ABI or \u2013 there\u2019s other indices on starts and the like, we\u2019ve been very successful in being able to expand our footprint in capacity and at the same time also be able to get more attractive projects with the pricing that we\u2019ve been putting into place in the market.","So I\u2019m feeling, I\u2019m still pretty bullish at least over the next a year or two, that this is going to continue, based on what we\u2019ve seen with the activity, what we\u2019re quoting on, lot of the large projects that I\u2019ve been involved with, with some of the key customers that we support. And so it\u2019s hard to predict, I mean, I hear all the same reports that you hear and some of the concern that we\u2019re at the mid or end of the cycle. And based on what I see today, I see it continuing and because of that we\u2019re doing very well. I mean, we\u2019re with the expanded footprint in the sales capacity that we put into place, we\u2019re getting more than our fair share.","Gautam Khanna","Thank you, guys.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Steven Winoker from UBS. Your line is open.","David Silverman","Good morning. This is David Silverman on for Steve.","Antonella Franzen","Hey, David.","George Oliver","Good morning.","Brian Stief","Hey, David.","David Silverman","Good morning. So in the past, you\u2019ve talked about potentially speaking about divesting 5% to 10% of the Buildings portfolio, that you considered to be non-core. From a portfolio management standpoint, is that kind of still on the table, and if so, can you give us an idea of what you might be thinking of as non-core?","George Oliver","Yes. So we continued to review the Buildings portfolio, we have made a number of small divestitures that most don\u2019t hit the radar screen. These are very small businesses that are distractions and we\u2019ve continue to look at those. We\u2019ve also made some small bolt-on acquisitions mainly in our Building Management Systems space. Overall, one of the divestitures you might have seen where, we did a \u2013 we entered into a JV with Con Ed on our distributed energy storage business here late in Q4. So there\u2019s a lot of activity like that, that we\u2019re working to clean up the portfolio.","When you look at the overall 5% to 10%, I would say, we\u2019re still in that range. These are businesses that when you look at our core strategy of strengthening, our HVAC platforms. And then leading in Building Management Systems, these are businesses that might not fit either of those two categories that are good businesses are running well in timing wise would be, what\u2019s the way to be able to then potentially divest or reinvest that into core HVAC businesses and\/or Building Management System. So as we review the portfolio that would be \u2013 we\u2019re still in that ballpark 5% to 10% of the overall buildings portfolio.","Brian Stief","Yes. I would say as it relates to that. Just, I think the way to think about it is, these are smaller businesses that would be transacted over time, and it\u2019s probably a multi-year journey that we\u2019re talking about that gets to that 5% to 10%. And I think as we\u2019ve talked about in the past to the extent that there are non-core Tyco businesses that could be sold as you\u2019re aware, we can use the proceeds from the sale of those businesses to pay down the original Tyco TSarl debt of $4 billion, which as we sit here today is now down to like $1.4 billion after a couple of years. So, that would be another item that would be taken into consideration as we think about some of the portfolio moves.","David Silverman","Okay, understood. Thanks for all the color.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of John Walsh from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","John Walsh","Hi, good morning.","Brian Stief","Good morning.","Antonella Franzen","Good morning.","George Oliver","Good morning.","John Walsh","So also late in the \u2013 or I guess early in Q4, we saw the small Lux deal here around smart thermostats and home automation. But I was wondering, if you were to take a look at your deal pipeline, as it stands today, if there is any color around if it\u2019s more opportunity around, consolidating existing building systems you\u2019re already strong in or if there is some opportunity to move into places where you might not be as strong in terms of building systems, thinking about a slide you presented a couple of year back around lighting and electrical.","George Oliver","Yes. So what I would say is that, right now we\u2019re focused on \u2013 these acquisitions have been bolt-on mainly \u2013 bolt-on acquisitions, mainly driven by technology or capabilities that we felt as we\u2019re looking at our organic investments required to ultimately lead and\/or filling gaps inorganically. These are the size of businesses, so they\u2019re relatively small in the grand scheme. Now, my belief is as we go forward and develop more capacity here, we\u2019ll continue to look at opportunities to be able to take our platforms here and position them, so that we can continue to accelerate. So at this stage, our focus has been execution, driving strong organic growth with the investments we\u2019re making. And then if there are gaps, we\u2019ve been building a pipeline to fill some of the small gaps. So there\u2019s been nothing significant at this stage.","John Walsh","Okay. And then one from a higher level perspective here to Buildings. I think a lot of times these systems are \u2013 particularly around HVAC are being sold more around energy efficiency. And one of the trends we\u2019re starting to see is a movement more toward wellness, so kind of moving away from \"energy star rating\" to more of a wellness rating. Are you actually seeing this in your business today? Or is that not something that\u2019s on the radar screen?","George Oliver","Well, I mean I can\u2019t speak for our team. I mean, I wouldn\u2019t say that I\u2019ve been directly involved in that type of dialog. But I would tell you our teams are absolutely assessing the current trends, it\u2019s happening in HVAC and making sure that from a technology standpoint, we\u2019re leading those trends. And when I think about the work we\u2019re doing in our digital solutions, it\u2019s being able to take all of the data that\u2019s collected through these multiple systems, and then ultimately \u2013 not only optimize performance and reduce energy, but also now it\u2019s tied to improving comfort, an individualizing comfort and a lot of other outputs with the work that we\u2019re doing. So a lot of our work around digital solutions in the Controls piece of what we do in HVAC is a critical component to being able to achieve that outcome that I believe you\u2019re talking about.","John Walsh","Great, thank you.","Antonella Franzen","Operator, let\u2019s turn the call back over to George for some closing comments.","George Oliver","So, thanks again for all of you joining our call this morning. As you\u2019ve seen, we\u2019ve made a tremendous amount of progress in 2018, and we\u2019re fully committed to build upon that momentum in 2019. And look forward to engaging with many of you here over the next coming days and weeks. So, operator, that concludes our call.","Operator","Thank you, speakers.

Alex is actually joining us from Davos, Switzerland, where he is attending the World Economic Forum.","So it\u2019s -- there is a little bit late here there because of the resistance here, so we are in different places. But Alex will join us of course for the call here and he will give an overview of the quarter and then we will be followed by Bruce McDonald, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer for a look at each of the business segment and an overall financial view, followed then by your questions-and-answers ending somewhere near the top of the hour.","And with that, we\u2019ll head over to Switzerland let me turn it over to Alex.","Alex Molinaroli","Well, good morning, everyone. I am glad everyone could join. It\u2019s actually warmer here than in the Milwaukee. I -- first thing I want to do and I will come back to it at the end is acknowledge all the hard work, there has been also lot of accomplish in the short period of time.","We have been able to accomplish some things that some things that we can about here and some things that are strategic while from an operational perspective could be enable to keep our eye on the ball. So the team -- when I say the team, all of our colleagues around the world are working hard and very focused.","So let\u2019s talk about the environment a little bit, because I think it\u2019s important, if you go to slide three is where I am starting. We are benefiting from the North American volume increased.","We will talk about -- we will talk about Europe and what we are doing. But we are seeing in Europe at least right now some stability in the market. It shows a, you should see a 2% increase in volume in the industry production, but I think that the 2% is not as important as stability is for us right now and hopefully, we can maintain that for the rest of the year.","And then China, we had significant growth, we keep talking about and hear about 7%, 9% growth. What we saw was 14% growth in the quarter as relates to OE market. When you look at battery demand, we finally got the cold weather there we are looking for. We got it late November and throughout December, and so we were able to get, we have got some orders because of that, we will talk about that North America.","Unfortunately and as I can attest, believe it or not, Europe having the warmest winter that had in a hundred years, so we can win for losing. But, so what you are going to find is we are little soft in Europe but we are going to see -- we are seeing the demand grow in North America which is we\u2019d prefer to have it there anyway and we will actually see more benefit going forward because it's continues to be cold and hopefully, what we will see is our customers haven't restock more than once this winter.","And then we have seen a note about commercial HVAC demand improving. I think what I would say that, we're seeing an increase. I think a lot of it has to do with share. But we are gaining some share. We're seeing more activity. But mostly on the negotiated side, if you look at the architectural indexes, it would tell you that, we still a ways off before we see a strong commercial recovery. But we have, our pipelines are growing now and we are seeing more and more opportunities.","And then in China, I am really happy to say that, we have been had a franchise business both in A\/E and B\/E and Power Solutions is making lots of strides and had their best month ever in December. So we\u2019re seeing growth in China across all of our businesses.","If you go slide four and we just kind of recap the quarter. The way I would say this is, we did what we said we were going to do and I think that we did it in a way that was -- what -- it was a good quarter, strong operational performance.","I think that, we can find opportunities that we could do some things, we could do some things better and some things we are surprised, how well it went. But we are particularly happy with how well the automotive business did and I'm sure Bruce will cover that later.","But if you look at what we said in December, we did what we said we are going to do and that\u2019s really important to us. We are very focused on the near-term in making sure that we have a cost structure in place so that when the market comes back we can benefit from it.","And I\u2019d say that, if you look at our restructuring activities, all the things that we've done in order to get ourselves positioned well for the future are on tracking and when we saw the benefits of that.","And in particular you look what happen in our metals business, in our European business for automotive, significant changes and those guys are feeling good, this year they have done a great job.","If you look at our second quarter outlook, EPS $0.64 to $0.66, see that\u2019s up 45%. Now, Bruce, will go over, we have some counting changes. So Bruce will go over some of that to make sure you understand what that means with the accounting changes, we went from -- we went from LIFO to FIFO in our Power Solutions business. So it has a significant quarter-to-quarter impact with our numbers. Our segment income, a 15% is a fully -- is continuing to be our full year outlook and we're sticking with the range that we gave you in December, $3.15 to $3.30.","I do want to go through a couple things that that strategically important. We talked about our portfolio in December. We continue to talk about that. We\u2019ve talk about how we want to manage our capital in a different way at least our allocation of capital.","And we have made, we have been very consistent in our behaviors of the things that we are doing, consistent with what we told you we are going to do it and you continue to see that. We are happy that we are able to get our agreement with Visteon, sell the rest of the electronics business. We increased our dividend 16%.","We did finish our share repurchases for the year because of the accelerated plan that we had. We announced the joint venture with Hitachi. It\u2019s a very important -- it's very important to us because it\u2019s going to bring some products particularly mini-splits and VRF into our portfolio which are very important globally and become important to North America.","And we announced that we are looking at strategic options for our interiors business. We don\u2019t have anything to talk about at that point but there is something that\u2019s ongoing. And then the building efficiency business, I mean this is a real big win. We have a largest contract ever and largest performance contract ever with the State of Hawaii Department of Transportation. It\u2019s over $150 million and over time that contract will grow.","So big win for building efficiency and overall if you look at their numbers, month -- quarter-to-quarter we continue to see growth. We still don\u2019t have our backlog above last year. We did think we would at this point. But we\u2019re on track to continue to build that backlog.","So with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Bruce and he\u2019ll give you some more color on the segments.","Bruce McDonald","Okay. Thanks Alex. So just starting on page -- on Slide 6, I\u2019ll go to Power Solutions first. You can see overall our sales in Power Solutions were up about 6%. If we were to sort of adjust for foreign exchange mainly the euro in lead, our underlying sales would have been up about 3%.","In terms of unit production, and this is one of the reasons, we have a little bit of pressure in terms of our margins here. Overall shipments were up 3% and within that we saw OE volumes up 12% and aftermarket up 1%. So this -- we tend to be more profitable on the aftermarket side of our business and the fact that OE was up significantly and aftermarket was relatively constant here, did depress our margins little bit here in the quarter.","Geographically, you can see the information here, North America or the America is overall 3%, our Asian business up 22% really reflecting the share gains that we\u2019re making in the Chinese market and then the Europe market down. What you would sort of see within Europe was the OE side of our business, is up about 7% and the aftermarket part of our business was down about 5% to 6%. So again little bit of a negative mix shift in our European partner business.","As Alex indicated, just we\u2019d have sort of look at our shipments by months, we started the quarter little bit soft in North America although our aftermarket volumes picked up significantly in December. We did see double-digit increases in some of our PLS data from our customers and so our order backlog going into the second quarter, North America is very strong. However, that\u2019s not fully but it\u2019s largely offset by coming into the quarter with a pretty weak outlook in the aftermarket side in Europe due to the unseasonably warm weather.","Just commenting on AGM and with this why we have note when I talk about the regional number that includes the AGM in there but -- but it stripped our AGM overall with up about 26% to about 1.6 million to 1.7 million units in a quarter.","Look at the segment income here, come in at $308 million, up 12% from last year. Generally speaking, our results were favorably impacted by the higher unit shipments, which obviously helps our plant absorption. We\u2019re getting the benefits of in-house lead recycling versus last year, you recall we\u2019re flanking up our forest smelter and that\u2019s now fully online. And we saw -- we continue to see very strong operational performance from the Power Solutions plant.","Margins overall were up about 90 basis points. I would point out from the early within some of the early notes -- within Power Solutions in the quarter, we did have $19 million non-recurring gain in here associated with an increase in our equity position of an equity and joint venture in South America. We went from 40% ownership interest to 90% ownership interest. So that business became consolidated in the quarter and that resulted in a $19 million non-recurring gain.","Turning to Building Efficiency, you can see sales are little bit soft here, down 4%. If you were to back out the impacts and divestitures that we made last year, particularly in Europe and foreign exchange, our sales were down about 2% on a year-over-year basis. If you look at things geographically, little bit of mix back here in North America, the residential and light commercial business or UPG, it is sometimes called, they are up double-digit 11%.","Asia was up marginally about 1%. Our North America systems and services business overall were constant versus last year. Then where we saw the weakness on the other hand was in the Middle East where we\u2019re down 30% -- 31%, Europe which was down 17% and then if you were to look at our global workplace solutions business, we\u2019re down about 5% globally there.","We talked a little bit about our backlog and Alex did comment to limit the quarter of $5 billion and again adjusting for FX and divestitures down about 1% year-over-year. So we start to climb back but still down year-over-year.","On the positive side, we can see orders, we talk about being up 5% in the quarter and again kind of a mix by here in the Middle East, up 16%; North America was our biggest market, we\u2019re up 11%. Europe, even though our revenue is soft in Europe, we\u2019ll start to see up orders. So Europe was up 3%. Asia was down 3% and the biggest area of softness is Latin America, it is down 17%.","Segment income in BE at $146 million, was down 15% versus last year. We will need to adjust for couple of items. One is in the current quarter, we had about $20 million of non-recurring charges associated with curdling out some aged contracts and last year, if you would look within our GWS segment, you would have seen a $22 million benefit on a contract settlement in U.K. last year.","So if you would have sort of equalized our year-over-year earnings with the gain that we recorded last year and the charge that we recorded this year, what you\u2019d see is our underlying earnings were up about 6% on the revenue decline, so got about 50 or 60 basis points of margin expansion on an underlying basis.","In terms of Slide 8, our automotive experience, we clearly had an outstanding quarter here. We\u2019ve suffered through some long period here of difficult launch performances and some operational challenges, which you\u2019ve seen over the last sort of second half of 2013. It's pretty strong year-over-year earnings momentum and that really gathered pace here in the first quarter where you can see our earnings are up more than double versus last year.","Look at our revenues and we like to kind of look at revenues in light of production, but North America, we're up 11% versus the production being up about 5%. So 2X times the market. In Europe, we have 9% versus the industry at 2%. That really reflects the -- the European performance really reflects our backlog coming on stream. So we have a higher percentage of our business that\u2019s on newer platforms and if you look at our custom exposure, we tend to be underexposed to a couple of customers that are losing share.","So we have a healthy customer mix versus the market right now. That's benefiting our topline. In China, and Alex touched on this in his comments but it is great momentum in our business here are reflecting ongoing share gains. Our overall revenues, which is primarily a non-consolidated joint ventures in the quarter was $1.9 billion, which is up about 33% against the 14% increase in passenger car production in the quarter. So terrific quarter in China and we see that momentum carrying through here into the second quarter.","In terms of our segment income, it more than doubled to $232 millions, which is up 130%. It benefited clearly from higher volumes but the real story was the operational improvements that we saw in our metals business, our European business and I guess to a larger extent in South America.","Most of our restructuring initiatives were geared towards automotive and generally speaking, we are in line with our plans and tracking losses with the benefits that we expect here in 2014. In terms of our margins in auto, at 4%, we are up 210 basis points with our seating business, which is the biggest piece here of margins that looks like 1% and a 190 basis points higher than last year.","If you look at our geographic profitability, North America was about 5.7%, which is consistent with last year. Asia was up 150 basis points with 13.6% and Europe was nearly at a breakeven level and about a $97 million year-over-year improvement. So a terrific quarter for our automotive businesses really drove the bulk of favorable year-over-year performance level of the company.","Let\u2019s get into the slide 9 and go through with some of the financial highlights. Maybe I will just expand a bit on Alex comment in terms of the impact of changing from a LIFO to FIFO in Power Solutions. So for the year and for the first quarter and the fourth quarter, the impact is negligible less than a $0.01 a share. But it does change our second and third quarter previously reported numbers.","So for the second quarter of 2013, last year ex-items, we reported earnings of $0.42. When we would make the LIFO to FIFO adjustment that becomes $0.45. So the number when we report our second quarter earnings here that we are comparing to, it is $0.45 ex-items not $0.42. And conversely in the third quarter, last year we reported earnings per share of $0.78 with LIFO change reduces back to $0.74. I know that\u2019s out by about $0.01 but it\u2019s all of the rounding and the full year impact is zero.","So when we talk about our second and third quarter numbers on a go-forward basis, we are going to talk to those two adjustments. Turning to the first quarter, you can see our revenues that overall were up about 5%. If you take out the impact of the euro, which was positive and the yen which was negative for us then our underling growth was 4% excluding currency effects.","We were pleased to see our gross profit improved by 70 basis points to 15.2%. We saw higher margins in all three of our businesses and that reflects the benefit of higher volumes and the cost reduction and initiatives associated with some of the manufacturing operations.","In terms of SG&A, as a percentage of sales declined by 20 basis points to 9.9% from 10.1% last year. We continue to invest in some of our key growth initiatives and infrastructure in Asia, some IT systems implementation and R&D and advanced battery investment in particular. But despite that we were able to offset some of those increases with restructuring benefits.","Our equity income line was up 33% to $113 million. What you will see in there basically is the $19 million non-recurring gain that we talked about earlier in Power Solutions and stronger profitability from the increased revenues in our automotive businesses in China. When I look at on our segment income here at 6.3%, very pleased to see a 100 basis point improvement in our underlying margins on a year-over-year basis.","On slide 10, I will just comment on few line items here. In financing, we came in at $55 million, down about $6 million versus last year. And generally speaking, borrowing costs are around the same as last year, the benefits really flowing as a result of the just lower averaged debt levels in the quarter.","Income tax rate of 20%, consistent with last year in our guidance. Income attributable to non-controlling interests up about $6 million versus last year, that\u2019s really just due to the higher level of profitability in some of our consolidated automotive joint ventures. And then lastly, if you look at our diluted earnings per share, it came in at $0.69 versus $0.52 last year, so up about 33%.","We did get the benefit of our share buyback here, although the fact that it got completed kind of late in the quarter, our averaged share count was a little bit higher than the $670 million that we guided to in our Analyst Call here in the first quarter, but $670 million is probably good number for [Qs 2 to 4]. But we had about one set headwind associated with slightly higher share count here in the first quarter.","Before I open it up for questions, I will just borrow a summary here. We were very pleased with the solid start to the year here. We had a couple of little bit near within our numbers with the one-time gain in Power Solution and that charges. And we have some contracts in BE but it was largely not out. So, I think -- if you look at the underlying $0.69, it\u2019s a strong number.","Looking at some of the momentum that we have, the way our businesses are performing and the traction that we are making on our restructuring programs, we feel pretty confident about our second quarter outlook here. And at the midpoint of our guidance here, we are talking about Q2 earnings growth of about 45%. I don\u2019t think we have anything to be apologizing. For us, it\u2019s a pretty strong number. I don\u2019t think we are going to see a lot of companies out here with 35% earnings growth here in the first calendar quarter of 2014.","After the first quarter in terms of our dividend, our buyback, in terms of divestiture activity, the Hitachi announcement and some of the work that we are starting to do with Interiors. And in terms of the full year, generally playing not as we expected, we are maintaining our guidance at $3.15 to $3.30. We commented about free cash flow for the year at being $1.6 billion and we think we are on track for that, even though we kept seeing our very large outflow here in the first quarter associated with some seasonal working capital factors and our buyback.","We are going to work on getting our cash flow back to the number that we talked about here and we feel good about our margin expansion opportunities. So generally speaking, a very good start to the year and with that we will open it up for questions.","Alex Molinaroli","Yeah, Toni, we are ready to take questions as soon as we can.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And our first question came from the line of Mr. [Ryan Rickman]. Sir, your line now is open.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi. Thank you. Could you talk about what is allowing you to make the market share gains in China that you aren\u2019t ceding with non-consolidated revenues up 33% in the industry, maybe 18% or so? Is that because of just -- which auto markers you lever to that they are gaining share or are you gaining share within those automakers and kind of continue?","Alex Molinaroli","I will start that and Bruce, if you can add some more commentary to that. First off, I just think we are partnered with the right people and our partnerships with the local Chinese OEs and their partnerships happen to be with the right mix of customers, very similar to what you see in Europe. So we\u2019re outperforming the market because we happen to have the right partners with the right products.","And not to mention that they are gaining share themselves, meaning our venture partners. So it\u2019s a little bit of both, we\u2019re unfortunate to have the customer mix and we are gaining shares.","Bruce McDonald","Yeah. And I would, Brain, I\u2019ll maybe just add a couple of things. One is, we are seeing the benefit of our metals investment in China. So if you recall when we made the KEIPER and Hammerstein acquisitions, we -- one of the things we talked was the fact that we are significantly underrepresented metals in China and that business is now up and running and demonstrating strong growth.","And the other sort of tailwind that we have is a lot of the Chinese own brand companies are putting more money to work in their interiors in an effort to compete with some of the European and North American brands.","And so there, what we are seeing a little bit of the shift away from Chinese, independent Chinese-based suppliers in our ceiling business and to some extent interiors and that\u2019s shifting to western suppliers, so they can compete on into quality and power lift with the Western European and North America. So there is just kind of two factors in addition to what our factor that our customs are gaining share that I would point too.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. Great. Thanks. Maybe update on the performance of GWS, how that division did in 1Q relative to our expectations and relative to what you would need to see to either want to dispose off or retain that division?","Alex Molinaroli","(Inaudible)","Bruce McDonald","The question was about GWS performance for the first quarter relative to our expectation I think, right?","Unidentified Analyst","Yeah. And relative to what you would want to see to support your decision to either keep the division or dispose it, perhaps?","Alex Molinaroli","Yeah. So, as you\u2019ll recall the GWS is going through a transformation around its delivery mechanism. And I think that, unfortunately because we had year-on-year one-time issue, it doesn't really demonstrate the kind of progress they\u2019re making. They are making good progress against their objectives. I don't know it\u2019s going to -- it\u2019s not going to get easier for us, they\u2019ve done of a lot change in a very short period of time.","Our customers are not only acknowledging the changes but they\u2019re helping us make these changes because it benefits both us and them. So at this point, I would say that they\u2019re pretty much on track. But it\u2019s early, we\u2019ve only been in this for three or four months, so it's early, but I would say so far so good.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. Great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question came from the line of Mr. Ravi Shanker. Sir, your line now is open.","Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley","Thanks. Good morning, everyone.","Alex Molinaroli","Hi, Ravi.","Bruce McDonald","Hi, Ravi.","Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley ","Just the question on the Power Solutions business, I think, it\u2019s an interesting trend that you are seeing the strength in North America with the weather being so severe, but it\u2019s weakest in Europe. Anything in particularly we had to keep in mind from either capacity utilization or slices of business or mix that\u2019s going to cause that to be a net headwind or tailwind when you will have this?","Alex Molinaroli","I\u2019ll start, Bruce, then you can give more information. I -- in generally, just from my knowledge of that business. Our volumes overall are higher in North America, particularly in the aftermarket. So if we had to get cold weather in one region and warm weather in another region, it would be exactly how it\u2019s happening here.","So I think that the Europeans will have to make sure that they flex which is little tough in Europe, but in North America we\u2019re going to see continue significant gains. So if I had to pick the weather pattern, I couldn\u2019t get cold everywhere, I pick it the way it with. It\u2019s more the tailwind than headwind I think.","Bruce McDonald","Yeah.","Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley ","Understood. And also on the smelter capacity, is there any more tailwind or dry powder you have there on margins in term of just squeezing more capacity utilization out of these smelters?","Alex Molinaroli","You are speaking anymore upside on the margins, is that you said?","Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley ","Yeah. Just from that, yeah.","Alex Molinaroli","Yeah. I think, well, we can't speak to -- I can\u2019t give you that answer completely. I'm sure there's going to be incremental improvements. We are still -- we\u2019re not starting up anymore but we are still, when you think about these plans. There\u2019s still lots of efficiency to be gain. But nothing like this coming online new.","I think one of the opportunities that we found is that, now that their extra capacities in the marketplace. We\u2019re seeing the secondary totalers come to us looking for longer term contracts and in a much different way than they did five years ago. So there might be some benefits that we see that are outside of their own totaling just from and what we purchase.","Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley ","Got it. And just lastly, one housekeeping question for Bruce. Just want to confirm that your 2Q and your full year guidance include the electronics business and it gives us 670 share account?","Bruce McDonald","Yeah. Yeah. You are right. It does.","Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley ","Thank you.","Alex Molinaroli","Thanks Ravi.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question came from the line of Mr. Rod Lache. Sir, your line now is open.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank","Good morning, everybody.","Alex Molinaroli","Hi, Rod.","Bruce McDonald","Hi, Rod.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank","Just a couple, it would be real helpful if you can help us understand some of the puts and takes in the Power Solutions margins year-over-year. You had a $13 million increase in earning extra gain? It -- I think the middle of last year, you implemented that 3% to 4% price increase in the U.S. which is maybe 45% of Power Solutions and applied to the aftermarket, which is the majority?","I would have thought that that alone would have maybe been more than that $13 million gain, maybe closer to $20 million and you also are talking about the benefits of I think previously you said 50 basis points per year from smelters and obviously some width from AGM batteries, which were up really strong. So just can you help us spread out a little bit on what we\u2019re seeing on the year-over-year basis?","Alex Molinaroli","Yeah.","Bruce McDonald","We\u2019ve could given the numbers so you are propping on net again.","Alex Molinaroli","Yeah. Yeah. I\u2019ll take that, Rod. I think, let me comment, in the kind of early notes there is a lot of, I feel a lot of questions about power and margins. And maybe let me just kind of give little bit extra step back. We -- if you look at our guidance that we gave for this year, we talked about Power Solutions margins being up 50 basis points for the year, roughly speaking.","If you look at where we are here in the first quarter and Rod, if you take out the non-recurring gain then what you would see is margins are roughly comparable to where they were in the first quarter of last year. So we\u2019ve got little bit of the headwind to get to our full year number here.","Now a couple things I would just point out in the first quarter. One, we -- that I talked about in my comments was we did see mix being a relative negative here in Q1 with OE being up substantially, aftermarket being largely flat. We don\u2019t see that continuing for the balance of the year and so that\u2019s as we sort of get flex back to normal mix here that will be headwind for us.","We also do have higher -- offsetting some of the price increase or some of the investments that we\u2019re making out of business. So the price increases that we implemented which were generally positive.","We put in place to offset higher lead totaling cost. Some of the increase costs that we have to incur to be compliant with some of the new emission standards. And look at our own business, we -- in the first quarter, we have some charges associated with implementing new IT system. And we continue ramp up our investment on a year-over-year basis in battery -- in advanced batteries.","I would also point out that generally speaking, if you look at our incentive compensation cost that we started off last year in whole. And on the year-over-year basis, incentive compensation in battery is little bit higher. And then lastly, we talked about the South American joint venture that we consolidated. So last year in Q1, every quarter we had equity income. This year that\u2019s been necessarily consolidated.","So you can think about our ownership right from 40% of that business to 90%. So last year, we had 40% of the profit and zero of the sales. This year, we have a 100% of the sales coming in than the corresponding profit. That business is a little bit dilutive to our margins but if you also factor in, the fact that\u2019s what we are essentially doing is picking up 100% of sales and only 60% of profit, it\u2019s a little bit of a headwind. Now that was in our guidance but I think those are the main issues I would say in terms of Q1. But our full year outlook at 50 basis point increase is stuff that we are still comfortable.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank","Okay. So just to clarify, if we think about it in terms of dollar changes of your basis rather than margins, which obviously can get thrown off by the OE versus after mark. You are saying, basically at this point at least, the volume increases the pricing adjustments and that big increase in AGM was offset by investments and comp generally, is that right?","Alex Molinaroli","","More or less, more or less.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank","Okay. And are there some significant adjustments, as we look out in Q2 and Q3 when we think about the year-over-year comparison for this accounting change?","Alex Molinaroli","","Well, what you are going to see as a result of that accounting change is a quarter similar to this one in the Q2. So you will see -- now when you make this accounting change, but it also -- what it does for us is because the length of a FIFO is out of the equation. Now, we can, I would say more efficiently run our factories and kind of more level load them because enough to worry about the volatility associated with buying and lead raw materials and things like that.","So we can be more efficient in Romania at our plants operations. But what we are seeing here us Q2 and Power Solutions will be comparable to last year. We\u2019ll see a big benefit on the other end of the spectrum and see a much, much bigger improvement in Q3. And the seasonality that will show this year would be kind of the mid norm, so nothing exciting in terms of margins in power in Q2. You will see the benefit really in Q3 and Q4.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank","All right. And just lastly, seating revenue was up 10% than first quarter and your guidance for the year was up 1% to 2%. Are there some big program roll offs in the second half, or are the numbers in fact coming in better than you were expecting?","Alex Molinaroli","The number are coming in -- I didn\u2019t comment on our revenue. But I would tell you if you look at the first quarter here, probably 2% or 3% better like in aggregate than we saw with the bulk of that coming through in the auto space. So, I think if I was updating our revenue guidance, I would probably up auto and probably take a little bit off of BE at this point and for the company, we had a little bit of a tailwind here.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank","Great. Thank you.","Alex Molinaroli","Appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question came from the line of Mr. Brian Johnson. Sir, your line now is open.","Brian Johnson - Barclays","Yes. Good morning. Couple of questions.","Alex Molinaroli","Hello, Brian.","Brian Johnson - Barclays","First, could you just maybe, Alex, walk us through the kind of sales new battery shipments cycles U.S. aftermarket, just so we get a feel when this battery replacement line, that actually is close to shipment. And the second is I just want to follow-up on the seating equity income and kind of various puts and takes there.","Alex Molinaroli","Okay. So, I will let Bruce handle second one. So in the battery business, especially in North America, we have liner side all way to the point of sale to our retail customers. So we are able to see what their point of sale is and then obviously what their order pattern is going to be got. As a rule of thumb, if we don\u2019t get a cold blast in December, if we don\u2019t get a good cold in December then we are probably going to get one restocking if that.","If we get the kind of colds that we got here, we could get -- I never get a full turn but we are going to get the benefit of them of the retailers in particular having to stock more than once. So that\u2019s probably what\u2019s going to happen. We\u2019re going to see with little pushing out things like the lawn garden shipments, that will probably get pushed out little bit because the demand is going to push out much more than it was in the past, so we are going to have to restock at the end of the season.","So, I would say that that\u2019s the rule of thumb and I can\u2019t give you the numbers, but I could tell you that it\u2019s more of a normal pattern, at least normal prior to the last couple of years. Sales from some of those customers were up 15% to 20% and we are shipping some of those batteries today.","Brian Johnson - Barclays","And does the primary replenishment come for this kind of late January cold or January cold, would it come in your 2Q or in your 3Q?","Alex Molinaroli","It will come in Q2.","Brian Johnson - Barclays","Okay. And then on the equity income, when you back out the special gain, it looks like your equity income was $96 million, yet your commentary was very positive on China, which is primarily avoid income. Can you kind of educate us on the other puts and takes in the equity income line, or is it the case that China is going well but the equity income isn't quite keeping up? ","Alex Molinaroli","The equity -- there\u2019s a lot of investment there. What I would tell you, if you sort of look at AEs equity, let\u2019s just talk about our seating business first. What you would see is our equity income there is up about 25%, so a little bit diluted there. We do have -- and you would say it kind of wires that. I mean, there\u2019s a couple of larger joint ventures where we\u2019ve got significant startup costs. As you know, there\u2019s a lot of new production coming on with Volkswagen and Audi and Ford and others in the western part of the country, so building new facilities there.","So that\u2019s a little bit of a dilution for us. Interiors, our equity income was down couple million and more really just reflecting on customer mix. The other adverse thing I would point out is we did have equity income associated with this Power Solutions joint venture that went away. So when I said, we have $90 million gain. Last year, we had $2 million or $3 million of equity income. So, I guess the net year-over-year was about $16 million versus $19 million. So it\u2019s really just investments that we are keeping that aren\u2019t quite keeping up with that topline growth point grow, but I think we are pleased with where we stand, are we doing on some startup, some new startup JVs in there too as well.","Brian Johnson - Barclays","","Okay. It would be helpful if we could just get China equity income and seating broken out at some point.","Alex Molinaroli","Okay. Okay. We can follow-up with you on that, Brian.","Brian Johnson - Barclays","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question came from the line of Mr. Patrick Archambault. Your line now is open sir.","Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs","Yes. Thanks. Good morning.","Alex Molinaroli","Good morning.","Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs","A couple of follow-ups from my end. Just kind of taking I think where Rod was going with his question, kind of more in aggregate for the whole company. If you look at what was done in fiscal Q1 and what's implied by the guidance for Q2, it does imply fairly backend loaded increase in margins in subsequent quarters. And I know some of that is seasonality. You did highlight kind of a mix benefit and some operational comps on the battery side. But maybe you can just help us understand how we kind of get up that backend loaded margin curve a little better?","Bruce McDonald","Well, I think, I'm not sure. I agree with you, but maybe -- let me try my best here. If you look at the guidance that we've given for this year, so we said 315 to 330, which played against about I think we end up last year 260 or something like that. So if you think about up sort of euro and you look at kind of Q1 were up 33% so we\u2019re front-end loaded on that one in Q2, up 45%.","So the back -- the earning -- the year-over-year earnings growth that we have in the second half is lower than the first half. So I would say that the -- our earnings growth is front-end loaded not backend loaded. Having said that, if you look at our seasonality of the company, really because of Building Efficiency what you tend to see it, who earns about 65% to 70% of profit in the last couple of quarters, that's really what drives the year-over-year improvement.","But maybe only other thing I could -- I would point to is if just look at Q1 and you said we'll take out the impact in December shutdown or let\u2019s say the December shutdown in Auto, that's probably worth $0.05 a share in the current quarter. So I think I feel pretty good about our phasing here and maybe I'm just missing your question, Patrick.","Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs","Yeah, it was more reflective of margins rather than just absolute EPS level.","Alex Molinaroli","Okay. Okay.","Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs","And if you just go through the segment, it does imply, I think pretty much across. Unless, I'm missing something I think it does imply the margin increase sequentially. I think you just sort of explain the seasonality of Building Efficiency.","Alex Molinaroli","Yes.","Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs","And then, I guess automotive to your point I guess is sort of has the shutdown. And then I suppose maybe it\u2019s -- those are two items, right. The mix, the benefit in batteries and in some of the operation cost that you explain maybe that's the rest of it I suppose?","Bruce McDonald","Yeah. And I guess maybe I don\u2019t think when the one point out would be that we're going to ask only thing, benefit from the restructuring activity.","Alex Molinaroli","Yeah. I would say that's probably, if you look at the pattern, the pattern is the same. If we make we make in first quarter guidance and we make the numbers that the guidance that we\u2019ve given you for the second quarter. Is that itself for the right pattern if you look at our historical patterns. One difference this year that will give us more margin is our cost basis is dropping because of the restructuring.","Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs","Got it, okay. That's helpful. And then kind of another follow-up, I mean I know this was addressed at your Analyst Day, but kind of the general. I just have to think the flat top line guidance right for sort of the longer term that you guys provided for the seating. It seems conservative right especially given what you're seeing now. I mean you've got kind of cyclical recovery in Europe that\u2019s starting China has strong momentum. It sounds like your customer exposure is favorable and then there is maybe the backlog is the key question. So maybe we could just revisit that a little bit just given the strength of that business unit this quarter?","Alex Molinaroli","Yeah. Let me start and Bruce can give in the backlog information. I think one another things that you have to recall and go back and look into your notes is what assumptions that we put in for the automotive business and what assumptions for Europe and North America. We probably didn't talk because it\u2019s not top line so much about the China assumption or at least it's not a part of the top line conversation.","I think what we saw in the first quarter, you could tell about our comments we were surprise as how strong it was everywhere. I personally don't believe that Europe is going to continue at that kind of strength. I think it's going to bump along, but I don't -- we're not predicting that it's going to continue to grow. We hope it does.","But I think what you -- if you say conservative -- being conservative, I hope we were, but it was based on the assumptions that we gave you. And I would say that our ongoing backlog is going to become flatter, because we are going to not -- we are not going to invest the same -- at the same level we did in past. So you should see our margin improve which you actually see the kind of the growth that we saw in the past, because we're not going to make those investments. That's going forward. Bruce, I\u2019m going to get something to add to that.","Bruce McDonald","Yeah. I think whether than -- or if I just look at our -- look at the guidance that we gave for 2014 in particular. We said North America we have 6% for the year, about 5%. We said -- we saw Europe will grow 2% for the year, it\u2019s up 2. China we said -- we saw it will be up 11 and that was up 14. So generally speaking I think we\u2019re generally above, clearly getting some -- we are getting some lift from our customer mix about those better than expected Patrick.","And we are continuing to see clinically in Europe not that luxury car segment doing better than we thought. And so I just -- that would be hard for us to say I don't see, I think those things may not continue. So like I said to one of the early question, we probably have some revenue upside in Auto when I look at things in aggregate here. On the other hand, I would say BE revenue is probably little bit weaker than we thought. But in aggregate, we probably got some revenue upside here in the balance of the year. That -- I'm not back away from that.","Glen Ponczak","Brett, it\u2019s Glen here. I think you're looking at through 2018 number being sort of flattish top line, remember most of our growth of the China and those sales are not consolidated.","Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs","Right.","","Bruce McDonald","So, it's really more a comment on, to Alex\u2019s point earlier, about the level of investment in North America and Europe, I think, what they\u2019ve been used to be. Then the growth in China being pretty good but you're not going to see it consolidated sales line.","Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs","Okay. Thanks a lot guys. That's really helpful.","Alex Molinaroli","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question came from the line of Mr. Italy Michaeli. Your line is now open.","Italy Michaeli - Citigroup","Good morning.","Alex Molinaroli","Good morning.","Italy Michaeli - Citigroup","Just wanted to drill down on cash flow little bit. Bruce, you talked about the working capital headwind. Looks like most of it or all of it really came from accounts payable and accrued liability. Hoping you could drill down a bit more into the detail there. Then typically historically you've always also been cash flow negative in Q2 of the year without -- should we expect the same this year or perhaps given the extent of the burn in Q1 -- Q2 actually turn positive for you?","Bruce McDonald","Yeah. Maybe I just give a little bit of some comments on the working capital. So you're right. We typically do have an outflow in Q1. Although, this was higher than in the previous year and a little bit of a disappointment actually coming out of the blocks here. So just look at where we finish the quarter, we had an outflow about $945 million, that\u2019s about 700 million higher than last year.","And I want to tell you, really look at the main items in there and kind of point to four things. One is timing of tax payments. So we probably worth about $300 million, a lot of tax planning and payments and sort of things delayed refunds on VAT and things like that, I see that all coming back, $300 million.","And we do have, our fair share of some customers with December 31st year end, where I would say our, we did not get a payment in on by December 31st. We got in the first week of December. I would say in aggregate and that typically happens to us but in aggregate that\u2019s probably about $100 million higher than the last year.","Inventory for us here in Q1 was we kind of made a decision because of the clear weather that we are seeing in power to -- you saw continued over, I would say, overproduced, so even though we really good shipments out, we have $100 million more inventory than we have in the past in Power Solutions.","And then, 2013, if you look at just the payments that we had associate with sales incentives and balances and things like that about $150 million higher outflow in Q1 than the prior year and again that will be, that\u2019s all timely.","So when I kind of go through all those items largely and this is pretty good about it being time and regulator, our full year guidance when we talk about being about $1.6 billion of free cash flow, we were forecasting a full year outflows of $200 million to $300 million. So my expectation here is in the second quarter some of these timing things will start to unwind and I think what you will see better cash performance in the second quarter than we had in the past.","Italy Michaeli - Citigroup","Perfect. Thanks so much for that detail, Bruce. That\u2019s all I have. Thanks.","Alex Molinaroli","Thanks.","Bruce McDonald","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question came from the line of Mr. [Brett Coperson]. Your line now is open.","Unidentified Analyst","Thank you. Good afternoon, Alex. Good morning, Bruce and Glen.","Bruce McDonald","Good morning, Brett.","Alex Molinaroli","Hi.","Unidentified Analyst","I wanted to start off the automotive business and Bruce, I was hoping you could just give us a sense of the margins by geography, maybe on a year-over-year basis, I know in slide eight you kind of gave us a flavor for it. I was hoping and in the past, you've kind of talked a little bit about your margins were in Europe last year versus this year and so on and so forth? And obviously, it would be great if you could maybe adjust for some of the divestitures that you've made?","Bruce McDonald","Yeah. Well, it would be, if I was, but if you just look back the old segment, here is what the answer would be. So North America last year 5.7, this year 5.7 flat, that\u2019s where you will see the impact of HomeLink heading us, only and it has a little bit of impact in the Europe, but generally speaking most of the dilutive impact of the HomeLink sale would have depressed North American margins and if I was sort of running that off to top of my head, I would say that\u2019s probably 80 to 100 basis points.","And Europe last year, I don\u2019t have the margin on this I know last year we lost $105 million. In Q1, this year our lost is, which mainly associated with the shutdown. So in Europe overall we lost $8 million, so that we touch about $97 million improvement. And in Asia, we are at 12.1% last year, 150 basis points to 13.6% this year.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay.","Alex Molinaroli","That\u2019s kind of an old segment, new segment basis.","Unidentified Analyst","And then as you kind of think about that margin progression through the remainder of the year, I mean your automotive is around 4%, your guidance is like around 4% to 4.2%, it kind of changes adjusted to margins, it\u2019s going to be roughly pass through the remainder of the year?","Bruce McDonald","While we talked about the guidance that we gave at the beginning of the year for Auto in aggregate was 70 to 90 basis point improvement with seating being up somewhere between 100 and 120. We\u2019ve been -- in terms of -- let's forget about electronics because that\u2019s where the HomeLink in and out, it is kind of really confusion. But let\u2019s say, if you looked at our interiors business, we talked about that business going from a minus 0.3 last year to a range of 1% to 1.2%.","Interiors had a great quarter. That\u2019s the probably the business that\u2019s furthest along in terms of the restructuring because we sort of started at earliest. And so we probably had some upside in terms of our interior\u2019s profit. But I think where we see seating come in that quarter 4.8% to 5%, number was -- I think we feel pretty good about that. If you would have probably take our Q1 number, just trying to think what I talked of both seating here. With 4.1 in the fourth quarter, we still had some -- obviously some loan figure on our medals improvement, I mean we are in the big year. We have improved. We got a lot of opportunity of, say, in the future quarters here.","Unidentified Analyst","And then switching gears to Power, over the past year or two, we have been talking about little bit weaker aftermarket demand, the winter cold snap here potentially driving little bit higher demand but if you kind of reflect back on the potential impact of maybe strengthening demand in the aftermarket battery business and Power Solutions business, how do we think about that from a revenue standpoint, in other words, is -- does normalized demand drive $10 million of incremental revenue in that segment or is it more like $100 million of incremental revenue, I mean, what kind of order of magnitude would you characterize that as?","Alex Molinaroli","Hello. This is Alex. I\u2019d be afraid to give you that number because some time we can take a look at and give you -- I just don\u2019t. I -- most of you know on top of the head, Bruce and I was pretty close to it. I just -- I don\u2019t have that number.","Bruce McDonald","No. I don\u2019t have that one.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. And then finally just on the share repurchase standpoint, $3.6 billion over three years, you did $1.2 billion in the first quarter. How do we think about the pace of share repurchase going forward?","Alex Molinaroli","We are going to only do a $1.2 billion this year. So we decided and I think I may have talked about this when we had our November call. But we really think we decided it because it was quite a departure in terms of our past that we would front-end load. I would suggest that we should not do it sort of equally through the year but get out and have it back stronger here and do it all in Q1.","We have not decided yet or even talked about as we get into the F\u201915, \u201916. We can always combine on Q1. We are going to spread it out. We don\u2019t have any answer for that yet. But I think the main thing is we are -- we did want to maintain some flexibility to look at M&A at some point in time here. For now, the $1.2 billion that we\u2019ve done here in Q1 is all that we are planning on doing for this year.","Unidentified Analyst","Thanks very much. Perfect.","Bruce McDonald","Thanks, Brett, I think we are out of time. Operator, I will be around for the balance of the day, certainly meeting tomorrow to answer any questions I didn\u2019t get answer out. So any final signoff from Davos?","Alex Molinaroli","Yeah. Just going to give you a couple -- I'm incredibly proud. As I said early on about what our teams accomplished. And we talk an awful lot here about what\u2019s going to happen next quarter, some of the bridges from the first quarter and how conservative we are for the full year. I hope as we continue to go -- continue to ask questions about how we are changing the company, changing the portfolio of the company, profile of the company and how we are going to run the company. And I hope we continue to have that conversation because we made substantial progress in a very short period of time of getting some momentum and getting our team aligned.","So, I just want to thank all of our employees. They are working extremely hard between restructuring to operational improvements and some of the changes that we are trying to make as far as how we operate and run the company. It\u2019s a lot of change, very fast and they are responding well. So thanks to the employees and I appreciate all the good questions.","Operator","Thank you. That concludes today's conference call.

I think we said that if we don't like the questions we probably won't be able to hear very well, maybe that is what we are doing. So let's talk about the first quarter. I'm incredibly pleased with what we were able to accomplish. Hopefully as you go through this you can see we are gaining some momentum. I look forward to talking about our Hitachi deal and hearing your questions.","As you saw in the release, we did have revenue increase of 1% and if you look at our business across the globe, currency translation particularly in Europe cost us 4% growth so we would have had 5% growth without the translation. Segment income of $768 million that\u2019s 18% over last year and if you look at all of our businesses, the margins are improving and all of that for the most part is being driven by initiatives that we had in place and the work that being done with our Johnson Controls Operating System.","Our $0.79 is a little better than what we expected when we were giving out our guidance for the first quarter in December and that really has to do with everyone meeting and exceeding their targets. The thing that I'm probably most proud is that we are seeing a continual increase in our margins, we have 110 basis point increase from this quarter to last quarter and we continue to see that as something that we can expect on an ongoing basis.","If you go to the second page, we talk about the environment we are in and it seems to be changing. I mean North America is stronger than we expected and it will be interesting to see what happens with fuel costs down what it is going to do to mix. We will talk about that later. In Europe, down 2% and I think that is pretty much what we expected, it is in the range of where we expected and then China up 6%, you will see our orders and our revenues exceed that and it has a lot to do with how we participate in the China market and our gains in share.","Our aftermarket battery demand, it's really back to normal not a new normal. Last year we had some real issues with volumes and this year we are really seeing things come back to what I would consider normal. Inventories are stable. We had a real cold spell for a while and at this point it's hard to predict what is going to happen in the next few weeks, but so far our volumes are up. You see up 4% in Q1 and one thing that is not in here, I don't think it is in the release, I'm not sure, but our AGM sales are up over 30%. And so that speaks to the North American adoption rate. One of the recent vehicles that was launched was the F150.","And then a lot of questions around our demand in our commercial HVAC, as you saw, it didn't show up in our backlog yet and we did in anticipate that it would but what we do see is our pipeline getting more full particularly in some of our institutional customers that we hadn't seen in the past. I highlight K-12 as being the largest increase.","And then I skipped over the commodity cost. So at this point what we forecast for the year at our current commodity cost, we are seeing a benefit that\u2019s being offset by the translation loss that we are having, particularly driven by the euro. So we have a near-term headwind that has to do with how quickly we\u2019re receiving some of the translations versus our commodity cost, but by the end of the year we think that it is going to not be material. We will keep updating you on that but at this point that is the way that we are going to talk about it is commodity cost offsetting the euro.","If you go to our first quarter highlights on page 5, we got a good bit accomplished. The first thing we will talk about is Hitachi and you know that has been something we have been working on quite some time. We are very happy the fact that we actually signed that yesterday here in Davos and we are going to be releasing a lot of the new products and talk about them at the ASHRAE Show, the heating and air-conditioning show that\u2019s in Chicago next week.","Last quarter we talked about, we increased our dividend 18%, up 18% and that should keep us moving in-line with the multi-industrial dividends. So in all the things that you are seeing us do, talk about the buyback, we are 1\/3rd of the way through our buyback, all of these things are showing our commitment to our capital allocation and capital structure consistent with where we are trying to take the company.","A couple of other people announcements happened over the last few weeks. One that is notable is Jeff Williams, I'm not sure if many of you know Jeff Williams or not. He is one of our best operations people in the company. He has grown up in the automotive business. He currently runs our - he had run our seating business in automotive and prior to that he has had many commercial and operational jobs but he is one of the steering committee members of our manufacturing counsel and he has agreed to take a job so we can take our operating system to the next level. He will be working for me at corporate and we will be taking the net steps towards our operation systems implementation around manufacturing, purchasing and engineering.","If you look to the right of the slide it's something that I don't want to get lost. You can see the product portfolio is starting to fill out and you can look and see some of the brands that you will start to know us by. Within ADT, there is multiple brands but you can see our York brand and our Hitachi brand. We are not going to talk about branding so much today but over time we will talk about how we are going to position those brands and in particular how the Hitachi brand along with the products is going to be very important to us.","On the next slide, on slide 6, let's talk about the joint venture. So when you put our two entities together in the joint venture and then you add it to the current capabilities that Johnson Controls has, we\u2019ve become the largest commercial air-conditioning company in the world and we also between the Hitachi, our existing products, the Hitachi joint venture and the ADT acquisition, our portfolio in the commercial business is really second to none. And we\u2019re very proud of that and I think that is going to help us in the light commercial area along with some of our distribution changes that we are going to be able to have a business that is not so dependent just on the high end.","When we looked at Hitachi, there is a couple of things that were important. One was the VRF technology, the second thing that was important is their distribution particularly in China. We immediately become the number two player in China and then across Asia in general with the Hitachi brand and their products makes us a player immediately.","Let's go through the investments in the business. So the revenue is around $3 billion, at this point we haven't sorted out whether we will consolidate this or not. We will sort that out over the next quarter and keep you updated. We can talk more about that if you have questions.","Ownership, Johnson Controls 60%, Hitachi 40%. The initial margins 4% to 5%; those margins are being dragged down quite a bit because of the residential part of their business and so that is an opportunity for improvement. The commercial margins on the business are similar to the margins that we see in the rest of our commercial businesses.","We expect to close in the fourth quarter and this is obviously very consistent with where we are trying to take the company particularly our investments in BE. When you look at why Hitachi and what we get and what we look like after the joint venture, we talked about, I talked about the number two position in China in VRF that is incredibly important. The manufacturing footprint that we get that\u2019s outside of North America and the Americas mostly in Asia. We also get scroll compressor technology and that is something that we have been lacking, that\u2019s going to allow us to be more vertically integrated in some of our light commercial and residential offerings over time. There is some engineering that has to happen but I think that is a real opportunity for us that we haven't been able to exploit particularly because of our scale that should help our cost position over time.","The brand, Hitachi brand, particularly for these type of products first being a Japanese brand, fits with these products and Hitachi with their quality. They are known for their quality and their technology and the distribution channels that we get outside of North America. We do get some residential air-conditioning technologies. As I said today it's not near as profitable as we would like it to be and it is an opportunity for us to improve that.","The next slide, on slide 8 is one that I think is representative of how we see Hitachi and Johnson Controls and how they complement each other. This puzzle, the blue shaded being what Johnson Controls had already had products between the ADT acquisition and our York products. To the red or whatever that color is - red or orange color where we see the products that we get that complement us where either we have a position that is small and we can extend it or we don't have a position around the products that we have and of course this doesn't include the scroll technology that we will get with the acquisition, but these are the go-to-market products that we will have.","We also could represent this by brands because we are going to be selling these products through multiple channels and so we will have not only a technology strategy but a brand strategy to go with it.","So with that I'm going to turn it over to Bruce and we can talk about each one of the businesses.","Bruce McDonald","Okay. Thanks, Alex and good morning, everybody. So starting with the automotive here on slide 9, we had a strong quarter as you can see. If you look at the sales line and all our businesses I will talk about the underlying sales excluding FX and you can see that we would have been up about 2% not really for the euro impact here and to a lesser extent the yen. Margins, great performance by the business going up 26% and you can see at the bottom of this slide, seating margins were up 90 basis points in the quarter to 5% and interiors margins were up 170 basis points to 3.6%.","Up on the right we have kind of noted the fiscal Q1 production levels and maybe against that backdrop I will just tell you how our geographic revenues came in. So in North America we were at 3% versus the 5% so a little bit below. Here we are really seeing the impact of some of the business that is rolling off as a result of some of our quoting disciplines in the last year to 18 months.","In Europe down 1%, we performed up 1%. Really what you are seeing there is the impact of luxury volumes being a lot more interior contents are benefiting from that and then China, the production we estimate was up about 6% and our sales as we noted here were up 15%.","In China, we are kind of benefiting from a few trends. One, SUV market is really starting to take off and if you just look at 2014 as a proxy for the quarter, SUV volumes in China were up 32%. Luxury vehicles even though we source of a lot of the content from Europe even into the next second tier luxury vehicles, those were up 21% in 2014 and then if you look at our sales mix being more heavily weighted towards the European and North American manufacturers, the Chinese owned brands are losing share so what you are seeing is the VWs, the GMs and the alike, Ford, gaining share at the expense of the Chinese owned brand. So really those are the three reasons why our business has substantially outperformed the market and I would probably be remiss if I also didn't mention the sort of strides that we are making growing our metals business.","If we flip over to slide 10 for building efficiency, here you can see sales were up 5% and if we take out the impact of the ADT acquisition and FX, it would have been up 1% in the quarter so some growth but not the robust levels that we expect to see over the back half of the year here.","North America, our revenues were up 3%, Asia up 1% and you can see Latin America down double digits, so kind of a mixed bag on a regional basis. In terms of the margins and here we are sort of showing it with and without GWS, but if you look at BE ex-GWS, margins in the quarter were 6.7% which is 110 basis points better than last year. And there we are really benefiting from improved operational performance and the beneficial impact of ADT being enriching to our margin.","We were pleased to see the momentum that we saw last year in GWS carry forward here in the first quarter. Revenues were down slightly 3% but margins improved significantly and I would note that while the GWS business did benefit from about a $13 million contract settlement gain which was in our guidance, even backing that out was solid margin expansion in the quarter.","Also on the right, we talk about our backlog being down 4% adjusting for FX and from an orders perspective generally speaking about level with last year if we adjust for foreign exchange and the fact that we had $150 million deal, Hawaii Department of Transportation order in the prior year. That\u2019s an exceptionally large order, for us a large order I would say in Building Efficiency. A mega order would be $20 million so that sort of puts the $150 million kind of in perspective.","I think the only other thing I would comment here is in the light commercial part of our business like our unitary business on the ADT side, we did see order activity up mid-single digits so as we talked about when we bought ADT getting that increased exposure in the lighter commercial part of the market should start to benefit us and we did see that in our order intake in the quarter.","I usually give backlog and order information by geography. In the interest of time I won't do that today but Glen can certainly follow up in the future, you can follow up with Glen in terms of what the regional outlook was.","Then on page 11, I will flip over to Power Solutions. Here you can see our sales were up 4%. If we adjust for foreign exchange and lead, sales were up 8%. So we are pleased with that. In terms of our segment income, you see up 4% but I would remind everybody that in the last year's Q1 we had a $19 million non-recurring gain associated with the consolidated joint venture. If you sort of back that out to make an apples-and-apples comparison, our margins were up about 90 basis points so we are pleased with the performance here.","As Alex mentioned, AGM volumes are up 31%, OE and aftermarket were each up 4% overall. I put a comment here about managing lead volatility and for some of you that have been following us for a while you know that in times of rapidly moving lead prices we can experience some windfall gains or losses as it takes time for our sort of indexing contracts with our customers to roll off or on and as we sort of buy cores and things like that.","So the last three or four years have been in a pretty stable environment where lead has kind of been in that $2000 to $2100 type range. We did see lead commodity prices dip down fairly significantly more than double digit here towards the end of the first quarter. That is going to introduce a little bit of volatility to our earnings and that is something that I would just remind people that we do have that and it can inflate or deflate our reported margins and on a quarterly basis something that can introduce some earnings volatility. It is not a long-term issue but on a quarter-over-quarter basis it can.","And then lastly and maybe before I turn it over to Brian, I will just update folks on where we are with the portfolio initiatives. So obviously I'm not going to talk about Hitachi again here but maybe just focusing on the other two major initiatives we have.","So on our automotive interiors joint venture that we are working on with Yanfeng Automotive Trim Systems really substantial progress in the quarter. We have received regulatory approvals in most of the major geographies. We are going through in terms of China; you have to go through a formal valuation process to get SASAC approval. We expect to have that done by the end of February and get SASAC approval at the end of March which would then trigger us signing our joint venture in April and we are on track with that which would then facilitate start of operation at the beginning of our fourth quarter on July 1.","So a lot of work kind of behind the scenes on this one but I think we are pretty confident in terms of getting the approvals here by the end of April and starting this thing up at the beginning of the fourth quarter. And then in terms of GWS, really pleased with how it's going, strong buyer interest, very strong buyer interest. We expect that we will be in a position to announce who this business will be sold to probably in early Q3.","Within GWS, we have a joint venture in Australia and Canada with Brookfield Asset Management and as part of this transaction, we had a buy\/sell type arrangement with Brookfield where they could either step into our shoes with the successor owner of this business or they could buy us out and then during the quarter we sort of resolved that with Brookfield agreeing to buy our shareholding. We expect that will close here in the second quarter and we will get proceeds of about $200 million.","So good news out there and in terms of the three big initiatives we have a lot of progress in 90 days and so with that I will turn it over to Brian.","Brian Stief","Okay. Thanks, Bruce and good morning, everyone. So on slide 13 if you look at our press release we did identify transaction and integration costs associated with the high level of portfolio activities that we have got going on right now of about $20 million, $19 million after-tax or $0.03 in the quarter. As I talk through these financials, I will exclude the impact of those transaction costs which is consistent with the guidance that we provided at our Analyst Day in New York in December.","Overall first quarter revenues as Alex mentioned, were up 1% to $10.7 billion with higher underlying revenues in all three of our businesses and this was partly offset by the impact of foreign exchange, excluding FX, revenues would have increased by 5% year-over-year.","Gross profit for the quarter of 15.8% was up 90 basis points from last year and we\u2019re seeing good focused operational execution in our businesses and we are also beginning to see the early benefits of our Johnson Controls Operating System implementation which we talked a lot about in New York as well.","On a year-over-year basis, SG&A declined by 2% which is the result of ongoing focus on costs across all of our businesses and if you look at equity income, our prior results as Bruce mentioned include a non-recurring gain of $19 million related to consolidation of a joint venture in our Power Solutions business in the first quarter last year excluding that gain, equity income of $102 million would have been up 10% reflecting the continued strong profitability of our automotive joint ventures particularly those in China.","Overall, operating income was up $118 million or 18% versus 2014 and our first quarter segment margins of 7.2% were 110 basis points better than 2014, all in all a real strong performance across the board for our businesses in Q1.","Turning to slide 14, net financing charges of $71 million were $16 million higher than prior year levels. These higher financing costs were attributable to the financing for the ADT acquisition which was $1.6 billion in the third quarter of last year as well as our ongoing share repurchase program. We have purchased $600 million of our stock back in the first quarter which compares to $1.2 billion that was repurchased last year and as you know that\u2019s part of a three-year $3.6 billion program that we initiated about 18 months ago.","For the quarter, our underlying effective income tax rate is about 19%, up slightly from last year's 18.7% and income attributable to non-controlling interest in the quarter was a charge of $39 million which is $6 million higher than last year and again that\u2019s just attributable to our automotive joint ventures in China where we are seeing improved profitability. Overall, very strong first quarter with diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.79, up 20% versus $0.66 a year ago and slightly higher than the guidance that we provided for the quarter.","So moving to page 15, I would like to spend a few minutes on our balance sheet and cash flow. Although it's a net outflow in our first quarter which is usual, our free cash flow did improve by $200 million compared to the first quarter of fiscal '14. Trade working capital continues to be an area of focus for us and we are pleased to see about a 50 basis point improvement in year-over-year trade working capital as a percentage of sales when you adjust for FX and the businesses held for sale which would be GWS and Interiors.","Capital spending of $280 million for the quarter was slightly lower than our original plan due to some project timing but it compares to $345 million a year ago. I mentioned the buyback of $600 million in the first quarter and I would just point out there that this buyback program we have obviously got flexibility with our ability to turn on or turn off that program depending upon whether there are other investment opportunities with better returns.","Our balance sheet position remained solid at the end of the quarter with net debt to cap of about 40.5% that compares to 35.7% at the end of the year, at the end of the fiscal year 2014. I would just point out that if you look at our free cash flow forecast for the remainder of the year plus the net proceeds that we expect from the GWS and Hitachi transactions, that our net debt to cap ratio should be in the mid-30s again by the end of fiscal '15.","So our outlook for the second quarter is $0.74 to $0.76 per share again excluding transaction costs which we think will probably again range in the $0.02 to $0.03 per share level and although we do see some headwinds on FX in Q2 as Alex mentioned, we think the all-in fiscal year impact of FX should be largely offset by favorable commodity prices.","We remain confident that we will deliver our full-year guidance of $3.55 to $3.70 that we provided at the analyst meeting in New York. So overall I think we have good momentum going into Q2 with riding on the heels of a strong Q1 performance. We have made excellent progress on our portfolio activities and I also think we are beginning to get some traction around the enterprise-wide Johnson Controls Operating System initiatives.","So with that Glen, we can open it up for questions.","Glen Ponczak","Yes, Candy, we are ready to take questions. I would ask those who are in the queue to give a main question and a follow-up and if you have more to get back into the queue just so that we give more people a chance to speak. And Candy, we are ready to go.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Colin Langan of UBS.","Colin Langan","On the Hitachi transaction, can you give any color on - are there chances to get out of the 60\/40 structure to fully own it over time? Is that an intent long-term, is that embedded in the contract somehow?","Alex Molinaroli","This is Alex. I don't know that is our intent. I think that our ability to dilute what has to do with capital infusions. One of the things that is really important to us is the Hitachi brand and I think if Hitachi pulled out of the JV completely I think that would be difficult for us to maintain the brand. So I think we are going to have a long-term partnership and in fact I think it will probably grow as we met with Hitachi folks over the last couple of years, as other opportunities for us too.","Colin Langan","Okay. Just one follow-up. What has to happen to get the margins back to the rest of the business and how long do you think it will take to get there to the building efficiency average margin?","Alex Molinaroli","For Hitachi?","Colin Langan","Yes, for the Hitachi deal, sorry. Yes.","Alex Molinaroli","So the margins range wildly when you go around the world. In Japan, the margins are low overall, that is a consistency if you look at their competition. If you go to China, our margins are good in China, in Asia in particular. We don't have much sales in North America, we expect those margins to be healthy but the residential is the real drag. So I think the two things I would say is the Japan business which is something that will likely be a drag on margins for a long time, it has to do with the environment there and the residential which is something that we aim to fix or understand better and figure out if it fits with the rest of our business.","Colin Langan","So the issues are Japan which will be a continued laggard and residential which you - think about strategically longer-term?","Alex Molinaroli","That\u2019s correct.","Bruce McDonald","But in terms of order of magnitude it's really about residential. I think within a couple of years if you look at what we are planning on doing the sales growth that we anticipate in North America, I would say it would be two years the commercial side of this business will be comparable. The residential which you can see in the bar, one of the pie charts nearly half of the business and that\u2019s what the real drag is.","Operator","Thank you. Next question Robert Barry of Susquehanna. Your line is open.","Robert Barry","Actually just a couple of quick clarifications on the Hitachi question. The 4 to 5, is that an EBIT margin or an EBITDA margin?","Bruce McDonald","It's an EBIT margin, segment income.","Robert Barry","And has anything changed since the original MOU was announced and in particular, was it always contemplated that half the JV would be residential?","Alex Molinaroli","Yes, it was all the products that they sell. So Hitachi on its own is essentially out of the HVAC business. Their HVAC business which fits inside their clients group is now a joint venture with Johnson Controls so we took all of it. Now strategically and Colin was asking the question about strategically how important this is, that\u2019s also where the compressor technology comes from. We don't want to make a rash decision on what our strategic choices are. We have to understand it better, but yes, it was always contemplated.","Bruce McDonald","One thing I would add to that, Rob, is we used to talk about the business having about 3% margins and the profitability while we have been in discussions on the improved and that would really be attributed to the growth in their business in Taiwan, India and China. Those markets are accretive, highly accretive and we have seen really rapid growth there. That is going to help.","Alex Molinaroli","And just some color on that, so the earnings are better than when we started and of course we are benefiting from the translation of the yen as it relates to what the economics of this deal looks like.","Robert Barry","And then maybe just finally on auto, could you break out what was going on the revenue in seating versus interiors and just how it kind of foots with the outlook for the year to be down 5% to 6%. It looks like you are off to a much better start.","Brian Stief","We are off to a better start. I think if you look at the automotive breakout for the quarter, I mean as we said in the slide, if you take the automotive interiors business, if you look we have got improvement in interiors for the quarter of about 1% and then seating was down about 3% for the quarter. As we mentioned earlier on the slide for automotive, there is 3% all in but if you adjust for FX, we get back to plus 2%.","Alex Molinaroli","Yes, four for seatings and four [ph] interiors ex-FX.","Brian Stief","Rob, one just reminder. When we gave our guidance and set down 5, don't forget we backed out one quarter of interiors. We were assuming that we would lose about nearly $1 billion of sales in Q4. That\u2019s how we got to the down 5%.","Robert Barry","Okay, so they down 5 to 6, is for really seating and interiors as long as you expect to have it?","Brian Stief","Yes, that is right. And we expect the interiors to be gone July 1 of '15. That is the significant item.","Robert Barry","Okay, but bottom line it sounds like the seating piece alone is tracking a little bit better than you thought?","Brian Stief","Correct.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is Emmanuel Rosner with CLSA.","Emmanuel Rosner","Wanted to ask you first about your commercial backlog and orders in the building efficiency business, I was a little bit surprised to see the backlog back in the down territory after showing - being in the green last quarter. Orders flat as well. Can you maybe give a little bit more color on what you are seeing there and more importantly what gives you confidence that we are going to see some better comps in the second half?","Alex Molinaroli","This is Alex. I will take that and Bruce might have some couple of things to add. I think you probably have to listen carefully. We were always concerned that we weren't going to be able to overcome the Hawaii deal, the $150 million in a quarter for us is a significant amount of secured sales. So I think that was one of the things so we anticipated that our backlog would be down. Obviously the revenues - we are seeing revenue in excess of what our backlog is in excess of what we thought. The reason that we are gaining confidence is if you look at the pipelines for the remainder of the year, you look at our Q2, our Q3 and our Q4, we\u2019re seeing a substantial increase in the pipeline.","So we need to translate those into orders so much so I mean we have been - we are talking with the team there about do we have the confidence yet to start hiring salespeople because we don't want to wait until the market is already there before we hire the salespeople. So those are the kinds of conversations that we are having in building efficiency which is a much more positive conversation and kind of bodes to the confidence level.","Emmanuel Rosner","Okay and then just a couple of points of clarification again on the Hitachi joint venture. First of all, does the JV carry any debt? Also curious in terms of the revenue, what is it currently? I know you said $3 billion by 2016 and then just finally on the margin profile, the 4% to 5% is that immediately or was that a 2016 number as well?","Brian Stief","So if you look at the revenues to answer that question first, the $3 billion is a '16 number if you look at the '15 number at current exchange rates, it is probably 2.5, 2.6, something along those lines. As far as the margins of 4% to 5% as we look ahead, those margins at the end of our four- to five-year period, we expect those margins to get up into high single digits and that also would not include opportunities that we have to do better on the residential air-conditioning business.","So we will make some decisions on how best to run the residential air-conditioning business going forward and that should actually provide some improvement across the board to all the overall Hitachi joint venture margins.","Emmanuel Rosner","Great. And any debt?","Brian Stief","And as far as debt, there is nominal debt from day one in the voucher.","Bruce McDonald","But the 525 just to be clear is cash-free debt-free number.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank.","Rod Lache","Just wanted to clarify your just previous comment, how do you get to the high single digits within Hitachi excluding the exit from residential? And maybe you can elaborate a little bit more on the ability to extend that business throughout your distribution elsewhere? And then lastly, on Hitachi, what is the reason why it might not be consolidated if you own the majority?","Alex Molinaroli","I will start that and see if we can get them all. It sounds like more than a follow-up. Let me see if I can catch them all. The reason that we would see the margins go up and then we are confident about that is our focus is going to be growing the commercial part of the business, the VRF part of the business and a lot of that would be to continue growth in Asia but also being able to leverage our distribution not only in Europe but in North America, the channel that we will be using is the channel that we acquired through ADT.","So we feel fairly confident we will be able to grow the commercial and also will be growing the margins. So what you are going to see is the percent of the residential would go down in our current pro forma because we are essentially saying we are not contemplating doing much different at this point, that\u2019s a strategy yet to be talked about. So we will have more volume at a higher-margin of commercial business which would be our focus.","What was your other question?","Rod Lache","The consolidation of it.","Brian Stief","Why don't I take that one, so despite equity ownership interest there are certain other criteria that you need to meet in order to say you have full operational control of a joint venture which would allow consolidation and depending upon how some of the final provisions work in the agreement, we may be in a situation where even though we own 60%, we don't in effect have operational control of that joint venture on a go forward basis. So it really gets down to some technical accounting application of consolidation versus equity accounting rules.","Alex Molinaroli","Yes, so let me add a little detail to that so that you understand. From an operational standpoint, Johnson Controls will be leading the business plan, the operational plan. What Brian is referring to is the multiyear strategic plan that has to be approved unanimously and that essentially is to get right down to the detail that\u2019s essentially what we have to make sure we understand how to account for it. But from an operational standpoint, Johnson Controls will be managing the business. We have the CEO as announced and we also have the CFO which we haven't announced yet.","Rod Lache","And Alex, just to clarify, is that business growing double digit even before you add your distribution? I think you said it was like 2.6 going to 3 next year. Is there an organic trajectory that\u2019s pretty favorable there?","Alex Molinaroli","Well they are growing fast, so there is a lot of consolidated and unconsolidated parts of this business. So I would say that the parts of the business in Asia are growing at that rate. They also have been focused on the commercial - Japan not so much. It's a very mature market as you say very competitive, but I think what we are saying is the markets that are large, China is seeing that growth happening and where we are not seeing it obviously is the other growth market is North America because they don't have any presence in North America and that\u2019s what we will be releasing this week here in ASHRAE.","Operator","Thank you. And next question is Brian Johnson with Barclays.","Brian Johnson","A couple of questions again I guess all related to BE. Given what you just said about the control, how do you foresee the distribution and the product side of Hitachi JCI JV working with your existing branches in the U.S. and in Europe and Asia where it's more still one business with that and you must have thought through, are they going to be to running into each in the market [ph] how do you kind of work on bids together and so forth?","Alex Molinaroli","I'm glad you asked that question because we haven't given a lot of clarity around that. One of the things you will see in the release it talks about that we don't have the sales and service in Japan but Hitachi has that. Johnson Controls in places like North America will actually have control of the distribution. So we will be managing the distribution both through our branch network and through our other channels. The part of this that is actually different is really Japan where it didn't make sense for Johnson Controls to be managing distribution; it makes sense for Hitachi to manage the distribution.","Brian Stief","So maybe you can think about it Brian in some terms, as a manufacturing joint venture, Hitachi will control the distribution in Japan and we will largely control the distribution outside of Japan.","Alex Molinaroli","And that would include the branding. So what you can expect in places like North America actually all around the world is that we will sell similar or same products through different channels with different brands but you will see the Hitachi brand and you will see the York brand.","Brian Johnson","Okay. So your customers in Europe and China, this will be JCI distributed wholesale product that happens to be manufactured in the JV?","Alex Molinaroli","So in places like China, it is a little more complicated than that because we actually go through a joint venture called Hisense. I don't if you are familiar with Hisense. It's one of the largest appliance manufacturers and white goods manufacturer and seller in China and so that joint venture will stay in place. We may or may not sell also directly. We haven't decided but the Hisense brand and the Hisense organization is very well known and China is a very strong channels so we are going to leverage that.","Brian Johnson","And over on the resi side, is the issue competition in the residential marketplaces worldwide pushing it down? Is it cost structure at the manufacturing? Is it a heavy dependence on the Japanese domestic market which is stagnated for a few decades or is it kind of all of the above?","Alex Molinaroli","It's all of those. I think the Japanese - there is a lot of bias to the challenges in Japan and then you also have to decide do we have the right business models in places outside of Japan? But I would say that it is all of those things, I would probably primarily the Japan business has got very tough margins.","Bruce McDonald","But vis-a-vis the competitor, I think if you just looked at the industry Brian, what you would see is challenged margins in the residential product across the board and Hitachi's business would probably be a little bit less than the industry.","Brian Johnson","Okay, so there isn't really an opportunity to raise price, you have got to look at it internally.","Alex Molinaroli","Yes, and that\u2019s why we are not making any commitments but everything we talk about at this point, we would see what we do with the residential strategically is adding value to the numbers that we talked about at this point. We didn't justify it based on residential.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is Mike Wood with Macquarie.","Mike Wood","This is more of a follow-up to the point you just made. You talked about the sales synergies of Hitachi, are there going to be cost synergies and restructuring post this closing of the JV and what type of incremental margin should we assume?","Alex Molinaroli","I don't know that we have talked yet about the margins, we talked about being accretive and we talked about our hurdle rates, but I guess what I would say is that there will be some restructuring. I think that it will be minor and it will be over a period of time. I don't think there is something that will be having to call out with the possible exception of some of the manufacturing that\u2019s in the East.","As it relates to synergies, you can almost like a reserve synergies. If we are able from a cost standpoint, if you think about the compressor technology if we can apply that compressor technology within current Johnson Controls products that\u2019s a real opportunity for us because today we purchase - we buy\/sell compressors and the supply chain is not real favorable to us. So this is a real opportunity for us. We will have to make some design changes.","So there is real synergies there on the cost side and then also I think from a manufacturing footprint today the manufacturing is primarily in Japan, China, Taiwan. Certainly as we move to the Americas, we will need to look and see if it makes sense for us to move some manufacturing there.","Mike Wood","And the follow-up, I'm having trouble getting to your earnings accretion from the Hitachi JV given the numbers you provided. Is there a higher tax rate in the JV than what you have currently at Johnson Controls?","Brian Stief","We will have to follow up on that. I mean the $0.5 to $0.07 accretion I think the tax rate used in there was the mid-20s so maybe a bit higher than the Johnson Controls tax rate.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research.","Jeff Sprague","Just to shift gears actually, I'm a little bit kind of confused on the raw math FX kind of offset argument. Obviously the foreign exchange has moved pretty dramatically. You said in December that your commodity exposure was minimal because of hedging and indexing and everything. So why is it now you are getting benefits if you were heavily hedged? And maybe you could just walk us through that and how that plays out?","Alex Molinaroli","Fuel is something that we did not anticipate so I think that\u2019s one of the benefits that we are getting that we did not anticipate and in most parts of the world, we are able to get that fairly quickly. We have also - this really kind of bleeds into some of our initiatives if you look at our - the purchasing synergies, purchasing opportunities initiatives we already have underway. Some of that is going to be economics but some of it is also the initiatives we have in place.","So I think based off the current economics and what I would say is the wildcard and this is lead mostly from a volatility standpoint, we feel fairly confident on today's exchange rates and today's economics that they do offset.","Jeff Sprague","And then just coming back to Hitachi for a follow-up, the question on restructuring and I'm sure you are still treading lightly here, but saying it might be minor except for possibly manufacturing in the East sounds like except for possibly cuts in Japan. I'm just wondering if you actually have kind of the license to do that, do you need to do that to repair these margins? Is there a significant amount of product coming out of Japan into these other regions and therefore there is kind of an issue with the cost structure?","Bruce McDonald","Yes, Jeff, this is Bruce. Maybe just to help you out there, some of the Japanese production today is in facilities that are shared with Hitachi and so as part of this arrangement, we aren't buying some of the plants and so we have to relocate it more into China. And so if you think about the arrangements that we have made with Hitachi around the plant that we haven't bought in the workforce, that\u2019s why we are saying - even though we plan to move some work out of those shared facilities, the cost of the joint venture is minimal.","Alex Molinaroli","I don't want to get into specifics but we do have a plan obviously we are not going to detail it here. But we do have the right to make the - the joint venture has the right to make financial decisions that may have the right returns. We are not handcuffed in any way. So I am not too concerned about that. I understand the question but I think there is something that we will be able to match particularly our growing businesses is when you think about China and North America, we will be able to match our manufacturing with where the business is.","Jeff Sprague","And if I could, just a quick one. Could you give us any color or comment on price realization in the U.S. and in HVAC? Obviously you and a lot of people are out there. Do you see signs that that\u2019s sticking, kind of what your confidence factor is on that as you move into the beginning part of the calendar year here?","Alex Molinaroli","We are only two weeks into the price increase for us. Our timing was first of January for the most part and for the majority of it. That\u2019s a great question and we expect it to stick and we have mechanisms in place for that to happen, but for me to say that it is or it isn't at this point it is just a little early.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question is Rich Kwas with Wells Fargo Securities.","Rich Kwas","Just following up here on Hitachi with the scroll technology, does that influence your decision whether you keep resi or not - adopting that technology being able to manufacture and become more vertically integrated? Is that one of the inputs here in the decision process or can you divest of resi and still become as vertically integrated as you potentially could be?","Alex Molinaroli","I don't think it impacts it. It is an opportunity so it might change the - I would look at it differently. We have made at this point a commitment to stick with the residential business that we have. If you look at the opportunity that we now have around design, this is an opportunity for synergies. I'm still in the same place that I was that even though we are subscale, we are going to try to find ways to fix some of that but we also think it's an important part of the business and having the scroll technology is just going to make it even better. But it's not something that is going to tip us either way.","Rich Kwas","And then does the light commercial piece because the light commercial product can be interchanged with the residential product on the VRF side, is this just kind of wait and see, we will see what we can do on residential and then make a decision? But you could - the plan is to be able to leverage the technology and stick that product through the light commercial channels with ADT, etcetera?","Alex Molinaroli","To where it makes sense, absolutely. Where we have the opportunity and we will have to do some design changes. There is some real practical things that have to be done and we also have to once we get the engineering done have to get it tested and trialed, but we do see opportunity in all of our products that use the technology. We are not limiting anything.","Rich Kwas","Okay, and then last quick one just on shifting the power. Europe, it was a pretty mild winter last year so that it hurt your volumes. What are you seeing so far in the European piece as you are moving through the March quarter here?","Alex Molinaroli","Actually I don't know this quarter. I can tell you that [inaudible] the momentum was strong and you could look at it two different ways. Last year there was lots of inventory in the channel in the first quarter and we had a mild winter so it was a really, really tough quarter for Europe last year, the first quarter and we saw that. We saw the channel not being as full and we saw a little bit better help from the standpoint of weather. So the first quarter was much better and our expectation is that we should see that continue at least from a moderate standpoint moving forward because it was very weak if you remember last year in Europe.","Bruce McDonald","We have pretty easy comparables Rich, for the next couple of quarters with the destocking that we saw last year and AGM volumes being very strong there where we have significantly higher share. And we talked in the last four or five calls about new business wins that we have made in share gains. So in the quarter, this quarter our volumes in Europe were up 7%. We expect to see upper single-digit for the next couple of quarters based on those factors.","Glen Ponczak","Thanks, Rich. We have got to cut it pretty short here. Alex, do you have any final questions before they kick you out of your room?","Alex Molinaroli","Yes, let me get this done to see who is coming in next. I want to thank our employees. As you look at the environment that we are in, some of it external and some of it internal because of all the changes that we have going on, I'm incredibly pleased with what we have accomplished. I think that it's just a testament to the people at Johnson Controls and leadership and the fact that we are rallying around the strategy.","I hope that you recognize the fact that we have had a blueprint that we\u2019re following and for the most part I would say that we are on or maybe sometimes even further ahead than I expected. So with the Hitachi thing mostly behind us, that was the one that I was mostly concerned about being able to meet the timeline of some of our portfolio actions. I feel really confident about the rest of the year around our portfolio and our margin improvements.","So with that I really thank you and talk to you next quarter.","Operator","Thank you for your participation. That does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect at this time."],"12536":["Johnson Controls International Plc (NYSE:JCI) Q1 2017 Earnings Call February  1, 2017 11:00 AM ET","Executives","Antonella Franzen - Johnson Controls International Plc","Alex A.

Your lines have been placed on listen-only until the question-and-answer session. This conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time.","I will now turn the call over to Antonella Franzen, Vice President of Investor Relations.","Antonella Franzen - Johnson Controls International Plc","Good morning and thank you for joining our conference call to discuss Johnson Controls' first quarter fiscal 2017 results. The press release and all related tables issued earlier this morning, as well as the conference call slide presentation, can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website at johnsoncontrols.com. With me today are Johnson Controls' Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Alex Molinaroli; President and Chief Operating Officer, George Oliver; and our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Brian Stief.","Before we begin, I would like to remind you that during the course of today's call, we will be providing certain forward-looking information. We ask that you view today's press release and read through the forward-looking cautionary informational statement that we've included there.","In addition, we will use certain non-GAAP measures in our discussion, and we ask that you read through the sections of our press release that address the use of these items. In discussing our results during the call, references to adjusted EBITA and adjusted EBIT margins, exclude transaction, integration, and separation costs, as well as other special items. These metrics are non-GAAP measures and are reconciled in the schedule attached to our press release.","All comparisons to the prior year are on a combined basis, which excludes the results of Adient, which is presented in discontinued operations and includes the results of Tyco net of conforming accounting adjustments and recurring purchase accounting.","Now let me quickly recap this quarter's results. Sales of $7.1 billion in the quarter increased slightly year over year on a reported basis. Organic growth of 1% was partially offset by the net impact of FX, M&A and lead pass-through pricing. Earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to Johnson Controls' ordinary shareholders was $0.39 and included net charges of $0.14 related to special items. These special items were primarily composed of transaction, integration and separation costs as well as non-recurring purchase accounting charges, which were partially offset by discrete tax items. Adjusting for special items, non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.53 per share compared to $0.48 in the prior-year quarter.","Now let me turn the call over to Alex.","Alex A. Molinaroli - Johnson Controls International Plc","Thanks, Antonella. Good morning, everyone.","Before I get into the details of the first quarter, I'd like to just take one minute, if we turn to slide 5 in your deck, to talk about the key priorities, and we talked about this when we were together in December. I just want to remind everyone what it is that we're focused on before we get into some of the specifics. When you think about this merger, the intangibles of this is bringing together two cultures of these two great companies and we shared with you that we have put together our vision, mission, values and we talked about that at the Investor Day.","We're well on our way on our journey to institutionalize this framework that we shared with you across our enterprise. At the same time, we remain focused on delivering our operating and financial plans. And we started off Q1 I'd say not exactly where we wanted to on the growth front, but certainly ahead of our plan on both margin and expansion of our earnings. And I remain confident in our ability to achieve our commitments for the full year.","We're deeply engaged in a process of developing a new strategic plan for the combined company.","It's informed by our insights from our customers on the convergence of technology. Evaluating our portfolio is an ongoing process that we do here and we're ensuring that we're investing in the right businesses not just because they're good businesses, but they're the right businesses for Johnson Controls.","We've installed a disciplined capital allocation strategy, we talked about that in December, which balances our investments for future growth and returning capital to shareholders. Our current set of businesses are well positioned for the right markets for the long term. And I'm confident we'll continue to execute and drive shareholder value.","Let's turn to slide 6 and let's talk about our start. Now, we started off this year with a great start with solid activity particularly around our integration activities. And we're currently proud of what's been accomplished by the team. If you think about our first quarter with the spin of Adient and the merger activities around Tyco, I feel, and George will get into the details, I feel very good about our start.","The first quarter profitability in both our Buildings and Power are better than we expected. And our teams are focused on what's in their control and they remain focused on execution. We began to realize our cost synergies and we're actually a bit ahead of where we expect it for the quarter and that bodes well for the future.","In terms of our end markets, the non-residential market continues to improve. Specifically, the institutional markets continue to be strong. And we saw good order activity there, particularly in healthcare. More importantly our sales teams are excited about the opportunity to work together and our quoting pipeline remains very active and cross-selling activity continues to build.","As you know and I just referenced, we completed the Adient spin-off at the end of October. And I'd just like to take the opportunity to wish Bruce McDonald and his team continued success at Adient.","Let's go to slide 7. So we put this slide in just to remind everyone about our investments in Asia-Pacific. And it really occurred to me that we wanted to make sure that we continue to talk about that and so I'd just like to spend a few minutes updating you on our progress.","You've heard us talk about Asia-Pacific, particularly China and how excited we remain about the growth opportunities in the near term and also in the long run. And we're seeing both top line and bottom line improvement. We see performance across all of our businesses. In Buildings, the organic growth is in the low to mid single-digit range, and in Power we're seeing excellent results growing north of 20% year-on-year on organic basis.","We're really seeing the benefit of these strategic investments we've made over the past few years. More importantly we continue to improve our profitability in this region with several hundred basis points of margin expansion. We're leveraging the expanding infrastructure that we have and the infrastructure of our customers and a growing middle class. And our scale continues to accelerate both our growth and improve profitability.","I'm also impressed with what's been accomplished. We've been at Hitachi in our integration, Hitachi over a year and all the work that's been put in place to implement our Johnson Controls operating system within the Hitachi joint venture is \u2013 continues to contribute an even stronger margin year, year-over-year improvement. I'm proud of our Asia-Pacific team, I want to give them a shout out and I'm confident that they'll continue to grow while continuing to improve our profitability.","Let's move to slide 8 and talk about the quarter. Sales in the quarter were basically flat with prior year $7.1 billion on a reported basis. Organically sales grew a little over 1% with a modest decline in Buildings more than offset by increased volume and a favorable mix in Power. We continue to see strong growth in start-stop. George will give you more detail on that in a few minutes.","Continued profitability and EBITA of 10% year over year on a reported basis and if you adjust for FX and lead, up 13%, extremely strong execution across all of our businesses. Adjusted EBIT margins expanded 90 basis points overall, far exceeding our expectation of 30 basis points. EPS for the quarter was up 10% versus prior year at $0.53, above the top end of an adjusted range of $0.50 to $0.52, a great start to the new year, and look forward to getting into the details.","With that, I'll turn it over to George, and George can go through the businesses.","George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc","Thanks, Alex, and good morning, everyone.","Before I get into the detailed business review, I thought I'd start with a quick integration update. As I discussed with you at our Investor Day back in December, I've been spending quite a bit of my time with our business unit leaders across the organization, getting deeper into the businesses and developing our strategies as a go-forward company. I've also had the opportunity to meet with several of our sales teams and I can tell you that energy levels are high with some early wins in the quarter, which set us up for future revenue synergy opportunities.","Let me share with you a few of these recent wins, which highlight collaboration among the teams. Building off a strong legacy Building Efficiency performance record, a government customer contacted our branch regarding a fire system issue with another competitor's equipment. Our local branch teams worked together to secure a life-safety repair project, including a complete SimplexGrinnell fire alarm system.","In Canada, our fire team was able to leverage a strong Johnson Controls customer relationship to secure an order for a very large fire sprinkler project.","And in Latin America, the joint team had a combined win including a building management system, HVAC, access control, video, and a communication system for a hospital. Again, these are just a few examples of early wins.","On the cost synergies side, we have implemented a strong governance structure to track costs and all related synergies. As we laid out for you in December, we expect to capture $250 million to $300 million in cost synergies and productivity savings in 2017. And as Alex mentioned, we are off to a strong start.","We achieved roughly $50 million in synergies and productivity or about $0.05 on an EPS basis in the quarter. We expect to capture a similar amount in the second quarter. And then based on the timing around things like head count reductions, we expect to achieve $0.07 in the third quarter and $0.08 in the fourth quarter.","The integration of two large organizations requires a lot of heavy lifting, commitment and leadership. Not all decisions are easy, but we have a strong team leading the process, ensuring we execute on decisions made and we move forward to the next step.","Both the integration team and the businesses are guided around four main objectives: grow, integrate, change, and operate. We are making good progress and I look forward to keeping you updated on our continued success.","Let's turn now to a review of the businesses, starting with Building Technologies & Solutions on slide 10. On a reported basis, Buildings sales declined 2% or a little less than 1% organically to $5.2 billion in the quarter. When you look at the field side of the business, which represents about 70% of total sales, organic growth was relatively flat overall, with a few positives and a few areas of pressure. We had strong growth in applied HVAC systems, which was up mid single-digits.","In fire and security, both North America and the rest of world grew in the low single-digit range. On the other hand, performance contracting continued to face pressure tied to federal government budget delays, as well as a tougher prior year comparison, while industrial refrigeration is pressured by the oil and gas and process end markets. These two businesses were down about 20% in the quarter on a year-over-year basis.","On the flip side, our products business, which represents the remaining 30% of sales, declined 3% organically year over year. We continued to see very strong growth in UPG, which was up low teens, driven by increased shipments in both residential and light commercial. The strength in UPG was more than offset by a mid-single-digit decline in fire and security products related to the high-hazard heavy industrial end markets.","Turning to orders, overall growth of 2% year over year excluding FX and M&A was driven by a 3% increase in field orders, which was partially offset by a 3% decline in our quick-turn product orders, which pressured our sales growth in the quarter. We have seen some early signs of stabilization on the orders front in industrial refrigeration, which is encouraging. Additionally, we expect the decline in fire and security products to ease, with revenues starting to flatten out. This stabilization combined with the timing of backlog conversion gives us confidence in improved sales growth in the second quarter.","Backlog of $8.1 billion was up 6% year over year and up 2% sequentially, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and M&A.","Buildings EBITA increased 3% year over year, was 6% excluding the headwind from foreign currency to $578 million. The margin increased 60 basis points year over year to 11.1%, benefiting from strong productivity savings and the early traction we're seeing on cost synergies, which more than offset planned incremental product and channel investments during the quarter.","Also contributing to the increased margin was the Hitachi JV, which continues to execute well with another quarter of solid operational improvement, although aided by an easy comparison to the prior year. Recall the Hitachi JV closed early in the first quarter of 2016, but the benefits from restructuring actions and plant productivity initiatives do not begin to bear fruit until the second quarter. We would expect that as we move forward in 2017, the magnitude of year-over-year profit improvements generated by the Hitachi JV will become smaller.","Turning now to Power Solutions on slide 11, sales increased 9% year over year on a reported basis and 7% organically to $1.9 billion. As a reminder, the organic change excludes the impact of lead pass-through, which benefited Power's top line by just over 250 basis points.","Overall, global unit shipments increased 5% year over year, driven by aftermarket shipments, which were up 7%. Global start-stop shipments continued to expand with a 27% increase year over year, with another quarter of significant growth in China and the Americas.","Power Solutions segment EBITA increased 8% on a reported basis or 12% excluding foreign currency and lead to $390 million. Power's margin was down 20 basis points year over year on a reported basis, including a 110 basis point headwind from the impact of higher lead cost.","Underlying margins excluding the impact of lead increased 90 basis points year over year, driven by leverage on higher volumes and favorable product mix, both higher aftermarket and higher start-stop shipments.","Now let me turn the call over to Brian to walk through Corporate and the consolidated financial details of the quarter and our outlook for the second quarter.","Brian J. Stief - Johnson Controls International Plc","Thanks, George. Good morning. So for the first time, we will be reporting Corporate as a standalone segment. I think this provides a bit more transparency to the true underlying EBITA performance of our businesses. This segment is really comprised of enterprise-wide costs like executive management costs, public company costs, and other functional administrative costs that really aren't directly attributable to our primary businesses.","Our Corporate segment expense did decrease 12% year over year, and this was primarily due to some of the productivity initiatives and the merger synergies that we had identified as part of the planning process last year, and both were a bit better than expected in the quarter.","If I turn to slide 13, there are a lot of moving pieces in this quarter relative to the special items and also the fact that Adient is for the first time reported as a discontinued operation. Given the size of some of the special items, let me just briefly comment on each of those, the first being transaction, integration, and separation costs associated with our portfolio activities. That was roughly $134 million, and the way to think about that is about half of it is transaction-related and half of it is integration-related.","We had a restructuring and impairment charge for $78 million. The majority of that would be severance-related. We had a lump sum pension buyout in the first quarter. And as a result of that, which was done in connection with the Adient spinoff, there's a requirement to go through a remeasurement of the liability and assets in the first quarter. And that resulted actually in a $117 million gain in Q1.","We had some non-recurring purchase accounting expenses that Antonella referred to. The two primary areas there are the inventory step-up amortization, which is now fully behind us at the end of Q1. And also, we continue to amortize the backlog asset that was set up as part of purchase accounting. And then lastly, there was a discrete tax benefit related to some planning in our foreign entities that resulted in a $101 million benefit.","The net of all that is a $0.14 charge, which when added to the $0.39 reported gets to the $0.53 that we've been talking about this morning. So, as I go through my comments, I will exclude these special items and also the comparison will be the pro forma combined financials that we put out on fiscal 2016 in the November 8-K that we filed.","So, overall first quarter revenues were up slightly at $7.1 billion. If you exclude FX, lead, and M&A activity, organic sales were up 1%. Gross margin was constant at 31.2% and SG&A was down 3%, which was reflective of the cost reduction initiatives that we have across our business and the merger synergies.","If you move to equity income of $55 million, it was 20% higher than year-ago levels, again related primarily to the strong Hitachi year-over-year performance. And then as Alex mentioned, for the first quarter we delivered double-digit segment EBIT growth, and we had EBIT margins of 10.7% which were 90 basis points better than the first quarter of 2016 and again both of those exceeded our expectations for the quarter.","If we turn to page 14, net financing charges were $119 million which were slightly higher than last year, and our effective tax rate as we communicated on Analyst Day was at 15%, which compares favorably to last year's rate of 17%. Hitachi continues to perform well and that is also the reason for the increase to $40 million in the minority interest add back line item on the income statement, it's up $11 million year over year. And then overall we had a really strong first quarter with diluted EPS of $0.53 versus $0.48 a year ago. And our business unit management team really continue to deliver strong results during this period of transformation and the level of integration activity that's going on across our company.","So turning to cash flow on slide 15, our first quarter adjusted cash flow was an outflow of $300 million. As mentioned at Analyst Day, there are a number of one-time expected payments that we realized in the first quarter. The most notable is the $1.2 billion tax payment we made related to the Adient spin-off. We also had some other items related to Adient's cash outflow for the quarter of $300 million and then we had some restructuring and change control payments of $300 million and transaction, integration and separation costs of a couple of hundred million which would include Adient. So, Q1 has historically been a cash outflow quarter for us. So, the adjusted free cash flow number is consistent with our expectations and we remain focused on delivering the $2.1 billion in adjusted free cash flow for the year.","If we move to the balance sheet at quarter end, we had net debt to cap of 33.6% versus 39.7% at year-end. That's really related to the fact that as part of the Adient spin-out there was a $4 billion reduction in our equity and as a result that drove the increase in the ratio.","Also during the quarter, we completed our previously announced debt exchange offers related to both the legacy JCI and Tyco debt, and we also made $535 million of scheduled debt repayments in the quarter. I would also just point out that beginning in Q2 we commenced a share repurchase program and expect to buy back about $200 million to $250 million of our shares during the rest of fiscal 2017. And again as we've mentioned, this is really focused on countering the dilutive impact of stock option exercises.","And then finally I'd just comment that we continue to evaluate our overall capital structure in order to take advantage of opportunities related to the current interest rate environment as well as the timing of our future debt maturities.","So, if you move to slide 17, just a couple of things I'd like to point out here. We've already talked about Adient being reflected as a discontinued operation. Just as a reminder, beginning in the third quarter of this year, we will be changing our segment reporting for the Buildings business.","At this time, for the first and second quarter, we'll continue to report segments for I would say the legacy BE business in the same four segments we've reported previously. And then Tyco will be reported as a single standalone business within the Buildings set of businesses.","And, as you may recall from Analyst Meeting, when we get to the third quarter, we'll have a Global Products segment. And then, we will have our Installation Project Service business, really our field business in three geographies; North America, Europe, EMEA and Latin America, and Asia.","Also, as we move through fiscal 2017, we'll continue to have some special items and our guidance that we give here today will exclude any the impacts of those special items.","And, lastly, I just wanted to point out that we did end the first quarter, harmonized the backlog definitions between Johnson Controls and Tyco, the primary adjustment related to the way both legacy companies had treated renewable service contracts. And so, the backlog what we're reporting here that's up 6% reflects those new definitions.","Moving to slide 18, which shows the waterfall for our first quarter results, you can see the $0.05 year-over-year EPS improvement. That really comes from cost synergies and productivity savings which drove $0.05, along with volume mix, which is $0.02, both in line with our expectations. In fact, the cost synergies and productivity savings is a couple pennies higher. That was partially offset by planned investments in our Buildings and Power Solutions businesses, which was a $0.02 impact. And then the favorable tax rate was really offset by the FX headwinds we had in the quarter. All-in-all $0.53, which represents a 10% growth over the prior year, and we really are off to a solid start as we move through fiscal 2017.","If I turn to page 19, in fiscal second quarter, you can see here that our organic sales will be up 2% and EPS at $0.48 to $0.50, which is up 7% to 11% year over year. And this reduction in Q2 earnings compared to Q1 earnings sequentially is consistent with the historic patterns of both Johnson Controls and Tyco, and really is the result of the seasonality in our Power Solutions business where our customers go through a strong customer stocking period in the months of October through December.","The waterfall also shows the benefits of synergies and productivity improvements, that does remain at $0.05 through the second quarter. I would tell you that the first quarter synergies and productivity savings were really a lot of the low-hanging fruit that we're able to quickly move on as part of integration activities.","I think as we get the processes and procedures in place here over the next quarter to ringfence both the legacy Tyco business as well as our federal business, I think we'll begin to see the second half ramp up in synergy savings. And then I've got a last slide here that I just wanted to go through relative to the phasing in the first half and second half of our EPS bill.","Just to provide some context around this, you can see that the normal seasonality, it's contributing a lion's share of the improvement in the second half along with the ramp-up and the synergy saves that we expect and as Alex mentioned, we're really running a bit ahead of our first quarter target. So I think that bodes well for us looking at the second half of the year. But all-in-all, we remain very confident in delivering a very strong fiscal 2017 and we reaffirm our full-year guidance of $2.60 to $2.75, which will represent a year-over-year increase of anywhere from 13% to 19%.","So with that, Antonella, we can it open up for questions.","Antonella Franzen - Johnson Controls International Plc","Thanks, Brian. Operator, could you please provide the instructions for the Q&A session and open up the lines?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Thank you. Our first question comes from Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks. Good morning, everyone.","Alex A. Molinaroli - Johnson Controls International Plc","Good morning, Nigel.","Antonella Franzen - Johnson Controls International Plc","Good morning, Nigel.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","So, George, you addressed in your prepared remarks the impact of the heavy industrial declines on the fire and security products. But I'm just curious that the field and product growth divergence is about 6 points this quarter. And it's something we've seen echoed by some of your competitors. I'm just wondering if in addition to that, that pressure from the heavy industrial, whether we're seeing some channel inventory clearance, and any perspective on that would be helpful. And then as it relates to the guidance of 2% to 4% for Buildings this year, just given the first half order trends, and the 1Q performance, are we already looking at the sort of the 2% zone for the full year?","George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc","Nigel, I think the first question was related to the fire and security products within the heavy industrial, high-hazard space?","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","It's more \u2013 just interested in the divergence between field and product trends, and the extent to which we've seen inventory clearance in products.","George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc","Yes, let me start with the field, within fire and security. We have been building and this holds true also for the legacy JCI Building Efficiency business, we've been building orders consistently about 3% or 4% over the last year or so, and that's been building the backlog. And what we're beginning to see is actually the conversion of that backlog within the fire and security space. And so both businesses, both North America and rest of the world up somewhere 2% to 3%, which actually is a reflection of the progress we've made with orders in building the backlog.","Relative to products, products are a shorter, your shorter cycle turn business, and as we've seen our first quarter last year was pretty good within the fire and security space. So now we have a \u2013 the last of our tough compare within the first quarter within fire and security. I believe we've seen the inflection point based on the current trends that we see with the activity that's taking place. A lot of this is being driven by the Middle East. And so the Middle East, when you look at both combined businesses, is down pretty significantly. That's driving both the Middle East field business as well as our product businesses. We've seen some real bright spots here over the quarter with some nice wins and orders coming through. And I think that bodes well here as we project the remainder of the year, both within the industrial refrigeration business, within the legacy BE business, as well as now the flow of our product businesses supporting the heavy industrial, high-hazard end markets within the legacy Tyco product businesses.","We continue to make the investment in our products. So we have not slowed the investments. And I think as the market begins to recover, we're going to be positioned extremely well to be able to capitalize on that recovery.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And then the part on the 2% to 4% for the full year in Buildings, is the high end of that range a stretch at this point?","George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc","So when you look at the orders that we've had and the backlog that we've built, so the orders in the first quarter up about 2%, but the backlog was up 6% year on year, 2% sequentially organically. And so although we're a little bit off what we expected, just recognize that in the first quarter, we only expected modest growth within Buildings in the first quarter. And so we came in a little bit short of that. And we were going to accelerate during the course of the year to be able to deliver on the 2% to 4% organic growth for the year.","Now that being said, now that we're off to a little bit slower start than we expected, that will put pressure to get to the higher end of that organic growth range. But we're still positioned with the orders that we've been able to generate, the backlog that's in place, our ability to be able to get into that range, most likely to the low or to mid end of that range that we provided guidance to back in December.","Alex A. Molinaroli - Johnson Controls International Plc","Nigel, this is Alex. From a Buildings perspective, I probably ham-and-egg this a little bit between myself and George. I would agree with what George said. I think that what we're seeing as the backlog continues to develop, just the sheer math of it would tell you that we're probably going to be at the mid range of that or lower. So, that being offset on the positive is I think the synergies are coming a lot faster than what we expected. So I think as we move forward, I'm just glad we continue to build the backlog. Eventually that's got to flow. But what we do have is we do see the cost coming through at a better pace than what we expected.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, thanks for the color, guys.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks, good morning everyone.","Alex A. Molinaroli - Johnson Controls International Plc","Good morning.","Antonella Franzen - Johnson Controls International Plc","Good morning.","George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc","Good morning, Deane.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Just to follow up on Nigel's question, can we extend that same discussion to the overall core revenue growth guidance for 2017, the 2.5% to 4.5%? I don't think I heard that explicitly reaffirmed, but maybe some color on that.","Brian J. Stief - Johnson Controls International Plc","I think it's probably a bit of a carry-on to what Alex and George said regarding Buildings. I think 2.5% to 4.5% consolidated is very doable for us at this point in time. I think Power Solutions continues to perform extremely well. And if some of the backlog starts to flow in the back half of the year on the Buildings side, I think we're very comfortable at 2.5% to 4.5% as a target we can get.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","That's good to hear. And then on the reference in performance contracting, the government delays, maybe you can expand on that. Is that anything unusual, is it election-related, is it a pause before potential infrastructure spending, just some context around that, please?","Alex A. Molinaroli - Johnson Controls International Plc","So I'll take this because it needs a little bit of a historical context with Johnson Controls to understand. I think we knew this was coming because a year and a half ago, at the end of fiscal 2015 I guess that would have been, what we saw and it had to do with all the budget issues with the federal government is a significant decline in our secured sales in the federal government business. As I think you know or at least you'll again understand is that business flows really over an 18-month period.","So now we're seeing the result of that federal government business that really never came back. It's a new normal of that business, which is a significant part of our performance contracting portfolio, normally secured in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, and that new normal is now what's flowing through our book. So I think if you had the historical context of Johnson Controls, this is the output of the secured sales challenge that was due to the federal government that I think is a new normal, quite frankly. Who knows what the future bodes, but at least over the last year and a half, it's a new normal.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","That's helpful color, thank you.","Operator","Thank you, and our next question comes from Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research Partners.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Alex A. Molinaroli - Johnson Controls International Plc","Hi, Jeff.","Antonella Franzen - Johnson Controls International Plc","Good morning.","George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc","Good morning, Jeff.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Good morning. Hey, I was wondering if you've been able to dig a little bit deeper into the whole border adjusted debate and analysis. Obviously, there's not a lot of import\/export with guys driving around in trucks and the like. So I kind of get that relative to your service business. But what can you share with us on the product side, your import\/export flows and any other frame of reference?","Alex A. Molinaroli - Johnson Controls International Plc","Sure. So there's border adjustment and there's a whole Mexico conversation, and they're related but not completely. And I think we'll have to wait to see how the dust settles. But if you just look \u2013 if we just take as a reference point because I think what most people are using is essentially the House blueprint as a tax policy and a border adjustment. I assume that's your reference point too, Jeff.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Yes, exactly.","Alex A. Molinaroli - Johnson Controls International Plc","If you think of it that way, we've modeled it, what the impact would be of, say, the 20% tax rate and a border adjustment. It's neutral to us if you look at the overall effect, because we are a net importer, mostly because of our battery business. But it's complicated because our supply chain, we take core batteries into Mexico. We manufacture batteries for the Mexico market and for the U.S. market. We bring batteries back into the U.S., and then we finish them in the U.S. And so when you look at our total cost in our value chain, it's a very complicated equation, and we really don't know the details of the tax plan. But the best we can tell when we do our own modeling, we're net neutral on this.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Great. And I was wondering also, we're all just sorting out, new company, new guidance, there's a lot of things moving around. Looking forward now into the back half and what you gave us, I just went back and looked at Q3 last year for both JCI and Tyco, and it was clearly the strongest organic quarter of the year for both companies, in the scope of what could be a recovering market, maybe not something to be overly concerned about. But as we try to get our models straight here, is there anything we should be thinking about as we lay that second half together off the second quarter guide that you gave us?","Alex A. Molinaroli - Johnson Controls International Plc","I don't know that we could give you much more in the quarter-to-quarter, but I don't see anything that's unusual this year versus last year. I think what for us at legacy Johnson Controls in particular, as we saw the models that were put together for the second quarter and we knew internally that we were going to have growth, but that we understood our seasonality, and we think a lot of folks didn't really understand our seasonality on the second quarter. So for us, the second quarter that we're giving is not a surprise and the back end is also not a surprise. I just think that this is a learning process that's going on between us and a lot of the folks that are following us that don't really understand the seasonality of the battery business.","The battery business is fairly predictable. There are some quarter-to-quarter lead adjustments, but overall it's fairly predictable. And I think if you look at the back half of the year with our backlog and then if you also think about it from the historical perspective, I think we feel relatively comfortable and that's why we put that slide in that showed both the synergy costs and the back-end flow of the business. George, you may have a perspective on the Tyco side.","George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc","I would say, Jeff, that within the Tyco portfolio, I think we start to see better compares as it relates to the heavy industrial, high-hazard end markets. Recognize that within our products business those markets represent about 30% of our volume and revenue. And so I think we start to see a better compare there, the field businesses are executing well with the continued order growth and the backlog growth that we're seeing.","That's going to play out here I think well as we now project the second half of the year. We typically have a seasonal decline in the second quarter, is typically the slowest quarter because of the install segment of our business and then it becomes very strong \u2013 it strengthens in the third and fourth quarter. So I don't see anything unusual except for that I believe that we're seeing an inflection within some of the key end markets that we serve.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","And now one just quick one for Brian, maybe, Corporate in the quarter is clearly run rating lower than the annual guide, I have seen some of that flexes up on higher sales and the like. But how are you thinking about Corporate for the year relative to that $480 million to $500 million guide that you gave us in December?","Brian J. Stief - Johnson Controls International Plc","Yes, pretty consistent. I don't think \u2013 we did have some synergies that came out at $15 million reduction in the quarter related some to cost synergies that were permanent takeouts. There was some expense deferral that will probably come back and end up in the second quarter for us. So, I would necessarily go with that $108 million x4, I do think there's probably a slight build in Corporate expenses into the second quarter, so the range we gave before is pretty reasonable still.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Great, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Shannon O'Callaghan with UBS.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","Good morning.","Antonella Franzen - Johnson Controls International Plc","Good morning, Shannon.","Alex A. Molinaroli - Johnson Controls International Plc","Hi, Shannon.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","Hey, Alex, you emphasized Asia in the beginning of the call. I mean, the Building Efficiency orders in Asia were down about 3%. Just wondering what your view is in the context of I guess generally staying pretty bullish on Asia?","Alex A. Molinaroli - Johnson Controls International Plc","When I look at Asia, I guess to give you some qualitative. What I see is that the activity is strengthening in Asia. And then if you think about orders being the field part of our business and you think about revenues on the other side, which show up in our \u2013 things like our Hitachi joint venture, we're seeing a mix change too.","So it's not just a projects business, which kind of shows up in our orders. But when you think about our products business, we're going to continue to see strength in things like our VRF products that we've gotten through the Hitachi joint venture. But I think overall, I would expect that we're going to continue \u2013 we will start to see orders build in Asia not \u2013 I mean, that won't be near the pace that we're seeing in Power Solutions because I think we have a unique situation there, but I do think that we're bullish on growth in Asia.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, thanks. And then maybe one along the same line there with the products North America, orders for Building Efficiency up 12%. I mean, that was probably the strongest area that we see in the company. Maybe just a little bit more color by product, and any other flavor there? Thanks.","George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc","We've had some real strong performance here within our residential like commercial business. When you look at our product businesses here, even in the first quarter, our sales were up in those two businesses up 12% organically. Units actually up even further than that, so that's continuing. And we see that coming through strong, as we project the business going forward. We've also seen within the HVAC space some real strong performance in our applied HVAC across the globe, and building off what Alex said about Asia, a lot of that strength is coming through the work that we've done to improve our product as well as expand our channel within Asia.","And so we're seeing some nice pick-up there within the HVAC. As I said we have short term, seeing the pressure with the industrial refrigeration, as it relates to the heavy industrial, high-hazard oil and gas type end markets. But the good news there is that in the quarter, we've seen some nice pick-up in order activity, as well as orders secured. And I think that's going to start to benefit us here as we project the remainder of the year. And so I think in the legacy BE portfolio with the exception of the performance contracting, with the investments that are being made, we're starting to see the pick-up within the product channels. And then within the \u2013 when you look at within the Tyco product businesses, we continue to invest in spite of some of the pressure that's coming through and the end markets that we serve and truly believe that we're at an inflection point, we'll start to see the progress here over the remainder of the year.","Alex A. Molinaroli - Johnson Controls International Plc","I think I'm going to take the opportunity to talk about this performance contracting. It's under pressure because of some of the end markets, but one of the things that is going to be important for us as we go forward we'll talk about the branch businesses that pull through products. So, whether it's our applied businesses or our controls business, then of course, what's happening in products.","The performance contracting business is a separate business unto itself and so as we compare ourselves whether we're gaining share or losing share, if you look at both the applied and the unitary products, we feel very good about investments we've made and we're seeing share gains. And so that's one of the reasons why we want to separate out because it bodes well for our future. We should see it both from the field side and get leverage at the factory.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Gautam Khanna with Cowen and Company.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC","Thank you, good morning.","Alex A. Molinaroli - Johnson Controls International Plc","Good morning.","Antonella Franzen - Johnson Controls International Plc","Good morning, Gautam.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC","Just to follow up on a couple of those questions, so could you first remind us of the size of the performance contracting business as well as industrial refrigeration and maybe what that 20% sales decline meant in terms of absolute dollar decline in the quarter?","Brian J. Stief - Johnson Controls International Plc","The performance contracting business is roughly $500 million on an annual basis and industrial refrigeration is probably $400 million to $500 million.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC","Okay. And so going forward, given the orders that picked-up at least on the industrial refrigeration side, what are you expecting the full year to be down and what do you think it's going to be net in 2017? Between those two?","George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc","Yeah. Gautam, I mean, I think it's a little bit too early to see what's going to happen here. I think what we've been doing is to try to mitigate the risk that we've seen with the softness that we've experienced, and we've been sizing the business appropriately to be able to execute on the plan. Now, that being said, with the pick-up in orders that gives us some confidence now that with the actions that are being taken that we're going to be positioned to deliver like I said on the guidance that we provided from an organic standpoint going forward. And, hopefully we'll be able to accelerate some of these orders so we can convert within the calendar year. But I think at this stage it's hard to forecast what ultimately the overall impact will be for the year.","Alex A. Molinaroli - Johnson Controls International Plc","Yeah. I guess the qualitative, I'd say the performance contracting will remain under pressure for the year. Industrial refrigeration, we've got some good order growth. And so, if we can get the conversion on that, it'd probably had less pressure on it. That's a qualitative, but I think that's the way I think about it.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC","Okay. And just to follow up on Jeff's question about tax reform and some of the impacts, does it have any impact on how you go about restructuring and where you go about restructuring? Does this give you any pause on the pace or maybe the nature of some of the plans you laid out at the Investor Day?","Alex A. Molinaroli - Johnson Controls International Plc","No, I don't think it impacts us from that perspective at all. I think the only kind of pause it would give is if you making an investment in plant and equipment, you probably have a new formula, which you don't really know what that is yet. But, it really doesn't affect the plans that we have in place when you think about our synergy efforts and our productivity efforts.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC","Thank you very much, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi, good morning.","Alex A. Molinaroli - Johnson Controls International Plc","Good morning.","Antonella Franzen - Johnson Controls International Plc","Good morning.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","My first question would be around the EBIT margin expansion. That was around, I think, 90 bps year-on-year in the first quarter. You're guiding to only 20 bps to 30 bps of increase in the second. What's behind that sort of 70 bps deceleration in margin improvement?","George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc","I think that really relates primarily to the fact that the Hitachi transaction occurred at the beginning of the first quarter in last fiscal year. And coming out of the box with Hitachi, as you may recall, they had lower margins. And as we look at the first quarter of this year moving into the second quarter of this year, the Hitachi piece of that is really what's driving it.","Because the Hitachi margins, dollar margins and actual margins in the second quarter of last year, obviously, are more comparable to the second quarter of this year than the first quarter was. So I guess a year ago we had Hitachi, just \u2013 we just closed the transaction and we didn't really see any of the cost synergies out of that transaction until we started the second quarter. So that's really the primary driver.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Got it. So in Power, there's nothing strange going on with lead or the cost impact of new capacity or anything in the margins?","Brian J. Stief - Johnson Controls International Plc","When we gave that 90 bps it had lead out. So the number we're using is neutralized for lead.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Understood. And then secondly, just on the adjusted free cash. As you say, the Q1 is often an outflow for sort of legacy JCI. When we're thinking about the path to get to that $2 billion plus number for the year, when do you think we start to see positive sort of adjusted free cash? Is that really a second half issue or you think Q2, you'll start to see an improvement?","Alex A. Molinaroli - Johnson Controls International Plc","It could be some \u2013 certainly there will be improvement in Q2. I don't know if we'll turn fully positive in Q2. It would be plus or minus $100 million probably off breakeven, but as we've seen I think historically in both companies the second half ramp-up is quite significant, and there are a couple specific things that we're looking at to drive throughout the remainder of this year.","I think a lot of the things that have been done at Hitachi to-date have been very focused on cost synergies, and there's an opportunity I think at Hitachi from a trade working capital improvement standpoint, which I think could benefit the second half of the year. And then when we talk about the JCI-Tyco merger as well, I think there's an opportunity as we work through some of the integration activities that we're going to see some improved trade working capital at the combined business.","So I would say those are both probably more back half of the year. And when you take that accompanied with the back-ended synergies and the related cash flow that will come off of that and then look at the legacy two businesses and how they generally had a second half cash performance, I think there's a roadmap to the $2.1 billion target we've got.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Great, thanks and thanks for all the color in the slides.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Steve Winoker with Bernstein.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thanks, good morning, all. I just want to make sure on the growth versus synergy element here. You guys in that $250 million to $300 million synergy target this year, none of that is linked to growth, or is some of that on the cost side, in another words, no large purchases that are volume-related that are on the cost side?","Brian J. Stief - Johnson Controls International Plc","That's all cost.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","But it's not volume-linked cost?","Brian J. Stief - Johnson Controls International Plc","Correct.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. And then secondly, I'd like to dig a little bit more on to the cash side. You've talked about the 10 points of conversion opportunity over time. You just gave us some detail about how the year normally sequences. But, George, from maybe also an operating perspective, when you think about that trade working capital, some of your competitors I know at ASHRAE and others are now maybe perhaps maintaining higher inventory levels to accommodate significant growth, at least in North America. How do you deal with that in what appears to be a pretty heavy trade working capital, capital-intensive business right now?","Alex A. Molinaroli - Johnson Controls International Plc","Let me grab that. I think most of the inventory that you see in that business probably has to do with more seasonality because a lot of that inventory is owned in the channel. So I'm not familiar with what you heard at ASHRAE, but when you look at our \u2013 if you look at Johnson Controls' working capital and our inventory, it's really more of a Power Solutions conversation than it is HVAC, which relates to the differences. And quite frankly, even though our products business is growing significantly, it's not as big a part of our business as it is probably with our peer companies. Our trade working capital, a lot of that sits in our field organization more than it sits in the channels.","But when you think about channels and you think about the product stocking, I don't think that we have seen an inordinate amount of build-up I think a year ago at this time, when we were having a conversation around UPG. We were talking to the channels because we had some product changes, but I don't know that we have anything inordinate now.","George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc","I would say, Steve, just based on the performance that we've seen here, we're turning that pretty quickly. We're producing at a double-digit rate on units. And as you've seen in the UPG channel or our business there, we're up 12% organically year on year, and we're projecting that to continue to be able to outperform the growth of the market. And so I think based on what we've seen, we're efficiently utilizing that inventory, and it's turning pretty well.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. All right, great. And I just want to make sure on the Buildings side, it sounds like it is. Thanks.","Alex A. Molinaroli - Johnson Controls International Plc","So just a footnote, we've seen a change in inventory that's half of our sales rate in our UPG business. So to George's point, it's turning quick, or quicker than it was.","Antonella Franzen - Johnson Controls International Plc","Operator, we have time for one more question.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Joshua Pokrzywinski with Buckingham Research Group.","Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Hi, good morning guys. Thanks for taking my question.","Antonella Franzen - Johnson Controls International Plc","Good morning.","Alex A. Molinaroli - Johnson Controls International Plc","Good morning.","Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","On the backlog conversion, which I think is really what you're trying to say, George and Alex, on the underpinnings of the second half acceleration in the Buildings business, how do you think that's trended over the last call it 18 months? It seems like orders have steadily grinded higher in both JCI and legacy Tyco conversion, or I guess the way we've seen organic growth, it had some fits and starts. And some of that is products, which don't really make it into it, some of that is compares. But how much of the second half outlook is really just execution on what you have in the backlog already versus hoping the products business picks up some steam as maybe the channel inventories move around or you get some easier comparisons?","George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc","Let me start by giving you the fundamentals of each of the businesses. If you go back historically, the BE backlog turns anywhere from 9 to 18 months. The Tyco backlog on the installed business is 9 to 12 months. And recognize that every project is unique in how we ultimately go to market and execute on these projects.","Now if you look at the total Buildings business, about 70% of the business is driven by the field orders. And so when you go back historically and do an average based on that backlog and the type of projects that are in the backlog and then project what's going to happen here over the next 9 months, we feel very comfortable with where we are and how those projects are going to convert, that we get into what we ultimately guided towards, which is the 2% to 4% for the total Buildings business because this is a significant piece of that within 2017.","And so at this stage, I think it's all about execution. We're going to see some continued orders come in that are quicker turn to supplement that backlog. But it's fairly predictable at this stage where we are through the year and ultimately what we expect here over the next three quarters.","Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","So it sounds like \u2013 not to put words in your mouth, George, but yes, the products business either accelerates or doesn't. And you're talking about maybe 0.5 point of variance, not a point or even multiple points, just given the relative sizing.","George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc","Correct. On a flow basis on the products side, as you know, we're continuing to expand our channels across both sets of businesses. That's helping us being able to accelerate the product growth. And that combined with the product that we support our internal channel with sets us up here fairly nicely for the next three quarters and continuing to accelerate the overall growth that we're going to achieve and deliver on the guidance that we provided.","Alex A. Molinaroli - Johnson Controls International Plc","Think of it as one piece of color on that legacy BE business. I think when we look at it internally, the law of large numbers. When we go into a fiscal year because of the turn rate, and you can do this math yourself, we're about 40% confident. About 40% of what we're going to get in a year is already in our backlog. Obviously, as the year goes on, that percentage goes up. So with 40% at the beginning of the year, you can kind of do your math. And so you can see as we go later in the year, as George was saying, we gain more and more confidence or not because it's either in the backlog or it's not. And so hopefully that makes sense but that kind of the 40% number walking into the year is from legacy BE when you look at our flow rates is how the math works.","Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Got it.","Antonella Franzen - Johnson Controls International Plc","Alex, any other final comments before we end the call?","Alex A. Molinaroli - Johnson Controls International Plc","Yes, I'd just like to finish the call and once again just thank our employees. The amount of change is incredible and I think we've moved past talking about Adient and the spin. I'm just proud of what we accomplished there but as we run these two companies together, it's \u2013 what I feel good about is the momentum that we're gaining around that something, George putting in place around organizational structure while getting the Buildings business organized and as it gets organized, we're going to be able to not only see cost synergies but be able to fulfill the promise of the merger. And so I want to thank our employees for a great quarter and we're confident about the year, I hope that comes true in this call, it just a lot of work for us to do. But I'm confident we've got the right team doing it. So thanks a lot, have a great day.","Antonella Franzen - Johnson Controls International Plc","Thanks, Alex. And thanks, everyone, for joining.

If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time.","I will turn the call over to Antonella Franzen, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Antonella Franzen","Good morning and thank you for joining our conference call to discuss Johnson Controls first quarter fiscal 2018 results. The press release and all related tables issued earlier this morning as well as the conference call slide presentation can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website at johnsoncontrols.com.","With me today are Johnson Controls Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, George Oliver and our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Brian Stief.","Before we begin, I would like to remind you that during the course of today\u2019s call, we will be providing certain forward-looking information. We ask that you review today\u2019s press release and read through the forward-looking cautionary informational statements that we have included there. In addition, we will use certain non-GAAP measures in our discussions and we ask that you read through the sections of our press release that address the use of these items. In discussing our results during the call, references to adjusted EBITA and adjusted EBIT margins exclude restructuring and integration costs as well as other special items. These metrics are non-GAAP measures and are reconciled in the schedules attached to our press release.","GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to Johnson Controls ordinary shareholders was $0.25 for the quarter and included a net charge of $0.29 related to special items. These special items primarily relate to restructuring and impairment cost as well as the net impact from U.S. tax reform partially offset by the gain on sale from the Scott Safety divestiture which closed early in the quarter. Adjusting for these special items, non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.54 compared to $0.53 in the prior year quarter.","Now, let me turn the call over to George.","George Oliver","Thanks, Antonella and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us on today\u2019s call. I thought I would start today by providing you with an update on the progress we have made with respect to some of the strategic priorities I laid out for you last quarter.","Beginning on Slide 3, first we made some additional changes to our Board in the quarter. At our most recent Board meeting in December, we formally welcomed our newest director, John Young who currently serves as Group President of Pfizer Innovative Health. Additionally, we announced the retirement of two longstanding board members effective as of the upcoming Annual Shareholders Meeting in early March. On behalf of my fellow board members and the executive management team, I would like to personally thank Natalie Black and David Abney for their many years of dedicated service to Johnson Controls and wish them all the best. We also nominated two new board members Gretchen Haggerty who served as CFO of U.S. Steel before retiring in 2013 and Simone Menne who served most recently as CFO at Boehringer Ingelheim and as CFO of Lufthansa prior to that. Both nominees bring decades of senior leadership experience and a deep financial acumen. I look forward to their joining the board and to leveraging their expertise in the coming years.","As we mentioned last quarter, we expected the Compensation Committee to make a number of changes to executive incentive plans in an effort to more closely align with shareholder expectations. Those changes have been made in beginning in fiscal year 2018 executive\u2019s annual incentive compensation plans are tied to three key performance metrics: organic revenue growth, EBIT growth, and free cash flow conversion. We are off to a strong start on our initiative to increase sales capacity. Net of attrition, we added 180 new sales team members during the quarter and we are well on our way to reaching our target for the year of 400 net adds. Although we are still in the early stages as it relates to the changes we are making across the sales organization within buildings, I am very encouraged by the results we are seeing so far. We are also beginning to see the initial benefits of driving improved gross margins in backlog. Our field teams are more disciplined on pricing new projects and more focused on driving stronger service growth. As a result, we are improving our booked margin rate on new orders as well as accelerating service growth which will help alleviate some of the margin pressure in the field organization as the year progresses.","We saw solid organic top line growth across the buildings platform which grew 4% organically in the quarter, admittedly on our easiest comparison of the year. But the underlying trends across each of our businesses are promising and should provide us some momentum as we go forward. I am very encouraged on the progress we have made in expanding our services. We have been adding both sales and technician capacity and it is beginning to pay off with service growth accelerating to 3%. Next, we have implemented our internal cash management office and the team is actively engaged with the business units as well as external advisors in an effort to improve cash generation and management. I have made this our top priority for the company in fiscal 2018 and we have the right team in place to deliver.","As I mentioned last quarter we will continue to look at the portfolio ensuring we are allocating resources in areas where we can generate the highest returns and divesting businesses that are non-core. Lastly, I wanted to highlight a number of truly innovative new products recently launched. As I have been communicating with many of you over the last six plus months, Johnson Controls entered into a significant product development base roughly 3 years ago. And we are beginning to see some of the fruits of our labor here on Slide 4. I want to spend time on each one of these, but I do want to call your attention to the breath of product categories across building technologies launched within the quarter over the last few weeks. We have a steady pace of product launches planned for 2018 across the buildings portfolio with expanded AGM battery offerings within power solutions.","Turning to Slide 5, I do want to spend a minute highlighting our new York YZ centrifugal chiller which was launched in early January. The YZ represents a significant milestone in our product development journey. It will become the new flagship in our chiller portfolio. Our engineers have spent the past 3 years analyzing, designing and optimizing each component. Turn it around the next gen low GWP refrigerant to create the highest efficiency centrifugal chiller on the market today. With it\u2019s mag bearing driveline, variable speed drive and our OptiView control panel we have created what will be the new industry standard when it comes to reliability, energy saving and service capabilities.","I have the opportunity to spend some time with key customers and distributors at the AHR Expo in Chicago last week. And I can tell you the feedback was overwhelmingly positive, not just about the YZ, but for the entire HVAC and controls products suite. I am extremely proud of the work our engineering and R&D teams are doing around the globe. And I am confident we are investing in the technologies and channels necessary to accelerate top line growth over time.","Let\u2019s turn to Slide 6, the macroeconomic environment remains generally favorable across most of our key geographic regions supported by rising global GDPs. North American non-residential construction markets are growing steadily, led by the institutional vertical. Global demand for our commercial HVAC and controls products is strong, highlighted by recent strength in Asia, the Middle East and North America. The sustained rebound in oil prices is helping to ease budget constraints. It even released some large infrastructure projects, especially in the Middle East and is also driving demand for our fire protection and suppression products that served the harsh and hazardous end markets.","China remains one of the fastest growth regions, although pricing remains competitive, particularly in HVAC. We remain focused upon developing innovative new products and expanding our channel presence and we are gaining share as a result. In Power, we continue to see increased adoption of our start-stop technologies globally and are well-positioned to address the increased electrification in vehicles. OE production is a soft spot, particularly in the U.S. and Europe and we would anticipate that to continue in the near-term. That said we are fully committed to serving our customers and channel partners worldwide and our technology capabilities enable us to consistently outperform the market. Overall, I would say the economic landscape is supportive of continued order and revenue growth momentum throughout fiscal 2018.","Moving to Slide 7, field orders accelerated in the quarter to 5% year-over-year organically compared to the low single-digit average we experienced in fiscal 2017. Underlying order strength was broad-based across the three regions as well as all domains, including installation and service. Brian will provide more color by segment in just a few minutes.","Turning now to Slide 8, let me recap the results for the quarter. Sales of $7.4 billion increased 5% on a reported basis in the quarter and 3% organically led by strong performance across our building platform. As expected, adjusted EBIT of $748 million declined 1% as the impact from the Scott Safety divestiture and anticipated headwinds from lower gross margins and incremental investments more than offset cost synergy and productivity realization. EBIT margins declined 60 basis points year-over-year on a reported basis or 30 basis points excluding the impact of the Scott Safety divestiture, FX and lead. Despite the anticipated margin pressure in the quarter, we were able to deliver modest earnings growth of 2% year-over-year to $0.54. Adjusted free cash was an outflow of roughly $300 million, which is typical of our first quarter and in line with our expectations.","Turning to our EPS bridge on Slide 9, you can see synergy and productivity savings adding $0.05 to the prior year. Volume and mix added an additional $0.05 driven by solid growth across buildings and a mixed benefit in Power Solutions. The cumulative benefit of synergies and volume mix was mostly offset by expected gross margin pressure and incremental investments we discussed on our last call. Overall, this resulted in $0.54 in adjusted EPS for the quarter.","With that, I will turn it over to Brian to discuss the performance within the segments.","Brian Stief","Thanks, George and good morning, everyone. Starting on Slide 10, we provided the breakdown of our buildings business, which is the same pie chart that we provided you last quarter when we thought this would be a useful reference point for you as we talk through our segment results.","So, let\u2019s move to Slide 11 and get into the details with a look at the performance of buildings on a consolidated basis. And I would just say as you will see as I go through the results here the Q1 headwinds, we talked about on our Q4 call came through pretty much as we expected and we see good momentum building as we move into Q2. Total building sales in the quarter of $5.3 billion increased 2% year-over-year and 4% organically with products growth in mid single-digits and field growth in the low single-digit range. Buildings consolidated EBITDA of $559 million declined 3%, but keep in mind the prior year included the results of Scott Safety. Buildings EBITDA margin decreased 60 basis points versus the prior year to 10.5%, but again, this includes a 40 basis point headwind from the Scott Safety divestiture. So, on a normalized basis, EBITDA margin declined 20 basis points as we expected. You can see in the margin waterfall that the combined benefit of 130 basis points from cost synergy and productivity save as well as volume leverage was more than offset by 150 basis points of headwind from conversion of lower margin backlog, price cost pressure and the incremental investments in product and sales capacity, all generally in line with the Q1 expectations we set for you last quarter. Looking to Q2 we do anticipate these headwinds will continue. However, these pressures should begin to abate sequentially as we move throughout the year. As George mentioned total field orders increased by very strong 5% including improved margins with backlog up 4% year-over-year to $8.1 billion.","Now in order to provide more transparency on each of our reportable segments within buildings let\u2019s review each segment\u2019s individual results. So moving to Slide 12 Building Solutions North America, their sales grew 3% organically to $2 billion, led by high single-digit growth in our commercial HVAC and controls businesses and mid single-digit growth in our solutions businesses, fire and security field revenues declined modestly in the quarter. North America adjusted EBITA of $236 million was flat on a year-over-year basis and EBITA margin declined 50 basis points to 11.7% as an 80 basis point headwind from lower margin backlog conversion and a headwind from sales force additions more than offset the benefits of synergies and productivity and volume leverage. Orders in North America increased a solid 4%. During the quarter we saw strong order intake, led by our conventional HVAC business, integrated security and retail primarily driven by higher installation activity. Our solutions business which as you know was primarily performance contracting also had strong order growth, but this was against an easy prior year compare. Given the underlying trends in North America and our opportunity pipeline, we expect to see continued solid order growth in Q2. Backlog at the end of Q1 was $5.3 billion, which was up 4%.","So let\u2019s move to Slide 13 in EMEA\/LA. Sales of $915 million increased 4% organically with solid performance in installing service across our three primary regions. Europe grew modestly in the quarter across fire and security and controls and in the Middle East we saw solid demand for commercial HVAC projects. Latin America experienced broad based strength across fire and security, HVAC and controls. Adjusted EBITA of $71 million grew 9% and EBITA margin expanded 40 basis points to 7.8%, primarily driven by cost synergies and productivity as well as modest volume leverage. Orders in EMEA\/LA increased to strong 6%, led by growth in Continental Europe and the Middle East with backlog increasing 1% to $1.4 billion.","Moving to APAC on Slide 14, sales of $597 million in the quarter increased 2% organically, primarily due to higher service activity versus the prior year. Adjusted EBITA of $74 million increased 3% and adjusted EBIT margin declined 10 basis points, but this includes a 30 basis point headwind related to foreign currency. The underlying margin increased to 20 basis points reflect savings from cost synergies and productivity as well some modest volume leverage. One item that I would like to point out is that pricing does remain very competitive in China and did negatively impact margins in the quarter. We do expect continued pricing pressure in our China field businesses as we look into Q2, but we are going to work to offset that headwind with cost actions. Asia-Pacific orders increased 9% driven by strong growth in China, Northeast Asia and India including a solid increase in service bookings with our backlog increasing 11% to $1.4 billion.","Now let\u2019s turn to global products on Slide 15 and again sales increased a strong 6% organically to $1.8 billion with mid single-digit growth across HVAC and refrigeration equipment, building management and specialty products. In HVAC and refrigeration equipment, our applied HVAC business grew in the mid single-digit range, with strong shipment growth across all geographies for both large and small tonnage chillers. Another bright spot that I would like to point out is our VRF business in Asia, where we saw mid single-digit organic growth in the quarter. And the other thing I would also point out would be that our unconsolidated Hitachi joint ventures in China also saw strong double-digit growth in the quarter.","Moving to resi and light commercial HVAC equipment, we saw low single-digit growth versus the tough compare in the prior year. Mid single-digit growth in building management and specialty products was driven primarily by growth in buildings controls and fire and security products led by increased demand for special hazards and fire detection equipment. Segment EBITA of $178 million declined 13%, but remember this reflects the impact of the Scott Safety divestiture. The reported segment EBITA margin declined 140 basis points, but again 110 basis points of that decline was attributable to Scott Safety. So, the underlying segment margin and products declined 30 basis points to 10% as the benefit of cost synergies and productivity and volume leverage was offset by about 100 basis points related to incremental product investments and 160 basis points related to price cost pressure.","So, let\u2019s turn to Power Solutions on Slide 16. Our solution sales of $2.1 billion grew 1% organically as favorable price mix was offset by decline in unit volumes. Global battery shipments declined roughly 2% with declines in both OE and aftermarket. The 1% decline in OE was actually slightly less than declines in the overall auto production. Shipments to the aftermarket channel declined 2% on a tough prior year compare, the warmer weather we experienced during the quarter and a bit of pull forward of demand that we saw in the fourth quarter of last year. Once again, the China market was a highlight with units up 20%, with strong growth in both OE and aftermarket channels. Global shipments of start-stop batteries increased 20% with another quarter of strong growth in the Americas and China and we saw EMEA start-stop up 3%.","Segment EBITA of $384 million declined 2% with margins declining 250 basis points to 18%, but this includes a 150 basis point impact of FX and the higher led prices. Power\u2019s underlying margin declined 100 basis points as favorable mix and productivity savings were more than offset by planned product investments and startup and launch costs and increased transportation costs and logistic costs were a bit higher than we expected in Q1. We are definitely seeing higher freight costs, particularly in the U.S. and Mexico as well as higher fuel costs and unfavorable lane mix due in part to the ongoing impact of the hurricanes.","Turning to Slide 17 quickly corporate expense, we moved down 6% year-over-year to $101 million and we continue to target a range of $425 million to $440 million for the entire year.","So, let\u2019s move to Slide 18 and free cash flow. Reported free cash was an outflow of just under $400 million in the quarter, which is in line with normal seasonal patterns and consistent with our plan on expectations. Excluding about $100 million of integration cost, adjusted free cash was an outflow of $300 million. As expected, we received $200 million tax refund in the quarter and this was offset by the $200 million in tax planning payments that we talked about in our fourth quarter call. As George mentioned, the focus on improving cash flow is our company\u2019s top priority and I am working closely with the newly established cash management office as well as our external advisors. In Q1, we have created a free cash flow roadmap and identified specific actions with clear accountability that will improve trade working capital and drive higher free cash flow conversion as we move through the year. For 2018, we are on track to deliver 80% plus adjusted free cash flow conversion excluding the net one-time items that we communicated to you last quarter.","Turning the balance sheet on Slide 19, net debt of $11.9 billion is down $1.3 billion sequentially versus the end of fiscal \u201817. Of course the biggest driver of this decline was the $1.9 billion pay down of the TSarl debt using the net cash proceeds from the Scott transaction. In addition we repaid nearly $500 million of debt in Q1. In early December given the positive rate environment we issued 750 million in euro debt with an effective interest rate of essentially 0% for a term of 3 years. We use these proceeds to fund recent maturities as well as the term-outs in commercial paper. In the quarter we also purchased 3.6 million shares for a total of $150 million and our outlook for the remainder of fiscal \u201818 still assumes buybacks to offset dilution.","Finally I wanted to spend a few minutes on U.S. tax reform on Slide 20 which I know is of interest to everyone. During the quarter we took a provisional net charge of $200 million which reflects our initial estimate of the impact of tax reform in fiscal \u201818. This includes a one-time non-cash tax benefit of $100 million related to the re-measurement of our net U.S. deferred tax liabilities and we also took a one-time $300 million tax charge for a preliminary estimate of taxes on unremitted foreign earnings. As you all know the cash taxes on the foreign earnings component is very manageable for us and will be funded over an 8-year period. Given the significance and complexity of U.S. tax reform, we continue to analyze all aspects of the new legislation and may adjust this one-time charge as necessary over the course of the year. With respect to our effective tax rate there will be no change to our 14% rate this year. We do anticipate our fiscal \u201819 tax rate to increase to a range of 16% to 18% based upon the effective dates of certain provisions of the new legislation. As always we will continue to evaluate tax filing opportunities as we move forward.","With that, let me turn it over to George.","George Oliver","Thanks Brian. Before we open up the lines for questions, I wanted to reiterate that fiscal 2018 will be a year of change. We are intensely focused on driving execution to deliver our adjusted EPS in the range of $2.75 to $2.85, which represents a 6% to 10% increase in earnings per share versus fiscal year 2017. As I mentioned on our last call consistent with prior years, we expect our earnings per share to be stronger in the second half of the year due to the normal seasonality of our businesses, the pace and timing of investment as well as price cost and gross margin headwinds, all of which are heavier in the first half. Based on our current outlook, we would expect EPS to be weighted roughly 38% in the first half and 52% in the second half compared to our normal 40-60 split.","As I think about the second half ramp, we are going to focus on controlling what we can control. Although I feel good about the underlying momentum we are seeing in the top line, organic growth begins to decelerate, you should expect that we will dial back the pace of investments. Cost synergies are on track and it will give us about $0.03 more earnings in the back half than in the first half. Price cost headwinds should begin to flatten out as some of our more recent price increases begin to take effect. We feel good about our price realization so far, but obviously Asia and China specifically are still tough.","And we are taking additional productivity actions to help offset some of the areas we are seeing pressure. Our guide assumes price gets better, so that is one area we will have to watch. I am encouraged by the margin improvement we are seeing in backlog, the traction we are seeing on sales capacity and by the acceleration we are seeing in higher margin service and product sales. Ultimately, we are committed to delivering on profitability as we continue to manage our way through the integration and focus on reinvesting for growth. We have made the structural changes necessary to help ensure that the focus on execution is felt deep into the organization.","With that, let me turn it over to our operator to open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Deane Dray from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Deane Dray","Thank you. Good morning everyone.","Antonella Franzen","Good morning Deane.","George Oliver","Good morning.","Deane Dray","Hey, just speaking of the year of change, I would like the revamp slide deck, lots of good color and especially like the bridges that are included so I appreciate that.","George Oliver","Thanks Deane.","Deane Dray","So first question, George, I was hoping you could expand on the strategic focus to improve to serve margins \u2013 secure margins in buildings and I can\u2019t help, but think that this sounds a bit like project selectivity and maybe there are some parallels there, but what are the initiatives and then for the 5% increase in orders this quarter, what\u2019s that margin improvement over the implied margin?","George Oliver","Sure. Let me start Deane by saying that when I took over I setup a sales leadership team that I ultimately cheer. And we have been meeting monthly making sure that we are executing on the commitments we have made to not only put the capacity in place from a sales force point standpoint, but to be able to execute on improved margins and ultimately deliver on the organic growth. We are making a tremendous amount of progress with this team and so not only have we been able to add 180 heads in the quarter that was in addition to the 50 that we added in the fourth quarter. But strategically now as we are now segmenting our markets, understanding how we are deploying that capacity to be able to go after where growth is occurring and making sure that from a pricing standpoint we are staying disciplined with the projects that we are taking on. And so that said, we have seen significant improvement not only in the pipeline generation, but how that\u2019s converting to orders and then how that\u2019s going now set us up to accelerate organic growth through the remainder of the year. When you look at the book margins in the quarter, we booked margins, so the margin in backlog now is up 30 basis points. And so you can imagine, we booked margins much better than that in the quarter that brought the average up about 30 basis points. So I am feeling really good working with the sales team and how we are going about deploying the resource that we are putting into place, the productivity we are getting from those resources, the book margins that we are securing, the service growth that we are accelerating and that all will then translate into not only improved growth in the second half, but also from a margin perspective much higher margins.","Deane Dray","So is there bit of this project selectivity playbook that you are running?","George Oliver","So Deane, the project selectivity is making sure that from a resource standpoint as we are understanding the markets and the opportunities that we have in the markets that we are deploying our resources where we can accelerate and we can ultimately get the returns for the resource that we are putting into these projects and that we are beginning to execute. So certainly from a discipline standpoint, we have implemented the discipline to make sure that as we are planning these projects, we are planning them in a way that positions us to be able to get the appropriate returns. And so whether it would be project selectivity or just pure discipline and how we deploy our resources and setting expectations for the type of margins that we expect by executing on these projects that\u2019s ultimately what we are doing.","Deane Dray","Got it. And then just as a follow-up question and this may just be competitive sniping with the second coming of ADT, but there has been some claims about taking share in light commercial and correct me if I am wrong, but non-competes all came off in 2014 and that really shouldn\u2019t be anything new going on here, but would be interested in your perspective?","George Oliver","I would reinforce what you said Deane. Our security business is executing extremely well in North America. We are continuing to grow. We are continuing to execute on the margins and ultimately delivering on performance. And so as you said, the non-compete went away back in 2014. Certainly, we respect our competitors, but as what we are seeing now, we are continuing to execute on our business, continuing to grow and continuing to maintain and grow the margins.","Deane Dray","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research. Your line is now open.","Jeff Sprague","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","George Oliver","Good morning Jeff.","Jeff Sprague","George, just back to thinking about how all those kind of plays out in margins. When you say margin is up and backlog up 30 basis points, that\u2019s up relative to what it I guess was last quarter, is it tracking up relative to what you are reporting here today and can you give us some context on that?","George Oliver","Yes, absolutely Jeff. In the first quarter, when we look at \u2013 let me just go back and reframe what the problem was when we gave guidance back in November. We had when we looked at our North America backlog we have 75 basis points of pressure in about a $5 billion business. And so we had projected that there was going to be roughly about $40 million of pressure that was going to play out through the course of the year and we are going to have to offset that with productivity and other initiatives so that we would be positioned to deliver on the commitments we made. So, we have seen about $16 million of that pressure in the first quarter. And so the remainder of that will play out a little bit less in the second quarter and then less in the third and fourth quarter. And I would tell you with what we have been booking, we had an improvement of about 70 basis points, maybe a little bit better in the quarter. And so the work \u2013 the projects that are going into backlog as we project how they will play out the remainder of the year and beyond we will start to see improved gross margins. And so I am projecting here in the second quarter, our margins will be relatively flat in buildings with the work that we have done realizing that in addition to the backlog that\u2019s converting with the pressure, we also have price cost that we have experienced here in the first quarter, little bit more in the second quarter \u2013 little bit less in the second quarter and then we start to see it turned positive in the second half. So, the combined \u2013 those combined topics as we are now executing we are now seeing the margins flat and then you will start to see them improve in the second half.","Jeff Sprague","And then thinking about the sales force growth and initiative, how long does that remain a headwind, how long does it take for lack of a better term for a new salesman to carry his weight so to speak and be accretive to the equation?","George Oliver","Yes, what I would say Jeff, it varies depending on what business you are in and whether it be large installed project type business or whether it be service \u2013 transactional service business, but you could say that when we estimated the year, we said we are going to have about $15 million to $20 million of potential pressure for what I would say while we are adding the sales capacity, we would have less productivity per head with that new capacity. What I would tell you is that the way we are bringing them on board, we have been very process driven in training, getting them educated and trained so that they can hit the ground running. So, there is still going to be that pressure, but I have confidence with the folks that we have brought on here not only in the fourth quarter, first quarter, we are making really good progress in how we are deploying that capacity and making them productive through the course of the year. So, you can average it probably takes around 6 months \u2013 3 to 6 months depending on the type of business, but I am encouraged \u2013 I am extremely encouraged by the progress we are making and what we can expect here going forward.","Jeff Sprague","And then just one last one for me, so you did do some share repo in the quarter, should we assume you are chipping away at repo or kind of given your leverage you are kind of on hold until the cash flow comes in later the year end or there is some asset sales or something else going on?","Brian Stief","Yes, Jeff, this quarter $100 million that we did in the month of October and the thought is roughly $50 million a quarter for the remainder of the year, which is essentially offsetting option dilution. So, I don\u2019t think at this point in time we are looking at any incremental share repurchase above and beyond that.","Jeff Sprague","Right, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steven Winoker from UBS. Your line is now open.","Steven Winoker","Hey, thanks and good morning all.","George Oliver","Hi Steve.","Steven Winoker","Hey, just wonder on the cash side, I know you did referenced it in your prepared remarks, but a couple of things, one, when did the conversion addition to comp start to really hit the ground for management sales force etcetera? And then secondly we are not the sales force, sorry about the broader teams and then secondly maybe just talk about that cash management offers and I know this is a seasonally normal cash outflow, but maybe get into sort of the biggest drivers of that and that we might expect to see the improvement in over the next year?","George Oliver","Steve, I will take the first part of the question and then I will turn it over to Brian on the cash management office. Relative to the incentives as we went through the succession with myself becoming Chairman and CEO, certainly there was a lot of focus on incentive compensation here, our executive compensation within the company. And as we are putting the plan together for 2018 that was certainly something was front and center with our \u2013 with our Board. And so we work through that very quickly, so that when we launched our incentives with our executive team and then had similar components that are embedded in the executive leadership incentive that now are pushed out into sales incentives and operational incentives, that all was done at the beginning of the year. So we wanted to be positioned, so we could hit the ground running. The right metrics were in place, the right incentives were in place, so that we could make sure that we execute on the commitments we made for the year. Now Brian, you might want to talk a little bit more about the cash management office.","Brian Stief","Yes. And we set up during the quarter that the cash management office, which is really a combination of roughly 8 to 10 people internally and then we have got an outside advisor that\u2019s working with us on this effort. I would just comment that we took one of our top finance people, the CFO of our buildings business and have put him in charge of the cash management office, which is I think reflective of the importance that we are placing on making sure that we deliver on the free cash flow conversion commitments we have got. As far as Q1 and why Q1 tends to be a bit of a cash outflow quarter for us I think I would focus on a couple of things. First of all, as it relates to the fourth quarter, there is a huge push in Q4 and that tends to be our best cash flow quarter. And so there is a little bit of I would say pull forward maybe in Q4 from Q1. Secondly, I would say our lowest income quarter tends to generally be the first or second quarter as well. And then there is some timing of working capital that I put in the equation as well and then we do pay our bonuses out and the first quarter of each year as well. So those are probably some of the items that really drive some of the timing Steve. But I think it tends to be an outflow in Q1 and inflow in Q2 and then Q3 and Q4 tend to be our strongest quarters.","Steven Winoker","Okay. And then George, I see all the start-stop growth that you are mentioning in power, can you maybe comment on the progress of those factor investments in AGM, how are \u2013 where we are in the ramp on those. And then I guess just one last one maybe Brian also I understand that tax \u2013 you are going through portfolio review together, but any of the tax legislation changes with regard to asset sales 338 H10 elections changed the view of tax leakage across the portfolio, does it give you more options?","George Oliver","Yes. So let me \u2013 starting with the AGM, like we said we are up about 20% year-on-year and that\u2019s really of a function of very strong penetration in Europe and that continues. And we have \u2013 we are kind of in line with the market. We are picking up a little bit of share. And then if you look at where the investments are being made it\u2019s mainly in China as well as North America. So we are executing well on putting that investment in place and that\u2019s what\u2019s contributing to the very strong growth that we are getting in China being up, I think it\u2019s up over about 50 \u2013 China was up almost 50% or there abouts and continue to see good progress in North America. And so that is going to be when you look at the mix that\u2019s going to be extremely important for us to continue to execute on those investments and in the volumes from those investments.","Brian Stief","Yes. And as far as the tax rate impact I mean clearly to the extent that any business that we would decide to divest of from a non-core standpoint to the extent of the head U.S. operations of significance, those tax rate reductions certainly would play into that.","Steven Winoker","Thank you.","Antonella Franzen","Thanks.","George Oliver","Thanks Steve.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Tusa from JPMC. Your line is now open.","Steve Tusa","Hi guys, good morning.","Antonella Franzen","Good morning.","Brian Stief","Hi Steve.","George Oliver","Good morning, Steve.","Steve Tusa","So I just wanted to clear, what is the target for your incentive for this year in cash, I think the guide is 80% plus and then $1.3 billion of or up to $1.3 billion of CapEx, I didn\u2019t see kind of an explicit rehalf of that just want to make sure that we were counting for any kind of tweaks there and is it based on conversion or absolute free cash flow?","Brian Stief","It\u2019s the adjusted free cash flow conversion is at 80% plus as we have talked about previously then there is no adjustments above and beyond that we have communicated already that are necessary really for us to talk about here. So the 80% plus is our target.","Steve Tusa","Okay. And the CapEx guide?","Brian Stief","CapEx $1.3 for the year, there is a little timing in the quarter, but still $1.3 for the year Steve.","Steve Tusa","Okay. And then just following up on I think it was Dean\u2019s question on the security side. I mean you said that your security business is holding up in North America, I think the field business fire and surety field was a modest decline. Does that mean kind of fire was down and security is growing maybe you could just give us some idea of how kind of that core business did, the security business did in the quarter from a revenue perspective?","Brian Stief","Yes. So, in North America, where we have had a GAAP with our capacity has been fire. And so as we talked about last year having some shortfall of putting the sales capacity in place, a lot of that was in the fire space. That has become a roll forward and why we are seeing. It\u2019s really just a temporary decline within that business. We have been adding capacity both in sales as well as technicians, because the market is very attractive and we are making progress. And so it\u2019s more \u2013 I would say, it\u2019s more of a temporary situation because of the way that we are short on how we are staffing the fire business, but that\u2019s going to \u2013 that will continue to improve now with the work that we have done in the capacity that we are putting in place. The part of the security business I think overall was modest, I mean, year-on-year they a good year first quarter last year and corrupt the low single-digits.","Steve Tusa","This year, this security business?","Brian Stief","Correct.","Steve Tusa","And then one last question on commercial HVAC pricing asking all these guys all the guys\u2019 question, what are your assumptions embedded in for price this year for the business where it\u2019s relevant, I think it\u2019s probably mostly in the products business, yet a tough price cost spread of this quarter. What\u2019s your pricing assumption embedded for commercial HVAC?","Brian Stief","Yes. So, if you look at our price cost pressure, we are in the first quarter, it was about $34 million and a lot of that certainly in HVAC. I am as we put our price increases it\u2019s our beginning of our second quarter, so the beginning of the calendar year. And I know there is a range from 5% to 7% type price increases that are being put into place. I think that that compares similarly with our competitors. Certainly, we are going to be very disciplined with how we execute on these price increases given the pressure that we have had here in the first quarter. Some of the actions have already taken place and so the price pressure, price cost will be better in the second quarter and then as we get into the third and fourth, we believe that we have a positive price cost. And so right now, it\u2019s really all about executing and staying disciplined with all those price increases are going into place, because we are seeing on the opposite side, we are seeing the commodity headwind and is coming through.","Steve Tusa","Yes, I guess I have seen a lot of letters around residential price and I am sorry to prolong this, but I am just trying to get an idea of the magnitude in commercial markets a lot more opaque for everybody and Ingersoll made some positive comments on ability to get price, so it\u2019s carrier, but there is no number that have been around those. I guess are the magnitude of commercial HVAC price increases, I mean, is it low single-digits, is it mid singles hoping to capture low singles, is that TBD like I did just trying to get an idea of the magnitude that you guys are all kind of trying to put out there. Nobody seems to be giving like up are a really good answer?","George Oliver","So Steve, I have been spending a lot of time in the field here over the last couple months and this is been front and center with many of our discussions and I would tell you is probably the range varies depending on market Brian talked about China being a little bit more difficult right now with some of the pricing but on average what I would say is, low to mid probably low to mid-single-digit still getting traction which is certainly part of our ability to be able to now normally improve the projects that we are putting in place and then ultimately however expanding on margin improvement of those projects.","Steve Tusa","Great, color. Thanks a lot for the detail. Appreciate it.","George Oliver","Thanks Steve.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz from Citigroup. Your line is now open.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Hi, good morning, guys.","Brian Stief","Good morning.","Antonella Franzen","Good morning.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Just going back to global products, the 6% organic revenue growth looks like the strong that it\u2019s been in a while, while you mentioned fire security VRS being highlights of the quarter, the former Tyco [indiscernible] business has been a drag in the business for a while, is that really the biggest change in the growth profile of the products business as we sit here today?","George Oliver","What I would say is we have had strength is very broad based. And so as Brian mentioned in his prepared remarks we are seeing it across all of the platforms. So we break it down into HVAC equipment, we break into building manager, which is all of our electronic equipment and we break it into specialty, which is the for a suppression business. And when you look at across the board, it\u2019s broad base, anywhere it\u2019s all kind of around 6% about 5% to 6%, 7% across the board. And so what\u2019s happening here is you have to two \u2013 there is two key elements, where we have been investing heavily over the last 3 years. We have actually increased our technology new product developments. If you look at our run rate of investments they are up about $165 million on a run rate over the last 3 years. We are now seeing the products from those investments coming to the market. And so we are positioned to be able to gain share and continue to accelerate our positioning. And that in addition to some of the market recovery and so as we see the Middle East with oil and gas beginning to recover, we see industrial refrigeration we are up very strong double digit 20 plus percent in our industrial refrigeration business with orders and backlog extremely strong. And so what we have seen here is not only a significant recovery of fire and security products, but very broad based execution across every one of our platforms.","Andrew Kaplowitz","That\u2019s helpful, George. And I want to ask about power margin in the quarter, you identified transportation costs as a drag, which I am guessing really wasn\u2019t as much in your initial guidance, so maybe you can give us little more color on what do you expect going forward there and if that cost is higher, what you can do to sort of get closer to the flat margin guidance that you had given for the year?","George Oliver","Yes. Overall when you look at the total, when you look at the total company we were down about 60 basis points in the first quarter and about 30 basis points of that was the divestiture of Scott Safety. Now if you break it down into the two segments, buildings it was right in line with the lower margin on backlog conversion, again we are down about 60 basis \u2013 it was about 60 basis points, 40 basis points of which was driven by the Scott Safety divestiture. And then with the additional price cost that we talked about in the quarter and then the acceleration of our sales force, the investments in sales force and the continued product investments is what ultimately contributed to that. So we got strong productivity and integration savings, plus the volume was a little more than offset from the price cost and the additional sales investments and continued product investments. So that\u2019s the building side. On power \u2013 the power margins right off the top you got 150 basis points from the impact of FX and lead. And so then when you look at the remaining 100 basis points, we got the volume leverage and mix on productivity was more than offset with the product investments \u2013 continued product investments as well as the increased transportation costs that Brian talked about, that post hurricane as well as with the overall pickup in the economy you can imagine transporting lead acid batteries, there is a cost of that. And as we are going through into our ramp up in the first quarter getting ready for the selling season certainly had higher demand. And so with that capacity is what created some of the increased cost that we saw in quarter.","Brian Stief","So I think when you look at the power margins, as George said there is 100 basis points in the first quarter that transportation and logistics will probably continue with us into the second quarter. And I would think in terms of half what we saw in the first quarter. And then I think as we move throughout the year through either cost actions we are going to take or pricing actions we are going to take in the back half of the year, we will make effort to cover that. But there still will be some going into Q2.","Andrew Kaplowitz","That\u2019s helpful guys. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tim Wojs from Baird. Your line is now open.","Tim Wojs","Hey everybody, good morning. I just had two quick follow-ups if you could, I guess first hit on the order growth in products, I am not sure if I saw them, I might have miss this some more, but if you will let me know what the order growth in the products business was in the quarter. And then secondly just on the cost side of the price cost what are you expecting or what are you putting into the back half of the year in terms of input costs around things like metals and refrigerants?","George Oliver","Yes. So on the first one\u2026","Antonella Franzen","So let me take that one. In terms of the orders one of the things that we decided to do just to make sure that everybody is clear is when we are looking at forecasting our revenue going forward the orders are now focused on the field side of the business, because keep in mind that on the products side it tends to be more of a book and ship type business. There might be a little bit of variability from quarter-to-quarter and you may recall last quarter actually orders were a little higher than the revenue growth. And this quarter I would say that the orders were a little lower than the revenue growth, but think of products as more of a book and ship type business.","George Oliver","And the second part as far as this price cost, we are monitoring all of our commodities and projecting what that \u2013 what each one of them will do and as we look at the mix of our commodities with the overall cost of goods that we have we are making sure that our pricing actions are not only in line, but ahead of that to make sure that if there are any additional pressures going forward we are going to be able to abate the overall margin pressure from that.","Antonella Franzen","And the only thing I would to that in terms of price cost I know there is a lot of focus on that. We had about $0.03 in the first quarter that\u2019s expected to moderate maybe $0.02 in the second quarter. And keep in mind as we get into the second half of the year it will actually be a benefit for us. So particularly as you think about first half, second half that is another thing that flows into the second half of the year as the benefit.","Tim Wojs","Great. Thanks. Good luck.","Antonella Franzen","Thanks.","George Oliver","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Noah Kaye from Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.","Noah Kaye","Thanks and good morning.","Antonella Franzen","We are getting a lot of feedback on the line.","George Oliver","Operator, you are going to have to\u2026","Operator","From Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Joe Ritchie","Could you guys hear me?","George Oliver","Yes.","Joe Ritchie","Alright, that was interesting. Maybe just circling back to this price cost question for a second, I just want to make sure that I may have not heard the answer, but we talked about $34 million headwind in the first quarter, it seems like your guide is assuming that it gets better as the year progresses, what the implicit or explicit assumption on price cost for the outlook?","George Oliver","So as we laid out the year and certainly this has been one of the headwinds we have been extremely focused on. We have started off knowing that the first quarter was going to be the most difficult which it was $34 million, mainly in global products and as well as some of the pricing in China that we talked about. But for most of the price increase going to affect this quarter and as we have started the second half we believe it will mitigate a lot of the pressure we had in the first quarter and the second not fully, so it will improve first quarter to second quarter. With the idea with all of the actions in place, we then in the second half we turned positive in price cost with the actions that are being taken. And so that\u2019s we are watching this very closely. We are making sure that we are staying disciplined in the market and that we are ultimately yielding what we need to yield to be positioned to be able to deliver on the commitments we made here through the year.","Joe Ritchie","Got it, that\u2019s helpful George. I guess my following question in yield and thinking about those like lower margin projects I mean you talked about it a little bit last quarter that had been basically have been building for about the last 18 months fully recognizes that your backlog typically isn\u2019t that long cycle, I am just trying to understand like when we start getting through these lower margin projects will be begun by the second quarter or could they possibly bleed into the second half of your fiscal year as well?","George Oliver","Yes. So our projects you can look at projects we turn \u2013 some of the quick term projects can be a few months. And then some large projects can go multi years, the average being somewhere 6 to 9, but probably 6 months to 12 months depending on whether it\u2019s fire security or HVAC. And so we knew the turn that we saw coming through in the first quarter that that was going to be the toughest. And as we said in North America, at the start of the year, we have 75 basis points of pressure that on a $5 billion plus backlog goes roughly about $40 million. About 40% of that turned in the first quarter. So, it was about $16 million. As far as we now project what\u2019s in backlog and how it\u2019s going to turn, that will be reduced in the second quarter and then minimal impact in the third and fourth quarter based on what\u2019s being put into the backlog. Just another note on that would just be to say that in line with the compensation discussion, a big change has been making sure that not only from a sales standpoint, but from an overall comp standpoint margins is part of the compensation now for our sales team and for our operating teams in the field.","Joe Ritchie","Got it. Thanks, George.","Operator","I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to George now for some closing comments.","George Oliver","Alright. Thanks, again for joining our call this morning. As I hope you took away from our call today, we are building momentum and expect a very strong second half. So, I look forward to seeing many of you soon. Operator, that concludes our call.","Operator","And that concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation.

Your lines have been placed on listen-only until the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] This conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time.","I will turn the call over to Antonella Franzen, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin.","Antonella Franzen","Good morning and thank you for joining our conference call to discuss Johnson Controls' third quarter fiscal 2017 results. The press release and all related tables issued earlier this morning, as well as the conference call slide presentation, can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website at johnsoncontrols.com.","With me today are Johnson Controls' Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Alex Molinaroli; President and Chief Operating Officer, George Oliver; and our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Brian Stief.","Before we begin, I like to remind you that during the course of today's call, we will be providing certain forward-looking information. We ask that you view today's press release and read through the forward-looking cautionary informational statements that we've included there.","In addition, we will use certain non-GAAP measures in our discussions, and we ask that you read through the sections of our press release that address the use of these items. In discussing our results during the call, references to adjusted EBITA and adjusted EBIT margins, exclude transaction, integration, and separation costs, as well as other special items. These metrics are non-GAAP measures and are reconciled in the schedules attached to our press release.","All comparisons to the prior year are on a combined basis, which excludes the results of Adient, and includes the results of Tyco, net of conforming accounting adjustments and recurring purchase accounting.","GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to Johnson Controls' ordinary shareholders was $0.59 for the quarter and included net charges of $0.12 related to special items. These special items were primarily composed of transaction and integration costs, a mark-to-market pension as well as restructuring and impairment charges. Adjusting for these special items, non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.71 per share compared to $0.61 in the prior year quarter.","Now, let me turn the call over to Alex.","Alex Molinaroli","Thanks, Antonella. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining the call today. So if you've read - written in the release and our slides this morning, we reported a quarter of solid EPS growth, strong margin expansion, driven by that continued progress with our synergies and our productivity actions. I'm on Slide 5.","As you'll hear from George in more detail, we continue to be below our overall revenue plan. And I just want to point out that many of our businesses and our regions are seeing some good growth and others have fallen short. So it's not across the board.","Also, I need to point out that within Buildings, it would be wrong for me to say that I'm sure the merger itself and some of the changes that have come along with that have created some near term distractions that have contributed us not achieving our top-line objectives. We believe we can get that back on track.","Our teams will however continue to offset the revenue shortfall by our continued driving of strategy and productivity benefits. Given our year-to-date performance and the expectations for the fourth quarter, we are guiding to the low-end of our prior range and we expect our full year adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $2.60 to $2.62. This will be a 13% EPS growth year-over-year, strong growth, but not quite where we expect it to be when we laid out our guidance in December.","Although we haven't achieved all of our objectives, I do remain confident that our strategy and the strategic platform that we're creating, the decisions we're making around integration and organization are positioning us well to serve our customers today and in the long-term. It's going to help us lean out our cost structure. And ultimately, will drive both top line and bottom line results.","And finally, let me talk about cash conversion. This is clearly a need - needs to and will improve. In addition to the large cash outflows this year related to the tax payments and the merger transaction, we've also made some operational decisions that have affected our underlying cash conversions.","Brian will talk about these in some detail. And George will address it also. So, if you go to Slide 6, and it's to kind of give you an overview of or recap of our results.","The total company sales for the quarter increased 1% year over year to $7.7 billion. Organically our sales grew similarly, 1% year over year. Organic growth in Buildings is a little over 2%, partially offset by a modest decline in our power business of 2%. And George will provide more color and the trends in both of those businesses.","Adjusted EBIT dollars are up 15% year-over-year. We saw solid profitability growth in the segment EBITA level, primarily driven by the continued focus on cost synergies and productivity initiatives. And we benefited also from the lower corporate cost and amortization expense versus prior year, the corporate synergies and the Scott Safety transaction respectively.","Adjusted EBIT margins expanded 150 basis points in the quarter to 13%. If you just for impact of FX and lead, margins actually expanded 170 basis points year-over-year. And lastly, EPS for the quarter was up 16% year over year to $0.71.","With that, I'll turn it over to George, to talk about the integration and also the business performance.","George Oliver","Thanks, Alex, and good morning, everyone. Let me start on Slide 7, by providing an update on the integration. The new organization structure in Buildings is now in place. And we have selected the best athletes and have asked them to play new positions on the field.","Region by region, business by business, we have completely realigned the leadership structure in order to eliminate cost and redundant layers of management as well to optimize sales and service productivity. Naturally, this degree of change in a merger of this size brings with it the potential for short-term challenges as the players familiarize themselves with the playbook.","With this in mind, we made a deliberate strategic decision to move as quickly as possible to implement our new organizational structure, recognizing this may result in a few false starts in the near-term, but will result in a winning strategy in team in the medium and long term. We remain fully committed to achieving our synergy and productivity savings targets. And have made great progress during the quarter delivering roughly $80 million or about $0.07 in year over year savings.","We continue to track towards the high end of the original $250 million to $300 million range in cost energies and productivity savings for the year. With roughly $0.18 achieved through the third quarter, we continue to expect to achieve $0.09 in the fourth quarter, which would total $0.27 in savings for the full year.","I am proud of the work we've done across the organization and the significant progress we are making on achieving merger-related costs energies. As I review the regional performance in Buildings, I will touch on some cross selling wins. Let's turn to Slide 8.","On a reported basis, Building sales in the quarter were flat versus the prior year at $6.1 billion, as 2% organic growth was entirely offset by the impact of FX and net divestitures. Our field business, which as a reminder represents about 65% to 70% of total Building sales, grew 1% organically year over year with mixed performance across the regions.","We saw continued momentum in our global applied HVAC business, which grew in the mid-single-digit range. Fire and security, the legacy Tyco installation and service businesses, declined in the low-single-digit range partly due to a tougher comp with the prior year.","Let me quickly walk through the regions, starting with North America. As many of you know, North America is the largest region for both legacy businesses and therefore creates the great opportunity for growth from both a top and bottom line perspective. This is also the region that has undergone the most significant amount of change.","At the beginning of the third quarter, we put in place a new regional organizational structure, which combine fire and security with HVAC and controls with 27 [P&L] [ph] leaders. The structure eliminates an organization layer, while increasing our sales management and selling capacity. This now gives us an opportunity to make sure our processes are consistent, that we harmonize the way we go to market, where it makes sense and we take advantage of scale.","These leaders are a mix of legacy Johnson Controls and legacy Tyco leadership, who know a lot about where they came from, but have a learning curve with the rest of the business. This added a bit of pressure to the quarter. Organic revenue growth was flat year-over-year, with orders down 4%.","Keep in mind, order activity can be lumpy and when adjusting for the timing of large orders, year-over-year order growth was relatively flat. As we've now been operating in this structure for a few months, we are continuing to make progress improving the level of depth and expertise of the P&L leaders. Although there has been some short-term impact, I am very pleased with the progress that has been made over the quarter, including the success we have had with cross-selling wins.","We designed and implemented a new sales operating model to enable our customers to buy, how they want to buy. For example, during the quarter, we won a large project in the healthcare vertical.","The fire team secured the order to install a fire detection system in a new building as well as the retrofit work in two existing buildings. Embracing the one team approach, the fire team brought in their HVAC colleagues, who are able to successfully displace a large HVAC competitor.","Moving to Asia Pacific, we had a strong quarter all around, despite the concerns of softening macroeconomic conditions both organic revenue growth in orders were up in the high-single-digit driven by China and Northeast Asia. Contributing to the growth was a strong increase in service revenue. We've added additional technicians in China and Japan. And we are seeing nice growth as a result.","Additionally, the team had several cross-selling wins in the quarter, which contributed to the high-single-digit order growth. For example, the team secured a nice win in Hong Kong for cooling systems in 19 rail stations. By leveraging cross business relationships, the team was able to secure this win over a seeded competitor.","Moving to EMEA, the macroeconomic indicators are mixed across the region. Within our businesses in Europe, low-single-digit growth in Continental Europe was partially offset by a decline in the UK, resulting an overall modest growth.","The Middle East on the other hand continues to be challenged. However, the decline has moderated to the mid-single-digit. Lastly, Latin America continues to grow organically, primarily driven by our subscriber business. Overall, orders in the EMEA region were down modestly.","Looking now at our product business, which represents remaining 30% to 35% of Buildings sales increased 4% organically year-over-year. A nice sequential improvement from the 1% decline we saw last quarter. We continue to see very strong growth in our North America residential and light commercial HVAC business, which grew high-single-digit organically, benefitting from a significant amount of new product launches, despite beginning to lot more difficult comparisons.","Our Hitachi business also grew high-single-digits organically aided by a recovery in the timing of shipments, we discussed last quarter. Additionally, as expected our Fire & Security product businesses have stabilized and our holding flat with prior year.","Trailing EBITA increased 7% year-over-year to $908 million. The segment margin expanded 110 basis points to 15%, a strong synergy and productivity savings modest volume leverage in favorable mix more than offset planned incremental product and channel investments during the quarter.","Turning to orders and backlog on Slide 9, total Building orders increased 1% year-over-year organically, up 3% when adjusting for the timing of large orders, driven by 4% increase in product orders, which drove the revenue in the quarter given the book and shift nature of that business.","Field orders were flat with the prior year and strong growth in Asia Pacific was partially offset by a decline in North America and EMEA, as I previously mentioned. In terms of the order pipeline, we are seeing continued momentum in the U.S. market, with stable growth in non-residential construction verticals year-over-year. And expect to see orders growth in our North American field business next quarter. Backlog of $8.4 billion was 3% higher year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and M&A.","In summary, the teams are coming together as well, having been very engaged with every member of the team through this process. I remain convinced that the strategy of this combined entity is going to continue to unlock significant value for customers, employees and shareholders.","Tuning to Power Solutions on Slide 10. Sales increased 6% year-over-year on a reported basis to $1.6 billion, driven by the impact of lead pass-through, which benefitted powers top line by roughly 8 percentage points.","Organic sales were down 2% driven by 3% decline in global unit shipments with declines in both the OE and aftermarket channels. OE unit shipments declined 6% versus last year with particular weakness in the U.S. and EMEA related to lower OEM production volumes, which declined at a similar rate.","On the aftermarket side, which comp for roughly 75% of our volumes, unit shipments declined 2% year-over-year. Weakness in the aftermarket channel was more prevalent in EMEA and China, where customers delayed order decisions based on the drop in LME lead prices throughout the quarter. Given the typical restocking that takes place in the late summer months, we expect low to mid single digit organic growth in the fourth quarter.","Global shipments of start-stop batteries continue to expand with 17% increase year-over-year, despite a difficult plus 22% prior year comparison, including another quarter of significant growth in China and the Americas. The decline in EMEA was tight to the lower level of production in Europe.","Power Solutions segment EBITA of $304 million increased 8% on a reported basis, or 7% excluding foreign currency and lead. Power's margin expanded 40 basis points year-over-year on a reported basis, including a 120 basis points headwind from the impact of higher lead costs.","On an EBITA dollar basis, lead was a slight tailwind in the third quarter. Underlying margins excluding the impact of lead increased $160 basis points year-over-year driven by favorable price mix as well as productivity benefits partially offset by lower volume leverage.","Now let me turn the call over to Brian to walk through corporate and the consolidated financial details of the quarter, as well as our outlook for the fourth quarter.","Brian Stief","Thanks, George, and good morning, everyone. On Slide 11, you can see that our corporate expenses were $23 million or 16% lower than last year, as we continue to see the benefits from the ongoing synergy and productivity actions we have in place. And we continue to feel that the corporate expenses for the full year will fall at the low-end of the $480 million to $500 million range we originally provided.","Before we go into the financial highlight section here, I just comment that our results for the quarter due reflect some special items again transaction and integration costs, restructuring costs and primarily mark-to-market charges those are outlined for you in the appendix both for Q3 and on a year-to-date basis. And as I go through the commentary, I'll exclude those items from my comments. I'll also just say then I'm going to move through the financial highlight section pretty quickly here, because I'd like to spend a little bit more time in the area of free cash flow.","So on Slide 12, you can see that our sales in the quarter were up 1% to $7.7 billion. It's also reported in organic basis. And SG&A expenses were down 6% quarter-over-quarter again reflecting our teams ongoing focus on cost and synergy realization.","If you look at equity income of $69 million, significantly higher than a year-ago, and that again demonstrates the strong performance of the Hitachi non-consolidated joint ventures as well as some Power Solutions joint ventures. So for the quarter, EBIT was up 15% to $1 billion and overall EBIT margins of 13%, were very strong up 150 basis points from 2016.","Moving to Slide 13, you can see the net financing costs were up $124 million versus last year and as primarily due to the debt issuances that we discussed with you last quarter. Our effective tax rate of 15% continues to compare favorably to our prior year rate of 17%, and you can see that our income attributable to non-controlling interest is $74 million, which was up $18 million from the prior year, and that continues to reflect the strong performance of the Hitachi joint ventures. The overall diluted EPS for the quarter of $0.71 is up 16% versus the $0.61 a year-ago.","Moving to Slide 14, just a quick EPS waterfall here for Q3, and you can see that we delivered our targeted $0.07 benefit from cost synergies and productivity savings in the quarter.","Organic growth in Buildings and some favorable mix in Buildings and Power provide additional $0.03, and we again picked up the $0.02 from the tax rate. These were partially offset by incremental investments in our business of $0.01 and $0.01 of foreign exchange. I will just comment that each of these bridge items are right in line with the Q4 - Q3 waterfall guidance we gave on our second quarter call.","So now let's move to free cash flow, given the significant cash impacts of special items during the year, we've provided a reconciliation for you both for Q3 and Q4 - Q3, year-to-date. The items that we have called out relate to transaction integration costs, and restructuring costs as well as the tax payments.","When you look at our Q3 and year-to-date adjusted free cash flow of $200 million, it's obviously well below, where we would typically be at that at this point in the year. And I just like to make a few comments on a few specific items here.","As Alex mentioned, there were some specific operational decisions that were made in the quarter, which have resulted in cash outflows versus our original guidance. This included $400 million inventory build in Power Solutions as well as the establishment of our hedge of our stock-based deferred compensation liabilities. And I'll comment on each of those in a second.","In addition to those two items the timing of dividends from several of our equity affiliates have been delayed, pending further discussion with our minority partners on whether those dividends - when those dividends will be paid, we're still be reinvested in the business.","So talking about the Power Solutions inventory build that was really driven by customer requests to ensure that we meet their stocking demands during the fourth quarter of this year and the first quarter of fiscal 2018. I just comment that in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we incurred incremental service and support costs and likely lost business opportunities due to inventory shortages that we had during the peak season, and we want to minimize that as we move in to this year's second half of the calendar year. In addition, the lower sales volumes in Q3 and Q2 increased our overall inventory levels.","Consistent with Johnson Controls past practice pre-Tyco merger and the Adient spin-off, we made a decision in Q3 to hedge our stock-based deferred compensation liabilities in order to reduce the future income statement volatility associated with the movements on our stock price.","As many of you know, Q4 is always a strong cash quarter for Johnson Controls and historically for Tyco as well. And we expect to deliver adjusted free cash flow of approximately $900 million, which is slightly higher than last year on a pro forma combined basis of JCI and Tyco.","I'd like to do a little walk here to take you back to the original guidance that we've provided of $2.1 billion. If you adjust that for the decline in our earnings per share for the year, you arrive at a number of - between $1.9 billion and $2 billion. And so the bridge that I'd like to kind of take you through here is for the first three quarters of this year, we've got adjusted cash flow of $200 million as you see on the chart.","We've got Q4 projected cash flow of $900 million to get to the $1.1 billion. And then if you add to that the inventory build Power Solutions, the equity hedge of $100 million, the delayed dividends from the JV of $100 million, you get to a $1.7 billion.","And then on top of that we have seen in the quarter, and a little bit and late in the second quarter of build in receivables within the Buildings business. And that relates I think in part to the fact that we're consolidating a lot of activities into our shared service centers globally right now merging the Tyco locations with the JCI shared service centers. And we've seen a little bit of a build in receivables that we've got to go after here in the fourth quarter and in the fiscal 2018.","I would also kind of step back and look at the trade working capital as a percentage of sales. And if you look at, I guess, I would call it our entitlement just to - if we would target trade working capital as a percentage of sales in the Buildings business to be around 12%, and the Power Solutions business to be around 20%. I think we've got about $500 million plus opportunity to go after some trade working capital opportunities here beginning in the fourth quarter through fiscal 2018.","Our free cash flow is below plan levels and we recognized it's been very choppy in 2017 both in terms of the number of adjustments that we're talking you through, as well as overall free cash flow conversion rates. We're committed to improving working capital in 2018, and we think the gap between our reported cash flow and our adjusted free cash flow should tighten.","And we also think that our free cash flow conversion rate should now be above the 80%, as certain of the operational items that I just talked about should in fact turn in the fourth quarter - late in the fourth quarter or into fiscal 2018.","Moving to Slide 16 on the balance sheet. At the end of the third quarter, our net debt to capital ratio is 41.2% up from 40.3% the prior quarter and. And as most of you know, we are moving forward with the share repurchase program in the second half of this year, it was up by about $500 million in the second quarter, and year-to-date we've repurchased 10.2 million shares for about $426 million. And we would expect the full year repurchases to be in the range of $650 million and $750 million.","Just talking through a couple of other items that you'll see in Q4. We'll see the items related to restructuring transaction integration costs and income taxes, we also will have our normal mark-to-market on pension and OPAB [ph] in the fourth quarter. And in addition to that I would mention that we've got the reportable segment change for Buildings that will be made in our fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. And as part of our earnings in Q4, we will provide restated quarters our new segment basis for Buildings.","And then finally, I just wanted to confirm that the sale of our Scott Safety business to 3M is expected to close in Q1 of 2018, and the net proceeds of between $1.8 billion and $1.9 billion will be used to pay down the $4 billion TSarl that was incurred in connection with the Tyco transaction.","Turning to Slide 18, as far as Q4 guidance is $0.86 to $0.88 which was up 13% to 16% versus $0.76 last year. We've got a year-over-year waterfall, as we've mentioned before, we continue to believe there will be $0.09 of benefit related to cost synergies and productivity savings. And we'll have volume and mix of $0.01, which reflects some price cost pressure that we expect to see as we move through the fourth quarter.","Our effective tax rate of 15% compares favorably to the prior year of 17, so that contributes a couple of $0.01. And I would just comment, we continue to evaluate additional tax synergy opportunities related to the Tyco merger.","And finally continued investments on our Buildings and Power businesses represent $0.01 impact in the fourth quarter. So overall our organic growth is now estimated to be 2% to 3% over last year with overall EBIT margin expansion of 70 to 90 basis points.","As far as full year guidance on Page 19, given our reduced Q4 organic revenue growth we are guiding full year EPS to the low end of the range previously provided that range is $2.60 to $2.62, which represents a year-over-year increase of approximately 13% versus $2.31 on a pro forma basis last year.","And with that, Antonella, we can open it up for questions.","Antonella Franzen","Thanks, Brian. Operator, can you please open up the lines and provide instructions for asking a question?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Deane Dray","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Antonella Franzen","Good morning.","Alex Molinaroli","Good morning.","Deane Dray","Hey, maybe we can start with, Alex, your opening comments you referred to some of the distractions on the integration. And may be George was referencing the same thing about some false starts. But maybe you could give some examples or some specifics around where that might have been seen in the quarter and how that has been addressed as we look at fiscal fourth quarter?","Alex Molinaroli","Yes, so the two things that I'd point out is - one is kind of clear when Brian talked about our receivables issue. If you look at it, as we started moving to shared services I think there is a distraction there. So either some cash, it wasn't collected. Process has changed, people have moved and locations have moved as it relates to some of our collections. So that's one that's pretty easy to get your head wrapped around.","We'd like to think that we were not going to have, that things are going to hit the ground. But obviously, if you just look at - if you see the underlying receivables, it was some of the stuff that Brian talked about, you can see that that is something we can get back. But we lost a few days if you look at our DSO. And if you think about where the - I think George referenced the largest part of our business being North America. That is where both businesses came together. And as we came together, it's just - you can't point to a specific thing and say, well, we lost a project or somebody got distracted.","But you just know, because those changes happened right after the end of this second quarter. I mean, we timed it to make sure that we got through the second quarter and then we made the changes. And so it's just logical to understand when you go through that kind of change in your field organization, that you're going to have a little bit of time that people need to adjust to the new bosses and new organization.","But in the end, when you get out in front of the customer that hasn't changed, so the reason we have confidence that this is a - you know what, a short term challenge and one that's hard to put your finger on is that, that when you get in front of the customer the people that recall on the customer service and the customer - and their boss at the local level has not changed. But when you look above that, much leaner structure and much more logical structure, one that's going to work for a long term, but it's just - it just change.","And I think that it would be naive for us to think that that didn't have somewhat of an impact, probably on some of our order secured is my guess. And so, hopefully, orders aren't lost, it's just - we just got to go through a process. So that's the way - George, you probably have more color on it. But that's the way that I would characterize it. North America would probably be the place that we're going to see, it is where we see it.","George Oliver","Yeah, just a little bit to add, Deane. I would say that, when you look at the Buildings organization, you've taken two very large organizations. And although we talk about legacy JCI, legacy Tyco, we're running these businesses across the globe together. And so you can imagine from a leadership standpoint, the changes that had to occur. And I am more confident than ever, the way that the teams have come together.","And the sales management, sales capacity that we've created, while taking out layers of management that, that is going to translate to accelerate the acceleration of orders and growth. Our pipeline, although we didn't convert in the quarter, we see a very nice pipeline built across the globe with opportunities and the quoting activity as a result of that pipeline is increasing.","So I'm developing more confidence every day that as we put these organizations together, building off of the strong customer relationships that we had within the legacy structures, working together now into operating system, we're now seeing that coming through.","Deane Dray","Got it. And then, just as a follow up on the free cash flow situation for the quarter, for Brian, is that $500 million trade working capital opportunity? That sounds like a new target. Just the degree of confidence and going after that, the pace of which you think you can begin to ring that out and does this change in any way the JCI longer term goal of reaching 90% free cash flow conversion by 2020?","Brian Stief","No, the 90% is still intact, Deane. And as far as the $500 million, that's a target that's based upon where we think our optimal position is on trade working capital as a percentage of sales in each of our businesses. And historically, Building Efficiency and Tyco, I think when their trade working capital is well under control, we feel in a combined basis that a target of 12% there makes sense.","And we're 150 basis points higher than that right now. And when you look at Power Solutions, we are of the view that 20% is historic targeted level that we think is optimal. And we're at 22.5% to 23% right now. So if you do the math on that, you pretty quickly get to a number of about a $0.5 billion that that should be achievable and we've got teams that are going after.","Alex Molinaroli","Deane, some of that is some of the same stuffs that we have talked about. We have an optimal level of inventory within Power Solutions that is not as high as it is today. But one of the things that we've done is we've gone through - because of the customer issues we had last year, the orders we missed and the service penalties we paid. We put capacity and as you know, our capital spending is pretty high in North America.","We put capacity in that will help us in the future. But this year, we're needing to put inventory in order to get through the season. I think we've got some capacities going a long place that will help us offset some of the need for inventory in the future too.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz. Your line is now open.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Hey, good morning, guys.","Antonella Franzen","Good morning.","Alex Molinaroli","Good morning.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Al, and then we can talk a little bit more about what's going on in your Power business. You guys have leading market share in the business. And I know, last quarter, you suggested that your Power team is feeling good about the rest of the year. And then you missed your own quarterly projections by a significant amount. We know that part of the issue is customers waiting for lead price reductions.","But why wouldn't that have been somewhat of a concern last quarter and something that maybe your teams could have been better prepared, so just sort of commentary on visibility around that Power business going forward?","Alex Molinaroli","Yes, it's a good question. What I would say is it's not a North American phenomenon, because of the closed loop system in North America. I think both in Asia, specifically China and Europe we see that phenomenon. And I think there's just been a lot of attention within the business, how much - in order to motivate your customers how much do we want to do to pull orders forward, which would mean essentially we would give them relief early versus being able to deal with the price changes as they happen.","So I think that we were probably hopeful, that we could pull some stuff into the quarter. I think that naturally it's going to happen. I think we'll see that happen in the fourth quarter. And it's hard to - and the only thing I could tell you for sure is we haven't lost any share. And it's - the you know the team is just as frustrated as you are, because it also a double dinger. It also hit us in the inventory.","If you think about our inventory in Power, it's not only the inventory you built on purpose, but the fact that we didn't get the sales coming out in the quarter that we expected. So I don't think it's we don't have our eye on the ball. I think we're probably little optimistic that we could pull in front of the price - the price changes for lead.","Andrew Kaplowitz","And, Alex, when you talk about sort of the low- to mid-single-digit growth in the business going forward, is that still optimistic or is that sort of realistic now based on what you see?","Alex Molinaroli","I think it's realistic. I think that quarter to quarter, we obviously are seeing some volatility. But if you just look at the orders that we have, we are going through a change where a lot of our customers are now moving to AGM products. So I think one of the limiting factors are we're going to have the - are we going to have the batteries to be able to serve that market as we move forward.","Some of the challenges - the reason why it's only 17% growth in AGM, which is not as high as it's been is - part of it is capacity constraints. Our customers are going through changes and we're putting the capacity in as fast as we can. I think the markets there on an overall basis, because you just look at the build and the replacement cycles, the markets there, the timing of it something that we don't control. And it got away from us this quarter, because it caught us both on the inventory and on the sales.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. Your lines is now open.","Nigel Coe","I just want to go back to cash flow. You built about $1.1 billion of trade working capital this year. And, Brian, you were saying there is about $0.5 billion of relief from that. So I'm just wondering, the message that you came in post-merger kind of low on working capital and you have to rebuild some of that. And as a result, you've lost some business. And therefore, now, you've kind of gone above that target range you have to - that delve back. That's the first part of the question.","And then the second part is you're not really assuming much working capital benefit in 4Q. Is that right? And if so, why is that?","Brian Stief","Yes, so the fourth quarter benefits, I mean, if you look at the bridge that we've provided to get the $1.9 billion. I think, there's going to be late fourth quarter into the first quarter. I do think, we're going to see at least $200 million of the inventory build flush out. And then, I think the dividends from the JVs, we also are still of the view the fact is going to be received, as I mentioned we were resetting the situation now, we were discussing with our joint venture partners whether there's going to be dividends to each of the partners, or whether or not we're going to reinvest in the business.","But we believe at this point that that's a timing item as well. And then on the receivable of a couple of $100 million, I would expect that we would start to see some of that turn as well as we get after this trade working capital initiative that we've got, we're moving forward with here.","So I do think that there is $400 million of that bridge that I gave you that we're going to see come back and relatively short order between now and mid-fiscal 2018, which should improve our cash flow north of the 80% level that we had originally targeted for fiscal 2018.","As far as your first question on optimal levels of trade working capital, and there is no double that we have gone backwards in the first nine months of this year. The biggest pieces of that tended to be the inventory build of Power, and receivable we've talked about. There were also payables and also about $100 million headwind there. So I think when we look at our overall initiatives for fiscal 2018. We're going to work toward trade working capital as a percentage of sales of 12% of Buildings and 20% of Power. And we think that's a good place to be both from customer standpoint and from a company standpoint.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Your line is now open.","Jeffrey Sprague","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Alex Molinaroli","Good morning, Jeff.","Jeffrey Sprague","I just back on cash flow here. Can you give us a sense of what you're expecting for CapEx in 2018 relative to 2017?","Brian Stief","Yes, so if you - Jeff, if you look at Power Solutions, we're finishing the AGM capacity in North America and we've got two plants that we're finishing up in fiscal 2018, early 2019. So it's a pretty heavy year from the standpoint of - I would call it growth CapEx in Power Solutions. As you know this year, we guided to $1.250 billion to $1.3 billion, I think we're going to be in line with that. I'm guessing next year could be in the $1.4 billion range plus or minus just kind of what we're thinking right now given the Power Solutions investments.","Jeffrey Sprague","And just trying to get my head around the conversion, obviously, on the cash flow miss here, could understand not want to go over promise for next year, but it's called $100 million headwind on CapEx, if you've got this big of a working capital swing. Actually feels like a number could be - could have a nine handle on it, I mean is there something else, I'm missing there, I wonder about other kind of charges that are maybe not in the deal integration numbers et cetera. What are the consideration should we have in mind, when we think about 2018 free cash?","Brian Stief","I understand the math you're doing to get a nine in front, but I think we're still in the process of finalizing everything for fiscal 2018, Jeff. And we will provide more color on this, when we go through our 2018 guidance. But I mean suffice it to say we all recognize that given the poor performance in 2017 and certainly the working capital areas that should certainly provide some tailwind for us as we go into 2018. And I would say - but I want committed to say right now it will be north of 80%.","Alex Molinaroli","I think that's a responsible way for us to answer the question, Jeff, at this point. We understand your math.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Stephen Tusa","Hi, guys, good morning.","Alex Molinaroli","Good morning.","Stephen Tusa","What exactly is the hedge for deferred comp, and I have a follow up on that?","Brian Stief","So we've got stock-based compensation awards that we give to our employees. And you essentially work with a financial institution, you give them the money to purchase the shares and they essentially a lot of you to provide a hedge against future movement in your stock price. So to the extent that we buy in. And I believe in the 10-Q that you'll be seeing, I think we brought in at $42.21. And that hedge is going to offset movement upward and downward in the stock price versus the $42.21.","So essentially what it does is, it takes the volatility out of your income statement for any movement in your stock price, which is required under gap to be either a compensation expense or compensation benefit as you move through the year.","Stephen Tusa","And if that have any influence on what ultimately your employees receive?","Brian Stief","No.","Stephen Tusa","Okay, okay. And then just for - I just looking a bit ahead, these are just basically items that are probably no one at this stage of the game. And any view on kind of what ForEx, looks like to be kind of snapped a line here for 2018, and any other parts of the bridge in 2018 that are kind of - would be more just financially oriented. We can all kind of do our own math around volume and mix, but and any planned change in the tax rate and also are you reaffirming kind of the synergy forecast that you guys gave at EPG, I assume there is no change and you're executing well this year?","Brian Stief","Yes. So the synergy number $250 million, we reconfirm. The tax rate we haven't finalized all the effective tax rate work at this point in time for 2018. But I would say that it will be 15% or lower, as far as FX. I don't think, I've got any specific guidance at this point in time on that. Antonella?","Antonella Franzen","Yes, I mean, if you take a look at kind of how rates have moved particularly now, you could see that we brought down our FX headwind expectations for the year. So I mean, if rate stay how they are, I mean, if we take Q4 as an example, there is really not much of an FX either headwind or tailwind, it's actually pretty neutral. But as you know, rate moved, so as we get closer to 2018 will obviously adjust to the more current rates to see what type of impact that gives us.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Tim Wojs with Baird. Your line is now open.","Timothy Wojs","Yes, hey, everybody, good morning. I guess, I was just on cash flow cash flow again if there are any thought or is there any concern just as you kind of tradeoff working capital that that has any impact on kind of the growth algorithm for the businesses.","Alex Molinaroli","I'm sorry. You mean not having or having?","Timothy Wojs","I guess, if terms are tighter, I mean, does that have any impact on how you guys think - how growth could come into the P&L in the Buildings business? If maybe in terms of a little less favorable.","Alex Molinaroli","No. I don't think so. I don't think that. I don't see, I think that what we're talking about now is we've got some process issues that we need to effect, and in terms that we need to harmonize that's our opportunity. I don't see that we're going to do anything that's going to affect the growth of the business. And that's why I think when Brian talked about it being an entitlement, I think that's - the way that he was framing it.","I thought maybe you're talking about Power Solutions, we did lose some growth, because we didn't have the inventory last year, or didn't have batteries. And you can either think you need to have capacity or you need to have inventory. I think at this point, we got the worst of both worlds, because we've got the extra inventory and we're putting capacity. And so we will be in that shape - we will be in a similar shape of next year from an inventory and Power.","But if you look at receivables and Buildings, I think Brian talked about right, as an entitlement that's not going to affect our growth, and you look at inventory and Power, it's the same thing that we can take our inventory and Power, it's the same thing that we can take our inventory down and not hurt our growth, because we're putting new capacity in.","Timothy Wojs","Okay. Great. And then just what's the - as you look at kind of price cost, that's been a theme in this earnings season. I mean, how would you guys frame that the price cost discussion into fiscal 2018, particularly in the Building side.","Brian Stief","Yes, so if you look at Buildings in the third quarter were up 110 basis points on margin that was driven by volume leverage. We got the synergies and productivity as well as now we're seeing the growth come through the products businesses, which is a higher mix. That was somewhat offsetting some price cost of about 20 basis points, and that's mainly driven by steel, copper, aluminum as well as some refrigerant.","And so as we look at this going forward, we'll still have the strong synergies productivity will continue to see increasing volume leverage, we will get the mix of our products beginning to accelerate but we are going to see continued headwind here in the fourth quarter, which we're estimating now to be about 20 basis points.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.","Noah Kaye","Yes, good morning, everyone. Thanks so much for taking the question. George, you mentioned earlier that you're starting to see very nice pipeline, and favorable quotation activity. Can you just give us a little more color on maybe where that is geographically or kind of within the segments?","George Oliver","Sure. So if you start - let me start with North America, because that's certainly the big focus area. At the new organization that we put together, we freed up a lot of resources that we took out the layers of management to put back into sales management as well as selling capacity. We're putting the businesses together, we got a little bit behind of our hiring plan with our sales force.","But we're significantly increasing our sales capacity as we speak and then with the work that we've done, the team has done a nice job in putting together prophecies in the field. As we're now leveraging the existing customer base that we serve to be able to better serve the customers with a complete portfolio. And I talked a little bit about that in my prepared remarks, making it simpler for the customer to be able to buy from us the total capability.","So when you look at the pipelines that have been developed across the globe within our direct channels, we're beginning to see that. Now there's a timing of conversion as we go through this. But it gives me confidence are based on what we see, we're going to begin to see an improvement on a go forward basis.","And our product businesses, the team is done a really nice job, not only making sure that we've got, we're leveraging the channel - our direct channel, but also expanding our indirect channels across each one of our product businesses. So not only are we investing in our direct sales capability.","But we're also expanding our channels, you'll see that some of the bright spots during the quarter and our DX business with a very difficult compare - last year were up about 17%, were up another 10% this year. That is really an output of some terrific work has been done in expanding our channel to be able to capitalize on the growth in the market share.","So what I can tell you across the board, it's certainly a key focus and being able to not only get world class sales management but increasing capacity in our direct channel as well as our indirect distribution that will enable us to be able to capitalize on a broader part of the market.","Noah Kaye","Okay, great. Thanks. And then just on Power Solutions, Alex, I think you mentioned kind of some capacity shortages around AGM. With all that we're seeing and reading around kind of changes to try to change across the auto industry. Is it AGM demand kind of trending globally the way that you thought it would, as you look out the next couple of years or as perhaps accelerating. How do we think about that and kind of your own capacity build plans?","Alex Molinaroli","It's a good question. There's so much been written about every all this whole topic, but what we're saying is probably going to move faster than we can afford to even meet the capacity. So I think we're going to have to be - really have to make sure that we put the capacity in the right place and leverage it, because I think it's just going to escalate. What we do see people trying to do is put some batteries and that are quite AGM capable, and then what we find is they come back later and say we need to do something else.","And our capacity plans are pretty significant, our shares are really high. I think, they're probably be more demand, which will be a good problem to have I just think we're going to have to pretty choosy I think on who we serve. I think that's where we're going to be in the next few years.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Julian Mitchell","Hi, good morning. Just wanted to circle back on the Power Solutions division, so I guess it's obviously unusual to be sort of growing inventories, while sales volumes came in a bit light. I understand that the guidance is for aftermarket sales to recover in the next few months. But just thinking about the risks that inventories stay high, how would you characterize inventories today versus a typical time of year or typical seasonality in the battery business right now?","And then also, on the Power side, I understand the drawdown of working capital not really having a revenue impact. So maybe just talk about any profit or EBIT margin impact as you get that adjustment on working capital in Power. Thank you.","Alex Molinaroli","Okay, I'll address the first one. This is Alex. Our inventory is much higher than it was a year ago. And that's twofold. One is it's a response to the fact that we and you may recall we called out, when we're having service problems over the - actually over the last year-and-a-half we had service problems in the peak season, because our peak capacity is probably 120% of our total capacity.","And so if you have to have an inventory, you'd be able to serve our customers. We had meetings with our customers, so particularly in North America, our very large customers who essentially put us on notice that they're not going to be short of batteries anymore. And so I think we've compensated for that in a way that we have the inventory and we're also putting in capacity, so that we don't have to have this much inventory on an ongoing basis. So it's a year from now.","And so I would say it's sort of kind of in between where we are and where we need to be. As we put capacity in our inventory levels won't be quite this high. But they won't be as low as they were a couple of years ago. But that still gets us in the range of where Brian was talking about as far as what we would believe our entitlement for working capital. And that certainly is - within Power Solutions, it really is an inventory story.","Brian Stief","Yeah, I don't think there's going to be any impact negatively on margins as that inventory turns out. I mean, as we kind of talked about in the past, sometimes your margin rates can vary depending upon where lead is. But I don't think there is a downward pressure on margins of Power Solutions as a result of that inventory turning out.","Julian Mitchell","Thank you. And then just, my follow up would be on the Building side. You've had a big push on trying to reinvest more to take share and you have pretty good order numbers in the legacy buildings business this quarter. So that seems to be working. When you think about the incremental investment from here, do you think there's a need for another big step up or do you think that the organic investment in HVAC in particular is running around the right level today?","George Oliver","Yeah, Julian, this is George. As you said, we're getting really good traction with the new products that we're bringing to market. And when you look at the performance across our portfolio, I think that's beginning to show, whether it'd be in the residential, like commercial or across applied, as well as within our controls. And that's where a lot of the investments are being put in.","What I see going forward as we continue to gain the momentum, we're going to continue to reinvest and look at incremental investments that we see as - given the success we've had in each one of these segments that we see a lot of opportunity with the investments we're making. So we're going to, obviously, take that into account as we're beginning to accelerate and gain market share, but it gives us a lot of confidence that with the investments we are deploying we are beginning to see the growth come through and it's coming through at very attractive margins.","Alex Molinaroli","Just to add to that Julian, I mean, we have some really exciting things that are going to happen over the next couple of years as it relates to some products we're developing. So, I think that - I think it's just going to get better. And one of the opportunities for us, particularly look what's happened not only with Hitachi, but just our business in Asia, I think you'll see investments there too, where we will be able to take advantage. We have a great position and we can take advantage for our position in the marketplace.","Some of that top line that we're getting in - through Hitachi, you don't see, particularly in China, because it's unconsolidated, but it's growing pretty well, particularly in China.","Antonella Franzen","Operator, I think we may be at the top of the hour. But we're going to try and squeeze in one more.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Gautam Khanna with Cowen & Company. Your line is now open.","Gautam Khanna","Yeah, thanks for fitting me in. So following up on just Brian's [ph] question about the cash flow. In Q4, how much of the items that you mentioned that slipped out of Q3 and perhaps this year do you expect to recover? So Power's inventory build, $400 million, the hedge, the dividend, and the - of the receivable, the $200 million receivable, how much is embedded in your expectation for Q4?","Brian Stief","So in what we've talked about, none of it is expected to come back in Q4. We think most of it will come back in first and second quarter fiscal 2018.","Gautam Khanna","Okay. And so, given that, and I think previously you've talked about $300 million tax item coming back to you in Q1 as well. Should we expect that Q1 and perhaps Q2 of fiscal 2018 will be very, very strong free cash flow relative to history?","Brian Stief","Should be stronger than we've seen historically, that's right.","Antonella Franzen","And, Gautam, that one thing to remember is, remember when the cash went out for the tax payment, we had it as one of our reconciling items. And when the cash come back, we said we would do that as well.","Alex Molinaroli","So we won't take credit for it, we'll just take the money. Okay.","Antonella Franzen","Operator, it is - yeah.","Alex Molinaroli","Yeah.","Antonella Franzen","I'm going to pass it over to Alex just for any last comments.","Alex Molinaroli","Yeah, let me just wrap up here. Thank you for everyone for the call and all your questions. We really appreciate it. So I just want to make sure that, I understand your feedback. And there are three things I would like to point out. First is the synergy and productivity numbers are doing as well or better than we expected. We don't really expect that to change. And so I want to make sure that as we talk about this that we show that we're making progress there.","Top-line I think is mixed. We have some opportunity. But we also are seeing some benefits and we haven't lost those benefits, but there are some opportunities for us to make some improvements. And then, clearly, cash flow we get it - there's work that needs to be done. We're a little gun-shy talking about, as you can see from our responses around how this is all - how and when this is going to come back. But we know the opportunity there and we're committed to make sure that, you're going to see the cash flow numbers as good or as better than what we've talked about in the past.","So I just want to wrap on that and I want to thank our employees. Lot of work, hard work is being done in order to make this one company. Thank you very much.","Antonella Franzen","Thanks, Alex. And, operator, that concludes our call.","Operator","That concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"12645":["Johnson Controls International Plc (NYSE:JCI) Q3 2018 Earnings Call July 31, 2018 11:00 AM ET","Executives","Antonella Franzen - Johnson Controls International Plc","George R.

LLC","Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Operator","Welcome to Johnson Controls Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. Your lines have been placed on listen-only until the question-and-answer session. This conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time.","I will turn the call over to Antonella Franzen, Vice President and Chief Investor Relations and Communications Officer.","Antonella Franzen - Johnson Controls International Plc","Thank you. Good morning and thank you for joining our conference call to discuss Johnson Controls third quarter fiscal 2018 results. The press release and all related tables issued earlier this morning as well as the conference call slide presentation can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website at johnsoncontrols.com. With me today are Johnson Controls Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, George Oliver, and our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Brian Stief.","Before we begin, I would like to remind you that during the course of today's call we will be providing certain forward looking information. We ask that you review today's press release and read through the forward-looking cautionary informational statements that we've included there. In addition, we will use certain non-GAAP measures in our discussions and we ask that you read through the sections of our press release that address the use of these items. In discussing our results during the call, references to adjusted EBITA and adjusted EBIT margins exclude restructuring and integration costs as well as other special items. These metrics are non-GAAP measures and are reconciled in the schedules attached to our press release and in the appendix to the presentation posted on our website.","GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to Johnson Controls ordinary shareholders was $0.78 for the quarter and included a net charge of $0.03 related to special items. These special items primarily relate to integration costs. Adjusting for these special items, non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.81 per share compared to $0.71 in the prior year quarter.","Now, let me turn the call over to George.","George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc","Thanks, Antonella, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today.","Let's get started with a high level review of the strategic highlights in the quarter starting on slide 3. Last quarter we began laying a foundation based on the theme of building momentum. As I think about the progress we have made in the third quarter, I would say the momentum continues on each of our key initiatives.","Starting with sales capacity, based on our success in attracting high performing talent during the first half, we continue to accelerate the pace of sales adds in the third quarter, hiring an incremental 375 sales professionals. This brings our year-to-date net additions to the Building direct channel and indirect sales force to about 775 globally versus our previous expectation of 500 to 600 net adds. We expect to end the year with 900 net adds.","By leveraging the Johnson Controls commercial excellence programs throughout the organization, the hallmarks of which are an appropriately designed attractive incentive compensation structure, proper onboarding and training models as well as ongoing sales management and coaching, we have seen a significant increase in the productivity of our new and existing sales teams. That, in turn, improves the customer experience and drives order growth as evidenced by the continued acceleration in Buildings orders and organic revenue growth.","Our initiatives surrounding our sales force resegmentation and improved pricing discipline continue to bear fruit with further improvement in margins on orders secured in backlog. For example, margins on new orders in North America increased 110 basis points year-over-year, which compares to the 70 basis point increase we saw in Q1 and 100 basis point increase we saw in Q2.","Despite a more difficult prior year comparison, our Global Products team continued to accelerate top line growth, reflecting outstanding execution and converting on the substantial investments made in capital deployed over the past several years into engineering, R&D and expanding our distribution footprint.","I should also call attention to the aggressive pricing actions we have taken, particularly over the last six months to combat rising raw material and other input costs. We have achieved above average levels of price realization relative to our announced price increases year-to-date, which has enabled us to move into a modest positive price\/cost position earlier than expected. Based on the timing of price recovery and assuming recent levels of inflation, we are well positioned into the fourth quarter.","Buildings service revenue growth accelerated once again in the third quarter to 5% year-over-year compared to the 3% growth we experienced in the first half. I'm extremely pleased with our execution in our service businesses across the globe, particularly given the intense focus we have had on expanding our commercial capabilities and strengthening operations, while increasing our service technician capacity.","At Power Solutions, we had strong organic performance in both the OE and aftermarket channels, benefiting partly from the new platform wins we discussed with you last quarter. The success in ramping shipments on the new wins can be directly attributed to the Power team's solid execution and commitment to serving our customers.","On free cash flow, we continued to drive operational improvements and I am very pleased with our progress in establishing sound fundamental processes and metrics across the organization. Cost synergies and productivity savings remain on track. At this point I would say these initiatives are well-weaved into the fabric of Johnson Controls. We delivered nearly $70 million or $0.06 of incremental savings in the quarter, as expected. We are on track to deliver our $250 million savings target in fiscal 2018.","Lastly, let me provide you an update on the strategic review of our Power Solutions business. As we previously discussed, we are analyzing multiple options, including a spin or a sale versus retaining it as part of our portfolio. We are analyzing the viability and benefits of a tax-efficient spin of the business and, in parallel, have been discussing the potential sale of the business with interested parties. Management, along with the Board of Directors, have decided to continue to explore these alternatives and expect to conclude the review by the release of our fourth quarter earnings. We will communicate more details when a final determination has been made.","Let's turn to slide 4 for a quick look at the macro environment. Despite recent FX volatility, inflationary pressures and trade policy concerns, the macroeconomic environment generally remains supportive of continued growth across most of our key geographic regions. By most accounts, U.S. economic fundamentals continue to strengthen; spending in non-residential construction markets remains favorable. Despite recent choppiness in a few of our macro indicators, the forward looking components are still pointing to modest growth over the next 12 months and we are seeing that in our orders, led by strength in the institutional verticals.","Trends in Europe remain somewhat mixed with lower growth for construction markets in larger developed economies and higher growth in the Eastern European economies, where those countries continue to invest at rates above their GDP.","The sustained rebound in oil prices continues to support investments in the Middle East, and is also driving increased demand for our fire protection and suppression products that serve the harsh and hazardous end markets globally.","China is an area we are monitoring closely, given the potential for trade disruptions with the U.S. that continue to escalate. Although China's economic growth has slowed somewhat, it remains one of the fastest growth regions and recently-announced government policies aimed at reviving growth may start to take shape over the next several months. China non-residential construction starts remain flat overall, with continued weakness in commercial verticals, offset by continued growth in the industrial and infrastructure verticals.","In Power, global auto production is stabilizing, particularly in the U.S. and Europe, and the recent platform wins position us well to gain share. The increasing electrification in vehicles, combined with a regulatory environment still pushing for stronger efficiency standards, are supportive of our core battery technologies.","Changing demographics also remain favorable, as evidenced by the growth we are seeing in China, which continues to outpace the market and has been a source of growth in both channels. Overall, the underlying fundamentals within most of our key geographies remain supportive of continued order and revenue growth momentum.","Turning over to slide 5, Buildings Field orders accelerated again in the quarter, up 8% year-over-year organically with continued strong quoting activity. This compares to low-single-digit average growth in fiscal 2017 and 6% average growth in the first half.","Underlying order strength was most notable in our North America and EMEA\/LA businesses across most of our core product domains, and including bookings for both installation and service. Our North America Fire business experienced its highest bookings quarter in over two years. Our growth in backlog provides confidence in continued improvement in revenue growth.","Turning now to slide 6, let me recap the financial results for the quarter. Sales of $8.1 billion increased 6% on both a reported and organic basis, with 5% organic growth in Buildings and 10% in Power.","Adjusted EBIT of approximately $1.1 billion grew 6% on a reported basis and 12% when adjusting for the impact of the Scott Safety divestiture, foreign exchange and lead. Favorable volume mix and the benefit of cost synergy and productivity savings more than offset incremental organic investments back into our business.","Between incremental product and sales capacity investments, we initially planned to spend approximately $35 million in the third quarter and we came in closer to $45 million, taking into account the significant number of sales adds I discussed earlier.","Overall, EBIT margins expanded 10 basis points year-over-year on a reported basis or 70 basis points excluding the impact of the Scott Safety divestiture, FX and lead.","Adjusted earnings per share came in at $0.81, up 14% over the prior year. Adjusted free cash flow in the quarter was just short of $650 million, which when added to our first half free cash flow, which was north of $300 million, brings us to $1 billion year-to-date.","Turning to our EPS bridge on slide 7, as I mentioned earlier, synergy and productivity savings added $0.06 to the prior year. Volume and mix contributed an additional $0.08, driven by solid growth in both Buildings and Power. The cumulative benefit of synergies and volume\/mix was partially offset by incremental investments.","Lastly, the combined benefit from lower tax and FX was offset by below-the-line items. Overall, this resulted in $0.81 adjusted EPS for the quarter.","With that, I will turn it over to Brian to discuss the performance within the segments.","Brian J. Stief - Johnson Controls International Plc","Thanks, George, and good morning, everyone. So let's start on slide 8 and take a look at the performance of Buildings on a consolidated basis. Total Buildings sales in the quarter of $6.3 billion increased 5% organically with Products up 7% and Field up 4%, led by strong 5% growth in service across all geographies and a return to growth of 2% on project installations.","A three percentage point headwind from M&A, primarily related to the Scott Safety divestiture, was partially offset by a 2% benefit of FX in the quarter. Buildings consolidated EBITA of $954 million grew a strong 10% organically with balanced growth across our Field and shorter cycle Products businesses.","Buildings reported EBITA margin expanded 20 basis points versus the prior year to 15.2%, but this includes a 40 basis point headwind from the Scott Safety divestiture and a 10 basis point headwind related to foreign currency. On a normalized basis, the EBITA margin expanded a solid 70 basis points in the quarter.","As you can see in the margin waterfall, the combined benefit of 130 basis points from synergy and productivity save, volume leverage and mix was partially offset by 60 basis points of planned headwinds from incremental product and sales capacity investments.","As expected, gross margin pressures from the conversion of lower margin backlog and price costs were not significant in Q3. And in fact, as George mentioned, we ended the third quarter with a positive price cost variance. Field orders increased by 8% organically year-over-year with backlog, up 7%, now standing at $8.5 billion.","Now, let's turn to each of the individual segments within Buildings and starting on page 9 with North America. Sales of $2.2 billion grew 5% organically with strong growth in our applied HVAC & Controls and Fire & Security platforms each growing mid-single digits. Our Solutions business, which represents less than 10% of North America's revenue, declined low single-digits in the quarter on a tough prior year compare.","Service revenue North America grew mid-single digits organically led by increase in activity in both HVAC & Controls and Fire & Security, while project installation revenue also grew in the mid-single digit range led by strength in Fire & Security.","North America adjusted EBITA of $318 million grew 10% year-over-year with EBITA margins expanding 60 basis points to 14.2%. We saw the benefit of volume leverage and favorable mix and synergies and productivity being partially offset by higher than planned investments in sales force capacity and the residual lower margin backlog conversion.","Orders in North America increased 8% organically, another great quarter for our North American team as we saw strong bookings in both our conventional HVAC & Controls and Fire & Security businesses, including strength in project installation as well as service. Backlog of $5.4 billion increased 7% year-over-year.","So let's move to slide 10, EMEA\/LA. As expected, sales of $926 million were flat organically year-over-year as we started the fiscal year with lower project backlogs in both Europe and the Middle East. Europe declined in the low single-digits driven by lower project installation backlog in our Industrial Refrigeration and HVAC businesses; however, orders did increase in the mid-teens organically in Q3 led by strong demand in IR, fire suppression and security.","In the Middle East, revenues grew low single-digits as low double-digit growth in service activity was substantially offset by continued softness in project installations. Latin America revenues increased mid-single-digits led by strength in our recurring security monitoring business and fire suppression.","Adjusted EBITA of $98 million increased 10% and EBITA margins expanded 60 basis points to 10.6% including a 40 basis point headwind related to foreign currency. Underlying margins increased 100 basis points driven primarily by productivity and synergy save.","Orders in EMEA\/LA were up a strong 13% with solid growth across all regions and across both service and project installation, driven primarily by strength in IR and Fire & Security. Backlog in EMEA\/LA ended at $1.6 billion up 6% organically.","So let's turn to slide 11 and discuss APAC. Sales of $681 million grew 4% organically, largely driven by low double-digit service growth led primarily by China and Southeast Asia. Project installation revenue grew low single-digits driven by Fire & Security and IR.","Adjusted EBITA of $97 million increased 15% over the prior-year with margins expanding 90 basis points, and this includes a 50 basis point headwind related to foreign currency. The underlying margin improvement of 140 basis points reflects the continued benefit of productivity and synergy save as well as favorable volume and mix, partially offset by investments in sales force.","Asia Pacific orders did decline 1% in the quarter primarily due to a tough prior-year comparison of 9%, but also reflective of an increasingly competitive market dynamic in the region, especially in China. Backlog increased 9% to $1.5 billion. I would point out that, based upon what we see today, we expect continued competitive and margin pressures as we move through Q4 and into fiscal 2019.","Turning to Global Products on slide 12, sales increased a strong 7% organically to $2.4 billion, led by high-single-digit growth in both Building Management Systems and HVAC & Refrigeration Equipment and mid-single-digit growth in Specialty Products. In BMS, we saw strong growth across our controls, fire detection, and security businesses.","In HVAC & Refrigeration Equipment, global residential HVAC, which does include sales through our consolidated Hitachi JVs, primarily in Japan and Taiwan, grew high-single-digits in the quarter. Our North America residential HVAC revenue grew in the low-double-digits despite a tough low-double-digit compare in the prior year.","Favorable weather in the latter part of the quarter drove higher replacement demand, and we are seeing strong price realization in the channel. Based on continued favorable weather trends, we do expect strong North America residential market demand will continue in Q4.","Global light commercial HVAC grew mid-single-digits in the quarter led by high-teens growth in North America on a relatively easy prior year compare, but this does reflect strong growth in our national accounts.","Our VRF business saw high-single-digit growth in the quarter with strong double-digit growth in our unconsolidated Hitachi joint ventures in China, which continue to perform exceptionally well. IR also had a strong quarter with high-teens growth, and our applied HVAC equipment business grew high-single-digits led by solid growth in APAC and North America, partially offset by a decline in EMEA\/LA.","Mid-single-digit growth in Specialty Products was driven by increased demand for fire suppression with solid growth in EMEA\/LA and APAC, partially offset by a modest decline in North America on a tough prior year compare.","Segment EBITA of $441 million was up 11% excluding the impact of Scott Safety. The reported segment EBITA margin declined 30 basis point, but this includes a 90 basis point headwind related to Scott Safety.","Underlying margins expanded 60 basis points to 18.2% as higher volume leverage and the benefits of cost synergy and productivity save was partially offset by 70 basis points of continued product and channel investment. As mentioned earlier, price cost inflected positive in the third quarter, but really didn't have a significant impact on the margin rates in Q3.","So let's move to slide 13 in Power Solutions. Sales of $1.8 billion increased 10% organically, driven by higher unit shipments as well as favorable price and technology mix. Global battery shipments increased 6% year-over-year with both OE and aftermarket up 6%.","The growth in OE shipments outpaced market growth as we began shipping units on several new business wins, which we expect to continue over the next several quarters. Aftermarket shipments increased 6% driven primarily by higher demand in Europe, reflecting a benefit of a modest pull forward in customer orders as lead prices began to rise toward the end of the third quarter.","Growth in the China aftermarket channel was also strong. We continue to outperform in the China market with units up 30% in both OE and aftermarket as well as across the various technologies. Global shipments of start-stop batteries increased 30% year-over-year with strong growth in the Americas, China and EMEA\/LA.","Segment EBITA of $310 million increased 7% organically. EBITA margin declined 200 basis points to 16.9%, but this includes a 150-basis-point headwind from FX and lead. Power's underlying margin declined 50 basis points as the higher volume leverage, favorable mix and productivity save were more than offset by planned product investments, startup and launch costs and the continued headwinds from higher transportation and logistic costs.","Freight costs do remain at an elevated level; and although, we made further progress in our pricing and productivity initiatives in Q3, we did not fully offset these costs. Looking to Q4, we expect continued margin pressure related to transportation costs in Power Solutions.","So turning to slide 14, Corporate expense was down 16% year-on-year to $102 million as we continue to see the benefits of the synergy and productivity savings. For the full year, we now expect Corporate expense to be approximately $415 million, slightly below the low end of the range we previously provided.","So turning to cash flow on slide 15, we generated free cash flow of roughly $450 million in the quarter. Excluding approximately $200 million of planned integration and restructuring cash as well as a planned non-recurring tax payment, Q3 adjusted free cash flow was approximately $650 million; two back-to-back quarters of very solid cash flow performance.","Year-to-date adjusted free cash flow is now $1 billion, up $800 million over the prior year. We are very pleased with our Q3 progress and are on track to deliver our 80%-plus adjusted free cash flow conversion for the year, excluding the net one-time items we've previously discussed with you. It is clear that our cash management office now has traction across the enterprise and is making improvements on various trade working capital initiatives and aggressively managing our CapEx spend.","Turning to the balance sheet on slide 16, our balance sheet position continues to improve with net debt down $150 million, sequentially, to $11.7 billion. Our net debt to EBITDA leverage of 2.4 is well within our target range and our net debt to cap declined slightly to 36%.","During the quarter, we purchased 1.6 million shares for approximately $60 million, in line with our normal pattern, and this brings our year-to-date to repurchasing 6.5 million shares for just over $250 million. Our outlook for Q4 assumes another $50 million of share repurchases, which will bring the full year to around $300 million, consistent with our original plan.","On slide 17, let me touch on just a couple of other items. Our Q3 results do include a favorable impact from a lower effective tax rate. At the beginning of the year, we expected our fiscal 2018 rate to be 14%. Given additional tax planning specific to fiscal 2018, we now expect our annual tax rate to be 13%. This resulted in a $0.01 benefit in the quarter versus our planned rate of 14%. I would also point out that the benefit for Q1 and Q2 has been excluded from our Q3 results and reported as a special item only for this quarter. We do expect the tax rate for Q4 to also be 13% as well as the full year, which will result in a $0.03 benefit versus our previous guidance.","Finally, I wanted to touch on a new revenue recognition Accounting Standard that will become effective for Johnson Controls in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. The impact of this Standard on our Buildings business is not significant. For Power Solutions, although there is no material EBIT impact, the reporting classification of battery core returns changes and will now be included as an increase to sales versus a contra cost of sales item, thereby grossing up sales and impacting our EBITA margin rate by 200-plus basis points.","Again, this will be effective for Johnson Controls beginning the first quarter of next year and we will provide disclosure on a quarterly basis regarding the revenue gross-up and the related EBITA margin rate impact.","With that, let me turn the call back over to George.","George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc","Thanks, Brian. Before we open up the lines for questions, I wanted to provide a quick update on the tariffs and make a few comments regarding our full year outlook.","Starting with slide 18, retaliatory tariffs related to Section 232 Steel and Aluminum were announced at the end of May. As I mentioned on our last earnings call, the direct impact related to steel and aluminum tariffs are nominal and will be fully offset. In terms of Section 301, the first phase of tariffs was enacted in early July. A second phase is currently under comment period. Given the evolving changes, we continue to monitor developments and update our analysis. Included in the tariffs are compressors, electronics, motors and valves, which impact our Buildings businesses. As I mentioned last quarter, we do not expect much of an impact at all in Power Solutions.","As part of our ongoing assessment, we are simultaneously identifying mitigating actions to minimize any direct impact. We expect minimal impact in Q4. As we look further ahead, we are well-positioned given our existing global and regional supply chain and sourcing strategies. Additionally, we are actively managing price, both within the Supply Chain and externally. Based on the analysis we have done so far related to our exposure and mitigating actions, we have already worked this down to a very manageable level. We will continue to monitor developments.","Turning to slide 19, let me take a minute to highlight a few changes to our underlying assumptions as it relates to our full year guidance. As I mentioned earlier, our operating performance is gaining momentum and we expect an incremental $0.06 benefit related to higher revenue growth.","Given our traction with the incremental adds to the sales force, and the productivity we are gaining from our new and existing sales force, our overall investments will be about $0.03 higher than previously planned. Additionally, as Brian mentioned, transportation costs continue to rise, which drives an incremental $0.01 of pressure net of cost recovery. As you can see in the last column, there are various puts and takes between FX and below-the-line items which net a $0.01 benefit. This takes the midpoint of our previous range to $2.81. We are tightening our full year guidance range for diluted earnings per share before special items to $2.80 to $2.82.","Again, I am pleased with the underlying momentum in our operations and the improvement in the fundamentals we have been able to achieve this year.","Operator, please open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Steven Winoker, UBS Financial. Your line is now open.","Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks very much. Good morning.","Antonella Franzen - Johnson Controls International Plc","Good morning, Steve.","George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc","Good morning, Steve.","Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC","Hey, so it's good to see the growth, but I want to focus on free cash flow, given I think, George, you said it's how you started most of your meetings. The step up that is implied in the fourth quarter to hit that 80%-plus number, I think it's about $1.1 billion, if my math is right, which is \u2013 sounds like the same as last year. But last year, you also had some puts and takes around inventory, et cetera, in the fourth quarter. What are some of those dynamics in this fourth quarter? And maybe you could put that, also, in context of some of the initiatives and actions that are in place.","Brian J. Stief - Johnson Controls International Plc","Yeah, Steve, you're right. Last year in the fourth quarter, we generated $1.1 billion and the implied fourth quarter based upon our 80%-plus this year is also $1.1 billion.","Last year, we did have the benefit of having a $100 million reduction in inventory related to the build that we saw in Q3 last year. And there was also a $100 million reduction in the fourth quarter of last year for receivables. So you could argue that the comparable number is really $900 million last year going to $1.1 billion this year.","There's really three buckets that bridge that for you. There's probably about $50 million, round numbers, in growth just in income. There's another $50 million that we've got line of sight to in Power Solutions inventory flushing in the quarter. And then, there's another $100 million of very specific CMO initiatives that we've got planned for Q4. So that really kind of bridges you to the $1.1 billion that we expect this year to get us to the 80%-plus free cash flow.","Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. That's helpful. On the Building Solutions North America front, you mentioned a lower gross margin conversion on the backlog. Are we \u2013 how far through are we kind of the pre current regime new pricing approach? I'm just trying to get a sense for what kind of product I'm looking at in terms of \u2013 I mean, what kind of pricing levels I'm looking at here, or were there cost issues or \u2013 maybe dig into that a little bit for us?","George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc","Yeah, Steve, George here. When we started the year, we laid out that we had roughly about 75 basis points of pressure in our backlog in North America. And with that, we laid out a plan here to be much more disciplined in how we're pricing projects and through the year that we'd be able to turn positive.","So through the year, that would have amounted to about $40 million of pressure coming through 2018. And about three-quarters of that was felt in the first two quarters. We did see some impact in the third quarter and that's going to \u2013 we have a little bit of an impact in the fourth quarter.","What's important to note is that the orders that we booked in the year were up about 70 basis points since the beginning of the year that we put into backlog. And more recently, in the quarter we're up 110 basis points. And so, we feel very good about being able to \u2013 as we get through this year, position for 2019, that our margin rates will continue to accrete now on a go forward basis with the mix that we put into backlog, with the service mix, and feel very good about that as we move forward.","And this has been driven by \u2013 we changed the incentive plan this year not only in line with delivering on the revenue or the booked orders, but also making sure that we're focused on booked margins.","Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. That's helpful. Just before I pass it on, one more question, George. It's been \u2013 I guess it's been almost two years since the Tyco deal closed with JCI, so we're normally well into kind of the cost side on synergies. It sounds like revenue is starting to pick up. Maybe just give us a little of an assessment of where you see things as you kind of stand apart in terms of the road map, how far we are \u2013 how much \u2013 how far you say we have to go, that kind of thing.","George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc","Yeah. What I would say is when we started the year, we knew that we had \u2013 this was going to be a transitional year. We had lots of headwinds that we needed to overcome; and then, from an operational standpoint, making sure that we're positioned not only for growth, but continued margin improvement across all of the businesses.","And what I would tell you, Steve, I'm very pleased with the progress we've made, with the way the team has come together and really focused on fundamentals of the business. We've created this growth machine on the front-end and our ability to be able to not only add capacity, but make sure that we're getting productivity out of that capacity. And that's playing out extremely well. We're getting 8% booked orders in Buildings; and the work that we've done in Power, we've been able to add new platform wins in Power. So that is going extremely well.","In the Field businesses, we knew that we needed to pick up service because, with the installed base that we create, we create a lot of value not only for our customers, but for our shareholders with the service growth. We've created a service council and that is going extremely well. And we're going to continue to accelerate there.","We've put a big focus on price cost and, although we've had headwind in the first half, I think you can see from the results we've made a lot of progress here over the last nine months. And I'm confident that on a go-forward basis, strategically, we're going to be pricing ahead of cost on a go-forward basis.","And then, on the productivity and synergies, we have executed well on the integration and been able to achieve or perform at what we thought we would be able to achieve when we started the merger. I believe that, although we've made a lot of progress now as we've been able to focus the organization on fundamentals, there's still a lot of room for improvement as we continue to not only drive growth, but continue to drive our margin structures to be able to deliver accretive margin rates.","Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Nigel Coe, Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.","Nigel Coe - Wolfe Research LLC","Thanks. Good morning and congratulations, George, on a good quarter.","Antonella Franzen - Johnson Controls International Plc","Thanks, Nigel.","Nigel Coe - Wolfe Research LLC","Yeah. So just wanted to turn to the portfolio, and I understand that probably there's been some reports of interest on (29:47) probably on the call, but maybe just talk about \u2013 maybe this is a question for Brian. You've got a large NOL and I'm wondering that if you do decide to spin or sell this asset, to what extent do you think you can utilize that NOL against any gain that you might realize on the sale?","Brian J. Stief - Johnson Controls International Plc","Yeah. The NOL that exists today would not be available to be used against any gain on the transaction, so \u2013 it's specific by jurisdiction, right, so we'd have to unpack all that. But right now, I think we'd look at the major NOL that's disclosed in the footnotes to the financials, which I assume you're referring to, and that would not be available in a meaningful way to offset the tax costs.","Nigel Coe - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay, okay. And then, just to follow-on, sticking with Power, so with the revised guidance for this year, and then the impact of the new Account Standard on revenues, are we looking at maybe a 16% to 17% margin for next year, all things being equal? Is that a normalized margin run rate for Power going forward or do you still think high-teens is where this business contracts?","Brian J. Stief - Johnson Controls International Plc","You're referring to the Power Solutions margins?","Nigel Coe - Wolfe Research LLC","Yes.","Brian J. Stief - Johnson Controls International Plc","Power Solutions \u2013 the impact of the new standard in fiscal 2019 will be between 200 basis points and 240 basis points, in that range. I mean, it's a gross-up of about 10% to 15% on revenue, and so you do that math off this year's expected margins and that's where we would expect to be in fiscal 2019, plus or minus.","Nigel Coe - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question, Jeffrey Sprague, Vertical Research Partners. Your line is now open.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Thank you, good morning.","Antonella Franzen - Johnson Controls International Plc","Good morning.","George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc","Good morning, Jeff.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Good morning, everybody. Hey, just back to Power, just the nature of the deal with Tyco, the inversion and the like, I thought that precluded the ability to do a tax-free spin possibly for a five-year timeframe. Should we assume, if you're moving forward to spin, you've found some way to make it tax free, or is there the possibility that we could be looking at a taxable spin here?","Brian J. Stief - Johnson Controls International Plc","So Jeff, when we were referring to the five-year limitation in order to do a tax-efficient spin, that would be based upon a straightforward spin of the Power Solutions business in September of 2021 or beyond. There are structured transactions that could be put together that would potentially allow a spin prior to that time, but when you put together a transaction of that nature, it would be very complex and there could very well be tax risk associated with that structure. And so, one of the things that we're doing as part of this evaluation of our options is also evaluating any tax risk that would be associated with a structured spin. And so, it's an option, but we're evaluating it in line with the other options that are on the table.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","I guess I would take that to then maybe believe the offer on the outright sale side is not that appealing, the fact that you're going down that path?","George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc","No. I mean, as we said right from the start, I mean, this is a great business that \u2013 the business is performing well. We're continuing to gain market share. We've got a strong industry position, Jeff, and the fundamentals are, although we've been a little bit pressured here this year because of transportation, are positioned well here for a long-term. And so, as we have looked at this business and with the strategic review we announced back in March, I would say that we're very pleased with the significant progress we have made with this review.","As we said in our prepared remarks, we're looking at multiple options: spin, sale versus retaining it. We have been evaluating, as Brian discussed, a tax-efficient spin and, in parallel, discussing with potential buyers. And we do expect, with the progress we've made, that we'll be able to be more definitive here by the release of our Q4 earnings. And so, I think at this point, we don't want to make any further comments until a specific determination has been made, but I would tell you that I'm very pleased with the progress the team has made.","Brian J. Stief - Johnson Controls International Plc","I wouldn't read anything into it, Jeff. I think we continue to look at all the options. I wouldn't read anything into the spin versus sale. I think we're trying to look at everything on a detailed basis and we'll conclude that review some time before our earnings call in Q4.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Thanks. Totally unrelated, if I could ask another one, just interestingly today, Fortive is spending 20-25 times EBITDA for a business that pulls data off of equipment for facilities management, asset management, and the like. I would think some of that type of information comes off of BMS; some of it might even \u2013 some of those capabilities might be resident inside of BMS. I'm not expecting that you saw this Fortive deal this morning, but do you have the capabilities to do that sort of thing in your existing business? And perhaps, give us a little color on that if you do.","George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc","Sure. As we have put the businesses together, Jeff, we have an incredible position with our Building Management Systems. And as you've seen the growth as we go-to-market today in multiple systems, we've had strong high-single-digit growth across all of our Building Management Systems. In parallel to that, we're putting all of those systems together into an integrated platform. And we are making incredible progress in being able to simplify the platform, be able to set it up so that we can collect all of the data not only off our platforms, but any other systems that connect to our Building Management, and we can now tailor specific solutions to each of the verticals that we support, depending on the problem that customers want to solve.","We're going to \u2013 on a go-forward basis, because of the growth that we're achieving in this space, the investments that we're making organically, we're going to be positioned to be able to segment this revenue to show that it is beginning to accelerate in the strategy of putting these businesses together. We're going to be positioned extremely well to be able to support the building in incorporating all of the data that's collected within a building.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell from Barclays. Your line is now open.","Julian Mitchell - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning. Maybe just starting on the Buildings business, George, as you said, you've had some sort of clean-up work to do around gross margins and such over the past nine months or so, but when you're looking forward on Buildings with those issues behind you now that the entity has got to grips with price cost, what kind of incremental margins do you think Buildings can generate with this portfolio mix, leaving aside any remaining cost synergies from the transaction?","George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc","Like I said, I'm very pleased with the progress we're making. When you look at our margin structure about \u2013 when you look at our product businesses, we're getting nice leverage on our product businesses with the strong growth that we're achieving and the volume mix and productivity is offsetting a significant reinvestment in that business; and that business was up 60 basis points net of that. And so, we see that continuing with the reinvestments that we're making.","When you look at the Field businesses, we have, as we discussed, significantly improved our service businesses. We've been focusing not only in segmenting the markets that we serve, building out the sales force, and then building out our field capacity with our technicians. And I would tell you, based on where we started at the beginning of the year and where we are today, we have made incredible progress. We have an installed base that's second to none to be able to mine and be able to build services. The growth that we've achieved in the first half was about 3%. We ramped up to 5% in the third quarter and I see that continuing going forward.","And then, the other piece of that is how we're booking installation projects across the board. We're booking at a higher rate, making sure that our sales force is focused on the value that we deliver with the projects that we deploy and ultimately execute on. And with the progress we've made in \u2013 I highlighted North America up over 110 basis points in the quarter. The combination of the higher book margins in backlog, the service mix and the leverage we're getting on our technology and investments in our products, the three will combine to very attractive margin accretion here as we go forward.","Julian Mitchell - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you very much. And then, my second and last question would just be around the EMEA and Latin America region, specifically. The margins there are some way below the other two regions within Building Solutions. Do you see that as anything structural or it just requires a lot of heavy lifting and self-help and you should be able to get to the mid-teens margin range in the medium-term?","George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc","Yeah. Our team in EMEA\/LA has done an incredible job as we took the businesses, put them together and we've gone through a very large restructure here over the last year. If you look at the overall performance, although it's flat, organic sales in the quarter, service was up 3% and that will continue. Install was down because we did have a lower backlog within our HVAC and Industrial Refrigeration.","The orders in the quarter was up 15%, and that's with strong demand both in Industrial Refrigeration and Fire & Security. I have complete confidence with the work \u2013 and then, when you look at margins, although reported they're up 60 basis points, they're up 100 basis points ex-FX.","With the work that we've done to restructure the business, with the volume that's beginning to come through, we're going to be in a good position here to be able to get much more leverage and to get to much more respectable margin rates on a go-forward basis. And so, I feel very good about the progress we've made over the last nine months.","Julian Mitchell - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question is from Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thanks. Good morning, everyone.","Antonella Franzen - Johnson Controls International Plc","Good morning.","George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc","Good morning, Joe.","Brian J. Stief - Johnson Controls International Plc","Good morning.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","So obviously, really nice to see the organic growth acceleration and the investments paying off. George, maybe you can touch on what you think the incremental investment will be in 2019. Where do you plan to continue to invest, whether it be in the sales force or on the product channel side?","George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc","Yes, so as a percent of revenue, we're going to begin to see leverage on all of these costs as we go into 2019. So recall, this year as we started the year, we were relatively flat last year in our sales force. And so, we've had a significant ramp up here through the course of the year. We have a lot of \u2013 from a mix standpoint, we have a lot of new sales leaders and sales people that are now getting up to speed. We're seeing tremendous momentum.","And so, on a go-forward basis from a sales standpoint, we now have segmentation of the markets that we're serving. We're making sure we have the right footprint and that we're getting not only the productivity, but we're adding in line with the market growth that we expect. So we've made a lot of progress this year. So on a go-forward basis, you'll see much more leverage on that cost that we've put into place this year and we'll be adding sales to offset attrition and be able to get net productivity and then some incremental sales adds to that. So on that basis, I feel a lot of improvement here as we go forward.","On the Products side, as you can see, we're getting tremendous results from the investments that we've made over the last two or three years. And so, I see, as a percentage of revenue, we're going to continue to accelerate our revenue growth and the incremental reinvestment will be levered. We're not \u2013 as a percent of revenue will continue to come down. And so, we're beyond where we're adding or reinvesting more heavily than our revenue is growing. I believe that we're now at that peak where we start to see leverage on the investments we're making.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. That's good to hear. And I guess my follow on question, as you kind of think about cash flow next year, obviously there are a bunch of one-time items that you guys have highlighted this year, roughly $800 million to $900 million that are excluded from the cash flow number. How does that number step down in 2019? And are there other opportunities from a working capital perspective that you're working on as well for 2019?","Brian J. Stief - Johnson Controls International Plc","Yes. So as far as 2019, you probably recall we did make a payment related to the Adient spin that was like $1.2 billion or $1.3 billion, and we knew that we were going to get that back in a couple of tranches, one of which we'll get back either in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 or the first quarter of 2020. Assuming we get that back in the fourth quarter \u2013 and the reason there's a question on that is because the refund is in that $600 million to $700 million range. And given the size of that, it needs to get special committee approval in order to release that refund to Johnson Controls. And so, we think we'll get it in the fourth quarter, but it could move into the first quarter of 2020.","Given that inflow of cash and given the one-time special items that we've got for ongoing restructuring and integration, clearly our adjustments in 2019 should be favorable relative to where we've been historically. So our reported cash flow in fiscal 2019 should actually be better than the adjusted cash flow, because we'll adjust out the one-time refund we get related to the Adient tax payment.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rich Kwas from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi, good morning, all.","Antonella Franzen - Johnson Controls International Plc","Good morning.","Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","George, on revenue synergies relative to the $500 million that was talked about a couple of years ago, how much would you say has been realized to-date at this point?","George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc","So we're tracking well. Originally, when we started we had identified it was about $0.5 billion to $1 billion over time that we'd be able to achieve. I'd say, as we've integrated the teams, we have a much more seamless structure as we're working \u2013 as the businesses have come together. I think when you look at our pipeline of opportunities, our pipeline is up over double digit pretty much across the board. And this is a result of these teams now working together. We've segmented the markets to make sure that we're positioned to serve the markets appropriately to capitalize on the growth. The leads come in into a central process, and now the teams are executing well. So it's hard to begin to segment that because now we're operating seamlessly, but I would tell you from a pipeline development it's been a big contributor to being able to create that base that we're working to be able to convert into orders.","Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","So is the way to think about this is there's probably not that much in current backlog, but your quoting staff and that's a function of this targeted focus combining the teams, etcetera. So as yet \u2013 more or less yet to come in the backlog?","George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc","Yeah, we're beginning to see it. I would tell you that if you look at Fire & Security, Fire & Security businesses are up mid-single digits across the board. And I think this is a result of the strong footprint that we had with the customers that we're serving within HVAC & Controls and being able to bring in Fire & Security. So we've had very strong growth in our Fire products with fire detection and suppression up high single digits. And then, when you look at \u2013 Security is still up, but up to kind of low to mid-single digits. That is definitely a reflection of these synergies that we're getting in the sales force in being able to create those leads.","Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Okay. And then, just a quick follow-up on \u2013 can you level set us on China, your exposure in Building Solutions percentage of sales. Obviously, that's going to be a headwind here for the time being. How much is that going to eat into some of the improvement you're starting to see in North America on margins as we think about 2019?","George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc","Yeah. I'd start by saying we have a extremely strong position in China, both commercially as well as with our residential HVAC. And that's combined with our strong partnerships that we have, our JV partnerships. As Brian talked a little bit about, there are some new competitors. Some of those are local competitors. We are positioned well locally with how we're not only designing new products, but also with our supply chain and manufacturing footprint and being able to serve the market. We are \u2013 we have, like I said, a strong position and we're continuing to invest, and I believe from a cost structure standpoint we're going to be well positioned to be able to continue to deliver there.","Short term, we have seen some projects that have come through at lower margins, but I don't believe that that's systemic. I believe that the work we're doing, we're going to be able to continue to grow and continue to grow profitably, and we're going to continue to invest.","Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Next question is from Deane Dray, RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Antonella Franzen - Johnson Controls International Plc","Good morning, Deane.","George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc","Good morning.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, there's lots of discussion about the investments in the sales force. I'm just \u2013 I'd be curious to hear what is the typical timeframe for a new salesperson? When do they start being productive? And then, a bit more about the allocation of these resources, are they going after new customers, like middle market? Are they generalists? Is there specialty sales? And maybe some color there because this is a significant investment that you've laid out.","George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc","Yeah. So, Deane, we started right out of the gate this year. This was our top focus here. We've lead it with a sales leadership council. We've made incredible progress and it starts with understanding our markets and how we serve our markets, and then making sure that we've got the right sales structure to be able to serve the markets. We've made a tremendous amount of changes in doing that, and then understand, now, where we're adding, we see line of sight to significant growth.","And so, with the adds we've made, it typically depends on whether it be installed projects or enterprise type projects, versus, let's say, T&M and service. So there's a varying level of skill sets that we're recruiting to be able to capitalize on what we see as the biggest opportunities.","So the cycle time of getting a sales \u2013 a new salesperson up to speed, it can be months in the service side or it can be one to two years, depending on the complexity of project sales that we're doing. And so, I would tell you, is that we have metrics across the board.","We're actually ahead of our metrics on the onboarding and then the production that we're getting out of our new sales force as well as getting strong performance out of our veteran sales force. And so, what I would tell you is that, based on where we started the year, where we are, we're actually ahead of where we thought we would be.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. And just one follow up on Power, and I can imagine what the answer is, but just \u2013 it's worth asking is \u2013 you're in this period of, I'll use the word, limbo on the disposition or potential retention of Power. Have you lost any talent? Are the OEs \u2013 with the feedback from them of any of your competitors making inroads and using that against you? Doesn't seem like it is, especially in China, but it's worth asking.","George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc","Not at all. I mean, let me start \u2013 go back to \u2013 this is a great business. The people in the business are very proud of the business and very passionate about what they do. We're winning across the board. We're winning in both OE as well as aftermarket. We're winning across the regions, gaining share. The team is executing well.","We've minimized the distraction that this has caused within the business. And so, when you have a business like this that is positioned well for a long term, you've got leaders that are very committed and very passionate and are very understanding that as we go through this process, we want to minimize disruption. So we have not seen significant attrition as a result.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","That's helpful. Thank you.","Antonella Franzen - Johnson Controls International Plc","Thanks.","George R. Oliver - Johnson Controls International Plc","Thanks, Deane.","Antonella Franzen - Johnson Controls International Plc","Operator, I'd like to turn the call over to George for some closing comments.","George R.

In discussing our results during the call, references to adjusted EBITA and adjusted EBIT margins exclude restructuring and integration costs as well as other special items.","These metrics are non-GAAP measures and are reconciled in the schedules attached to our press release and in the appendix to the presentation posted on our website. Additionally, all comparisons to the prior year are on a continuing ops basis excluding the results of Power Solutions.","GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to Johnson Controls\u2019 ordinary shareholders was $0.77 for the quarter and included a net charge of $0.01 related to special items which Brian will address in his comments. Adjusting for these special items, non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.78 per share compared to $0.57 in the prior-year quarter.","Now, let me turn the call over to George.","George Oliver","Thanks Antonella and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us on today's call. Before I get into the details of the quarter, I thought I would kick things off with a quick look back at our year to recap some of our strategic initiatives and financial commitments.","Starting with Slide 3, one of the most significant strategic achievements in 2019 was the successful divestiture of Power Solutions and the subsequent capital deployment actions. I am extremely pleased with our execution from start to finish. Large transactions like this never go completely as planned and usually take longer than expected to execute. Our teams effectively navigated the transaction process, monetizing the business with lower-than-expected tax leakage, resulting in net cash proceeds of $11.6 billion.","As we discussed last quarter, we quickly began redeploying the proceeds within weeks following the close of the transaction. Including the use of those proceeds, we were able to meet an aggressive capital allocation commitment, deleveraging our balance sheet, and returning a significant amount of capital to our shareholders.","In 2019, we were able to pay down nearly $4 billion in debt and completed $6 billion in share repurchases, buying back over 150 million shares with just over 17% of our shares outstanding. Perhaps even more important to the long-term strategy of the company, the sale of Power Solutions completed our transformation to a pure-play buildings company. As we move forward, we will continue to strengthen our core, increase profitability and accelerate growth in digital solutions across all aspects of the company.","Our broad portfolio of smart edge devices, connected equipment and systems and cloud-based applications and data analytics capabilities provides Johnson Controls a unique competitive advantage and market-leading position, as customers increasingly seek outcome-based solutions.","The strength of our capabilities combined with our large installed base and trusted customer relationships provides us with unparalleled industry expertise and thought leadership with the most advanced digital innovation. That innovation captures untapped value for our customers and positions Johnson Controls as the preferred partner for their digital transformation.","From delivering better patient outcomes in hospitals to creating better learning environments in schools or defining new exciting fan experiences in the world's most advanced stadiums, we have the unique position to power the goals and missions of our customers.","As we move further into the next phase of our strategy, I was pleased to announce the addition of Mike Ellis to our team in a newly created role, as Chief Customer and Digital Officer. Mike brings an incredible amount of industry knowledge and leadership with a deep expertise in software and connected solutions.","Mike's primary responsibility will be to accelerate our digital strategy and execution across all business units, regions and functions within JCI and ultimately to expand our service offerings. In addition to Mike's announcement, we also made two other significant changes to our executive leadership team during the quarter.","In late July, we announced that Jeff Williams would transition from his role leading our EMEA\/LA Field segment to lead Global Products. Jeff's proven leadership abilities and operational expertise will drive improved underlying fundamentals as well as innovation and new product growth.","At the end of September, we announced Jeff's successor in EMEA\/LA with the appointment of Tomas Brannemo, who joins us from Xylem, where he led global operations and oversaw key functions across their European businesses. Tomas brings a diverse background in project and service businesses as well as strategy and will play a critical role in driving growth and increased profitability as we go forward.","Also as you may have seen this morning, as Brian enters his last year as Chief Financial Officer of JCI, we have appointed him as Vice Chairman. The Board will begin a process to identify Brian's successor, including an external search to allow for an orderly and smooth transition.","Lastly, I am very proud of what the teams around the globe have accomplished over the course of fiscal 2019 to improve the underlying fundamentals, drive innovation and new product development, strength in talent management and further enhance commercial excellence across the organization, all while optimizing our cost structure.","Now let's turn quickly to our financial commitment and scorecard for the year on Slide 4. I won't spend a lot of time on each of these. But in addition to some of the strategic priorities we just discussed, we met or exceeded each of the financial targets we set at the beginning of the year: strong growth in orders and top line revenue, solid margin expansion, and free cash flow conversion ahead of our guidance.","Turning to some of the highlights for the quarter, starting with orders on Slide 5. We had another quarter of solid mid-single digit order growth despite our most difficult quarterly comp of the year at plus 9%.","Our order pipeline remains robust with an attractive mix of service and a balanced profile of small and large projects. Backlog ended the quarter at $8.9 billion, up 8% organically versus the prior year, which provides high visibility into 2020.","Turning now to Slide 6 for a quick recap of the financial results. Sales of $6.3 billion increased 3% on an organic basis with solid growth across the Field businesses led by high single-digit growth in Commercial HVAC.","Adjusted EBIT of $812 million grew 8% on a reported basis including a $10 million headwind from FX in the quarter. On an organic basis, adjusted EBIT grew 10%, driven by solid 7% growth in segment profit as well as lower corporate and amortization expense.","Overall underlying EBIT margins expanded 80 basis points year-over-year on both a reported and organic basis. Adjusted EPS of $0.78 increased 37% over the prior year with solid operational performance and a significant contribution from the capital deployment actions related to the utilization of the Power Solutions sale proceeds.","Adjusted free cash flow increased 25% over the prior year to just over $1 billion in the quarter. Full year adjusted free cash flow was $1.7 billion representing 99% conversion.","With that, I will turn it over to Brian to discuss our performance in more detail.","Brian Stief","Thanks George and good morning everyone. So, let's get started with the year-over-year bridge of EPS on Slide 7. As you can see our operational performance including synergies and productivity save contributed $0.09 and this was partially offset by $0.01 of investments.","We also benefited in the quarter from the redeployment of the Power Solutions proceeds from both the share count and net financing charge perspective which added $0.12 and $0.05 respectively. And below-the-line items netted to a $0.04 headwind which resulted in fourth quarter EPS of $0.78 which was up 37% year-on-year.","So, let's move to Slide 8 and take a look at segment results on a consolidated basis. You can see sales of $6.3 billion increased 3% on an organic basis and this was led by 4% in our Field businesses. And this is partially offset by some softness in our Product businesses which was flat in the quarter.","I would point out that in Q4; we were facing our most difficult comp from the prior year up 8% in aggregate with every segment facing its toughest comp. Within the Field businesses, total service revenues grew 4% in the quarter which was consistent growth across all three regions.","As you know growing and expanding our service offerings has been an area of significant internal focus and we've now established a consistent cadence of mid-single-digit growth for the past two years. Going forward we look to augment our service growth, enabled by digital solutions to continue driving similar growth level in service. As you know our service business represents just over $6 billion in revenues, which is about 40% of our field revenue base and this provides us with a very profitable, resilient revenue stream as we move forward.","We continue to convert our project backlog in Q4 as well driving install revenue, up 4% and this was solid growth across all regions. Segment EBITDA of $990 million grew 7% organically and this was driven by the volume leverage from the field, strong price cost realization and products and our ongoing productivity and synergy save.","Lastly, Q4 segment EBITDA margin expanded 60 basis points to 15.8%. And as you can see in our margin waterfall, underlying operational improvement contributed 100 basis points. And this was partially offset by some product and run rate sales force investments as well as a minor headwind through pension and other items. So let's review each segment in more detail.","Turning to Slide 9 in North America. North America sales grew 3% organically against an 8% prior year compare and this was driven by continued growth in both install and service activity. The growth was led by strength in applied HVAC and Controls businesses, which increased high single-digits again in Q4.","Fire & Security grew low single-digits with balanced growth in both install and service. I would note that Performance Solutions declined mid-teens in the quarter. This was due primarily to a high teens comp in the prior year.","North America adjusted EBITDA increased 6% and EBITDA margin expanded 40 basis points to 14.9%. This was driven by favorable volume leverage as well as synergy and productivity save.","And as expected the mix headwinds we faced in Q3 this year eased substantially. Although HVAC again outgrew the Fire & Security businesses, putting pressure on mix in Q4, this was offset by higher growth in service.","Orders in North America were very strong, up 7% led by Fire & Security, up strong double-digits and applied HVAC, up mid-single-digits. Orders in Performance Solutions declined 3% due primarily to the timing of some large project awards. Backlog of $5.8 billion increased 8% year-over-year.","So let's move to EMEA\/LA on Slide 10. Sales in EMEA\/LA grew 4% organically with service up 4% and install up 5%. Growth was positive across most regions except for the Middle East where we continue to see pressure. Europe grew mid-single digits in the quarter led by low double-digit growth in our Industrial Refrigeration business and both Fire & Security and HVAC and Controls grew low single-digits.","In the Middle East, revenues declined mid-single digits as solid growth in our service activity was more than offset by continued softness in HVAC, project installs and Fire & Security. In Latin America revenues increased mid-teens with growth across most lines of business led primarily by strength in Fire & Security.","EMEA\/LA's adjusted EBITDA increased 17% and EBITDA margin expanded 80 basis points to 11.7% and this includes a 40 basis point headwind for FX. Underlying margins increased a strong 120 basis points in the quarter as favorable volume and productivity and synergy save more than offset the run rate impact of our previous salesforce additions.","Orders in EMEA\/LA increased 3% which was led by continued strength in Latin America across both install and service. And orders in Europe grew low single-digits in the quarter. Backlog ended up 1.6 -- backlog ended at $1.6 billion, up 10% organically.","So, let's move to APAC on Slide 11. APAC sales grew 7% organically led by higher demand for project installs which grew 9% in the quarter. Install activity was led by continued strength in our core HVAC and BMS platforms with sales in China up low double-digits.","Sales for our core service offerings grew 4% in the quarter including low double-digit growth in China. APAC adjusted EBITDA margins did decline 1% with margins down 100 basis points to 14.2%. Favorable volume leverage was more than offset by higher install mix as well as expected margin pressure.","APAC orders were flat in the quarter as our strong service order growth of 13% was offset by high single-digit decline in install orders. And I would just note this was due primarily to order delays as a result of the unrest in Hong Kong and ongoing China trade disputes. Backlog in APAC increased 4% year-over-year to $1.5 billion.","Overall, it's clear that the environment in APAC is very competitive and the economic conditions in some areas remain uncertain. Nonetheless given the actions we've taken in fiscal 2019 to drive growth in our service base and also improve the quality of installed jobs and our project execution, we are confident in our ability to grow the topline and improve profitability in fiscal 2020.","So, let's move to Global Products on Slide 12. Global Products growth in the quarter was flat organically versus a strong 9% compared to last year. As we discussed on our Q3 call, we did expect a decline in North American Resi HVAC due to a 20%-plus prior year compare as well as our strong Q2 and Q3 performance this year and resulting Q3 quarter end channel inventory levels.","Having said that the unexpected softness for us was in APAC residential which as a reminder relates to our Hitachi joint venture. This softness resulted in a three percentage points headwind in overall Global Products organic revenue growth for the quarter.","The decline in our Hitachi business was due primarily to market conditions in Japan and Taiwan. And just as a reminder we have market-leading positions in both these countries which together make up over two-thirds of Hitachi's revenue base.","So, let's turn to the individual platforms within Global Products. We saw BMS grow low single-digits with double-digit growth in Fire Detection and mid-single-digit growth in Controls. Security products were relatively flat year-on-year.","Overall sales in HVAC & Refrigeration Equipment businesses declined less than 1%. Global Residential HVAC declined low double-digits in the quarter, driven by the expected weakness in North America and the previously mentioned softness in APAC. Light commercial unitary grew high single-digits in the quarter with North America, up mid-single-digits.","IR equipment declined mid-single digits in the quarter against a tough prior year compare which was in the upper high teens. VRF had a nice quarter with low double-digit growth and our applied HVAC Parts and Equipment business grew high single-digits reflecting continued strength in our chillers business and the indirect channels for North America and Asia.","And finally, Specialty Products grew mid-single-digits and strong demand for our fire suppression products, particularly in North America. Product segment EBITDA increased 7% and EBITDA margin expanded 130 basis points, as the underabsorption on lower volumes was more than offset by positive price\/cost and the benefit of cost synergy and productivity save. Incremental product and sales force investments were also a slight headwind. Looking to fiscal 2020, we expect sales for Global Products to be in the low single-digit range in Q1 and in the low to mid-single-digit range for the full year.","So let's move to corporate on Slide 13. I continue to be very pleased with the progress we make and overall corporate cost reductions. As you can see corporate expense was down 6% year-over-year to $89 million and this was driven primarily from the benefits of synergy and productivity save as well as the ongoing actions we're taking to reduce cost as a result of the Power Solutions divestiture.","On Slide 14, free cash flow. We reported Q4 cash flow from continuing ops of $800 million. If you exclude the $200 million in one-time cash outflows in the quarter, adjusted free cash flow was up 22% to slightly above $1 billion for Q4. For the full year, we delivered adjusted free cash flow conversion of 99%, this reflects solid performance on trade working capital improvement and continued discipline around our CapEx management actions.","As we look to fiscal 2020, we see adjusted free cash flow conversion of approximately 95% and this excludes $300 million of remaining one-time cash outflows and the $600 million tax refund we've talked to you about in previous quarters, which we expect in the first half of fiscal 2020. As a result, our GAAP free cash flow will exceed our adjusted free cash flow in fiscal 2020.","So let's turn to the balance sheet quickly on Slide 15. Net debt was up slightly in Q4 as we redeployed some of the Power Solutions cash back into share repurchase, which as you can see was nearly $900 million in the quarter.","Before turning it back to George for a look at our fiscal 2020 guidance, I do want to provide some commentary on two significant special items that are outlined on Slide 16. We recorded a non-cash pre-tax loss of $626 million related to our year-end mark-to-market adjustments and this results primarily from lower discount rates associated with our year-end pension and OPEB calculations. Additionally, we recorded a non-cash $586 million tax benefit related to the favorable tax audit adjustments that we saw in the quarter.","So with that let me turn it back over to George.","George Oliver","Thanks Brian. Before we open up the line for questions, I want to provide you with our outlook for 2020. Let's start by walking through the waterfall chart on Slide 17. Overall, we expect low to mid-single-digit organic revenue growth which will drive approximately $0.15 of earnings. Additionally, we will have the continued benefit of synergies and productivity savings which we will realize over the course of the year and will contribute an additional $0.15 of earnings.","As Brian mentioned last quarter, we are moving forward with a plan to continue repurchasing our shares. We expect to deploy approximately $2.2 billion of Power Solutions sale proceeds during the course of fiscal 2020 which is expected to result in an incremental benefit to earnings of about $0.33. This assumes we continue to hold the remaining $1 billion of Power Solutions sale proceeds on hand.","There is -- other small items result in a $0.04 headwind. These items net to our fiscal 2020 EPS guidance range before special items of $2.50 to $2.60. This represents earnings growth in the range of 28% to 33%. And the full details of our guidance is included on Slide 18.","Our guidance is based on strong underlying EBIT growth of 8% to 12%, driven by solid top line performance and synergy and productivity benefits. Lastly, as a portion of the benefit related to the deployment of the Power Solutions sale proceeds will benefit fiscal 2021, I wanted to provide an updated framework for how our earnings are expected to progress as we move forward.","As you can see on Slide 19, the incremental run rate benefit of proceeds deployed in 2020 and a reduction in corporate cost is expected to contribute an incremental $0.06 of earnings. This takes our fiscal 2020 EPS to a range of $2.56 to $2.66 on a run rate basis. This would be prior to the deployment of the remaining $1 billion of Power Solutions sale proceeds as well as any operational growth or benefits from additional capital deployment in 2021.","Over the last two years, we have made significant progress in aligning our portfolio, improving our underlying fundamentals, and reinvesting back into the businesses. As we move forward, it is all about execution and controlling what is in our control.","Although we are watching the macroeconomic environment closely, we feel good about our position entering fiscal 2020 as our backlog provides us visibility in our Field businesses, our service business tends to be more resilient, and we continue to benefit from self-help and our capital deployment. We remain focused on driving execution and delivering for our customers and shareholders.","With that, let me turn it over to our operator to open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will now begin our formal question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question is coming from Gautam Khanna, Cowen & Co. Your line is open.","Gautam Khanna","Hey thanks. Good morning guys.","Antonella Franzen","Good morning Gautam.","George Oliver","Good morning.","Gautam Khanna","So, George I was wondering if you could just talk about the applied HVAC pipeline? What are you seeing in terms of front log if you will projects RFPs, what have you? Any slowdown yet to speak of in that domain?","George Oliver","No. I mean as you've seen we continue to execute very well in the commercial HVAC space. When you look at our revenues in the quarter we're up 8% with strong growth for both applied equipment and service and that was spread across North America and APAC. We've had light commercial unitary up mid- to high single-digits. And a lot of that has been a result of the new products we've been launching with our rooftop products.","If you look at orders, the orders show a 3% in the quarter but that's off a strong plus 9% last year. So that's important to note. And when you look at where that's occurring it's pretty broad-based. So then if you go and look at our pipeline on projects, we continue to have a very strong pipeline that we're working pretty much across the globe and converting and that has given us confidence with the backlog we have going into 2020 and the continued progress we see - continuing maybe a little bit lower on our growth rate mid- to single-digit here through the course of 2020. But I believe that that gives us confidence that we're going to be positioned here to deliver on the commitments we made here in 2020.","Gautam Khanna","Okay. And just a quick follow-up. On consolidation, you guys have kind of earmarked $1 billion for M&A. I just wondered if you could update us on your pipeline there? And do you think there's going to be any broader consolidation, any bigger moves in the space? And just your thoughts on how things might shake out with Ingersoll becoming an independent climate company and CCS spinning. Any thoughts on that? Thank you.","George Oliver","Yes, Gautam. Let me just give you my perspective. I think in any industry there's always opportunity for consolidation. But I think it's been clear based on what we've been doing with the reinvestments we've been making in products with the work that we're doing to build out our channels globally that we're focused on continuing to execute for our customers, being able to build strong pipelines of potential orders converting and ultimately executing.","And I think, as we look at the future and a lot of this is tied to what we talked about with the Chief Customer Digital Officer that we've added, we see an incredible opportunity to take a very strong portfolio and position ourselves to be able to outperform on a go-forward basis. And so that's our focus.","When we look at M&A, we certainly are working pipelines as we look at our each of our product businesses and our regional footprint. And we're opportunistic looking at opportunities that would strengthen our organic investments. But the focus for us is continuing to execute, delivering strong performance and then continuing to do bolt-ons as needed.","Gautam Khanna","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is coming from Nigel Coe, Wolfe Research. Your line is open.","Nigel Coe","Thanks, good morning.","Antonella Franzen","Good morning.","Nigel Coe","George, it sounds like you [indiscernible] your voice sounds bit creaky. So hopefully answer to the questions here. So maybe just talk about pricing broadly speaking. Obviously Asia Pac is a bit more challenging but how are you seeing pricing across the board, especially with raw materials starting to move to and then maybe just comment on price costs and how that shaped up this quarter versus expectations?","George Oliver","Nigel, I'd go back, if you look at the last two years we had a headwind in 2018. And we began to overcome that headwind at late in that year. And that positioned us well for 2019 where we got -- when you look at our top line it was roughly two or three points of the top line growth in 2019. And that contributed to a positive price\/cost in 2019.","Now that being said, as we've set up for 2020, we continue to make sure that we're staying disciplined from a pricing standpoint. And that we're projecting that on the topline, it will contribute about 1% to the overall topline. So, that combined with our productivity and the like will continue to offset inflation and we'll continue to be price cost positive as we go through 2020. It is important to note that with that price the impact to the margin rate is relatively neutral in 2020.","Nigel Coe","Yes, great. Thanks George. And then Brian I wanted to dig into some of the cash flow items for next year. So, you're flagging $0.3 billion of one-time outflows just maybe just talk about that. And then the tax refunds obviously as-expected, but does that came up that item?","And then on the conversion question to what extent is pension income putting pressure on that conversion next year? And then the final point I know there's four points here. There's a large outflow this quarter in disc ops, just wondered if you could just discuss that as well. Thank you.","Brian Stief","So the large outflow in disc ops this year relates to the tax payment that was made associated with the gain on the Power sale. As it relates to the $600 million tax refund, we've kind of been flagging that for several quarters now. We do expect that in the first half of 2020. We're hopeful it's December-January timeframe. But I mean that because of the size of it as we've talked about previously had to go through committee with you. So, we do expect that to come in in the first half of 2020.","And then the $300 million of outflow that we're flagging really relates to prior cash costs -- or current cash cost of prior restructuring charges as well as the ongoing activities that we have to support the $150 million of synergies that we're going to generate related to the $900 million target we've got through fiscal 2020 that we've talked about previously. So, was there one other question there?","Nigel Coe","Sorry yes. The pension income. To what extent is that putting some pressure on conversion?","Brian Stief","Yes, I mean pension income provides some pressure for us as does the joint venture dividends being less than our equity income, but we also get some benefit from our amortization as well. But net-net, I think when we look at our free cash flow conversion target next year at 95% as I think about how that improves on a go-forward basis to get closer to 100%, I would say there's two areas. One would be to close the gap between equity income and our joint venture dividends that we get on an annual basis. And secondly, I still think there's some improvement in trade working capital that will come through continued efforts of our cash management office team around the globe.","Nigel Coe","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","The next question is coming from Jeff Sprague, Vertical Research. Your line is open.","Jeff Sprague","Thank you. Good morning everyone.","Antonella Franzen","Hi Jeff.","George Oliver","Good morning Jeff.","Jeff Sprague","Good morning. Could we dig in a little bit more George into synergy and productivity? And I'm kind of sure at this point of the game just getting a little blurry on what's synergy and what's productivity, but I'd be a little more explicit on what it is you still have yet to capture? What is kind of embedded in that number? And I'm sure you're never going to stop seeking productivity but will this bring that program to a close in 2020?","George Oliver","Yes. So as Brian laid out, we are still positioned here to deliver very strong synergy in addition to productivity here in 2020. On a go-forward basis, when you look at our cost base and our ability to be able to get continuous productivity on that cost base, normal productivity would generate about 30 basis points of net margin expansion","And so our goal is to continue to keep strong pipelines of opportunities to reduce the structural cost. And then from a process standpoint with everything that we do whether it be in our manufacturing product businesses or within our field installation and service business, really driving strong operational improvements on a continuous basis going forward. And so our -- when we project beyond 2020, we're still going to have a very strong pipeline for productivity to continue to expand margins.","Jeff Sprague","And George just looking at backlog I think it goes a little bit to one of the earlier questions, right? Some of the macro indicators for whatever they're worth, right? Dodge starts the ABI, the put-in-place data all is kind of wobbling here. And it really hasn't shown up in your orders or really any of your peers' orders yet. I just wonder, if there's any additional insight you could share on maybe what you think the disconnect is there and your visibility to convert backlog as you look into 2020?","George Oliver","So I would start Jeff by the macro indicators when you look at ABI or Dodge forecast, they do suggest they are a little bit lower but they have stabilized. And when you look at some of the areas where we have strength, obviously institutional, we still believe that that has yet to peak in some of the end markets that we support there. And I think that's driving a lot of the order pipeline and the conversion of that pipeline.","So what I would tell you is that when we projected the year in 2020, we're starting with a nice backlog. We have suggested that the order rate will slow a bit to kind of low mid-single digits based on what we see in the pipeline today. And the two combined is what gives us confidence that we are positioned to be able to deliver kind of low to mid single-digit growth throughout the year.","Certainly we're watching this closely and making sure that from a cost standpoint that we're going to do what's necessary to adjust as needed. And what I would say is that for us, our service business is about a little better than $6 billion globally. And if you've seen our progress in the last two years, we've been able to sustain our growth rate up over 4%.","So we were short of 4% two years ago. And then this past year we're north of 4%. And our goal is that we believe with the installed base that we have that we've built that there's still a tremendous opportunity to build our service business. So at the same time that we're watching the big project in that pipeline and making sure that we're going to be able to adjust appropriately as this plays out, we also are working hard to be able to execute on our service strategy that we believe that if it does soften much we're going to be positioned well with our service franchise to be able to try to make up to some of that softness.","Jeff Sprague","Great. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is coming from Steve Tusa, JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Steve Tusa","Hey, guys. Good morning.","Antonella Franzen","Good morning.","George Oliver","Good morning, Steve.","Steve Tusa","Can you just talk about what you're seeing specifically in China on kind of the larger equipment and services side? Things there for everybody seem to be holding up pretty well. You guys are obviously continuing to lead the pack there to a degree on your growth. So, any color on -- is there any timing here in the next 18 months or this is going to slow down? Is it some project phasing concerns? Or are things -- think things are pretty robust there for the next -- for the foreseeable future?","George Oliver","Yes, let me frame-up China for us Steve. China overall is about 6% of our total company, about $900 million of that is in the Field and $400 million is in Global Products. When you look at the Field business, China is an important market for us in Asia-Pac. It's about 35% 40% of the Asia-Pac region. And we are seeing -- as you said, we are seeing good revenue growth. We had low double-digit organic growth here driven by HVAC equipment as well as our ability to be able to expand our service here in the quarter. And I believe that we are now lapping the tough backlog that we had in margins on a go-forward basis.","Now, that being said, we -- as I was just -- I just spent over a week there, met -- I was in Shanghai, I was in Chongqing. I was in Chengdou and working with the teams and meeting with customers and meeting with the local governments. And I have to admit I left feeling really good that the work that we're doing, we're continuing to make progress. We're positioning our capabilities appropriately to capitalize on the infrastructure, expansion, and the like. And so I don't -- I'd say it's going to continue to grow.","It my temper a bit based on what's happening here with some of the trade wars and the like, but overall, I have to say I feel good about the growth in the China market. We're also going to make sure that we stay competitive not only from a cost standpoint, but in how we create value with the type of projects we go after, but that's my current view Steve.","Steve Tusa","Great. Thanks a lot for all the detail and the comprehensive answer. Thanks.","Operator","The next question is coming from Julian Mitchell, Barclays. Your line is open.","Julian Mitchell","Hi good morning and congratulations Brian on the Vice Chairmanship.","Brian Stief","Thank you. Thank you.","Julian Mitchell","In terms of I guess my first question just looking at the EBIT margin guide fiscal 2020, so it's up 60 to 80 bps with some corporate cost reduction within that. Just wondered when you're thinking across the four segments, do we think about that expansion being sort of APAC margins flattish and the other three in 2020 being up say 50 bps? Is that the right way to think about the segments in 2020?","George Oliver","Yes. So, when we look at -- well, let me give you a high level that obviously we're positioned here to expand margins as we've guided 40 to 60 basis points and -- for the total year. And that's going to be pretty much we'll see expansion across the Board. It's -- we're going to get better leverage out of our Global Products. And so as we look at our Global Products, we're going to be closer to a 70-plus type basis points.","And then our Field-based businesses kind of the -- where we're seeing good leverage here is the work we've done in EMEA\/LA being a little bit better. The one that's going to be -- the lower margin is going to be North America roughly about 30 or 40 basis points. And that's purely when you look at the total -- when you look at how we achieve the margin expansion, we get about 20 basis points on volume mix. We pick up about 50 basis points on synergies and productivities. And then we are pressured a bit on a total year with APAC as well as some other pressure we have within the overall portfolio. So that's what gets us in total. Now when you break that out into as I said North America, a little bit more pressure there because of the mix of HVAC versus Fire & Security, as well as the headwind that we've had in the retail business continuing because of the pressure that we see there in the end market that we're serving. And so overall, it's -- we're going to see improvement across the board. But the strength will be driven by Global Products as well as the EMEA\/LA continued performance of EMEA\/LA and then beginning to recover here in APAC.","Julian Mitchell","Thank you very much. And then my second question just around that Global Products residential revenue aspect. So you had as you said down low double-digits revenue in Global Resi HVAC in Q4. Just wondered if you could give a bit more color around the Asian piece? You talked about Japan and Taiwan being culprits. Is there something going on market share-wise there? I think numbers in Japan have been okay. So I just wondered what your outlook was on that Asian piece within Global Resi HVAC?","George Oliver","Sure. So let me frame it up here Julian, when you look at Global Products organic revenue growth being flat in Q4, let's start that it was off of a plus nine last year. And that we did expect a decline in North America Resi, given that a year ago we had 20-plus percent growth.","And when we -- coming into the quarter we knew that there was going to be distributed inventory levels that we're going to have to be burnt off. Now what was softer as Brian talked about was the APAC residential business. And just to frame that up it's about $1.8 billion in annual revenue. It's primarily the Hitachi JV and that -- with the strength and the position that we have in Japan and Taiwan.","The overall decline, it was a low-teen decline. That impacted as Brian said three points of our global products growth. Now if you break it out into Taiwan and Japan, the decline in Taiwan were partly due to a mild summer. We had -- distributors had to burn through their inventory as the cooling season was coming to an end in our fourth quarter. And then as we look at it today, we see the inventory levels to be back to normal at the end of September.","Recognize that we have about a -- we do have a very strong share position in that market. And so we do believe on a go-forward basis we're going to be positioned well and continuing to maintain share.","In Japan, we had a very strong first three quarters ourselves in Japan. And then the market decline began to occur in Q4. And so with that we saw our distributors burning off inventory. And I think right now I just came back from there. I spent a few days with our team there. What I would say is that the inventory levels are back to where they need to be.","We are a little bit concerned about continued softness here in Q1. So we're going to watch that closely. I would tell you from my visit and the deep dive that I've done on all of our investments, I feel really good about the business with the investments we're making and being able to maintain a very strong position in these markets. And so that's kind of the way I see it today but we are going to see a little bit of pressure here in Q1 because of the Japan market.","Julian Mitchell","That\u2019s great. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is coming from Andrew Kaplowitz of Citi. Your line is open.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Hey, good morning, guys.","Antonella Franzen","Good morning.","George Oliver","Hi, Andrew.","Andrew Kaplowitz","George in Building Solutions North America you mentioned mix issues Q4 versus Q3 as service is better. But put a really large EBITDA improvement 40 basis points versus last quarter, which I think was down 90 despite Fire & Security growth still being lower than HVAC. So can you give more color into the improvement? I know you just said that retail pressure didn't really go away. Did it abate at all? Or was it really just a better service mix or maybe better sales force productivity?","George Oliver","So there's a lot of -- let me try to frame this up, so you can kind of put the pieces together. Overall, as you said, we had a lot of pressure in the previous quarter with mix and the like. And now in the fourth quarter we were 40 basis points year-on-year improvement.","When you look at the breakdown of that volume and mix was about 20 basis points. We're seeing good volume come through continued volume. We're seeing very strong productivity savings and cost synergies, which was up 40 basis points. There is a little bit of a headwind on pension. And then there's -- we're almost done with the headwind that we've seen in sales investments.","And so when you walk that through that's where which ultimately achieve the net 40 basis points year-on-year. And so it's -- we're obviously watching this closely as we get into Q1. We are looking and making sure that on a year-on-year basis we're a continued -- positioned to continue to expand.","I believe that right now it's going to be somewhat flat because of the way the mix is going to come through and some of the pressure that we're seeing in retail. But we're going to continue to focus on driving strong productivity and cost savings while we're executing on the growth.","Antonella Franzen","And Andy, the only thing I would add as a reminder is just keep in mind that in Q3 for North America, part of that decline really had to do with the really strong performance we had in the North America retail business in Q3 of 2018. And we didn't have that same dynamic here in our fourth quarter.","Andrew Kaplowitz","That's helpful, guys. And then George can you talk about the Fire & Security markets in particular? I think you mentioned that Fire & Security products growth was good. Your field orders have hung in there reasonably well. But how much of it is sort of the markets being strong? I know fire detection generally has been pretty strong. How much of it is sort of self-help over the last few years for you guys in markets like security and digital improving the business versus the market? Are you outperforming the market?","George Oliver","So let me start Andy by breaking it out into products and field. And so if you look at our Fire & Security products, we were up although it prints 2% but that was on a low double-digit prior year compare. So, on a two-year stack, we're still doing extremely well with our product businesses.","Now if you dig into that fire detection was up 7% and that's a result of both reinvestment in new products, continuing to expand our channel and the sales force and then ultimately being able to convert backlog. The security was flat. Now that's on a very tough comp also year-on-year. I believe it was high teens","And we are continuing to invest and position ourselves with the right products and mix and how we want to compete in security as it relates to our overall -- when we look at our digital solutions, the importance of having that product mix within the portfolio.","And then the last is our fire suppression business continues to perform very well. I believe that we continue to gain share. We're up mid-single digits pretty much and that's pretty broad-based across the globe. When you look at our -- the Field businesses, we're up 4% and that's both install as well as service and it's broad-based.","It's across all three regions. There's been a big -- like I spoke earlier about our focus on building services. We continue to focus on how we build out our service capabilities. But overall I would say that we're performing -- we are performing at above the market with both our product and technology businesses as well as how we're executing projects and service.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Thanks guys.","Operator","The next question is coming from Deepa Raghavan, Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Deepa Raghavan","Hey good morning all. Would you say at this time your Field backlog -- just given your Field backlog and your visibility into fiscal 2020, now your visibility is at least three quarters out? Or you think that's lower perhaps you declining? And any color on how that visibility splits across regions?","George Oliver","Yes. It's pretty -- what I would say is the -- if you look at our order rate in 2019, right, we had a good pace of order growth throughout the year. It was driven by pretty healthy end-market demand, pretty much across the Board, some softness in the Middle East and a few soft spots, but overall, pretty broad-based across all three of our regions.","With the work that we've been doing in expanding our salesforce as well as our service technicians, I think at the end of the day, we're positioned well now to be able to convert that. And if you look at the mix of projects, it's a balanced mix of small, mid, and large-sized projects.","And so what we do is we take that backlog and we look at how it's going to convert over the next year, much of which is in backlog. And with the continued -- as I said earlier, with the idea that there might be some -- a little bit of pressure here to maintain our mid to upper single-digit order growth that we've seen in the last two years, we're suggesting that might be more of the low to mid order growth that we're putting into the backlog that that's what then pretty much ties to our organic revenue growth of low to mid-single-digit for the year. And so again that's something we'll watch closely, but we are starting the year with a healthy backlog.","Deepa Raghavan","Got it. My follow-up would be on cadence of month. Can you talk about how the quarter progressed? I mean did momentum strengthen or weaken in any of your geographies or any of your Products or Field businesses? Thank you.","George Oliver","The -- just a clarification on that. So, how the quarter -- the quarters progressed through 2020?","Deepa Raghavan","No, the month -- and in the quarter how did your F Q4 -- fiscal Q4 progressed by month. Did you see increasing momentum as in or momentum decreasing in certain verticals or certain geographies?","George Oliver","Yes. I mean when we look at our businesses and it differs a bit. But typically the third month of the quarter is where a lot of projects close and a lot of the shipments get made. So, there is a little bit of an anomaly here on a quarterly basis where the third month is always our strongest which ultimately was the case in the fourth quarter.","So, I don't believe that there was any change in the profile of how the quarter played out with what we expected. I think we did see as we knew as the quarter played out that from a residential standpoint that was a little bit of where we saw additional softness from what we were expecting when we started the quarter. But that was probably the only spot that as the quarter played out, it didn't play out as we would have normally expected.","Brian Stief","Yes, I think the cadence in Q4 of fiscal 2019 was very similar to the cadence of the monthly in Q4 in 2018. So I don't think there was anything unusual at all.","Deepa Raghavan","Got it. Thank you for the color.","Operator","The next question is coming from Josh Pokrzywinski, Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Josh Pokrzywinski","Hi, good morning all.","Antonella Franzen","Good morning.","Brian Stief","Good morning.","Josh Pokrzywinski","Just wanted to follow-up on -- I think something has become a bit more topical recently, maybe more of the applied space than anything else. This whole concept of refrigerant upgrades, more energy efficiency, it seems like something that the whole industry has been talking about for decades on end. That's really starting to come into its own. George could you size for us, how much of the business is really around some of these kind of energy efficiency upgrades versus something that's more break-fix or maybe new install focused and how that's been doing?","George Oliver","Yes. So while there's a couple of different questions, I guess embedded in that question. When you look at what we do today, certainly as we're bringing new products to the market they are more efficient. They're in higher demand. And ultimately there's a payback from an energy standpoint. So I think consumers and even from a B2B standpoint when you're -- when we do a performance solutions, we bring our new equipment. It delivers energy efficiency. We deliver value and ultimately we get paid for that value.","I think for all of us we are anticipating -- there's a lot of pending legislation around HFC refrigerants. And ultimately what's that going to mean? We're taking a very active role and we support bipartisan federal legislation being introduced that gives the EPA authority to phase down the high global warming potential of HFC refrigerants in a manner that's consistent with the Kangalee amendment in the Montreal protocol.","That being said is we want to work with the industry as a whole in -- with a consistent approach to the HFC transition rather than a patchwork of individual state laws, targeting different sectors or having different transition date. So all of the investments that we've made is -- in our R&D is to develop new low GWP product platforms. A good example is our YZ chillers in anticipation of these regulations.","And so we're very active in the industry, making sure that as we project what's going to happen here from an efficiency standpoint, making sure that we're delivering the highest efficiency, as well as being able to drive the regulation appropriately. That's what our commitment is. And we believe that that would benefit our customer\u2019s, shareholders as well as the environment.","Josh Pokrzywinski","And then just a follow-up. If I remember back to the Tyco days and I think early in the integration there were parts of the products business, I think around oil and gas that showed a little bit of surprising cyclicality that were a drag on the business. I think today those are probably some markets that are a little choppy themselves. Is that something that's still in the portfolio? Did some of that leave with Scott? Maybe just kind of update us on how that's performing relative to the whole?","George Oliver","Yeah. So the -- what remains is our fire suppression business has a strong position in the oil and gas space with high hazard technologies that they bring. And so -- and as we said earlier that business is actually continuing to perform very well. And when we look at our field based businesses, obviously, we restructured a lot of those businesses in the downturn. And we've been very careful in how we grow those businesses on a go-forward basis, capitalizing on where we believe the opportunities are and ultimately where we don't want to play. So, our footprint is much smaller than it was back then without the Scott Safety business as well as the way that we've restructured our field businesses over that time period. ","Josh Pokrzywinski","Got it. It\u2019s helpful. Thanks for the color.","Antonella Franzen","With that operator I'd like to turn the call back over to George for some closing comments. ","George Oliver","Yes. Just to wrap up here today, I want to thank everyone for joining our call this morning. We have made a tremendous amount of progress this year. And we'll build upon that momentum in 2020 as we laid out our guidance and I am looking forward to seeing many of you soon. So operator that concludes our call.","Operator","That will conclude today's conference. All parties may disconnect at this time."]}}
