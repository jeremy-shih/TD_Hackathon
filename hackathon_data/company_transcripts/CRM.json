My name is Victoria, and I will be your conference operator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the CRM Q1 FY '18 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. John Cummings, the Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","John Cummings","Thanks so much, Victoria. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us for our fiscal first quarter 2018 results conference call. Our first quarter results press release, SEC filings and a replay of today's call can be found on our IR website at www.salesforce.com\/investor. With me on the call today is Marc Benioff, Chairman and CEO; Keith Block, Vice Chairman, President and COO; and Mark Hawkins, CFO. ","As a reminder, our commentary today will primarily be in non-GAAP terms. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP results and guidance can be found in our earnings press release. Also, some of our comments today may contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Should any of these materialize or should our assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual company results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements. ","A description of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions and other factors that could affect our financial results are included in our SEC filings in our -- including our most recent reports on Form 10-K and 10-Q. With that, let me turn the call over to you, Marc.","Marc Benioff","All right. Well, hey thanks, John, and welcome, everybody, to the call. We're excited that you're here with us, and I'm personally very excited to be here and to share these amazing first quarter numbers. So as you can see, the numbers were really outstanding with very strong top and bottom line performance. Revenue for the quarter rose to nearly $2.4 billion, that's up 25%. And this is the fastest growth of any top 5 enterprise software company, and no company in the history of enterprise software has achieved our scale faster and at this growth rate. ","Our non-GAAP earnings per share for the quarter rose to $0.28, up 17%, and deferred revenue grew to more than $5.04 billion, up 26%, really excited about that. And the dollar value of booked business on and off the balance sheet is now more than $14.6 billion. That's up 26% from a year ago and we've added more than $3 billion since last year.","Operating cash flow for the quarter was $1.23 billion, up 17%, and we're maintaining our full year operating cash flow guidance of 21% growth at the high end of the range. Based on these strong results, we're raising full year top line revenue guidance by $100 million to $10.3 billion this year, the high end of the range, 23% growth for the year.","We're also raising our non-GAAP EPS guidance by $0.01 to $1.30 at the high end of the range, which is 29% growth year-over-year. We've consistently delivered excellent top and bottom line growth, driven by our industry-leading CRM product line and strength of our financial and operating model as continued in this quarter. ","In fact, our consistent non-GAAP operating margin improvement over the last 3 years has enabled us to triple our free cash flow even as we have doubled our revenue. So that is something that we're very, very proud of at Salesforce that over the last 3 years, we've now tripled our cash flow and doubled our revenue. And we're on track to deliver our fourth consecutive year of non-GAAP operating margin improvement this year, 150 basis points at the high end of our range.","Our strong revenue performance shows the strength of our full product portfolio. In fact, our 4 major clouds are standalone companies, they would represent 4 of the top 10 pure-play cloud software companies in the world. We have strong organic revenue growth across all of our product sales. Cloud revenue is growing at 14%, Service Cloud at 21%, Platform at 32%, Marketing Cloud at 32%, excluding Demandware. And our portfolio has not only gotten stronger as we have continued to strategically invest in our business but as you know, last year, we also acquired a number of amazing companies, and the integrations of these acquisitions has been very successful. ","And I just want to thank all of our employees at Salesforce for welcoming these new companies, and I want to also thank these companies who have now become part of Salesforce, a further incredible hard work over the past several months integrating it with us. And a great example of this is, of course, Demandware, which serve more than 500 million shoppers and purchased more than $4 billion in total gross merchandise value in the first quarter, which was up 31% over last year, pretty incredible. And yesterday, I was down in Las Vegas with the entire Salesforce Commerce Cloud team. And I'll tell you, we had over 1,500 people attending our Commerce Cloud conference, and it was amazing to see what's happening right now in this incredible retail industry and how so many retailers are focused on achieving a new level of customer success by going online or creating hybrid solutions between online and stores. ","Now this is fuel -- further fueling our B2C CRM product line within our already industry-leading Marketing Cloud. And as retailers are shifting from these brick and mortar to online situations, they're focusing on building more personalized, one-on-one relationships with customers, using artificial intelligence to provide the best capabilities to their customers, delivering world-class customer experiences and not only in the store but even in the mobile environment. And Salesforce is leading all of these transformations. ","Our competitive position has never been stronger. Just look at the latest data from the top industry analysts, IDC, shows Salesforce grew its overall market share more than any other CRM vendor. And according to IDC, we are #1 in CRM, we're #1 in sales applications, #1 in customer service applications, #1 in marketing applications in 2016. And you can see that if you go to my Twitter feed, there's a nice chart that we put together using the IDC data.","And Salesforce is gaining share at a much faster rate than our competitors, which you'll also see on that chart. We increased our market share in 2016 by more percentage points than the rest of the top 10 CRM vendors combined. That is, we increased our market share in 2016 by more percentage points than the rest of the top 10 CRM vendors combined, and we are very, very proud of that outstanding market performance in sales, in service and in marketing applications. ","Gartner showed similar results. It named Salesforce the #1 in CRM. And based on total software revenue for 2016, for the fifth year in a row in its latest worldwide CRM market share reported Gartner, market share of software markets, very excited.","So in the same Gartner report, we also saw total software revenue for 2016, Salesforce is again named #1 in application Platform-as-a-Service and for the fourth year in a row as well as the #1 sales provider for the eighth year in a row and the #1 customer service and support provider for the third year in a row. So all these incredible areas that we're focusing on, we're delivering phenomenal results. ","With the strength of our market leadership and multiproduct portfolio, in the first quarter, we closed some of the biggest deals in Salesforce's history and Keith will talk more about that. We've also expanded relationships with incredible brands like Visa, very excited to see them go wall to wall with our Salesforce automation technology, with Delta Airlines and 21st Century Fox, very excited about 20,000-seat deployment of Quip, which they are using to replace their Microsoft Office implementation. So very excited to that and congratulations to all of those teams at Salesforce. No one else is closing more strategic CRM deals.","CRM is the fastest-growing enterprise software category today, and by 2021, CRM will be the largest area of spend in enterprise software, according to Gartner. And we are very excited about that. We have a massive opportunity to continue our growth and leadership in CRM and grow the Salesforce economy. Our ecosystem of customers, partners and developers is generating hundreds of billions of dollars in GDP impact and creating millions of new jobs. And in a time an incredible change in the world and incredible areas of workforce development, we are so excited that so many people are coming to Salesforce to find a new employment.","In fact, there's hundreds of thousands of job openings today that are calling for Salesforce skills, and we've seen this incredible situation where Salesforce developers and Salesforce administrator are 2 of the highest-paid jobs today in the United States. It's very exciting time for Salesforce. We expect to grow to nearly 30,000 employees worldwide this fiscal year, something I'm very proud of. And with each and every one of them completely focused on CRM and mostly focused on honestly, our customers and their success. In fact, nothing is more important to Salesforce than our customers' success, which is why we continue to be so successful and no other company has a focus like ours in the CRM market. ","Our customer success message is on display this quarter. As you've probably seen, we launched our worldwide advertising campaign featuring some amazing customers and you're going to see some amazing more ones but one is -- and this is certainly something that everyone's interested in, the partnership between Salesforce and Amazon Web Services and how Amazon Web Services uses Salesforce to grow. It's been an incredible -- incredibly excited to use Amazon and the success of their cloud to feature the launch of our advertising campaign, and it's backed up with some incredible video testimonials that you can find on YouTube. ","Farmers Insurance as well, Intuit, and so many other incredible brands, you're going to see emerging in our advertising campaign as we seek to raise the awareness of Salesforce in the general market to show people how they can connect with their customers in an entirely new way. ","And in London today, you probably saw we held a sold-out world tour with more than 10,000 people in attendance and will be in Boston, Paris, Chicago in the next month, having similar world tours. We'll also have our second annual TrailheaDX developer event coming up in June 28 and 29 in San Francisco. And I hope you're going to join me for any of those events or you can join me in Tokyo on July 4 as we continue to deliver our message in the Asian market and to put on display the incredible success of Salesforce in Japan, which has been something that I have really been excited to see, helping our customers to blaze these new trails in CRM.","Okay. Well, that's enough of what's happening. With the numbers, let's hand this over to Keith.","Keith Block","All right. Thanks, Marc. We delivered incredible results in the first quarter across all of our geographies, industries and clouds. As you can see from our numbers, the investments that we have made, and we continue to make an international expansion and industries and our partner ecosystem, continue to pay off. More importantly, we are deepening our customer relationships. We're engaging with them in more strategic ways, some of which Marc alluded to, and we are acting as a true trusted adviser to their businesses. ","We had some of the largest transactions in the company's history this quarter, starting with an iconic technology brand who is standardizing on Salesforce to bring together sales, service and marketing for thousands of employees worldwide. More to come on that next week. ","And another large transaction in Q1 was with a major telecommunications company who is using Service Cloud and Marketing Cloud and the Salesforce Platform to transform the shopping experience for its customers. Very, very strategic. Now this company sees Salesforce as the key component to their retail growth strategy, and with this win, now 10 of the top 15 global telecommunications companies rely on Salesforce. Very impressive. ","Now while our market-leading core products continue to see great traction and drive success for our customers, we're also seeing momentum with our new additions to the portfolio such as Commerce Cloud and Krux and Quip. Marc gave you an example of 21st Century Fox who's rolling out Quip to 20,000 employees, helping them co-create documents and streamline approval processes and collaborate in realtime.","Looking at our revenue internationally this quarter. We delivered strong results in all of our geographies as we had constant currency revenue growth of 29% in EMEA and 26% in APAC. Expansion outside the U.S. is key to serving our global customers. It's a key part of our strategy and achieving our goal of $20 billion of revenue. And this starts with investing in our go-to-market resources, our partner ecosystem and our infrastructure. ","We made amazing progress on this front in Q1, starting with announcement in March that we are leveraging AWS to deliver Salesforce services to customers in Australia, which I just returned from a couple of days ago. ","We also announced the opening of our second data center in Japan in April. And in Europe, we had customer expansions with Banca IFIS, Adecco and Group Atlantic. In Japan, we landed wins with major brands such as SoftBank, Japan Asia Group and Mizuno. And in Australia, we expanded our relationship with AMT, a leading wealth management company. They are turning to Salesforce as many wealth management companies are to reimagine their client advisory relationship to the digital edge. ","Now turning to industries. We continue our strong showing in Q1 yet again. In fact, as Marc talked about, if you were in Vegas this week, you've seen Salesforce hosting our XChange conference for the retail industry, a great reception there. And at the conference, we announced an expansion of our relationship with iconic fashion brand, Diane von Furstenberg. ","We also had a major expansion this quarter with Ralph Lauren. They've been very active in the press, and they have a new vision for growth and customer engagement that is powered by Salesforce Commerce Cloud. They believe that Salesforce will create a best-in-class experience in all of their markets around the world. And with these wins, today 8 of the top 10 U.S. retailers, nearly half of the top 20 global retailers, rely on Salesforce to power their business. ","In the public sector, the team recently unveiled Impact Level 4, IL4, provisional authorization for government cloud, enabling even more federal government agencies to benefit from Salesforce. And in the quarter, we expanded our relationship with the United States Army and the United States Air Force. ","In state and local government, we drove an amazing win with the state of Florida. They're using Salesforce to implement travel management system that will include authorization requests and approvals and expense reporting. And by streamlining all these processes with Salesforce, the state will be able to better analyze the amount of funding spent on travel and ultimately save tax payer dollars, which is a good thing.","Finally, in financial services, we're thrilled to expand our relationship in Q1 with Northern Trust, a leading provider of wealth and asset management services. And with the addition of Salesforce CPQ and Shield, they're enhancing customer trust and building a 360-degree view of their clients. And today, 9 of the top 10 global wealth management firms rely on Salesforce. ","On the partner front, we continue to work with the largest and most strategic SIs and ISVs in the world, reaching new markets, building amazing applications on the AppExchange and ultimately growing our impact with customers, if it is all about customer success. ","And in Q1, we expanded our relationship with Accenture. As you know, they're a long-standing and strategic partner for us, and this quarter, they grew their deployment of Sales Cloud to thousands of their consultants worldwide. But it's not just about the SIs. We're also seeing momentum across our thriving ISV ecosystem, and earlier this month, we announced that Quintiles IMS, a leader in life sciences is building new clinical trial applications on the Salesforce Platform. ","And just last week, you saw that we launch new AppExchange partner program and a $100 million platform fund to empower millions of developers and ISVs to create new applications. So it's never been a better time to build on the Salesforce Platform.","At the end of the day, our strategy of international growth and building the world's greatest cloud ecosystem and speaking the language of our customers continues to fuel our results. I'd like to thank our customers and our partners for their trust in us and our employees for strong results for the year, and of course, now over to you, Mark.","Mark Hawkins","Thanks, Keith. I'm really pleased with our first quarter results. We continued strong top line and bottom line growth and our record operating cash flow in the quarter. Revenue grew 25% in both dollars and constant currency, excluding a year-over-year FX headwind of approximately $11 million. Sequentially, we benefited from an FX tailwind of approximately $15 million. Each ","of our clouds demonstrated strong revenue growth in the quarter as Sales Cloud grew 14%, Service Cloud grew 21%, Platform and Other grew 32% and Marketing Cloud, excluding Demandware, now Commerce Cloud grew 32%. The Commerce Cloud started FY '18 very strong, contributing $57 million in total revenue and with $46 million in subscription and support revenue. ","Dollar attrition in the first quarter, excluding Marketing Cloud and other acquired businesses, remained below 9%. As you know, our fourth quarter is our largest new business from renewals quarter and Q1 is our largest cash collection quarter. And as a result, we delivered a record operating cash flow in the first quarter of $1.23 billion, up 17% over last year. This is more operating cash flow than we delivered in all of FY '15.","Deferred revenue ended the quarter at $5.04 billion, up 26% in dollars and 27% in constant currency, excluding an FX headwind of $21 million. On a sequential basis, deferred revenue benefited from an FX tailwind of $41 million. Commerce Cloud contributed $50 million to deferred revenue in Q1, up from $49 million in Q4. ","Moving on to guidance. With strong results to start our fiscal year, we're very pleased to be raising our full year FY '18 revenue guidance to $100 million to $10.25 billion to $10.3 billion for 22% to 23% growth year-over-year. This guidance includes approximately $50 million to $100 million of FX headwind. And we're also raising our FY '18 non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance to $1.28 to $1.30. ","Please keep in mind that Dreamforce is in Q4 this year versus Q3 last year. And as you update your models for the second half, we anticipate slightly more EPS to come in the third quarter than in the fourth. We continue to expect to deliver 125 to 150 basis points of non-GAAP operating margin improvement in FY '18, our fourth consecutive year of improvement. ","We're also maintaining our full year operating cash flow guidance of 20% to 21% year-over-year. For Q2, we're expecting revenue of $2.51 billion to $2.52 billion, non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.31 to $0.32 and year-over-year deferred revenue growth of approximately 22%. This deferred revenue guide reflects the increasing seasonality that we've discussed over the last several years. ","Before I close, let me give you a quick update on our future adoption of the new revenue standard ASC 606 starting in Q1 of next year. We will adopt this using a full retrospective method, which will result in recasting our results in FY '17 and FY '18. We're on track with the preparations to address the accounting changes. ","Regarding commissions, we anticipate capitalizing more selling-related cost, and our amortization of these costs will be over the customer life rather than the contract term. While we expect to increase our disclosures for revenue backlog, deferred revenue and other customer contract information, we have not yet quantified the impact to revenue. However, we do not expect these changes to have any impact on our operating cash flow results upon adoption in FY '19.","All these changes are required under the new standard. We plan to provide you with a thorough review of these changes and the anticipated accounting impact later this year. So to wrap up, our first quarter results position us well for another year of strong financial performance. I'd like to thank all of our employees, customers, partners and our stockholders for their continued support. And with that, we'll open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank.","Karl Keirstead","Question for Mark Hawkins, just on the how front-end loaded the investment spend will be this year. I noticed you and Marc updated the full year operating margin improvement of 125 to 150, but it looks like in Q1, operating margins were down year-over-year and it looks like R&D was up quite a bit. So I'm just curious whether Salesforce is front-end loading your OpEx investments and what would drive the operating margin improvement in the second half.","Mark Hawkins","Sure. Thank you, Karl, and good to speak. Remember last year, Karl, one of the things that we called out is that we had the benefit of a leap year. And while that washes out for the year, what that does is has a material 25 -- $20 million to $25 million in revenue impact in Q1 from that standpoint. And so when you -- that's one thing that you would consider. The second thing, Karl, as a reminder, is that we still have an annualized the full integration costs that we're doing right now for some of the work with our major acquisitions, including Demandware and a few others. And so that obviously has a little bit of a front-end impact. But when you look at those 2, that explains a little bit of the topography as you look quarter by quarter. Of course, for the full year, as we talked about, our operating margin, 125 to 150 is intact. It's consistent with our framework and it's on a higher revenue basis obviously. ","Therefore, we raised the -- also the EPS for the year. So I think we're in good shape on that but hopefully, that gives you a sense there. Number two is on research and development, Karl. One of the things that we want to call out is we've been having a group of people, as you know, as we've been going into industries, we started industries, trying to talk the language of industries and with a really huge go-to-market focus. And now -- we're now starting to move some of our industry resources into the product development side. And so there's a bit of a reclass of moving some of our resources and shifting those into R&D. So in total, it's just a movement between line items, but we're in good shape overall, and that's what's happening in Q1 in those two items.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Bank of America.","Kasthuri Rangan","Actually a couple of questions. One for you, Marc Benioff. It looks like there's a lot of business coming through on the government side. And I'm also hearing, really over the last several quarters of conference calls, a decided shift in the business towards more B2C-centric industries. Can you talk about the business strategically, Marc, given that we know that according to statistics that the government actually spends the most amount of money on software. It's, by far, the vertical that commands the biggest share of what's spent on software. Can you talk about how the company views this opportunity ahead in the context of the Platform business, which also has a potential to be a multibillion-dollar business? And I guess I'll save the question for Mark Hawkins if you can get through this, that will be fine.","Keith Block","Okay, Kash, it's Keith. So you alluded to the progress that we're making in the government. We have made an incredible amount of progress with our focus on the government business, the public sector business here. We had a big announcement in the quarter of IL4, which obviously is making a difference for us. We've expanded our relationship in the quarter with the U.S. Air Force and the U.S. Army. So we see that as a huge opportunity as the government really focuses on trying to modernize and transform their business and their organization, their technology. So there's a lot of potential there in the quarter. As I mentioned, we had a significant win with the state of Florida. And we did some incredible work in 3 11 for one of the largest cities. So stay tuned on that. For one of the cities -- largest cities in the country that we all know and love.","So again, this industry's strategy is really, really paying off for us, not just in our go-to-market strategy but as Mark Hawkins alluded to in our orientation of our product set. As you know, last year, we released the financial services cloud and the health cloud with the acquisition of Krux and Demandware, now Commerce Cloud. We have a widely compelling B2C story. Ralph Lauren is an incredible story and the company that is going through a lot of transformation, and they're leveraging us as the growth platform for B2C. So we just see tremendous opportunity and tremendous upside, and we continue to focus on speaking the language of the customer, leveraging our platform, growing our partner ecosystem and investing our assets in driving solutions for customers in specific industries.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Phil Winslow from Wells Fargo.","Philip Winslow","Question for Marc Benioff. Wanted to focus on the Sales Cloud because obviously, a lot of attention has been given to the growth over the past couple of quarters and Service and Marketing. But if you look at the growth in Sales Cloud, that's actually gotten accelerated over the past couple of quarters here. How do you think about Sales Cloud in terms of where we are in the life cycle, pricing, upsell potential, just walk us through just your thoughts on where we are.","Marc Benioff","Well, Sales Cloud has become one of the largest products not just at Salesforce, but in the entire software industry, and it has far exceeded our expectations. And as you can see, as Salesforce, Sales Cloud specifically kind of heads towards that, these kind of incredible revenue levels, I think Sales Cloud has really accelerated because we kind of have a -- had a breakthrough in how we think about Sales Cloud and the ability to grow that revenue stream. And that you saw with our acquisition, for example, of SteelBrick. When we acquired SteelBrick, it also gave us the ability then to extend Sales Cloud with CPQ-type functionality, which just -- was something that we did not have previous to that, previous to the acquisition, and we're able to organically grow the product.","And that has been a big revelation for us as we look to all the options and all the things that our Sales Cloud customers need that previously we didn't have. And in addition to that, we continue to close very large new Sales Cloud licenses. I mentioned Visa, for example, which went wall to wall with Sales Cloud this year. But there's been so many other exciting Sales Cloud customers, as you know. And as Keith mentioned, combined with the vertical strategy, it's really opened up all these new opportunities. I think, a great example is financial services where we have the Wealth Cloud, which is built, of course, on the Sales Cloud. And now, 9 out of the 10 largest financial institutions of the world are using Sales Cloud and Wealth Cloud to manage their wealth advisory firms. That's pretty cool and another example where we're growing Sales Cloud.","So we take this very, very seriously that when we look at Sales Cloud and Service Cloud, which are huge products, 2 of the biggest products in the software industry and 2 of our biggest products, we want to continue their strong organic growth. And we have been able to put together a whole portfolio of strategies to do that. And it's working. And I hope that it will continue to work and we're trying to do a lot of cool things this year to make that happen. And I think that we look and talk to Alex or you talk to Keith or I, we're extremely aligned on this breakthrough and we're executing it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alex Zukin with Piper Jaffray.","Aleksandr Zukin","Maybe for Marc Benioff or Keith. You guys continue to sign some very large transactions in the quarter. So I guess, as you think about the strategic imperative of growing your wallet share within these Fortune 500 accounts, how should we think about a very large customer that you are for this along with in terms of that percentage of their overall budget or spending on you versus your average? And how does that compare with an Oracle, SAP or Microsoft at this point?","Marc Benioff","It's a very good question. Do you want to handle [indiscernible]...","Keith Block","Well, let me -- Alex, it's Keith. Let me take a swing at this. So obviously, we have a very balanced portfolio of business, whether it's our large deals or small deals, whether it's our industries or geographies or segments. We've highlighted a couple of these very large transactions because we're particularly proud of the fact that these are 2 of the largest transactions that we've done in the history of the company. And when you think about the compelling reason why these companies are undertaking these transactions and establishing these relationships, at the end of the day, the CEOs of these companies are very forward-thinking CEOs. And they want to bring their companies into this age of digital transformation, and they have an imperative for growth, and they believe strongly that we are the only technology platform out there that will enable that growth. So that would be point number one.","Point number two is that once we've established this relationship and they start to get more and more value as a company, as you know, we continue to innovate. And as we bring new innovations to the table, like Quote-to-Cash or SteelBrick like Marc was talking about, that allows us to go back into those large customers and bring new points of innovation to them. So that huge deal or those large deals really create a platform and an opportunity for us to innovate and continue to attach. That's a big part of our strategy. Obviously, from a percentage of IT spend, if you look at where the market is going, IDC has a study out that says that the largest category of enterprise software by 2020 will be CRM and the fastest growing.","And if you look at our results, we're growing at significantly more than that rate of market, so that means we're taking market share, which means we're taking wallet share and that means obviously, we're taking -- which translates to IT budgets. And it translates into the mind share of our CEOs that we're trying to do business with. So we have a compelling offering. We're driving the market. We're taking share from our competition. We've got the mind share with the CEOs of these companies, and that just translates into higher penetration rates from IT budgets.","Marc Benioff","And I think the other point you -- kind of dimension of it, I think they love to hear about is these top 10 customers just continue to grow. I mean, it's kind of amazing and I think it surprised us, right, to see how big our largest customers are becoming and how committed they are to our technology, especially is our platform. Do you want to illuminate that further?","Keith Block","Yes, I think it's kind of an interesting statistic that we talk at the board level is if you look at the top 10 companies and the barrier to get into what we referred to as the top 10 club. If you look at what that barrier was 4 years ago and then you fast forward to where we are today, particularly at the end of this first quarter, to get into that top 10, you'd have to be spending more than 2.5x what you did before 4 years ago. So we have not only grown these relationships, but we also have new members into this, what we call the top 10 clubs. So again, it's an indication that these companies are adopting our technology and they're transforming our business.","Marc Benioff","And back at that point, you mentioned the kind of -- this kind of pre-growth time, we only really have maybe 1 or 2 products to offer these companies. Now we have a full range of services to help them focus on their customer, sales, service, marketing, community, analytics, apps, platform, commerce and so forth. Is that -- do you think that's one of the reasons that it's growing is the digital transformation of these companies that's doing it? What is it that's happening?","Keith Block","There's no question that there is a laser focus on digital transformation by the CEOs of these organizations. And when you think about the evolution of our company, we have a strategy that we refer to as exceeding growth, where we initially penetrate and we drive value, typically, with Sales Cloud. So this reacceleration of Sales Cloud is obviously a great thing. And then once we drive success for those customers, as Marc was talking about, then we're able to say, \"Okay, now the walls between sales, service and marketing are coming down.\" So now we have an opportunity to provide a 360-degree view of the customer with service and with marketing. And take that now one step further, as we've moved from systems of record to systems of engagement to now systems of intelligence. And that's where Einstein, which we're all very excited about and customers are excited about comes into play. So it's an expansion of our capabilities and our opportunity to drive transformation with these customers.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citi.","Walter Pritchard","Question for Keith. Just first on -- you highlighted Australia rolling out AWS down there. And I'm wondering just generally, is the AWS partnership and you've been able to put customer data in more locations, ultimately, long term helping your pipeline internationally or any impact at this point yet?","Keith Block","Well, interestingly enough, I just returned from Australia a couple of days ago. And there is a great deal of excitement about our Australian data center and a great deal of excitement about our partnership with AWS. And this is something that as a company on the -- for the benefit of our customers, it's kind of a big deal strategically for us. And obviously, it's a big deal for our customers. It's something that we're excited about.","Marc Benioff","Yes. And I think at Salesforce, we really strongly believe that the enemy of my enemy is my friend, and I think that makes Amazon Web Services our best friend.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs.","Heather Bellini","This question is actually for Marc Benioff. Marc, I was wondering if you could share with us how you've seen Einstein start to impact deal sizes. And what's the general, I guess, adoption curve look like for machine learning and AI now that you have it embedded into your products?","Marc Benioff","Well, I can just tell you from my personal experience and I think I've mentioned this before, but I think it played out in this quarter once again, which is that we have Einstein now built into all of our capabilities. And like in a lot of our technologies, we really become the first and most probably fastest moving user. And we then have a piece of Einstein now that we've not yet rolled out to our customers called Einstein Guidance. So this is a capability that I use with my staff meeting, when I do my forecast and when I do my analysis of the quarter, which happens every Monday at my staff meeting like a lot of CEOs do, it's a very typical process, of course, we have our top 20 or 30 executives around the table. We talk about different regions, different products, different opportunities. And then I ask one other executive their opinion and that executive is Einstein. And I will literally turn to Einstein in the meeting and say, \"Okay, Einstein, you've heard all of this. Now what do you think?\" ","And Einstein will give me the over and under on the quarter and show me where we're strong and where we're weak and sometimes will even point out a specific executive, which has done in the last 3 quarters and said that this executive is somebody who needs specific attention during the quarter. And I can tell you that I do believe that Salesforce's enhanced performance has been greatly attributable to our ability to have Einstein on board and as part of our team. Because that ability to consult with Einstein has made me a better CEO. I have the ability to talk to Einstein and ask Einstein everything from product areas that I should be focusing on, geographies that I should be focusing on, the linearity of bookings during the quarter. Every question that I possibly could have, I'm able to ask Einstein. And I think for a CEO, typically the way it works is, of course, you have various people, mostly politicians and bureaucrats, in your staff meeting who are telling you what they want to tell you to kind of get you to believe what they want you to believe. Einstein comes without bias.","So because it's just based on the data, and it's a very exciting next-generation tool. And to have Einstein guidance has transformed me as a CEO. I'm sure that if we are a sales leader in here, they would tell you that it's transforming our individual salespeople's experience as they have the ability to prioritize who to make sales calls onto or who to make phone calls to with our new Einstein dialer or to -- yesterday, I was down in Las Vegas talking to retailers where Einstein is helping shoppers make better shopping decisions because it's able to prioritize based on shopping histories what products that they're seeing. We did a very exciting demonstration with one of our top customers, which is Deckers. They have an incredible brand that I love called UGG shoes. And we demonstrated how one of their consumers is having a mobile experience using Apple Pay and using all these kind of next-generation activities to have a one-on-one shopping experience. And Einstein comes in and says, \"You like that shoe.","These are the other shoes and other products that we have that we think that you would like and the colors that you would like them. And based on how everybody else has purchased in your purchase history, this is what Einstein recommends to you.\" And that was very, very powerful for our customers. I mean so we see it in our analytics product, we see it in our Commerce product, we see it in our Sales Cloud. You're going to -- you see it in our Service product as well, especially with the emergence of Box, where many of our customers wanted to flood calls using Box, which I think is a great strategy and across the board. So I think that Einstein artificial intelligence, I mean, I guess, I have -- I should probably just point back to we started the quarter in February and many of you saw the demonstration with Coca-Cola were building the smart cooler for them, which has Einstein built into the cooler in a retail store that's paying attention to what products are being taken and removed from the store using Einstein Vision.","So you can see into the cooler and actually say, \"Oh, they took a Coke, they took a Diet Coke, they took a Sprite or Royal. There's a competitive product in here. Send somebody to get this out.\" So Einstein is having, I think, a very dramatic impact. Of course, we're the first major CRM company in the world, artificial intelligence so dramatically through all of our products. And I think that it's going to be instrumental. And when you look at AI, there's a couple of things you can think about. One is this is happening a lot faster than anybody expected. The fundamental development of AI where there's machine learning, machine intelligence or deep learning. The growth of AI, the advancements in AI, and you saw that yesterday in the Google conference as well, it's just the speed of growth is just exceeding everybody's expectations. And two, AI is the next platform.","All future applications, all future capabilities for all companies will be built on AI. Much in the same way that we talked about the future with cloud, the future of social and social became the next platform, or mobile became the next platform. Now you can really see how AI is becoming the next platform. And everyone is going to build on AI, and it's going to fundamentally transform all of our customer experiences and Salesforce is going to continue to do -- lead the way with that and also be on point to be able to have that meaningful transformational conversation with the most important CEOs in the world to help them to do what I'm doing, which is to transform their own business and how they run their businesses using AI. And that's why I'm excited about Salesforce Einstein.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan.","Mark Murphy","Also a question for Marc Benioff. Given the board-level attention that you're receiving, I'm curious what inning you think we're in, in terms of digital transformation. In other words, how many Global 2000 types of firms are seriously considering a digital transformation? And also when you do see a company engage in a new Salesforce as the centerpiece for one of those projects, how does their level of spending with Salesforce change?","Marc Benioff","Well, I think that is really the big question right now here at Salesforce so I appreciate you asking that. I'll give you an example. I was in Las Vegas yesterday. We had thousands of customers down there. Simultaneously, we had thousands of customers at our London world tour, which is just, in my mind, a major accomplishment for Salesforce for running 2 multi-thousand person events concurrently in 2 different parts of the world. And when I was down in Las Vegas, I was meeting with a very large manufacturer of furniture who has not done a lot of automation. It's a huge company with tens of thousands of employees. And they are both a B2B company, where they are building their furniture, designing their furniture, creating their furniture and they're selling it to partners and they're selling to the resellers, and they're selling it online to different vendors, and their B2C company, they have their own stores and they also do their own online","And they're like, \"We are looking for an opportunity to digitally transform our company. And honestly, we have -- we're not the state-of-the-art, and we need a B2B and a B2C transformation. Can you help us?\" And I said, \"Honestly, I think Salesforce is the only company today who can work with a company like that and be able to come in with a full range of capability, technology, services, relationships, partnerships and say we can transform you whether you're B2B or B2C or both. And it was the first time that a customer actually ever came up to me and said, \"I'm B2C and I'm B2B.\" And it was really very powerful to kind of hear that because I -- it's how we're [indiscernible] a lot of Salesforce, which is, of course, we have this incredible -- we're #1 in B2B. Sales, Cloud, Service Cloud, you know the numbers. Marketing Cloud, Pardot, I mean, it's incredible, the Platform, Application Platform as a Service. ","And now you saw the IDC numbers we're #1 in B2C with the Marketing Cloud, which is incredible. And this is a big, big deal in Commerce Cloud with our digital marketing platform that we introduced yesterday, which is so incredible as well as our -- not just our DFP but also this incredible capability with commerce. And the ability to stitch it together for these customers in a meaningful way to provide deeply interactive experiences and deeply personalized one-to-one experiences and make it all intelligent with Einstein. And with that customer, we're able to sit there for 1 hour and sketch out on a piece of paper everywhere they need to go. And here's the other thing that's so cool is we can say, \"We're going to get all this done for you probably in the next 90 days, no more than 180 days.\" It doesn't take a long time to really build and deliver.","And I won't go through this specific example, but we have a major customer right now who just has imploded with SAP Hybris because it's on-premise software product built in the last generation of software. And these retailers, they don't have time to wait and they don't have the ability to take on the risk of this old enterprise on-premise stuff like SAP Hybris. And that's why you see this rapid acceleration of our Commerce Cloud. But that's just a metaphor. They just don't have the ability to take on the risk of any of that old Oracle or SAP on-premise software. So that's why by basically being born cloud, by being born social, born mobile and now being born AI, we can do more for customers today and go faster than ever before. And we have so many examples. And I think that when you look at that IDC chart, the reason why we've really just taken SAP out of their #1 spot in CRM and left them in the dust is because these customers, they need transformation now and we're able to deliver it. And that makes me very proud for the company and makes me really happy when I meet with one of my best furniture company yesterday in Vegas to be able to support them so fully.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI.","Stewart Materne","Keith, another really nice quarter in Europe for you all. Just 2 quick questions on that region for you. Can you just talk about where you think Europe is versus the U.S. in terms of your mind share with senior executives that are thinking about digital transformation? Do you feel like you have sort of the same sort of brand awareness over there as you do in the U.S.? Or is there still some opportunities on that front? And then second, any concerns at all about the new GDPR regulation that's coming up around data privacy, maybe slowing down decisions on cloud technology as that deadline gets closer?","Keith Block","Kirk, thanks for the question. So let me address the first one then actually, our President and General Counsel is in the room, so we're going to let her talk about the second part. So obviously, we did have another great quarter in EMEA. It's part of our growth strategy around international expansion. And look, at the end of the day, we honestly, we see opportunity everywhere, whether it's in the U.S. or whether it's internationally. And it really is coming back to this notion of CEOs embracing this concept of digital transformation. I spent some time in Europe about a month ago, and I'll give you 2 examples. One is with the CEO of one of the largest consumer banks in the world who is looking at how does he embrace our technology, how does he embrace Einstein to drive digital transformation inside the consumer bank? And it is very real.","And financial services, as you know, it's an imperative because there's an incredible amount of disruption that's going on. Another example, I was with our President of EMEA, Miguel Milano, we went -- took a day trip up to Finland to meet with the CEO of Koenig. And this is a company that we would think as they are an elevator company. They are an escalator company, but the way that they view themselves is they're not really a B2B company, they're a B2C company. They move 1 billion people every single day and that's how they view themselves. So they want to go through a digital transformation to drive service because everything in their world is about service. And they're leveraging all of our technology, they're leveraging Sales and Service and Marketing and Einstein to make predictive insights about their customers' behavior and optimizing how they could move to these machines, these escalators and these elevators to optimize the experience for the consumer. So there is a ton of opportunity.","I actually think it's limitless. It is bound only by the imagination of what you can do with this technology. And in Europe, I find that the industrial manufacturers are actually quite progressive in their thinking. You find financial services institutions all over the world that are very progressive. AMP in Australia, the wealth manager, many of the financial services institutions that we've talked about here in the United States, the example I just gave you about the consumer bank over in Europe. But in terms of the manufacturing sector, EMEA is very, very progressive in terms of embracing digital transformation. And by the way, we see that at The World Economic Forum every year in Davos. Regarding your second question, I'm going to turn that over to Amy Weaver and she can give us a little bit of an update on that.","Amy Weaver","Great. Thanks for asking about this. So the GDPR, for anyone who does not know, is the new EU General Data Protection Regulation. And that's when you kind of expect about 1 year from now in May of 2018. And what is this going to do? Is this going to replace the current attach work of national data protection laws in the European Union and at the same time strengthening privacy rights. And at Salesforce, we really welcome the GDPR as an important step forward in streamlining all of these processes. And we're committed to making certain that our customers can continue to use our services while compliant to GDPR. It's something we are looking at very closely, and we will have further update to the market and to all of our customers throughout the year as we get closer to its implementation deadline.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Samad Samana with Stephens, Inc.","Samad Samana","So we thought at the New York City world tour, the company announced it was lowering the rev share for ISVs back to pre-2015 levels. What's the strategy behind that decision? And maybe related to that, can you give us an idea of what the revenue from ISVs represents as a percentage of total platform revenue? And overall what percentage of new ACVs coming from the partner ecosystem generally versus direct sales?","Keith Block","This is Keith. Let me try to address that as best as I can. Look, at the end of the day, we think we have the most compelling platform in the marketplace. I gave the example of Quintiles IMS who's building a mission-critical application. Clinical trial application, it's pretty serious stuff and they're going to be building that on top of our platform. Great example of an ISV. Another example obviously is Accenture. Vlocity, I mean, there's a roster that we've given here. And we want to drive proliferation and usage and adoption in the marketplace, and we want to make sure they're going to use price to value, and that's why we made an announcement in New York and also why we made the announcement around our fund, which we're very, very excited about to be able to invest in these ISVs. As far as breakout of ISVs, revenue and ACV and all that stuff, we don't disclose that. Mark Hawkins, I don't know, if you want to...","Mark Hawkins","Yes. In fact, just we concur, we don't, but I totally agree with your points there. I would add, Samad, that this is, as you know, is an exciting offering our Platform app grew 31%. It's another $1 billion, $1.5 billion cloud that's growing and rapidly towards $2 billion. So it's an exciting thing. And I think this change, Keith, is just simply part of amplifying the opportunity for customers. So that would be the net of it.","Operator","And your last question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays.","Raimo Lenschow","A lot of mine have been answered, but the one I wanted to talk to you about is now do you want to hit the $10 billion in revenue and only very few software companies have achieved that. Now that your eyes are kind of moving on towards the $20 billion, can you talk a little bit about the changes you need to think about in terms of organization and we need to think about as well because obviously, it's a completely different skill again then and it's something that kind of requires kind of careful planning?","Marc Benioff","Sure. I'm happy to talk to you about that. I think everyone at Salesforce is so excited to see our run rate begin to eclipse $10 billion in revenue. And of course, the big -- I think the big announcement on this call here, you can see the switches, the book business on and off the balance sheet is just the deferred revenue, which is what Mark, $14.6 billion. $14.6 billion...","Mark Hawkins","Yes, $14.6 billion. You're exactly right. Growing, Marc, 26%.","Marc Benioff","26%. So all of you are going to run your own financial models. You know how our revenue and expense models work. And you can start to model next year now based on that, which is very exciting, I think. Or you can model -- we run our models now for the next 2 or 3 years. Next to that, we have, of course -- we have a running 5-year long-range plan and a 5-year long-range budget that gets fueled and created by that on- and off-balance sheet deferred revenues, probably one of the most important things to drive that forward. And we -- that gives us the ability to kind of have a true north star of where our company is going and our finance team has done a great job in building these models and giving me the ability and then coupling it with Einstein to actually look to these models, too. And that is part of how we are able to deliver our quarter.","Specifically, as we start to look at eclipsing $10 billion and moving into much higher numbers going forward, of course, it's exciting to have that $20 billion in sight. And I think that you're going to see the transformation of Salesforce in a few areas and you already saw it with what Keith has -- Keith mentioned, which is started by talking about government. That's a major business opportunity for Salesforce going forward and a major vertical for us. Of course, financial services remains a major opportunity and major capability, health care. These major verticals, that's a major focus for us. Keith has spoken extensively about that transformation. That's really complemented by our strong focus and Keith touched on this with the top 10 enterprise focus as well as our commercial business unit has continued to grow. So those are some of the examples.","And then I would have to kind of couple in there the other major growth driver that we've kind of acquired our way into with ExactTarget, with Krux, with Demandware now becoming this incredible Salesforce Marketing Cloud and B2C. So when you look at things like government, financial services, health care, enterprise, commercial, B2C and I could go on and on in other critical areas for the company or by product, we touched on that. I think we have a very strong performance matrix that we are going to manage across all of our geographies, which also remains strong growth drivers, as you can see on the numbers for the quarter with Europe and Asia Pacific and Latin America as well. So that's how I look at it. I would like Mark to kind of touch on that as well.","Mark Hawkins","Sure, I'd love to add, and Marc, I was going to touch on international that you just covered as well. But I think the thing, Marc, that strikes me and some other really -- rather Raimo, I really appreciate when you teed up that question about going from $10 billion to $20 billion because it's talking about doubling the company and how do we think about doing that. Well, one of the things that helps us is we're used to thinking about doing that, we just doubled the company in the last 3 years, and we've been thinking a lot about laying the groundwork to make that happen and that's been a reality. So we obviously extended our planning to do it again. And I think that's one key thing. But the thing that really strikes me when we talk about that is obviously, it starts out with all the innovations and the offerings to make our customers successful to drive our top line, and we're getting that top line growth. You can see the market share progress. But what's hard to do is to get that kind of progress and success with the customer and the market share, Marc, and the operating margin that we talked about and the cash flow we're delivering all of that currently, and we're certainly planning to do that in the long-range plan.","Marc Benioff","Yes, and I think that really just touches on our core values in our company, which starts with customer success. And I think is more important than the trust and customer success that we continue to focus on. I think you'll continue to see that be amplified as we head towards $20 billion. We hire people who are focused on customer success. We have a culture of customers' success and trusted. We also hire people who want to build a growing business. These are people who like to work hard and who enjoy growth and who relish that. And that's important to us. And third, I would say innovation. We continue to deliver world-class innovation, both organically.","You've seen that with Einstein, with Lightning. And inorganically, we've seen that with Commerce Cloud and Krux and Quip. And this kind of perfect combination of that has created an amazing innovation inside our company. And we hire people who are focused on the quality because I think we all realize that we're in a world today where we have to focus on quality, that this is a time when each and every one of us has a personal responsibility to look at the world and ask, \"What value are we going to provide back to the world?\" And that's why you hear me talk extensively about the importance of K-12 education because I strongly believe education is equality. And you'll hear me talk more about that this weekend. In Saturday, we open our Indianapolis Tower, Salesforce Tower in Indiana where we become the largest tech employer. And that's a place where equality has become a very important and core value of Salesforce. ","So anyway, I want to thank all of our employees and customers and partners for an outstanding quarter and being so committed to our company and helping us to achieve these incredible milestones. And we're looking forward not only to the next level, but working together as a Salesforce family going forward to these incredible new heights. So thank you very much, everybody.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

I am in Geneva at the World Economic Forum headquarters where I'm attending our annual Board of Trustees meeting and also our international business committee of our top 200 CEOs in the world.","And it's been fascinating meeting. But I'll tell you one thing that everyone is really excited about here is what happened in the United States which is that the business roundtable, one of the top two business groups in the U.S. published an incredible statement this week on the purpose of a corporation and talked about how the purpose of the corporation is to serve all stakeholders.","And why that's exciting here is many of the words that they were using almost exact phrases were written by Klaus Schwab, the founder of the World Economic Forum. Over 50 years ago when he was at UC, Berkeley, and it's great to see the BR team take this incredibly progressive stance and I'm just very grateful to them because of course at Salesforce we do believe that business is the greatest platform for change.","Well, I want to just thank you, John for introducing that and also thank you everybody for being on the call today. And as you can see, we had just incredible quarter here. Revenue in the quarter rose to $4 billion, up 22% in dollars and 23% constant currency and we ended the quarter with more than $25 billion in total remaining performance obligation. That was up 20% versus last year. It's really amazing what's happening at Salesforce.","With our organic growth in our acquisitions of Tableau, Salesforce.org, ClickSoftware, we are raising our fiscal year 2020 revenue guidance to $16.9 billion at the high-end of our range representing about 27% growth year-over-year.","Now, we have really been very strategic in building out our Customer 360 platform. This is our vision that really is at the heart of what's happening at the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Everybody knows the Fourth Industrial Revolution is underway. Everyone and everything is getting connected.","But behind all of those things is the customer and certainly all the customers that I'm working with here in Geneva, all the customers that we work with around the world, well, they realized that behind all that Fourth Industrial Revolution is their customer and that they need to build that Customer 360 platform.","And that's what we're doing. We're doing everything we can to build\/deliver this incredible vision and we couldn't be more excited to build out our Customer 360 platform organically as well as through the acquisition of some phenomenal companies and some phenomenal talent.","Now with Customer 360 we have just never really been better positioned for the future. In fact, we're the beginning of an enormous wave of digital transformation, I'm certainly seeing that here in Geneva.","IDC forecast global spending on digital transformation to reach $1.18 trillion in 2019, that's an increase of nearly 18% over last year, truly quite amazing. And Salesforce is at the center of this massive shift because every digital transformation of every single one of these companies that we're talking to begins and ends with the customer.","In fact, IDC also forecasts global spending on customer experience alone to reach $641 billion by 2022.","Every company needs a intelligent, 360 degree view of their customers. They need to personalize every customer experience. They need to predict customer behavior and anticipate their customer needs, and they need to build modern mobile apps quickly and deliver the right services at the right time on any device.","Well, that is Customer 360. Our vision for bringing companies and their customers together and it will be a huge growth engine for us over the next decade. And for our customers it's their aspirational goal. They're all trying to create a Customer 360. They want a Customer 360 to see what's happening with their customers in this incredible time of change. And they want to understand their customers and connect with them like never before.","Salesforce is their number one CRM, and our Customer 360 platform is a leader in sales, in service, marketing, commerce, communities, integration, app dev and more. Customer 360 includes amazing platform services such as absolutely leading artificial intelligence and breakthroughs, envision and voice, in mobility and security.","And because they're all built into the foundation of that platform they're available to everyone our customers, to every app, and everyone. We're operating a tremendous scale. Just look at some of the daily milestones our customers have helped us achieve with our Customer 360 platform.","4 million sales opportunities and 4.3 million leads generated today, 77 million service case interactions log, 4.1 billion messages and email sent, 4.2 million orders processed bot, 53 million reports and dashboards created every day and 700 million commerce pages.","We're delivering world-class AI with Einstein, Salesforce Einstein in Customer 360. It's actually generating now and I know many of you've been following this and it's been incredible for me to see this.","But we actually do now 8.6 billion Einstein predictions a day using our market-leading artificial intelligence platform. We've also made Einstein Voice and Einstein Vision available to every Salesforce app and these AI-powered capabilities are the future of the customer experience.","We're also extending the power of Customer 360 with new services like Salesforce Blockchain, Salesforce Maps and as we've seen this quarter is specifically Salesforce Blockchain is the world's first declared Blockchain solution for CRM built natively on our platform.","And with this new Salesforce Maps we're adding intelligent location-based services that improve productivity for sales and service employees to the field was built really building out that Customer 360 vision and our team has just done an incredible job getting this in the hands of customers.","At the heart of Customer 360 is our incredible community of our Trailblazers. They are using Trailhead, our free online digital learning platform to get the skills they need for the jobs in the digital economy. We're more focused on this digital education than ever and we realize to achieve this vision of a new economy that we all want, we have to deliver this next-generation vision of education as well.","We now have 1.5 million learners changing their careers and changing their lives on Trailhead. It's a 50% increase over last year and really cool, just last week we announced a partnership with Southern New Hampshire University, one of the fastest growing universities in the U.S. so that Trailblazers can now earn college credit for free on Trailhead. That's just an incredible lean forward for Trailhead.","Well, Saleforce skills are in high demand. For those of you who watch what happen, I think just now about a week ago we saw that the Salesforce developer was ranked at the second number two on GlassDoor's list of jobs are the best career opportunities that was amazing for us.","A huge economy is developing around Salesforce one that will create more than 3 million jobs and more than 860 billion GDP impact worldwide by 2022 and we'll continue to create opportunities for everyone to participate.","With our Customer 360 vision with amazing Einstein innovations, the millions of Trailblazers innovating on our platform, Salesforce is incredibly well-positioned to help companies transform their customers.","And you'll see all this at our \u2013 all this amazing innovation and all this amazing customer success at Dreamforce which this year will be November 19th in San Francisco. You probably know it's almost sold out, so you better register now. We are really right down to our last few seats and we'll be bringing together the thought leaders, industry pioneers, amazing innovators, incredible customers and of course all of our Trailblazers for four days of customer success stress, innovation of quality and learning.","Dreamforce is an expression of our core values, our commitment to giving back which have been the key to our success to the business over the last two decades. For those of you know, we also something about to come out which is my -- our new book Trailblazer, the Power of Business is the greatest platform for Change including many of the concepts pioneered by Klaus Schwab here at the World Economic Forum in Geneva. It comes out on October 15, so you can preorder your book now and I hope you'll get a chance to read it. And let me know what you think at Dreamforce. And until then, I will look foresee you all of you in November.","And now, over to Keith.","Keith Block","Thanks Marc and thanks everybody for joining us on the call today. As Marc said, we have an incredible opportunity ahead as more and more companies invest in their digital transformation. Across every industry, every geography, they are turning to Salesforce as their trust advisor into our Customer 360 platform as the foundation and catalyst of their growth.","That's clearly reflected in our Q2 numbers as we continue to see great result across our clouds, our industry solution and our region. The hundreds of customers that Marc and I meet with every quarter are looking for a vision and they're looking for strategy that will help them propel their growth and to get closer to their customers.","They're asking us about the future of their industries. They are asking us about their peers, their competitors and how are they transforming. They're asking us about best practices from other industries. They're asking us most importantly about how to innovate.","But it's not just about technology. They also want to learn about Salesforce culture and our values and how we can help them drive success with their customers, their partners and their employees.","Now, throughout the quarter, we continue to build and strengthen our relationships with leading brands around the world. FedEx selected Salesforce in the quarter is the platforms for their customer service transformation.","FedEx will use Service Cloud Einstein in their call centers to drive agent productivity with AI-powered recommendations in Einstein analytics to get a deeper understanding of their customers needs across their business.","The Union Pacific Railroad system, one of the world's largest transportation companies chose Salesforce as its unified CRM platform to deliver faster, more proactive service. Now that includes automated shipping notifications and tracking updates, so customers can plan better and improve their shipping experience, very important.","Airbnb turned to Salesforce to power its global messaging program. Airbnb expanded with Marketing Cloud that continue to deliver meaningful hyper personalized communications with its community of guests, hosts and travelers engaging with all Airbnb users across the globe on a single platform.","And we continue to expand our relationship with Marriott, one of the world's great companies which is using Salesforce to better anticipate each guest travel needs and display relevant offers during that stay and provide a more personalized customer experience.","Now, in May we have announced Einstein Analytics for financial services giving wealth advisors, managers and retail bankers that AI-powered insights they need to better serve customers and grow their book of business.","Our momentum in financial services continues. We expanded our relationship with HSBC and form the new relationship with Unicredit in Italy in the quarter. In the public sector, the U.S. federal government increased its Salesforce investment including the Bureau of Land Management, the USDA and U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.","A critical part of customer service for many of our customers is also field service. It is incredibly strategic to their operations and differentiates them, and that's why as of Q2, Field Service Lightning is growing at nearly 100% year-over-year.","Now in the quarter FOX Sports chose Field Service Lightning to manage production workflows, employees, equipment, facilities, rentals and more for its live broadcast. And with our recent agreement to acquire Click Software we'll be able to deliver even greater field service innovation to our customer, so that's very, very exciting.","Our international revenue growth continued in the quarter, super strong with EMEA growing at 30% ,APAC growing at 27% year-over-year both in constant currency, AXA , one of the largest insurance companies in the world is on a journey to a global 360 degree view of every customer and in the quarter they made a number of strategic investments across several divisions including deploying service filed to give their insurance agents the complete view of every customer enabling them to have smarter or personalized conversation.","In EMEA, we form new relationships with HDM in Germany, the largest global manufacturer of offset printing press and fashion retail organization Esprit, both choosing Commerce Cloud in the quarter.","In Australia we expanded with ANZ Bank [ph] and form new relationships with Ramsay Health Care and the Australian Department of Environment and Energy. In Japan, we expanded with Hitachi and Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance. Our partners very critical to our strategy continue to help us deliver customer success. In Q2 partners were engaged in 68% of our new business. And these partners continue to invest in their Salesforce practices.","Global partner certifications are up 40% year-over-year. That just keeps going and going and going. All seven of our top consulting partners run their practices on Salesforce, and Salesforce is their fastest growing enterprise practice.","Strategic partnerships are absolutely critical to our future and that's why we're thrilled about our new relationship with Alibaba, as a global company it is important for us to support our multinational customers wherever they do business.","And finally, we close our acquisition of Salesforce.org in the quarter and we continue to seek incredible demand in the non-profit and education verticals. We work with more than 44,000 non-profit and higher education customers and our employees have given more than 4.3 million volunteer hours and we delivered nearly $300 million in grants which is pretty amazing.","Last quarter, I mentioned making investments to fill the next chapter of our growth around the world. Now part of that investment is bringing incredible talents into the company and we've been very fortunate at two extraordinary executives at EMEA and APAC to our international leadership team.","Later this fall, Jayne-Anne Gadhia will become CEO for Salesforce U.K. and Ireland and Pip Marlow will be joining us as CEO for Salesforce Australia and New Zealand and we're very excited to have both on board. They are both great executives.","And on closing, I'd like to thank our employees, our partners and our customers around the world for their support and of course our company's great execution, so thanks to everybody.","And now, I'll hand this off to Mark Hawkins.","Mark Hawkins","Well, thanks, Keith. As you've heard we delivered strong results in the second quarter, including generating durable organic revenue growth and organic operating margin expansion year-over-year.","Here are few highlights. Total revenue grew 22% in dollars and 23% in constant currency. Excluding Salesforce.org total revenue grew 20% in dollars and 21% in constant currency.","cRPO grew 23% in dollars and 25% in constant currency and we continue to put up solid organic revenue growth across each of our clouds and in our geographies. There are few moving parts here for Q2 results, so let me take you through some of the additional details starting with revenue.","Total revenue for the second quarter was $3.997 billion including $54 million of acquisition of Salesforce.org. Just as we saw in Q1, we continue to experience FX headwinds to revenue in the second quarter of approximately $34 million year-over-year and approximately $20 million sequentially.","Looking at the drivers of growth by cloud, we continue to see strong subscription and support revenue growth year-over-year with sales cloud growth of 13%, service cloud growth of 22%, marketing and commerce cloud growth of 36%, and platform and other 28% which probably includes $159 million of MuleSoft, approximately 54% of MuleSoft subscription and support revenue is treated as term license.","Let me call out a few other items related to the various cloud growth rates in the quarter. First, the FX headwind of a total -- for total revenue that I mentioned earlier, represents approximately one percentage point of growth year-over-year, and that affected each of our clouds on a similar proportional basis.","Second, our acquisition of Salesforce.org represented approximately one to two percentage points of growth year-over-year across each of our clouds. Third, this was the first quarter of a normalized year-over-year compelling MuleSoft. So where MuleSoft now on the base period, the rate of growth of platform and other moderated in Q1 to Q2 as expected.","Adjusted for these items, we are very pleased to deliver robust organic constant currency revenue growth across each of our clouds in Q2. Attrition also remain healthy in Q2 as we have seen over the past several quarters, with dollar attrition continuing to decline modestly year-over-year remaining below 10%.","Turning to operating margin, Q2 non-GAAP operating margin was 14.3%, down 349 basis points year-over-year. As a reminder our Q2 operating margin EPS results were affected by the settlement of our reseller agreement with Salesforce.org.","This one time non-cash accounting charge of $166 million is reported as a discrete line item on statement of the income and was slightly lower than we anticipated. We continue with our efforts to improve our operating efficiencies and we're pleased to deliver Q2 non-GAAP operating margin improvement excluding the Salesforce.org non-cash accounting charge of approximately 66 basis points year-over-year.","Q2 GAAP EPS was $0.11 and non-GAAP was $0.66. In Q2 below the line mark-to-market adjustments benefited GAAP EPS in the second quarter by approximately $0.10 and non-GAAP EPS by approximately $0.11, business outperformance in the quarter ,along with a lower than anticipated salesforce.org settlement charge benefited GAAP and non-GAAP EPS by approximately $0.08.","Turning to cash flow. Second quarter operating cash flow was $436 million, down 5% year-over-year. Operating cash flow in the quarter was impacted by a recent M&A activity as well as continued FX headwind. On a trailing 12 month basis, we're pleased to deliver operating cash flow of 25%.","CapEx for the quarter was $178 million, leading to free cash flow defined as operating cash flow less CapEx of $258 million down 10% over last year. On a trailing 12-month basis we're pleased to deliver free cash flow growth of 26%.","Remaining performance obligation ended the second quarter approximately $25.3 billion, up 20% versus last year. Current RPO which is approximately $12.1 billion was up 23% year-over-year and on a constant currency basis was up 25%. Salesforce.org contributed approximately $200 million to this amount.","Now turning to Q3 and FY 2020 guidance. We're pleased to be raising our full year FY 2020 revenue to $16.75 billion to $16.90 billion for full year growth of approximately 26% to 27%. This guidance includes approximately $550 million to $600 million in revenue from our acquisition of Tableau.","Approximately $200 million in revenue from the acquisition of Salesforce.org and approximately $25 million in revenue from Click Software, excluding these acquired businesses we expect top line revenue growth of 20% to 21% year-over-year. This outlook reflects approximately $200 million in FX headwind for the full year.","Turning to our outlook for operating margins we now expect FY 2020 non-GAAP operating margins to be down approximately 50 basis points year-over-year. Our FY 2020 non-GAAP operating margin guide is the result of several factors. First, is the one time non-cash settlement charge of $166 million related to Salesforce.org reseller agreement.","Second, is the blended margin profile of the recently acquired businesses namely Salesforce.org and Tableau, which we'd anticipate at roughly break even non-cash margins for FY 2020 inclusive of the purchase accounting. And Click Software which is modestly diluted along with the associated transaction cost.","In fact, excluding the impact of these acquisitions this year, we expect our FY 2020 non-GAAP operating margin improvement year-over-year to be more than 150 basis points, which is higher than the improvement we've initially laid out at the beginning of the year.","For EPS we're updating our FY 2020 GAAP diluted EPS of $0.28 to $0.30 and our non-GAAP diluted EPS of $2.82 to $2.84. For operating cash flow, we're pleased to be maintaining our FY 2020 operating cash flow guidance of 21% to 22% despite the increased expenses from recent M&A and the cash impact of FX headwinds.","For Q3, we expect revenue in the range of $4.44 billion to $4.45 billion or 31% growth year-over-year. This guidance assumes revenue of approximately $300 million from Tableau and approximately $75 million from Salesforce.org. We also expect Q3 GAAP diluted loss per share of $0.21 to $0.20 and non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.65 to $0.66.","We expect cRPO growth of approximately 24% to 25% year-over-year in the third quarter. This guidance assumes around two points of growth from Salesforce.org and two to three points of growth from Tableau. Click Software does not have a material impact on the cRPO growth and excluding this acquired cRPO, we anticipate that our cRPO growth would be approximately 20% year-over-year.","Lastly, regarding our long term FY 2023 revenue target, we continue to be on track for this and to achieve our long term revenue goals on an organic basis. And as previously discussed we plan to update these targets factoring in recent acquisitions during our annual Analyst Day at Dreamforce in November.","To close, we delivered another strong quarter of durable revenue growth and organic margin expansion. We continue to invest to foolproof -- future proof our technology and scale of our business globally. And I'd like to thank our employees, our customers, our partners and our shareholders for your continued support.","And with that, I'd like to open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Mark Murphy from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Mark Murphy","Yes. Thank you very much. Congrats on a superb quarter. Marc, I wanted to ask you, we're witnessing such a bifurcation in the retailer's results this year. We've seen companies like Target and Wal-Mart and Home Depot doing well. And at the same time it seems like the Amazon is hurting some of the others whether it would be Sears or Barneys or Nordstrom or the GAP or others. I'm wondering if you're finding the retailers that adopted Demandware are actually competing better. And then, and just -- is this retail apocalypse kind of causing companies in other industries Q1 to adopt Salesforce a little faster so that they don't get Amazon or uberized?","Marc Benioff","Well thanks so much for that question. I'll tell you that I think that we are rapidly heading towards this Fourth Industrial Revolution and that this digital transformation is hitting every industry, and retail certainly is one of the major industries that is really been taken the stand and deliver, and you are seeing a bifurcating between those organizations who are ready for this transformation and those who aren't. But it includes not just the ability to have a strong digital presence but also being able to understand what your strength is in regards to your physical presence and making those to work together in a synergistic way. Well, that is where the magic is for many of the organizations that you mentioned.","I work with a lot of those CEOs personally and I can tell you that they've done a tremendous job. You mentioned Target, I mean you just have to go in and see what they've done online is matched as well as what they've done in the physical store. I think that that's kind of an indication of where the future is going. You didn't see of course Amazon moving into the physical world as well. We've seen tremendous success with our own e-commerce platform. We're very excited with Demandware. And some of the customers that we've seen on that platform have really just trounced their competitors. Of course there's a lot of good examples; Adidas [ph] is one, but there's so many others.","And every one of these companies needs a strong platform like Demandware, but I'll tell you it's more than that, it means that they have a real Customer 360 because once that customer actually gets to the store you want to know everything about them in terms of a 360 experience. And we have a number of luxury retailers some that I can mention by name, but honestly a lot of them, so I just cannot by their own request who have done a tremendous job of integrating their digital experience and their physical experience. And when you walk into one of their stores they say, hey did you know we have this new capability or that new capability where you purchase something and in this product line and it's made a big difference for them.","So you're 100% right that transformation in retail is underway and we're excited to offer that Customer 360 vision to the top retailers, so that they can offer whether it's in sales or service or as you mentioned e-commerce or marketing or app development or so many other things the ability to be competitive. Thanks for the question.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Heather Bellini","Great. Thank you so much. I mean, Marc you've been one of the most strategic visionaries in the software market over the last two decades. And obviously you built one of the biggest cloud companies to-date through a combination of internal R&D and M&A and I guess that's where my questions would lie. Can you share with us your vision for M&A as you look ahead and how you think especially now that you've kind of gotten into the on-premise market as well? How you think about the marriage of the cloud footprint and the on-premise footprint?","And I guess the other question that we get asked a lot about and I'm sure others do on the line is, how do you think about the margin tradeoff that come with that bigger TAM? And given Mark Hawkins talked about it on the call, the fiscal 2023 target there -- are there any thoughts of maybe ever adding a margin target to the [Indiscernible] inorganic number? So I guess that's where my focus is. Thank you very much for taking the questions.","Marc Benioff","Well, thanks Heather and I'll let Mark directly addressed the issues of guidance. But I'll tell you that, the way we look at it is innovation is happening everywhere and we have tremendous innovation happen been in the Salesforce, and that's been so important for us over the last 21 years. But we're also in all of -- a lot of other innovation that's happening outside of our company and we've been fortunate to have a big enough view of innovation that it's motivated us to be one of the most innovative companies in the world because we were the hardest both organic and inorganic innovation I think in a really positive way.","And I have to also thank our customers because a lot of the ideas that we've created whether it's software we've \u2013 software we've built or companies we've bought it's really been driven by those customers. I mean a great example just tying back to the last call is Demandware, one of those luxury retailers is based in Paris. I was having a meeting with them, and they took me aside and they said the company that you should acquire is Demandware and here's why. They had already moved to Salesforce and other services and -- but they had a gap in their Customer 360 and they wanted our ability to be able to connect Demandware into what we were doing so that they could have, be more competitive themselves.","And that has turned out to be really great for them and augment our vision of what CRM is and also being able to execute our Customer 360 vision. I think that when I look out and I just was thinking about conversations that I had today, we're really at a moment in time where these top CEOs in the world all realize not only do their digital transformation has to be under way, their customer experience has to be first. And I'll let Marc to answer the rest of the question.","Mark Hawkins","Sure. Thank you, Marc, and thank you Heather for the question. We certainly highly prize the operating margin expansion. It's something that's very important to us. Over time as you can see over the last several years we've been expanding that. We do make tradeoffs between our organic growth and margin. The tradeoffs are something that we always look at when we look at this opportunity to serve the customer. We have been making considerable progress over the years, but we know there's more work to be done and that's something that we're always thinking about and trying to focus on constantly improving.","We're certainly going to be talking about that in February when we give out our operating margin targets. And I hear your point about exploring beyond one year, but certainly we'll be talking about the operating margin in February.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from a line of Kash Rangan with Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Kash Rangan","Hi. Thank you very much. I'd like to first applaud the company for the tremendous amount of clarity and the straightforwardness of how you report your financials such as the organic versus the acquired currency impact. You go through excruciating detail to make it abundantly clear how your core business is doing particularly the fact that margins are projected to grow excluding the acquisitions more than you anticipated. So I just want to give you a round of applause on the clarity and straightforwardness of the disclosure.","Now the question for you Marc as you move ahead you're targeting a $28 plus million revenue company with the diversity of end markets that we've just simply not seen in software, the prior analogs and the on-prem with this SAP or Oracle. Just didn't quite have the diversity of end markets that Salesforce.com is pursuing. So as you plan to roughly doubled revenues, how does that go-to-market nature of how you're going. How does the go to market strategy evolved as you attacked a breadth and complexity of markets that the world has simply just not seen, and there's no recipe to follow?","Marc Benioff","Well, let me fill in some of it, but then also let me ask Keith really to fill in the rest. I think you said it really well which is that we've worked really hard to build this Customer 360 platform. It's taken us 21 years and it turns out, this is exactly what customers want and really need to be competitive in today's world. And as we go to now execute and deliver that, we are focused on how do we do that by region, by country where we're really looking at how we're doing that by segment, it's extremely important.","And I think that for us certainly we started just with Salesforce automation. That was our kind of soul app if you will. But it was it was clear from a focus with customers that if we're going to continue to build serve them we had to get to customer \u2013 to Customer 360. So, Bret maybe you also want to add to that and then Keith I think maybe it'd be great if you filled in on the go-to-market as well.","Bret Taylor","Yes. I think Marc, you put it well, which is as we think about our value proposition, it spans a lot of different markets, but it's all under this umbrella of digital transformation. And I think the defining characteristic of companies in the Fourth Industrial Revolution is the things driving the digital investment is customer experience. Customers are demanding that their interact with these companies in new ways. And that does span the entire portfolio.","The question that came up earlier about Demandware and commerce, its a lot more than that. When you think about what it defines your retail experience, it's about customer service, it's about buying online and picking up in-store, its about merging the physical and the digital. It's about how you get recommendations and marketing after you've purchased something.","And so when I look at our portfolio, it spans wide breadth of functionality. But when I talk to the CEOs of all the major companies in the world that's what they need to transform is all of the above. And when they fragment their customer experience by thinking of them as separate categories or silos they can't actually achieve the vision of the digital native companies that you mentioned before. So, I think our breath is an asset when we go into these conversations with our customers because I think we can provide a more complete vision for their digital transformation than any other company.","Keith Block","Yes. And listen, on their go-to-market side, we made a conscious decision over the last few years to really focus on three things. One is how do you take an international company and turn it into a global company. And there is a large difference between being an international company and being a global company, a lot of that is around culture behavior and how you solve customer problems. The second was really a movement towards selling solutions and speaking the language of the customer and understanding an industry. And just to give you an example of that, in two weeks, I have to go to New York which I'm very, very happy about to address the board of one of the -- I would say the most prestigious retailers in North America. I talk about the future of retail.","A couple weeks ago I had dinner with the CEO of a different company, although same industry, but it's one of the largest retailers in the world and they want to talk about how our Customer 360 platform can help them drive growth and optimize customer experience. So being able to understand the industry and enabling our field organizations and our entire company on understanding an industry and being able to solve the customer problem is a huge part of it.","The third piece of this is moving from a partner ecosystem to a strategic ecosystem. And part of our ecosystem is really encompassing with our classic firms that we do business with like the Accentures, and the PWCs and the Deloitte to the world who are just well processed, but how do we extend that community to drive success for our customers everywhere in the world. And that's why we formed partnerships with companies like Alibaba because we have the service companies all over the world, we have global operations, again I mentioned the word global. It also means that we continue to invest in this Trailblazer community, where we want millions of people who evangelize and architect solutions that drive success for our customers.","And then the final component which I mentioned on the call is talent. We are fortunate enough because of our culture and the type of company and our values to be a destination company for talent. And we have attracted some amazing people whose careers we continue to grow, who are very focused on customer success, as well as these other folks like we talked about with the Jayne-Ann Gadhia, for example who's going to be running the U.K. eye for us. And having those executives, having that talent in place who are passionate about customer success and driving solutions really makes us I think a very, very unique company and that's why you see the success. And that's why we're optimistic about the future.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citigroup. Your line is now open.","Walter Pritchard","Hi. Thanks. Question for Mark Hawkins or for Keith Block. I think it's been a couple of years back, you gave a framework around cost to serve on Dreamforce Analyst Day. And I'm wondering you are talking about seeing really good underlying margin progression in the business ex-acquisition. Could you update us on into those two drivers where you're seeing the margin improvement which \u2013 it's a little bit harder for us to tell given the acquisition influence on each of the OpEx and cost of revenue line items, that'll be helpful?","Mark Hawkins","Sure. Well, first of all, thank you Walter and I'm happy to do that. I think the thing that we are making progress on right now is in the area of gross margin. You'll take note, we've been investing for quite some time to get more scale and capability there and we're pleased to see some progress on that. We're getting also progress in our G&A areas as we look to make G&A more efficient as we scale up the company. That's certainly an area that we're making progress as well. We have a great initiative.","I think our team driving even customer success there in it to really help deliver an even better performance while also scaling. And I think these are some of the areas in the cost in particular that we're doing. And Walter, I would add just one additional point in an area of cost to book, that's always a choice, it's always a tradeoff. And we just had a great market opportunity in front of us to serve our customer. And we're obviously investing there but always looking for progress as well. But those other areas are the key areas that we're focused on.","Walter Pritchard","Okay. Thank you.","Mark Hawkins","You're welcome.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Keith Weiss","Hi, guys. Thank you for taking the question and a very nice quarter. I wanted just Keith Block opinion on or perspective on potential synergies from the recent acquisitions particularly Tableau, given the success you guys have seen with MuleSoft over the past year, where should we expect sort of the biggest synergies? What are you most excited about in terms of adding Tableau, and may we can put Click Software into there as well into the portfolio as we look over the next year? And then one for Mark Hawkins, can you repeat the Tableau guidance again in terms of what the full year contribution is and what the Q3 contribution is. Because it seems like it implies like a smaller Q4 than Q3. I want to make sure I have those numbers right?","Marc Benioff","Let me address \u2013 hi, Keith. Let me address the first part of this and then I'll ask Mark Hawkins to comment as well. So look, we're incredibly excited about Tableau. It's a great company, a set of great products. It's got an incredible development community. It's got a great executive team and customers love their products. As far as Click Software and I'll let Mark talk about Tableau in a second, but as far as Click Software, we're very, very excited about the Click Software acquisition. As you may know Field Service is incredibly strategic to a number of industries such as utilities, telecommunications, equipment manufacturers and we have a very strong product in Field Service Lightning.","And the combination of Field Service Lightning which grew 100% by the way year-over-year in the quarter and Click Software is very, very compelling. So that's a great example of marrying innovation organically and inorganically. So we're super excited about that. And Mark I know you have some comments specifically on the Tableau.","Mark Hawkins","Yes. I do in fact. And let me take the numbers first and we'll talk about the synergy secondly. First of all, Keith I just want to call off for the year as it relates to Tableau we're anticipating $550 million to $600 million contribution for the year, and of course that's not of the DRE [ph] write-down, number one. Number two; for the quarter for Tableau I just want to reiterate that we're looking at $300 million and the Q3 time period again net the DRE write-down. That's the first part of your question. The second part of your question has to do with synergies. And I just would call out and say that look, we're incredibly excited, but as discussed at the beginning of the call, we're running the companies separately right now as operating independently.","Right now, it's an incredible company with a fantastic product and leadership team. We're so pleased about that and so excited about that. But let me take a step back and address the spirit of your question. We have a tremendous history with acquisitions of complementing organic innovation and being able to make progress in that way. And when we do M&A, we're always looking for opportunities to make these companies even better and have even greater success for our customers, which is what it's all about at the end of the day. So I've never been more excited about our ability to create more success for our customers that with the strategy, that's what I would say.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","Kirk Materne","Thanks very much and congratulations on the quarter. My question might be for either Keith or Marc Benioff. I was wondering if you could just talk about Europe a little bit. It's obviously been a real source of strength through you over the last few quarters. Just where is the market. I think broadly just in terms of adoption and thinking about things like Customer 360 it seems like it's hitting a little bit of an inflection point and we just love your thoughts on that? Thanks.","Keith Block","Yes. So, Marc and I have actually been flying around the world quite a bit. I spent about a four-week trip where I was in Japan. I was in the United States I was in Canada. I was in the U.K. and Switzerland and France and Italy and meeting with CEOs from various industries in those geographies. You can see from the results EMEA continues to be very, very strong for us with 30% growth in the quarter. And just go back to the UniCredit situation that I mentioned in the earnings call. This is a very strong bank in Italy. I think we're all aware of the situation that's going on in Italy from a macro perspective, from a government perspective. But the CEO of UniCredit is really betting the future of UniCredit around Customer 360 initiative and the experience for his customers that he wants and how he wants to transform that bank.","And that is the same conversation that is going on in every industry. I was in Paris meeting with one of the largest bank\u2019s CEOs in the world. You know the Barclays story that we have in the U.K. We have industrial manufacturers in Germany automotive manufacturers who are trying to improve the customer experience and driving 360 degree. So the one thing that is very, very clear to me is that whatever is going on around the world we see a buying environment. We see CEOs investing. And top of mind for them is digital transformation, which begins and ends with the customer. And that's why they're talking to us and that's why you're seeing these results.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from our Richard Davis with Canaccord. Your line is now open.","Richard Davis","Hey, thanks. So, maybe a technology question. So, I saw that you guys at Gartner ranked you guys, Salesforce as a leader in low-code and in addition you're doing really well in Decision Support with Einstein. And then the other third area that's really hot these days is this whole robotic process automation. So the question I have you maybe for Marc is because you're you think about these things is you know how do you see Salesforce participating in each of those three markets, because it sure seems to me that those three technologies are going to have to work closer with each other over time because they just feel like they're going to intersect and so how does Salesforce position itself for that kind of next wave of those three things kind of connecting with each other? Thanks.","Marc Benioff","Well, I'm going to actually ask Bret to answer that question. I mean I think it's perfectly set up for him to deliver, so Bret you want to hit it.","Bret Taylor","Yes, absolutely. This is really our vision for the Customer 360 platform, which is a platform that works together with all these technology that's accessible to all of our Trailblazers. And when we talk a lot about Trailhead and we talk about this vision of low-code, that's what we mean. There is 1.5 million people are earning 15 million badges, are learning how to apply these advanced technologies and the technologies you mentioned in the first half of this year alone the capabilities had this platform are incredible. We added the Salesforce Blockchain. We added Salesforce Maps. We added Einstein translation, Einstein Voice, Einstein Vision.","We have all these capabilities and they're accessible to everyone on our platform in a low-code way. And what that means for our customers is it's easy for them to leverage these technologies to improve their customer experience. And all those technologies you mentioned the challenges that we hear in the market is these customers are excited about these new technologies and what they could do for their customer experience. But it's often cost prohibitive or too complex to do so. And that's the value they see in our Customer 360 platform. That's why as Marc mentioned Salesforce is the number two most appealing job according to GlassDoor.","In the first half of this year alone over 72,000 new job postings for Salesforce jobs were posted on just the top two job sites. You're seeing the draw of this platform and you're seeing how empowering it is for \u2013 I think anyone in the world can become a Salesforce developer. You could if you go on fill out after this call.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Brad Zelnick from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Brad Zelnick","Thanks so much and congrats again on a fantastic quarter. I'll throw this question out up for grabs and it's really just to dig in a little bit deeper on Service Cloud with the re-acceleration this quarter, just wondering if you could help unpack that a little bit. You called out Field Service Lightning strength in your prepared remarks, but I'd love to hear any additional color in terms of competition win rates and also how you see the products coming together with ClickSoftware coming into the fold? Thanks.","Mark Hawkins","So, why don't I take that and then I think Bret will want to weigh-in as well from the product strategy perspective. This way the digital transformation is really fueled by so many things that is the foundation of it is the 360 degree view of the customer and each of the elements of that 360 degree view of the customer important whether it's relative to the use case and the problem that you're trying to solve whether it's sales or service or marketing or commerce. And service is just very powerful. If you look at companies in a variety of industries they like to differentiate themselves by service and customer experience is a big component of that. And field service is a big component of that.","So as we talk to these executives about the future of growth you can't have growth without the great customer experience and that starts with service. So Bret, I'm sure you want to add to that as well.","Bret Taylor","Yes. I'll add to \u2013 I do think our customers are driving us here because service defines their brand. But I also think it shows the power of this Customer 360 platform because all of these fundamental technology innovations we're investing in really I think benefits service in an unique way. Obviously, with Einstein bots enabled customers to deploy frontline support using AI. This past quarter, we added Einstein case routing, so we can route support cases that people have the best skill to provide the best customer experience at the right time. You saw the growth in field service which we are really proud of. It really shows how our investment in maps and geo location and mobility are all sort of converging to enable these customers to provide the right support to the right customers wherever they happen to be.","And so I really want to say that this is really what I view as the power of the platform. We're doing so much leverage from our technology investments to enable the experience that Keith talked about.","Operator","Thank you. And our last question will come from the line of Jennifer Lowe with UBS. Your line is now open.","Jennifer Lowe","Great. Thank you. I wanted to circle back on some of the discussion earlier about going from international company to a global company and the addition of CEOs in a couple of particularly strategic markets? And I'm curious as you add that role what sort of the mandate there? What do you view as sort of core competencies that need to start by global leadership versus providing regional leadership with the flexibility to make the changes or run the business in a way that they see as most appropriate on the ground in that market?","Mark Hawkins","Well, Jennifer, one of the important things of being a global company is to be able to think globally and think strategically and act locally. And we want to empower our leaders in the field so that they can make decisions on behalf of the customers in front of the customers. There's an expression that says, the best decisions are not made in the office. They are made out in the field. And by hiring these senior executives and cultivating and growing our other executives inside the company so that they're empowered to make these decisions. We think this is a perfect way to skill [ph] a company.","With respect to being a global company versus an international company, kind of the key tenant of being a global is that you act the same, you behave the same, you execute the same no matter where you are all over the world, whether it is with one or many customers. And as we bring in these senior executives, we're augmenting and enhancing an already incredible management team. So we're super excited about these adds and challenges and important strategy for the future.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question and answer session for today. I'll now hand the call back over the company for any closing comments or remarks.","Marc Benioff","Thanks everybody for participating in the call today.

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. David Havlek, Head of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin your conference.","David Havlek","Thanks, Jamaria, and good afternoon to everyone joining us today to discuss salesforce.com's First Quarter Fiscal Year 2013 Results. The details of our results can be found in a press release issued about an hour ago or in our Form 8-K filed with the SEC.","Joining me today, as always, to discuss our first quarter performance, Marc Benioff, Chairman and CEO, as well as Graham Smith, our Chief Financial Officer.

And let me just go through some of these highlights of the quarter, just awesome.","Revenue for the first quarter was up 38% from a year ago to $695 million. We just couldn't have asked for anything more, and we now have an annual revenue run rate of nearly $2.8 billion. Operating cash flow exceeded $210 million, an increase of more than 50% year-over-year, and that absolutely is our strongest Q1 cash flow ever, 50% year-over-year growth.","Deferred revenue more than $1.3 billion, which is up 46% year-over-year, only better by the dollar value of book business, which now, on and off the balance sheet, now tops $4 billion. That's an increase of more than $400 million from the fourth quarter.","Now given our strong financial results and the pipeline of new business, we're thrilled to announce today that we are raising our full fiscal 2013 revenue guidance again. And after becoming the first enterprise software company to achieve the $1 billion run rate, the $2 billion run rate, now we're guiding to $3 billion for the year, fiscal year '13. That's an amazing new milestone for our industry.","The high end of our guidance keeps us on track to finish the year with a full year revenue growth rate of 32%, and I'm sure everyone recognizes there aren't too many enterprise software companies delivering that to the market for this year.","salesforce.com is the fastest-growing software company of its size. salesforce has always been a catalyst and evangelist for change in enterprise software, it's been a promoter of cloud, it's been a promoter of social, it's been a promoter of mobile, and those 3 axes really have defined who we are today.","Now in the first decade of our business, we pioneered the shift to cloud. Today, we're redefining what it means to be the social enterprise. Social enterprises are looking for a deeper connection with customers and employees. They're looking to delight their customers in a whole new way. They're building social profiles that deliver a more complete picture of customers', employees' social networks to rapidly collaborate, motivate, align their workforces and building customer social networks to better market, sell and service their customers. And they're building product social networks to help integrate their products and bring those back into the social enterprise as well.","Our social enterprise vision has opened a door for thousands of companies and empower them to revolutionize how they engage with their customers and their employees. And since sharing our vision for the social interface -- enterprise at Dreamforce last year, we've gone around the world now to more than 200,000 people, face to face, joining our events, to learn how they can use these social, mobile and cloud computing technologies to drive their businesses to a whole new level.","Now with the Sales Cloud, with our Service Cloud, with our marketing cloud, the heart of our CRM strategy built on our social enterprise platform, the core of our business at salesforce, our customers have the tools to create a true social front office. And salesforce is recognized as the leader in each of these 4 critical categories.  And let's just review that briefly.","According to Gartner, salesforce.com has surpassed Oracle last year and now has the #2 market share position in the overall CRM market, which includes the -- both the cloud and on-premise CRM. Now, of course, we're already #1 far and away in cloud CRM, and now we are #2 overall, which includes cloud and on-prem. Two, the Service Cloud and the Sales Cloud are now both the absolute market leaders in customer service and sales force automation in Gartner's Magic Quadrant. So if you look at Gartner's Magic Quadrant for Sales Cloud, we are #1 in SFA, on-premise or cloud. salesforce.com is #1 in sales force automation. And if you look at the just-published Customer Service Magic Quadrant, salesforce.com Service Cloud is the #1, whether it's on-premise or in the cloud, #1 in customer service.","Now the marketing cloud, based on our Radian6 technology, providing the foundation for our marketing cloud and also including our Data.com capabilities, is rated by Forrester as a leader and visionary in enterprise marketing platforms. And Forrester also named our social enterprise platform, which includes Force.com and Heroku, as the leading social enterprise platform for coders and business developers.","The combination of our social enterprise vision and our clear leadership in each of these core markets is what's driving our success with customers today. A great example is the largest transaction in our history, which we closed at the start of this quarter with an insurance company. They are building a customer social network to connect hundreds of thousands of employees with millions of customers, prospects and even Facebook fans. Their vision is to empower their entire customer-facing team, including their sales forces, their customer service organizations, their marketing organizations, their claims agents with a single view of customers across any of their chains. Customers can start a conversation in the call center, finish an application on the website, ask a question on Facebook, get a response on Twitter. They're pulling customers together and putting them in the driver's seat and at the heart of their social enterprise.","The world's largest food distributor, Sysco, spelled S-Y-S-C-O, not C-I-S-C-O, is swapping out SAP and deploying the Sales Cloud and Chatter. And Sysco's Social Enterprise will be able to create an interactive community with hundreds of thousands of restaurants, educational facilities, hotel venues that they serve.","In addition to that insurance company and Sysco, another great win in the quarter is -- direct from Japan, the Nippon Life Insurance Company, Japan's largest life insurance provider. They leverage Force.com to deploy insurance, policy, management, application to thousands of users in less than 30 days, and that's the speed of cloud, mobile and social, at which our customers want to transform their businesses today versus the traditional months or years it takes with the traditional legacy enterprise software companies.","The Post Office in the U.K. is taking its 400 Crown branches digital by creating a social enterprise for its entire team of financial service advisors. And citizens in the U.K. will soon be able to book appointments and engage with advisors online. And another great win in the quarter, the makers of Chivas and Absolut, Pernod Ricard, is one of the world's leading beverage brands and selected Chatter and Force.com to create a social enterprise for employees, customers and distributors. We use their products extensively here at salesforce and during this analyst call. Pernod plans to create a wall-to-wall employee social network to boost innovation, extend its strong culture of entrepreneurship, and by linking Force.com with on-premise back-office systems and applications, Pernod will be able to power its entire workforce with next-generation social, mobile and cloud apps.","Vodafone is swapping out Oracle and put salesforce.com at the heart of its social enterprise transformation in Germany. Their vision is to build a customer and employee social network that will integrate their back office, Amdocs and their Oracle financial systems and power a new level of customer insight for their management and sales teams. And Meritage Homes, builds homes across the U.S., is rolling out an amazing configuration app on Force.com that's going to allow its agents to modify home options on the fly, and with Force.com, our Sales Cloud and Chatter, Meritage is bringing together its front and back office systems, linking people with the documents they need to close deals faster. Another great innovation by our customers.","And one last customer I wanted to mention on the call today, Morningstar is a great win against Microsoft. They're bringing together sales and service teams across hundreds of product lines, including the Sales Cloud and Chatter. Morningstar's social enterprise will allow sales teams to collaborate on deals from the road, deliver a consistent brand experience to customers wherever they are.","Other new or add-on transactions in the first quarter include: Abbott and Allergan, Allstate and Amazon, Barclays and CHANEL [ph], Citrix, 4G Xerox, Honda and Nestl\u00e9, Office Depot, Rockaton, which is Amazon's -- the Amazon.com of Japan, and Tokyo Marina and thousands of others.","The pace at which these companies are embracing the social enterprise is amazing, and it's driving outstanding levels of usage. We now have nearly 2 million apps built on our Force.com and Heroku platforms. Our ability to deeply integrate our social front office solutions with back office systems like SAP and Oracle, the core back office systems of our customers combined with our social front office systems is helping many of our customers like Activision, Burberry and Kimberly-Clark to transform with the speed of social.","And I'm delighted to announce that we delivered 54 billion transactions for the quarter, an increase of 72% from a year ago. 54 billion transactions, that's more than 800 million transactions every business day, and to put that into context, that's more than double the number of posts on Twitter every day that the salesforce.com delivers as core transactions in its service.","In closing, I want to remind everyone about the next stop on our Cloudforce road show, Cloudforce London, our largest European event, with 14,000 people registered to attend, will be happening in London next week, May 22 at the ExCeL Center. It is going to be a phenomenal, phenomenal event.","I also want to remind everyone to save the date for Dreamforce. It's coming up. It's September 18 through the 21st right here in San Francisco. And it's going to be featuring some spectacular speakers, including Jeff Immelt, our great customer at General Electric. The CEO of GE will be speaking on GE becoming a social enterprise. You'll also be hearing from General Colin Powell as well as an entire day of motivation, energy and excitement featuring world-class motivational guru tony Robbins and great musical performance by the Red Hot Chili Peppers. It's going to be an awesome Dreamforce. And now is the time to sign up by going to www.dreamforce.com.","And with that, I'm going to turn the call over to Graham Smith, our Chief Financial Officer, to discuss the financial details of our first quarter. Graham?","Graham V. Smith","Thank you, Marc. We are off to an excellent start in fiscal 2013. First quarter results were better than we had expected, with strong execution and continued reduction in our attrition rate. With a goal this year of delivering robust top line revenue growth and improving profitability, we were also pleased to post EPS above our prior guidance.","We delivered strong operating cash flow, as Marc mentioned, with first quarter cash flow exceeding $210 million, that's our best Q1 on record. And our pipeline of new business continues to grow, as does deferred revenue and booked business on and off the balance sheet. Given our strong start, we're very pleased to be raising our full year revenue guidance by $50 million, with the high end of our predicted range now at $3 billion.","I'll talk more about guidance in a minute, but let me start by highlighting some of the key financial metrics from the quarter. Q1 revenue of $695 million was up 38% over last year. Q1 revenue was actually up 39% year-over-year, excluding the effect of $6 million of FX headwind, and this was our strongest constant currency revenue growth in more than 3 years.","Revenue in the first quarter benefited from a continued decline in dollar attrition, which fell for the 11th straight quarter and is now in the low teens on a percentage basis. Dollar attrition is now at its lowest level since we started reporting the number back in the first quarter of fiscal 2010.","On a geographic basis, we posted strong year-over-year revenue growth in each of our major regions. Revenue in the Americas grew 43% to $485 million. Revenue in Europe was $118 million, that's up 25% in dollars and 33% in constant currency, and revenue in Asia was $92 million, an increase of 32% in dollars and 30% in constant currency. Our business mix continues to become more diverse, with more than 40% of new business in the quarter coming from non-Sales Cloud contracts.","Turning to the income statement. Operating profit grew faster than revenue in Q1, with operating profit up 45% over last year. This enabled us to grow operating margins by nearly 60 basis points year-over-year, driven principally by improvements in G&A, even as we executed on key growth initiatives.","First, we continued to hire aggressively in Q1, adding more than 500 new employees with, of course, the emphasis on sales and engineering roles. Our total employee population is now more than 8,300.  That's up 51% from the first quarter last year. Second, we continued our investment in corporate and product marketing in Q1, including staging some of the largest Cloudforce events ever in cities like Chicago, Washington D.C. and San Francisco.","Higher operating margins along with a lower-than-anticipated tax rate enabled us to translate overachievement on the top line to the bottom line, with non-GAAP EPS coming in at $0.37, and that was $0.03 above the high end of guidance. The lower tax rate contributed about $0.02 of that EPS overachievement, while the other $0.01 was due to better operating leverage. Our tax rate in the first quarter was lower than expected as a result of our finalizing the tax accounting related to our acquisition of Radian6.","Operating cash flow in Q1 was $213 million, that's up 53% over last year, a great result. Cash flow in the first quarter benefited in part from the 2 invoicing effects that contributed to our strong cash flow in the fourth quarter, including longer invoice [ph] durations. This quarter, we also collected the last tranche of the large multiyear invoice we discussed in the fourth quarter. However, this amount was more or less offset by the one-time tax payment of $40 million related to our acquisition of Radian6, which we have highlighted on earlier calls.","Free cash flow, which we define as operating cash flow less CapEx, was $168 million in Q1. That's up 50% over the first quarter last year. Free cash flow yield or cash flow as a percentage of revenue was 24% in the first quarter, again up from 22% in Q1 last year.","CapEx was approximately $45 million in the first quarter, up 64% over Q1 last year. New office buildouts and equipment related to headcount growth continue to be the largest driver of CapEx spending.","Deferred revenue in Q1 was approximately $1.3 billion, up 46% over the first quarter last year. Excluding an FX headwind of approximately $18 million, deferred revenue on a constant currency basis increased 48% over Q1 last year. On a sequential basis, currency had no material impact on deferred revenue.","In Q4, we discussed how increased discipline around annual invoicing contributed to the improvement in current deferred revenue and how a multiyear invoice contributed to the increase in the long-term deferred revenue. In Q1, deferred revenue benefited from the same 2 invoicing effects. Excluding these effects, first quarter deferred revenue grew approximately 30% year-over-year or 32% in constant currency. This was consistent with fourth quarter deferred constant currency revenue growth of 31%, excluding those same 2 effects.","As a point of reference, about 2\/3 of total invoicing dollars in Q1 were from annual invoices, a significant improvement over last year. Off-balance sheet backlog, which is unbilled business that is booked but not yet invoiced, was $2.7 billion in the first quarter.  That's an increase of more than 20% in Q4 and approximately 60% up over Q4 -- sorry, Q1 last year.","Our average contract length remains between 12 and 24 months. Taken together, deferred revenue plus backlog now exceeds $4 billion.","As we've said in the past, our deferred revenue balance has a lot of moving parts, and our focus on annual invoicing has added another variable. While deferred revenue overall is clearly benefiting from longer invoice durations, it's very difficult to predict net sequential changes in deferred revenue. In addition, it's important to understand that the deferred revenue benefits from longer average invoice durations in prior quarters actually served to create a sequential headwind to deferred revenue in subsequent quarters as the deferred revenue amortizes from the balance sheet to the P&L.","As a result, we expect a lower dollar benefit from invoice changes in Q2 than in Q1, just as we saw a decline in the dollar benefit from invoice changes from Q4 to Q1, and we expect this effect will continue through the end of the year. In that context, our best estimate is for second quarter deferred revenue to be approximately flat sequentially. And on an adjusted basis, excluding the effects of the invoicing changes, to be up slightly, consistent with our historical trend.","Let me close with guidance. For the full year, we are raising our revenue outlook by $50 million to $2.97 billion to $3 billion, which represents growth of 31% to 32% over fiscal 2012. We now estimate full year non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.60 to $1.63. This is $0.01 higher than our prior guidance. While we received a $0.02 tax benefit in Q1, we now expect a higher share count to reduce full year non-GAAP EPS by roughly that same amount of $0.02.","Our non-GAAP EPS estimates reflect a slightly lower tax rate of 37% for the full year. This takes into account the lower tax rate in Q1 we discussed, along with an anticipated quarterly tax rate of about 38% for Q2 through the remainder of the year. For Q2, we anticipate revenue in the range of $724 million to $728 million for year-over-year growth of approximately 33%. We expect Q2 non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.38 to $0.39.","We expect operating cash flow in Q2 to grow slightly faster year-over-year than our revenue growth rate as we continue to migrate customers to annual billing. All of the underlying assumptions for our non-GAAP guidance as well as our GAAP guidance and a complete GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation can be found in our earnings press release issued today.","Just to conclude, we had a great Q1 with top line revenue and bottom line EPS that exceeded guidance. We continue to deliver outstanding cash flow from operations, and our backlog of business on and off the balance sheet is now more than $4 billion. We look forward to updating you on our progress in Q2. Meanwhile, we hope to see many of you in Cloudforce London next week.","With that, we'll open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Tom Ernst with Deutsche Bank.","Thomas Ernst - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Marc, I'd like to ask you a question that's kind of in the thread of common questions, I guess, from investors about the balance between the hype in cloud and social versus is it real. So the question I've got for you is if we look at kind of the downfall of some of the last-generation technology like Siebel, it was almost that they were too successful in selling and never got the usage and adoption. As your business is kind of continuously evolving here from a viral adoption to more strategic purchase, how are you changing the organization to make sure that you're connecting with the customer, driving success? And are you actually measuring that success staying high and sustainable?","Marc Benioff","Well, I think the most exciting thing that's happening this week certainly is the Facebook IPO tomorrow, and there's a couple of exciting things about Facebook. Number one is that we've just never seen an application -- a complex application of this size, this scale with a 1 billion registered users, 1\/2 of them will log in every day. And you just have to take a step back and just say, \"Wow!\" in terms of adoption. And the new user interface models that have been created there like the feed, the status update, profiles, groups, I mean, we've been talking about this now for some time in our various forums. And I'm number one just in all of that. Number two, you just see the level of interactivity between users is really just awe-inspiring, and we've really adopted as fast as we can those user interface models into our own business and then brought them, of course, to the mobile platforms, brought them into the social platforms with Salesforce Chatter and into our core business, which is our Sales Cloud or Service Cloud, our marketing cloud and our social enterprise platform built on Chatter. And you've seen -- if you go to trust.salesforce.com, our transaction volumes have just been really awesome. I mean, you -- we're just anticipating this first billion-transaction day at salesforce.com. You can see days this week that where we've hit 800 million transactions. I mean, that's just awesome. And the question will be, \"When we are going to have 1 billion transactions a day?\" And I think you probably can see that those are happening faster than ever before at between 210 and 240 milliseconds per transaction. That's usage, that's growth, that's adoption. And that's what we're focused on, and the only reason we're successful at salesforce is because our customers are successful. And that's what we focus on every day. Is the customer successful? That's our #1 value in our company, the trust that we have with our customer in making them success. And after that, it's really all about creating that Customer for Life experience, where they're bringing their data, their business process into our services. And then, of course, it's the day-in and day-out execution of our business that you've seen now as we've delivered. Next month will be, I think, our 8 years as a public company since we went public in I think it was June 2004, right? So I mean, it's been consistent levels of execution, and those are really the things that we focused on. And I think it's -- we'll continue to focus on those things, and that will create the success. And the companies maybe who have come before us and have not been as successful as we have been, I think it's mainly they just weren't focused on the customer success at the end of the day. And I know that seems quite basic, but there's different ways to running a company and different motives, and that's ours.","Operator","Our next question is from Adam Holt with Morgan Stanley.","Adam H. Holt - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","My question is about the off-balance sheet number. That's an eye-popping number, and obviously, there's a big client that's contributing to that. But can you maybe walk through some of the elements behind that quarter-on-quarter increase and the off-balance sheet number? And how should we be thinking about the seasonality of that number through the duration of the year?","Graham V. Smith","Adam, this is Graham. Yes, of course, the large customer we signed, the largest in our history, the 9-figure deal, was certainly -- helped that backlog number significantly. But we also had some big renewals in the quarter. And when, clearly, we have large customers with large annual order values renewing for multiple years, that's very encouraging to us and really helps add to that backlog number. So we did a great job on renewals this quarter. As you heard, we finally got to a low-teens attrition rate which is great. And I do point out, we still see our average contract length between 12 and 24 months. So it's not like this number is getting moved -- getting skewed or anything like that, so we're still in that 12- to 24-month average contract length. But we're just renewing, we're renewing well, we're renewing often and we're renewing for longer contract periods, and that's just really helping boost that overall backlog number.","Operator","Our next question is from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs.","Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","This question is for Marc. Marc, I was wondering if you could talk to us a little bit -- I mean, you got the Magic Quadrant for Gartner this quarter for Service Cloud. I'm wondering if you could share with us where you think that market is in terms of kind of tipping into the SaaS' favor? When are we going to start those big rip and replaces from the legacy on-premise deals that were signed, God, over a decade ago? And if you could also just frame for us how big of an opportunity, if you were to characterize that opportunity versus Sales Cloud, if you could give us an idea of how you think that -- how attractive that market is for you.","Marc Benioff","Well, it's -- I think we've been talking about this now for a few years in terms of how excited we are about Service Cloud and how much we've invested, and it's turned into a massive business for us and far exceeded all of our expectations. I think that the exciting part about Service Cloud has been the growth and the huge transactions that we've signed. We also have created our Service Cloud for small business that we've delivered with Desk.com, and I'm sure you've seen that as well, so we're really not only focused on the very high end of the market, but on the low end as well. And I think when you look at Service Cloud, when you look at Sales Cloud, Sales Cloud, of course, is just a much, much bigger business today, but Service Cloud is growing at a faster rate. So you're just going to see this just incredible tear, that business and we're investing more in Service Cloud than ever. And then we've got our marketing cloud right behind it that we're very excited, and as I said, it's really that Sales Cloud, the Service Cloud and the marketing cloud built on our social enterprise platform that is just awesome, and we're very happy with our strategy. We really do focus, like you mentioned, Sales Cloud the absolute leader in the Magic Quadrant, Service Cloud is the absolute leader, marketing cloud platform, all of these things, are they competitive? Are they winning deals? Are they at the top of their game? And then in our area in cloud, and in many cases, and not just in cloud but it's, as I said, it's #1 in cloud or on-prem. So I'm very excited about service, and I think that it will continue to perform this year in an extraordinary rate.","Operator","Our next question is from Brent Thill with UBS.","Brent Thill - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Marc, there was some concern going into the quarter about some of the sales changes that went on in Q1. I was wondering if you could maybe articulate the changes that were made. And obviously, it didn't seem to have any impact on the current quarter.  And I had a quick follow-up for Graham.","Marc Benioff","Well, we're a fast-growing company. We're the fastest-growing, and that means that our organizational models that were competitive at $1 billion dollars are not the right organizational models at $3 billion. And so we make slight adjustments every year, and those slight adjustments generally take place in the first quarter, this year was no exception. But at the end of the day, it's -- it just sets us up to continue our growth and execution of our business. And we don't go into the nitty-gritty, because it would be kind of pathetic, I think, at some level to kind of like try to tell you how our sales force is organized. But at the end of the day, we're very excited. I mean, we have a tremendous focus on the enterprise, led by Blair Crump, who was a former executive at Verizon, running their enterprise business, and we've got an incredible business, small and medium business being run by Hilarie Koplow. She is doing a fantastic job, and it's this kind of these 2 businesses together that works so unbelievably well, and it's under the auspices of our Vice Chairman, Frank van Veenendaal, who kind of ensures that our core distribution strategy is propelling salesforce.com in the future. And that's kind of how we look at it. And it's very, very -- it's been -- it's a great organization. I couldn't be prouder of them in their success.","Operator","Our next question is from Kash Rangan with Merrill Lynch.","Kash G. Rangan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Marc, I'm just wondering if you could comment on how trends for new business signings worked out during the month of April. There's been quite a bit of debate. One famous technology company, Nuvali, talked with how their business, not that it's a proxy for your business, but their business progressively weakened as the quarter came to a close. I'm wondering if you can share with us how your pace of new business held up in the month of April. That's it for me.","Marc Benioff","Well, February, March and April were all very strong months and we have -- that only offset in that -- in March that we had previously discussed with you, we closed our largest business deal -- the largest business deal of all time, which was this massive transaction, but then through the quarter, we saw some great transactions emerge in Europe. We saw some great transactions emerge in Japan, and our U.S. business is also outstanding. So I felt very good about business during the whole quarter, and I think we're, as you can see from these numbers, well set up to deliver an outstanding year, which is why we're raising our guidance now to $3 billion for the year.","Operator","Our next question is from Nathan Schneiderman with Roth Capital.","Nathan Schneiderman - Roth Capital Partners, LLC, Research Division","Marc, in past quarters, you've given us metrics on the number of 7-figure deals and the number of 8-figure deals. I'm sure we'd all love to hear that, if you'd be willing to share it this quarter.","Marc Benioff","I've -- we've talked about that, and we do that on a periodic basis but not on a regular basis, because we just don't want to set the expectation up that on this call, we're going to discuss the specifics of our bookings during the quarter and\/or the specifics of the deals. But it's certainly our intention that on a semi-regular basis to tell you exactly how many 7- and 8-digit deals we do. And if you go look back over the last 3 or 4 years, I think we probably do that over 3 or 4 quarters, we show that to you, but we don't plan to do that on a regular and consistent basis. I don't think that that's an appropriate estimation of our business anyway, and I'll tell you why. We're not a company that's based on big deals. Yes, we close big deals. Big deals are exciting. We do a 9-figure deal, an 8-figure deal, a 7-figure deal. But the reality is, is that we do a lot of deals during the quarter, and we do a lot of business in the quarter, and this company has never been able to make this quarter on a big deal, and it makes its business happen on a solid book of business. It's highly distributed between, as I mentioned, small and medium business, product line and an enterprise product line and both of those product lines delivering consistently and effectively across the 7 or 8 countries that we do business in across the world. And that's how we really make our business. I think that if we emphasize the 7- or 8-digit deals to you, it's -- and while, as I said, we will do it on a regular basis, we -- it does not characterize kind of the true nature of our business, which is many, many transactions happening over the quarter, delivering a strengthened portfolio of customers in all markets.","Operator","Our next question is from Pat Walravens with JMP Securities.","Patrick D. Walravens - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division","Marc, do you think the window is closing on the on-premise license model faster than the Oracles and the SAPs of the world expected? And is it happening faster than you expected?","Marc Benioff","Well, I think that you can look at their license revenue growth over the past couple of quarters, both Oracle and SAP. And I don't think it's anything to write home about. And I think that if you compare that to our growth rate or the growth rate of companies like us in our category cloud companies or even private companies who are in the cloud, companies that have our model, the multi-tenant shared model, I mean, you just -- you can see where the future is. And if you're going to see a software company today, you're not going to start it as an on-premise company. It's just -- it would be unheard of. I mean, I think that really speaks to it. I don't know any venture capitalist that's starting a software company today. So it's not the future. And I think that what is the future is cloud, it's social, it's mobile, and I'm a huge, huge fan of our peers in the public markets and in the private markets as well who have pioneered these models, and I think they represent what the future of our industry looks like, and as you can see with our numbers this quarter, you can do it as a scale that this is what Oracle used to look like.","Operator","Our next question is from Mark Murphy with Piper Jaffray.","Mark R. Murphy - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Marc, when you consider the deal pipeline for the second half of the fiscal year, are you sensing a turning point in your ability to engage specifically at the CIO level in larger and more expansive deployments that are absorbing more of your products up front as a result of this social enterprise positioning?","Marc Benioff","Well, I think that we have a strong portfolio and a strong pipeline ahead. We are very excited about the pipeline and the opportunity for the fiscal year. And when I look out at those, it's a pretty big mix of customers who have not used us before, but we have a lot of customers that we have relationships with that are expanding and growing and adding -- what we call adding on, and I think it's a good balance of that. Graham, do you want to kind of comment on that?","Graham V. Smith","Yes, I think that's right. You've already talked about the portfolio of different businesses, and certainly, we have some customers where we start with a complete set of solutions and all the different products, but others, for example, some of the transactions in Q4 we saw were just around one product, and then we'll look to expand from there. So I don't think you can really typify it, but certainly, overall, our pipeline growth has been good.","Operator","Our next question is from Jason Maynard with Wells Fargo.","Jason Maynard - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Marc, I have a question for you on the competitive positioning. SAP this week at Sapphire was talking about no big upgrade to their core apps for, I guess, 7 or 8 years. And post SuccessFactors, they're going all-in on, I guess, non-integrative, best-of-breed apps in the cloud. And I'm curious to see if you think this will impact customer buying decisions and, frankly, your sales strategy into their installed base.","Marc Benioff","Well, we're in some of their largest, most important customers in the world, and we're in dialogue with those customers on a regular basis. Some of those customers have become some of our largest and most important customers. And I think SAP does a great job in the back office. They do a great general ledger, and it's on-premise and it works, point-of-sale system, whatever it is for our customers. But in terms of that broad-based social front office, that vision that we've articulated that you've seen now, Jason, at so many Cloudforces and Dreamforce, and you see the fever with the customers and prospects that they want to become social enterprises. And if you watch the Sapphire videos, which I did, I just -- could've happened last year, could've happened 2 years ago, it could've happened 3 years ago.  I didn't understand what was new and exciting. And if the new and most newest and exciting thing at SAP is the acquisition of SuccessFactors, well, then God help SAP, because that just isn't that exciting. I mean, that was a sub-$1 billion company that makes a human performance management software that you log into once a year. So where's the action and the vision? I think that they're a great company with a great product line that customers use in their back office, but I think that they have not shown us the future of company and of the industry, and I think it's kind of well represented by what we saw last week. And for us, we're trying to do our best to demonstrate the future of our industry, and that's why major customers like well, I guess, Kimberly-Clark is a great example, who was at Cloudforce in San Francisco, have shown how you can have a great salesforce.com social front office combined with that back office. And if you go to YouTube and you type Kimberly-Clark social enterprise, you'll see the video of their global CIO, Ramon Baez. He's probably the most respected CIO in the SAP ecosystem, used to be the CIO at Honeywell, talking about how this is the perfect fit. It's the best of both worlds. He has had his SAP back office now for a couple of decades, the SAP mainframe that's in the closet, and then they've got all their next-generation applications and systems being in salesforce. That sounds great to me.","Operator","Our next question is from Tom Roderick with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Tom Roderick - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","So Graham, I wanted to try on this deferred revenue issue, just make sure I get a little bit more clarity here and also thinking about sort of the pace of deferred as we go through the year. But can you just clarify what the total impact from sort of the invoicing changes and the longer-term changes were to Q4? And then into Q1, just trying to get an apples-to-apples compare on that and then how we think about Q2. And then I -- so understand where you're kind of guiding to.  I was thinking about deferred revenue in Q2.  As we think about the rest of the year, Q3 was sort of down sequentially. Is that kind of the right pattern to think about as the model out the rest of the year and then a big ramp into Q4?","Graham V. Smith","Yes, I mean, so this is -- as I say, there's a lot of moving parts in this number. If you remember, when we talked about Q4, we had overall coming out of Q4 net benefit on DR just around $150 million to total deferred, and that was split roughly between 2 items: one was the change in annual invoicing discipline, and the second was the multiyear invoice that you can see also showing up in long-term deferred. So if you sort of roll that forward to Q1, the net benefit actually is slightly less, because, as I mentioned earlier, what we do when we accelerate the invoicing to annual is you actually create a headwind for DR the next quarter. So roughly $150 million benefit at the end of Q4, roughly $140 million net benefit at the end of Q1. So that's why when we talk about the guide for Q2, we say -- but the actual total that we'll report will be roughly flat, but if you -- we expect when you back out the net sort of cumulative benefit on DR of these changes, it will actually be slightly up.  And that's kind of the trend we've seen over the last couple of years with DR moving from Q1 to Q2.","Operator","Our next question is from Rick Sherlund with Nomura Securities.","Richard G. Sherlund - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Graham, I'm kind of struggling as well with the adjustments for the effect of the changing terms. If I adjust last quarter and this quarter, do I end up with actually faster or, let's call it organic growth sort of after the adjustments? Though, I think I'm coming up with about 36% growth in billings as adjusted versus the 34% reported number. But I'm still playing with the math. Any -- am I doing it the right way?","Graham V. Smith","Yes, I think you're thinking -- I mean obviously, Rick, we don't talk about billings, because for all the reasons we've said in the past, we don't think it's a particularly accurate representation of what's happened in the quarter. But if you want to do that calculation, basically yes, it adds a little to the 34%, I think, that you would calculate normally on the balance sheet accounts. It adds a 1 or 2 points to that number for that calculation.","Richard G. Sherlund - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","That's terrific. I was braced for a lower number, but when I realized I got to adjust last quarter as well, I realized, well, actually, year over quarter, looking at from last quarter, it actually -- actually, I think it helps you little bit. All right, so that's a relief. Marc, I was -- I think I might have missed a little bit on your response to the earlier question about Cisco's comments. There was also a lot of speculation about your enterprise business being slower, and then Chambers made his comments, and you guys obviously had a terrific quarter. Have you noticed any change in your enterprise? Was the mix different in the quarter? Was enterprise slower? Any indication -- read across to what's happening in the broader economies?","Marc Benioff","For us, I think that we at a fundamental level believe that we're still very much a distribution-constrained organization and we're just trying to hire as many salespeople as we can around the world and get them properly organized and in their seats and trained and able to deliver on the opportunity. And it's not that the overall economy can't affect us. We saw when the whole world imploded, it did slightly impact us but probably not as much as everybody else, because when you have this level of growth and differentiation from the competitors, our greatest challenge is just the ability to close the business.  And that's honestly what we're focused on when we look at these pipelines.  Obviously, by the nature of our business, when we look at the second quarter pipeline, it's unlike anything we've ever seen in size and scale. And then the challenge is how we're going to close it and wrap it up, because there's only so many of us. And that's how kind of how we look at the business, and we don't really take into consideration these kind of things that we're hearing about. And I've got the highest, highest respect for John Chambers and Cisco, but I -- their business in pushing out switches is not directly related to our ability to close Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, marketing cloud and platform transactions and help our customers define their social enterprises. Our customers are trying to grow their top lines, and that's what we are. We're a top line company. We're a company that helps our customers close more business, and that's all we're focused on every day is our customer's success in closing those deals. And that pipeline is rich and deep, and we want to just mine it, and that's all about getting those salespeople in their chairs and out there and closing. And we've done a good job of that, that's why you can see the $3 billion guide for this year. That's why you see your -- these implied billings numbers that you're talking about are doing just fine. And at salesforce, it's never good enough. And we work -- we think we have to work harder and that we can even do better. And that's our goal, is to do better and to deliver -- and I've talked about this a few times, but it's been on my mind more this quarter than ever, is that $10 billion a year, and how do we deliver that $10 billion year, and how do we get that Sales Cloud to the level where it needs to be for the $10 billion year and the Service Cloud and the marketing cloud and the platform. And those are our 4 core businesses, and they need to all come in for that $10 billion year to manifest, and that's what Graham and I spend the time on, and we've got revenue goals for each of those buckets, and we're working hard to deliver them. And that's where we are.","Operator","Our next question is from Richard Davis with Canaccord.","Richard H. Davis - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","Marc, how do you think about making your franchise in the developer world, specifically Force, as good as you have kind of at the application layer? And I realize the 2 are interlinked, but do you think of those separately? Or do you get people really playing on the test dev side of that equation?","Marc Benioff","Yes. Well, I think it's a multidimensional problem, and for us, we've got developers who are inside our existing customers, and those are core developers, and they love things like Force.com. You've got ISVs, who are building applications on Force.com, like companies that you've maybe read about in the Wall Street Journal, Canaan D [ph], which is building manufacturing on Force.com; or FinancialForce that's building the ERP solution; or BMC Software building revenue force and others. And then you've got, in addition to those ISVs, you've got kind of independent developers who are building on Force, but they're also building on our Heroku platform, and Facebook developers, of course, can access that Heroku platform right from inside Facebook, which is awesome and has created a lot of growth in the application number. And then you have developers who are building applications for websites and for interactive capabilities also on Heroku. So it's not one developer, it's many different developers, and our developer numbers are at record levels. And we're speaking, I think, with a competitive product for developers in a way that we've never been able to do before. We've just really been able to really beef it up since our acquisition of Heroku. It's really -- that really changed the tone in our ability and you saw that in our Cloudstock program at the Cloudforce, where we had a whole developer Pavilion. So we are very focused on the developer, but we are focused on the developer as part of our overall strategy, and it's one of 4 critical legs of our stool to make that happen, which is the social enterprise platform this quarter but so is sales, service and marketing as well.","Operator","Our next question is from Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse.","Philip Winslow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","One of the things we -- you were talking about earlier, obviously, was the marketing cloud. Marc, just wondering as you kind of envision the future how you sort of see the marketing cloud evolving, both from a B2B and a B2C perspective.","Marc Benioff","Well, I've spent a lot of my time thinking about that question this quarter, because I'm sure, like you have, I have been reading a lot of stories about Chief Marketing Officers who are spending more on technology than ever before.  That is a common story today. And I think an increasingly common story is that the CMO is going to spend more on technology in a company than the CIO. And that has not happened yet in most companies, but I believe that it will. And that is a whole new opportunity emerging, and we need to double and triple down internally at salesforce on creating that marketing cloud. We were very fortunate about a year ago to buy the #1 marketing company with Radian6, doing social listening. And we're really looking at what are all the things that we need to develop to deliver that marketing cloud. And I am really excited about the marketing cloud. I really think it is a multibillion-dollar opportunity just as we've seen the Sales Cloud is and the Service Cloud is and the platform is. So I'm trying to get my thinking around that, and by the time we get to Dreamforce, I think now we'll have a lot to talk about in regards to the marketing cloud. And you can already see a couple of strong tenets of that, and I just mentioned a few of those to you. We've got, of course, Radian6, which is doing amazing. We've got Heroku, which lets you build interactive applications for Facebook or for the Web. We've got Site.com that we introduced at Cloudforce San Francisco, which is -- lets you deliver your website. And we've also have Data.com, which is the critical data that marketers need to be able to figure out who their customers are and get key marketing materials and information to them. So that is the core of the marketing cloud today. Radian6, Heroku, Site.com and Data.com. And then the question is for us how do we build a full marketing suite? How do we become the marketing desktop? How do we have the marketing front office? And we're looking at that, and I think that's a very, very exciting opportunity. And I -- and then just like Heather was talking about how exciting Service Cloud is, she's absolutely right and it's stellar. And, of course, I've been talking about Sales Cloud for 13 years, and now you're going to hear me talk a lot about the marketing cloud, I think, over the next decade.","David Havlek","All right. We're down to the final stretch, so maybe 1 or 2 more questions.","Operator","Our next question is from Derrick Wood with Susquehanna International.","James Derrick Wood - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Graham, I was wondering, the $140 million number you gave.  Does that include the impact from the 9-figure deal? And if not, could you give us what came on the balance sheet from that? And then I guess for Marc, back to kind of the macro question, if you were to see some budgets come under pressure, are there proof points that you can look at past deal flow that has helped that accelerate -- helped accelerate decision-making to move off of on-premise and over to cloud given the ROI?","Graham V. Smith","So Derrick, the $150 million and the $140 million numbers for Q4 and Q1 don't include the invoicing impact of the 9-figure deal, because that's a normal deal. Those 2 numbers we've given for Q4 and Q1 are changes that we want to call out, either because it's a multiyear invoice or because it's a change in sort of invoicing, either from quarterly or semiannual to annual. So the 9-figure deal was just a normal annual deal, and so it's not included in those numbers.","Marc Benioff","Yes, I'll tell you that in today's world, and the world has changed, and we're going to see that tomorrow with the Facebook IPO, that it's a social world and it's a mobile world and it's a cloud world, and social, mobile and cloud have really been defined by Facebook. That's what Facebook is today, and that's what we're trying to be at salesforce, but we're trying to deliver it through our Sales Cloud and Service Cloud and marketing cloud and platform. If you haven't redefined your company at this point around those pieces, you're probably grasping for straws in your strategy. We saw that yesterday at Sapphire, and we've seen that with other competitors as well, where they're just trying to sell the past to the future, and the past does not equal the future. And by the time we get to Dreamforce and you see the power of our customer base, 100,000 attendees attending Dreamforce this year in September. When you see major CEOs show up and say they're using salesforce.com, like Jeff Immelt at General Electric, and you hear that the incredible stories of success of these customers, you're going to see the world has changed, and this isn't just about cloud. This has been a fundamental transformation of our customers themselves and users, and I'm sure everyone on this call is looking at their iPhone or their iPad or their Android device or some other mobile technology, and maybe they've got Twitter or Facebook in front of them. And we just didn't have that 4 or 5 years ago. And yesterday, I re-watched Steve Jobs rolling out the iPhone in 2007, and it just inspired me that the world can change so fast, that so many exciting things are happening, and now you do have these great new prophets emerging, like Mark Zuckerberg and Jack Dorsey, and our job is just to listen and follow them, because I think the enterprise is going to get pulled into the future through these consumer services. And that's what salesforce.com is going to help our customers do. All right. I'm getting some tired stares here, so we're going to take one last question. Let's bring it home strong.","Operator","Our last question is from Steve Ashley with Robert W. Baird.","Steven M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Actually, you pointed out that large deals aren't your whole business, you make a lot of it on base hits. And I just want to talk about maybe the small and midsized business, how you continue to see that represent the same kind of percentage of your business.  And then also Desk.com, Concur Force, some of the initiatives you've talked about in the past of bringing to that market. Are you having any success selling into that small and midsized markets with those products?","Marc Benioff","Well, Desk.com and Do.com are phenomenons. And with Do.com, we have now more than 100,000 customers on there who've created more than 1 million tasks, which is amazing. We've just never seen any kind of growth like that before, and that's very much a future for salesforce. It's not where our revenue is today, but we look at that almost like our skunk-works, our R&D center. And these new companies that we bought, that we're nurturing along and that we honor and respect, because hey, we respect the future at salesforce, and what we see at companies like that is what we have to become in the mainstream.  And we look at those as beacons of the future. And if you're not using Do.com, you should be. I mean, it is something that I use every day, it's phenomenal. And for small and medium business, Desk.com is awesome. And we've also talked about all the other great services of salesforce. Even great capabilities like we have, like our Database.com service, letting customers roll out their databases, our Site.com for websites and, of course, Salesforce Chatter, and you can see that at Chatter.com where you can sign up and just get going, and we've seen so many customers there, and we have these massive customer implementations now with Chatter. We didn't have time to talk about that in deep depth on the call, but I was just reviewing that with the head of our Chatter unit, and the size and scale of the Chatter deployments are as large as they've ever been. So a lot of exciting oars in the water and working to get to that $10 billion business in the era of Facebook and Twitter, that we are paying attention to these next-generation companies, and we are working hard to build those concepts into who we are as a company so we can deliver that in the mainstream of the enterprise.","David Havlek","All right. I think that wraps things up. Before we sign off here, I want to encourage everyone to attend our upcoming Cloudforce London event. As Marc indicated, that's next Tuesday, May 22 at the ExCeL Center in London. The event is going to be hosted by cofounder Parker Harris as well as our Chief Operating Officer, George Hu; and this is an event you absolutely won't want to miss. We already have more than 12,000 customers registered. You can go ahead and register, as Marc said, at Dreamforce.com, or you can go ahead and just send me an email. We'll make sure to get you in. We look forward to seeing everybody there. Thank you for joining us today, and we'll look forward to catching up with you soon.

Thanks very much, John, and thanks, everyone, for joining us on the call today. We had a monster quarter and it was just a great finish to yet another year of exceptional growth and customer success. First, before I get into this I just want to congratulate all of 15,000 salesforce employees for just an amazing year.","Our quarter \u2013 you just look at this year after delivering more than $5 billion in annual revenue, we're guiding now to a $6 billion annual revenue run rate in the next quarter. So this is the fastest software company to reach $5 billion and in 90 days, we're going to be on the phone with you talking about that we're the fastest software company to reach $6 billion. And if you can look at our deferred revenue and $9 billion in book business on and off the balance sheet, you can just straight line out. My dream is crystal clear to be the first soft \u2013 first one and fastest to $10 billion, first in the cloud, fastest to $10 billion in software and then onward. Now, I'd like to share the results from our fourth quarter and our fiscal 2015.","As you can see, revenue for the fourth quarter has rose at 26% from a year ago to $1.44 billion. For the full fiscal year, revenue grew 32% to nearly $5.4 billion. That is just an awesome result for the year. No other software company of our size or scale is growing at this double-digit rate, and you can see all the single-digit growers in enterprise software who think that they are competitors, where they're just not able to take advantage of this opportunity. Deferred revenue grew 32% year-over-year to more than $3.3 billion. And the dollar value of book business on and off the balance sheet, as I said, is now more than $9 billion. There's no better predictor of our future revenue than looking at those numbers. And as we deliver this phenomenal pace of top-line growth, we also improved non-GAAP operating margin by 175 basis points, exceeding our guidance, and you're going to hear our commitment to continue that incredible momentum.","So we're not just focused on the top-line and growing the top-line. As we've been talking about for more than a year now, we're also focused on growing the bottom-line as well. This translated into another excellent year in operating cash. We delivered more than $1 billion \u2013 $1.2 billion in operating cash flow, that's up 34% year-over-year and we're the first cloud computing company to deliver more than a $1 billion in operating cash flow.","Looking to fiscal 2016, we are delighted to be raising our guidance to $6.52 billion at the high end of our range and while we're pleased to have exceeded our non-GAAP operating margin guidance last year, we're committed to improving non-GAAP operating margin moving forward. And once again, we expect to deliver an additional 125 basis points to 150 basis points of operating margin improvement despite this foreign exchange headwind that everybody is going through and to deliver another year of strong operating cash flow.","Okay. So here we are. salesforce.com, now the sixth largest software company in the world, the number one cloud computing company in the world, very unique in the industry. We've got a complete, trusted Customer Success Platform built from the ground up or cloud. The social, mobile and data science world, and with six world-class apps that is we have six engines for growth. Of course, our Sales Cloud, our Service Cloud, our Marketing Cloud, our Community Cloud, our new Wave Analytics platform and our app development (6:50). It's one unified Customer Success Platform delivered on our trusted enterprise environment.","I couldn't be more excited about how all of our clouds are doing. I think that if you look to what I'm most excited about got to be our newest cloud, the Analytics Cloud, just 120 days old on \u2013 this is off to an incredibly fast start of any product in our history, and I've never seen anything like it. I saw the new version of it that's coming out at Dreamforce in September yesterday. That completely took me aback. I haven't seen technology like this delivered in the analytics industry. Salesforce is crossing over from the CRM industry into the analytics industry with this product. It's an app development environment. It's mobile. It's built for everyone. I use it. All of our employees can use it. You can ask any of our employees for a demonstration of it. It's really just an awesome product and I've never seen a product take off with the speed and velocity that this product is going. And of course, I have to just mention our Salesforce1 platform, the foundation of everything we do, become the number one platform development in enterprise cloud apps.","And I guess what I love about that ecosystem that surrounds this whole company with more than 2 million developers, more than 2,600 apps, installed more than 2.8 million times through our AppExchange, and you look at another 4 million apps now on Heroku platform. This company is so much more than our six apps. It's really our ecosystem that continues to fuel our growth and the company has done a fantastic job building a platform, and not an application.","Now, we've delivered 177 billion transactions for our customers in the quarter. That's up 68% from a year ago. You can see our usage rates are soaring. Customers are using our product more aggressively than ever before. That's an average of nearly 3 billion enterprise transactions every single business day. That's unprecedented in enterprise technology. No other enterprise platform comes close to that. And I have to mention our foundation. They are doing a fantastic job. We've added more than 4,000 non-profit and higher education organizations managed by them, bringing the total to more than 24,000 non-profit and NGOs that are using salesforce.","Also, we have delivered over $19 million in grants bringing our total foundation grants to $80 million and our employees have volunteered 262,000 hours this year bringing our total to 840,000 hours of volunteered and we're getting ready to break through that million hours of volunteering which is something I'm extremely proud of. Great work with all of our employees that we're not only doing well, but we're doing good.","It's just an incredible year for Salesforce. I want to congratulate the entire company. Fortune magazine just said we're the most admired software company in the world, again, that's the third year in a row, the most admired software company. Forbes magazine says we're the most innovative company in the world. Forbes has said that now four years in a row, most admired and most innovative. And I couldn't be more excited about our future.","Looking forward to seeing you all next week at the Morgan Stanley Conference. And if you have an opportunity to see us at any of our events or programs, this quarter, we are going to be all over the world event, how many events are we doing in Q1?","Unverified Participant","355.","Marc Russell Benioff - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So we're going to be doing 355 events this quarter all over the world. I will be at many of them but not all of them. And I hope that you will join us, whether you are in London or Paris or New York, whether it's Melbourne or Tokyo, Amsterdam and you can experience the power of salesforce of the cloud, social, mobile world coupled with data science and analytics. I mean, this is just a sight to behold and I just want to congratulate everyone in the company for creating the first company, first cloud company to ever get to $5 billion. But we're the fastest software company ever to $5 billion and can't wait to get on the call, 90 days to tell you about, the fastest company to $6 billion.","And now, let's turn it over to Keith.","Keith G. Block - Vice Chairman & President","Thanks, Marc. There's a lot of great things to say about this quarter, but the thing I'd like to say is how proud I really am about our performance in FY 2015 and really the outstanding work that I saw in the quarter and in the year and I want to congratulate, as Marc said, just an incredibly high-performing team, a super high-performing team, once again for their, I would call, sustained excellence. As far as how we ended the year, suffice it to say that we fired another shot across the bow to the legacy antiquated on-premise software companies and our competition and, Marc, you just said this, and I absolutely agree. It was an exceptional quarter, an exceptional year, and Q4 was a capstone to this outstanding year.","So this was a year in FY 2015 that we saw customers not only embracing but evangelizing our vision for the Customer Success Platform and more and more CEOs, CEOs, which is incredible, are realizing how Salesforce can help drive growth and customer success. And I will tell you, they are incredible, incredible advocates for us. And that's one of the big reasons why we signed more large deals in fiscal 2015 than in any year in the history of the company.","So for fiscal 2015, we closed nearly 550 seven- and eight-figure transactions. That's roughly 100 more than it was last year. And not only is the number of large transactions getting bigger, but the value of the transactions is increasing. In fact, a number of eight-figure transactions in fiscal 2015 increased by 33% from a year ago. So no other cloud computing is closing transactions like these of this size and this scale and this volume. The execution by our teams to achieve these results has been just simply phenomenal. So we've been talking about this for a while.","It's very clear to me that our customers want a more meaningful relationship with salesforce. They're not just buying a single cloud. They are betting their businesses on our vision. And we are absolutely executing at scale in every region, across every segment and in every major industry. And as our relationships are only getting stronger and more strategic, I'm going to take some examples \u2013 share some examples with you that I think you'll be excited about.","ABB, Time Warner, Merck, all amazing companies, and they're all betting their businesses on us. And I'll start with one of the leading CPG companies in the world. They've been using salesforce to great success globally. After speaking with them at Dreamforce, it was pretty clear we shared a vision towards transforming the future in Q4. I'm happy to say we strengthened our partnership, we've closed one of the largest deals that we've ever done in the consumer packaged goods industry. And for the first time, they plan to bring together their entire sales and customer support teams to one platform, our Customer Success Platform, with our Service Cloud. And what's really interesting about this is that we're helping them connect their front office and their legacy back office, supply chain systems, giving them a very seamless experience. So we are moving from an integration perspective into legacy system supply chains. I don't know if anybody would have thought of Salesforce that way in the past.","ABB. We've talked about them before. They are a $40 billion leader in power and automation technologies, another great example in Q4. Marc and I met with their CEO in Davos last month, and we talked about how his industry is transforming and where he wants to take the company. As part of that transformation, he's placing Salesforce at the center of his strategy to help drive top-line growth. So in the quarter, ABB decided to replace more than a dozen legacy CRM systems worldwide with Sales Cloud and Service Cloud. It was a great win against both SAP and Microsoft.","Time Warner Cable, again, another great brand, very strategic win in the quarter. They've been leveraging our Service Cloud and our Salesforce1 Platform to drive their mobile strategy. In Q4, they also selected the Analytics Cloud. Marc talked about that and how excited we are. And it will give Time Warner Cable an unbelievable opportunity to have powerful insights across their enterprise. As Marc said earlier, there's enormous enthusiasm for Analytics Cloud. It's every CEO's dream to put analytics in the hands of every employee, and it's important to note that our analytics product is integrated right into our platform. That means the customers can connect any data set, whether it's SAP, Oracle, Microsoft or any other legacy technology right into the metadata layer of Salesforce platform.","I will tell you in my entire career I've never seen so much enthusiasm from our customers for a solution like this or our partners. Our complete CRM and analytics platform with an open ecosystem built natively for the cloud, very exciting, people are really excited about this. Another great story is Merck in Germany, another very exciting customer expansion in the quarter for our team. They've been a Sales Cloud customer for many years. Recently, they wanted to accelerate innovation across their geographies and their businesses. So this quarter they expanded with Service Cloud, the Salesforce1 Platform and again, Analytics Cloud. And it really is enabling to build custom applications, drive collaboration across their R&D departments, and again, drive insights across the company and, by the way, right in SAP's backyard.","I'm also pleased to continue to see attraction across our industry strategy particularly in financial services and again, this is all about speaking the language of the customer. In fact, this quarter, we've significantly expanded our relationship with one of the largest U.S. financial services firms. It is a premier company that is using the Customer Success Platform to make their sales teams and their wealth managers wildly more effective with their customers.","So those are just a few of the wins in the quarter. There were many more at Amtrak and Boston Scientific, Fujitsu, Home Depot, Ingersoll-Rand, LinkedIn, LIXIL, MassMutual, Pearson, the Royal Bank of Canada, the State of Colorado and the list goes on and on. So I have to tell you I'm very, very proud of the team and the progress that they've made and the level of trust they're establishing with their customers.","We also saw great momentum in our business globally. We accelerated our investments in Europe and Asia this year, adding more distribution capacity, and expanding our partner ecosystem. We opened up a U.K. data center and we'll have two more to follow in Germany and France as well. And it's obvious that our international investments are clearly paying off. We saw remarkable deal growth internationally. And I want to say one word about our partners. As Marc mentioned earlier, we have the largest cloud ecosystem in the world, and the largest that we did this quarter, in fact, was the signing of global agreement with one of the world's top software companies. And not only will they be using our solutions to run their business, but they're also moving their products to the cloud with Salesforce which is very, very exciting, so stay-tuned for more of that.","So we're incredibly well-positioned for the future. We're well on our way to becoming the most strategic and influential technology company in the industry. And again, I want to thank everyone at Salesforce for delivering an exceptional quarter, an exceptional year, and I would like to thank our customers and our partners and our employees for their continued commitment to us.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mark.","Mark J. Hawkins - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Great. Thanks, Keith. We had a great quarter to finish off a very strong year as you just called out. (19:00) financial goals exceeding our non-GAAP operating margin, operating cash flow and EPS guidance. I could not be more pleased with the results. On today's call, I'll be focusing my commentary on two key topics related to our results detailed in our earnings release.","As you know, we continue to see significant moves in foreign exchange rates which impacted both our top-line and bottom-line results for the fourth quarter and the full year. From a top-line perspective, we delivered Q4 constant currency revenue growth of 29% year-over-year excluding the headwind of approximately $34 million. Sequentially, we saw headwind of $21 million, and for the full year revenue was up 33% excluding an FX headwind of $32 million. Not only does FX impact revenue in aggregate, it also affects revenue by cloud, with a disproportionate impact on specific clouds. For example, Sales Cloud is the most widely distributed product with the most international exposure relative to other products and therefore the FX has a more pronounced impact on those results. Conversely, revenue from Marketing Cloud is primarily derived from the Americas with little impact of foreign exchange.","On the topic of international, we had another strong quarter and year in our geographies with constant currency growth in EMEA of more than 30%, and Asia-Pac of more than 25%. Now, a dollar attrition (20:21) for the fourth quarter excluding Marketing Cloud remained between 9% and 10%. From a bottom-line perspective, we expanded full year non-GAAP operating margins by 175 basis points over last year, coming in ahead of our prior guidance. We also increased full year non-GAAP EPS by nearly 50% year-over-year. We were pleased to exceed our operating margin and EPS goals during the year even as we absorb the RelateIQ acquisition.","This is a great result as we drive more discipline and efficiency throughout the company while continuing to invest in the innovation that our customers have come to expect. This margin increase contributed to a record level of operating cash flow as we delivered nearly $1.2 billion in fiscal 2015, up 34% over last year. CapEx as a percent of revenue for the full year was approximately 5%. It was principally related to leasehold improvements and to a lesser extent new data center buildups. With CapEx at the low end of guidance, free cash flow defined as operating cash flow less CapEx was $883 million for the full year, up 53% from last year.","Now, looking at deferred revenue, we delivered another strong quarter with growth of 32% year-over-year. Excluding an FX headwind of $67 million, deferred revenue grew 35% over last year. FX also reduced revenue sequentially \u2013 deferred revenue sequentially by approximately $44 million. It's worth noting that the deferred revenue benefited from a couple of items. First is the invoice duration. In the quarter, 85% of the (22:02) were issued with annual terms. This is up four percentage points over last year and was more than we anticipated, frankly.","Second, we saw a slight benefit from Marketing Cloud contract renewals that were written down as part of the normal purchase accounting related to ExactTarget which has now (22:21) benefit.","Moving on to guidance, while we delivered strong financial results in fiscal 2015, we continue to face an increasingly difficult foreign exchange environment. Since November, the dollar continued to appreciate against most of the major currencies. As a result, we now anticipate an incremental $50 million of FX headwind for a total of $175 million to $200 million in FY 2016. Keep in mind that we have more international revenue pressure than we do expense relief. Therefore, FX also has an impact on operating margin which we expect will cost 25 basis points to 50 basis points of headwind in FY 2015. Despite these FX headwinds, our great results and momentum allows to raise our fiscal year 2016 revenue guidance. We now anticipate revenue to be $6.475 billion to $6.520 billion, and we also plan on increasing our non-GAAP operating margin by an additional 125 basis points to 150 basis points this year. As a result, we anticipate full year non-GAAP EPS of $0.67 to $0.69. Our non-GAAP EPS estimate assumes that (23:34) will continue to be a net expense, our non-GAAP tax rate will be 36.5% and no significant M&A activity. We anticipate full year operating cash flow growth of 22% to 23% and CapEx to be roughly 5% to 7% of revenue. For Q1, we anticipate revenue of $1.485 billion to $1.505 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $0.13, $0.14 and deferred revenue in the mid to high 20% range.","So, to close, despite significant FX headwinds, we delivered very strong fiscal 2015 results with revenues, deferred revenue and operating cash flow growth of more than 30%, while expanding our non-GAAP operating margins. Very few software companies have a leadership position in one product category, let alone in multiple product categories. With our world-class Customer Success Platform, we are well-positioned to continue our industry-leading growth in FY 2016. Also, we expect to continue to improve non-GAAP operating margins consistent with the framework we laid out at the Analyst Day. At this point, I'd also like to thank our salesforce team for helping deliver an amazing result. It is just inspiring to me.","And with that, I'd like to open up the call for questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question is from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.","Mark R. Murphy - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yes. Thank you very much. A question for Marc Benioff. I, of course, saw your commentary about reaching $5 billion in revenue faster than any other enterprise software company, and aspiring to be the fastest to reach $10 billion. And meanwhile there are so many signs of accelerating momentum, looking through the billings growth, the deferred revenue growth, the Service Cloud growth, the platform growth; they're all actually accelerating and those markets are very large. So I'm wondering if the current offerings can carry you to $10 billion or even $15 billion in revenue. And if you have ever sketched out a path to a level beyond that, what else do you think could logically fit into the portfolio? And perhaps is it possible you would define e-commerce as a part of the CRM stack at some point?","Marc Russell Benioff - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I really appreciate that question and I think you really don't have to go any farther than looking at our book business on and off the balance sheet at $9 billion to ask yourself the question are we going to $10 billion? I mean $10 billion will be fueled primarily by that. I can tell you more or less where revenue will be a year from now or even two years from now because you can kind of look at deferred. We don't do that because there can be changes in foreign exchange, there can be changes in other characteristics of the business, but if you look back now, Salesforce has been a public company for over 10 years. You can see how our deferred model has played out with the kind of consistent revenue growth, even through 2008 or even through dark times, the deferred continue to pay out on to the top-line.","So I don't think the question is about are we \u2013 certainly my \u2013 (27:15) my mind there's no question that that's going to happen. I think it's all about where we are going beyond that. And as we cross through that threshold, what are the different clouds and capabilities, will we have to invest in to make that happen? I'm very excited about the transformations and changes and shifts that the company is investing in data science and analytics, and the next idea that it's not just about the cloud, social or mobile anymore, it's also about fueling the analytical corporation, fueling the analytical CEO.","I thought that Ram Shriram had a fantastic article in Fortune magazine this month on the analytical business and what that means. And we want to fuel that. We want to fuel that kind of capability that gives our customers not just world-class execution in sales and service and marketing and community, we want to give them the ability to have analytics platforms, analytics apps, analytics ecosystems that fuel that future. And that's, I think, our biggest, most exciting revenue opportunity going forward. The CRM market is big and exciting and has fueled us, will continue to fuel us. The analytics market is just as big and just as exciting. I think some would say the analytics market is bigger than the CRM market. And our initial indications of that are that's true. And that's why we're investing and I couldn't be more excited about the Analytics Cloud in our Wave platform.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Rick Sherlund with Nomura. Please go ahead with your question.","Rick Sherlund - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks so much and good quarter. First, Keith, I wonder if you could talk about verticals. You had mentioned that at Dreamforce that we'll be hearing more soon about your approach to addressing vertical markets. As I recall, Siebel Systems had about 22 verticals that they addressed, and right now you guys kind of have only one or so verticals. And also, maybe for Mark Hawkins, on the sequential increase in the Sales Cloud, I heard your comments on FX. It looks like it was up only about 1% sequentially. That even if I assumed it's flat, and take that on the first year-over-year number, we're going to have, which is April, it's still about 10%. So is it fair to assume that when we start getting the numbers \u2013 year-over-year numbers that Sales Cloud's still going to be, on a constant currency basis, a double-digit growth business?","Mark J. Hawkins - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So do you want to take the verticals first, and maybe the...","Keith G. Block - Vice Chairman & President","Yes. Why don't I do that? So, Rick, thanks for asking the question. So we're very excited about our industry strategy, and it takes many flavors. I think the reason why the company continues to get such traction with these enterprise customers and really customers of any size and any geography is because when we talk to these customers, we are speaking in the language of the customer. So that's kind of point number one. We are focused really on six industries right now. And all of that is equipping our folks with the solutions and the messages that our customer's really demanding and asking for. So we're listening to our customers. And we will be making some announcements shortly about some exciting stuff that we're doing with the products around our industries but we also \u2013 and I want to go back to a point that Marc made about our AppExchange and our ecosystem.","We have the largest ecosystem in the world for the cloud. And we are driving incredible success with a number of our ISVs who have taken our platform because they obviously have confidence in that platform. And they are building their solutions around industries. We signed up some pretty strategic partnerships this fiscal year. We continue to do it. You look at the statistics on our AppExchange, several of those are also vertically oriented. So we are really driving industry messaging into the marketplace, whether it's our own industry messaging, our organic product, the highly configurable cloud solutions that we have, whether it's our AppExchange and our ISVs and our ecosystems. This really resonates with customers. And this is something that Siebel never had. They never had a \u2013 as you know, they were not a platform company. They were never in a position where they could drive an ecosystem with vertical extensions the way that we're able to do it. So we're getting a lot of traction, and we're really excited.","Mark J. Hawkins - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So let me take the second part of the question, Rick. In terms of the sales revenue by cloud, a couple of different things. First of all, foreign exchange, yes, there's an impact there. To your point, what we're assuming right now is sequential performance right now. And I'm looking forward to it into Q1. You'll be able to see the year-on-year and, of course, you'll see that with all the dynamics that are going on there including whatever foreign exchange is there. So I think I can get to the spirit of the question that you're asking. The spirit of the question is the SFA market is a double-digit market, according to Gartner, it's been that way \u2013 projected to be that way for a long period of time. We have not only done well in that market with a double-digit growing market but we've also put share for the last decade consistently. And so that's what's happened historically. We don't guide by cloud. But that's a very effective market as Marc has talked about, and we'll know \u2013 you'll be able to see a lot more when we anniversary the actual revenue by cloud. Hope that helps, Rick.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Brent Thill with UBS. Please go ahead with your question.","Brent John Thill - UBS Securities LLC","Good afternoon. Keith, a question for you on the traction with the larger enterprise deals. I'm just curious if you could give us a little more color. You have some phenomenal logos that you're reading through. But is there anything quantitatively you can share with us what you're seeing in the success of \u2013 as you've gone upstream?","Keith G. Block - Vice Chairman & President","Yeah, listen \u2013 thanks for the question. I think \u2013 first of all, I think that the numbers were astounding. We're incredibly proud. I'm certainly proud of the work that the team has done, and I think it is proof positive about the relationships that we're building strategically with these customers. You don't do these types of deals at scale and volume unless you're successfully getting mind share and building those great relationships. We've got \u2013 over the year and certainly in the quarter, we've done some wonderful work with some of the best brands and the best companies in the world. Like 3M and ABB, Time Warner I mentioned, obviously. And some of these I could not mention before by name. But there are just many, many examples of us doing an incredible job, building more and more traction and becoming more meaningful.","And now, I have to tell you part of this comes from the opportunity for us to really unshackle either legacy SAP environments or have \u2013 give customers the opportunity to transform their business models, because they've really been shackled by legacy technology for years. And with this absolute convergence of cloud and social and mobile, it really gives us an opportunity to talk about what our Customer Success Platform can do for them, generally speaking. I mean, Marc and I had the opportunity to spend some time with Brian Moynihan in Davos and we talked about how CFAs (34:30) transforming their business. And those are the types of meaningful relationships that we're really talking about here. So, again, we're very excited about what's going on. And a lot of our growth initiatives are really taking some traction here.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Terry Tillman with Raymond James. Please go ahead with your question.","Terry F. Tillman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey, guys. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I guess my question is on the Wave Analytics product. I know it's still early but in terms of the deals that you're signing or the deal opportunities, are you seeing large enterprise deals? Or are these still more try it before you really buy it kind of departmental level deals? And then typically are you replacing something that's a legacy DI (35:08) vendor or is this kind of greenfield investments for the analytics solution?","Marc Russell Benioff - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, first of all, we've never seen a product take off with these kind of numbers before. In the fourth quarter which was the first quarter that we sold the Wave Analytics Cloud. We saw a lot of very large transactions, probably the very largest transactions that happened in the analytics industry happened on our platform. And we were really taken aback by that. We've decided to focus with dedicated distribution personnel this fiscal year because of that. We've also made a very significant investment and upgrade and the number of people working on the product. And this is the real deal. I mean we really have a world-class product on our hands. And in our minds the way we think is, we only want to focus on those multi-billion dollar opportunities or as we call them clouds. And there's just no doubt in our mind that this is \u2013 has all the makings of that.","And of course, we keep track of what all the startups are doing and we're very friendly with them, and even a part of our ecosystem or attend our trade shows. They cannot even \u2013 their bookings can't even compare to what our team did in the fourth quarter. So very excited about that and when I look at some of the names that closed in the fourth quarter on the Analytics Cloud the one that I love that I've profiled at Dreamforce which is GE Capital, and if you get and watch that video that's on YouTube, I mean, what they say is true. You just can't run your business without this product. This is just one \u2013 this is the greatest product, I think, salesforce has ever built and it's going to just transform the way our customers run their business, not just run their sales, service and marketing. I mean this is a enterprise-wide, enterprise-grade capability to fuel the analytical corporation. And it's not just an app. It's a platform. It's going to have a robust ecosystem. It's got \u2013 every characteristic that we like to make our bookings and revenues happen in our largest and most important customers. And to that end, it's not just enterprise and very large enterprise deals, it's also, yes, departmental deals, it's even deals in non-profits and NGOs. I mean it's amazing the democratic nature of the pipeline and deal flow already. Do you want to talk about any of the deals that you closed in the fourth quarter on the Analytics Cloud?","Keith G. Block - Vice Chairman & President","Yeah. Again, I'm going to go back to a comment that I made earlier. In my entire career, I've never seen as much excitement, both internally and externally about a product launch. I mean, again, I'll go back to Davos. We had a nice little area in Davos. It was overrun with customers and prospects, and you know the type of people who attend Davos. And they all had incredible interest of looking at what Analytics Cloud meant and what it could do for them. And Marc did plenty of demos, I did plenty of demos, and we signed up some great companies. I mean Merck is obviously a great global brand. In the quarter, they went with the Analytics Cloud, Time Warner Cable went with the Analytics Cloud, (38:30) with the Analytics Cloud. And that's on top of many that we signed up before. So it's all good. We're very excited.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question.","Karl E. Keirstead - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks. Question for Marc or Keith on the Service Cloud. It's now 27% of your subscription revenues, your fastest growing segment. Your partners are quite positive about it. I just wanted to ask, is this really a function of salesforce on the sales execution front doing a better job selling it into your Sales Cloud customer base? Has the product improved? What's the key driver of that growth? And then a follow-up for Mark Hawkins. You gave your April quarter DR guide of mid- to high-20% range. I presume that's U.S. dollars. Just curious what you're assuming in terms of a likely FX hit in the April quarter on DR? Thank you.","Marc Russell Benioff - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think I just want to make some initial comments and then I'll let Keith chime in. And the first thing is you look at our competitors and their work in good customer service area. Number one, Oracle, they bought right now \u2013 they have their own Fusion service product. They took Fusion, they turned it into confusion. Oracle keeps saying they're growing more quickly than anyone else in the cloud. Well, that's very easy to do when you're starting at zero. And Service Cloud from Oracle, that's a great example. This is not a multibillion dollar business for Oracle like it is for us. They have not been able to execute. They don't have a multi-tenant shared, scalable, mobile, social, integrated analytics customer Service Cloud and then move on to SAP. They will just come into customers and say just use Hana. And it's like but for what and how? And unload the software into your company.","First of all, I think the number one thing about this customer service revolution that's going on and why Service Cloud is delivering phenomenal results is the traditional keepers of the customer service information for these customers, Oracle and SAP, have just not delivered. And we have. We have a very clear vision that we want to transform how our customers not only grow their top-line with our Sales Cloud, which we've done unbelievably well, and you can see it into the multiple billions of dollars. But now, we have this second huge multibillion dollar growth engine with Service Cloud. And our competitors have not been able to execute. They just don't have \u2013 they're delivering new versions when our customers want new visions. And that is where we are right now in the customer service marketplace. And why Gartner says we have the number one customer service product. But anyway, Keith, maybe you can tell us \u2013 you're out there every day selling that product with the customers. What's your perspective?","Keith G. Block - Vice Chairman & President","Yeah. I think what's interesting is that many companies want to differentiate themselves with service. And they're looking for incredible capability to do that. And obviously, we have a very compelling story, and if I just look at some of our top wins, I would say at least half of these top wins had Service Cloud. And so if I think about Amtrak or ABB, Boston Scientific, Ingersoll-Rand, Merck, Pearson; these are all Service Cloud wins. So this is a compelling product. It's a compelling solution. It's actually the source of quite a few of our competitive takeouts, particularly in kind of legacy providers whether it's SAP or Oracle. There's a lot of Siebel replacements going on right now. So this is a great product and it's a great solution and our customers love it.","Mark J. Hawkins - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Okay. Let me talk about the last part. (42:46) you asked about the deferred revenue for Q1. We guided it in the mid to high 20%s and you were asking about foreign exchange. That is in U.S. dollars that we've guided. We've given you a sense of perspective for foreign exchange. We called out the entire top-line of the company, $175 million to $200 million of headwind for the total top-line. So you can get a sense of our thinking about foreign exchange. You are correct, that's U.S. dollars that I called out for deferred revenue. I hope that helps.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Joel Fishbein with BMO Capital. Please go ahead with your question.","Joel P. Fishbein - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thank you for taking my question. I just wanted to take it up more from a bigger perspective in terms of \u2013 we looked at these six engines of growth: Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, Marketing Cloud but I want to look at it holistically from the customer's perspective. Can you talk about how salesforce \u2013 and give us some specific examples about how salesforce is becoming more strategic as an enterprise provider\/solution provider and maybe some examples about how people are buying the solutions holistically and looking at salesforce that way.","Marc Russell Benioff - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think that's really a great point. Keith and I have been talking a lot about that. Because in this quarter, what Keith and I were really struck by is in all of our very largest transactions, we were not dealing with the CIO in the company, or the head of sales or the head of service or the head of marketing. We were dealing with the Chief Executive Officer in the company.","And that was a huge shock to us. We really either keep their eye on (44:32) our careers going back now a couple of decades, we have not really seen ourselves showing up in the CEO office. And Keith mentioned one and I'll just come back to this which is, here's an example of a great company, which is $43 billion German manufacturer called ABB. And ABB is a great company. They are a very diversified provider of industrial scale energy products and other products. And when ABB did the transaction with us, the CEO was personally involved. And they wanted to issue a press release and issue a statement about the strategic nature of the transaction which we did, which was a very strong eight digit, very healthy transaction, but it was really all about the strategic capability of what ABB is doing with us.","What's interesting about the deal was, salesforce and \u2013 ABB is a huge Microsoft customer. I think they've got 40,000 or 50,000 sheets of Microsoft. I mean it's just amazing what Microsoft has done in the account. And salesforce and Microsoft went in hand-in-hand and showed Office 365 deeply integrated with salesforce's services. And we had built a variety of very exciting vertical type functionality into Office 365, using Force.com and our different clouds and automating their business processes. And ABB really has this vision of real-time customer collaboration, but it's all driven by the CEO, okay, and that is a shock to us. And when we look at big deals we did this quarter whether it was General Electric or Coke, or others, okay, the CEO is involved with us. So that's just very exciting. And I think that that is a big change in how our implementations are viewed. We have seen that in Home Depot. We have seen that, of course, at Cisco. We had seen that in \u2013 but we're really seeing it in all the biggest transactions.","Keith, do you want to talk about that?","Keith G. Block - Vice Chairman & President","Yeah. I think that it's pretty clear. And I don't think this will be a surprise to anybody that the agenda of a CEO is growth. And our message is all about growth. So there's a natural synergy there. And when we had talked to these customers, they \u2013 ABB is a classic example. Marc mentioned it. But there are countless examples whether it's financial services institutions, again, we talked about Bank of America earlier. It really is about solving a customer problem, speaking the language of industry, and it's not about one Sales Cloud, one Service Cloud. It's about a Customer Success Platform and it's a platform discussion. And again, it fits the growth agenda. So that's why CEOs seemed to be getting more and more involved in this. If I go back to the example that I gave earlier in the call about the strategic agreement that we signed in the quarter, that was a CEO agenda. That's all about growth. So I think the sun and the star and the moon are all aligning here as it relates to the agenda of a CEO and what our messaging is all about. And it's showing up in our results.","Marc Russell Benioff - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yes. I wanted to also mention, I misspoke. It's not a \u2013 ABB is a Zurich \u2013 is based in Zurich, Switzerland, near Davos and not in Germany.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your question.","Philip Alan Winslow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi. Thanks, guys, and congrats on showing upside both on the billings and bookings line, but also just on operating margin line. It's kind of like the Lego quarter, movie quarter. Everything is awesome. So within sort of in that context, question for both Marks here. Marc B, just from your standpoint, wonder if you could kind of walk through how you sort of imagine, I guess, the evolution of the company here because you've laid out these longer-term revenue targets, but then also on this call, you focused a lot in your prepared remarks on margins. Just from sort of the CEO's perspective, how do you sort of see that give and take there?","And then for Mark Hawkins, obviously, at Analyst Day, you laid out the framework for growth and margins. Wonder if you could kind of just reiterate that for everyone, but also put the 20 \u2013 sorry, fiscal 2016 guidance sort of in the context of that?","Marc Russell Benioff - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Great. Well, I think first and foremost, our shareholders have spoken that they want us to keep our non-GAAP operating margin in mind. And for us to \u2013 as we work on our revenue growth plans to have clarity and mindfulness about delivering not just the phenomenal pace of top-line growth, which we certainly have done, but also improve the non-GAAP operating margin as you saw this year by 175 basis points. And that's why this year we're coming in and saying that we're expecting to deliver another 125 basis points to 150 basis points of operating margin while continuing the strong top-line growth. And I think both of these things are now important for salesforce. And we obviously know how to do that. We did it this year. And we plan to do it again in the coming year as well.","Mark J. Hawkins - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And let me just add on to that, Phil. Appreciate the comments about the quarter. I think the guidance when you look at the revenue, 20% to 21%, which is the implied guidance here for the revenue growth in U.S. dollars, plus a headwind that we talked about of $175 million to $200 million, you quickly get a sense of what the constant currency growth rate is. You can see that's matched right in to our revenue margin framework. I think the operating margin to expand that 125 basis points to 150 basis points again after a year that we've just exceeded of 175 basis points plus with the headwind of 25 basis points to 50 basis points due to foreign exchange, it's right in the exact ZIP code of where we want to be. We feel like it's excellent balance in terms of the top-line that Marc talked about, the bottom-line that we talked about and the cash flow (51:15) as well as the growth rate. So we feel really good about where that lines up. And the revenue margin framework is the \u2013 very much something we embrace.","Operator","Your final question today will come from the line of Bhavan Suri with William Blair. Please go ahead with your question.","Bhavan S. Suri - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hey, guys. Just one for Keith, and congrats, too. But, Keith, just a little bit of color if you could give us on sort of the contribution of the influence of the large SIs like Accenture, Deloitte, KPMG. And then as you look at the concept of the data driven organization and the ability to build some custom (51:52) analytical apps, does it feel reasonable to feel like those large SIs are going to get even more involved given they've all got pretty big analytics practices? And as they do get involved, if that's the case, longer term, is there a chance that we get them to become such an influence that they do drive more leverage on the sales and marketing line because of the reach they provide?","Keith G. Block - Vice Chairman & President","Yeah, listen \u2013 thanks. That's a great question. Thank you for the question. As I mentioned earlier, we're obviously very, very excited about the launch of analytics, and our partners are as well. So we have worked very, very hard over the last 12 months to strengthen our relationships with the strategic influencers in the market, be it Accenture or PwC or Deloitte, or cloud sharers (52:32) even some of the regional players. And we think that's very important because they're in the boardroom, and they have the influence with our clients. And we are very aligned around customer engagement and our customer platform and growth strategy for customers.","The early returns from these firms are very \u2013 they're very, very excited about what the Analytics Cloud is all about. So that's a natural play for them because they can wrap some incredibly high value-add services around our offering, and really do, I would say, more of the advisory services which are probably more margin services for them. So they're excited, we're excited, we continue to build out those relationships and I think you're just going to continue to see great progress there.","Operator","Thank you for your questions.

I am sorry I'm a little bit late here. I was working on Kramer and that will be on in 45 minutes. So, let me just say, first of all, we are just happy to share that revenue in the quarter rose to more than $3.7 billion, up 24% in dollars and 26% in constant currency. And in Q1, we delivered nearly $2 billion in operating cash flow, up 34% year-over-year, and I just want to congratulate our entire team for these cash flow numbers because they are just phenomenal.","For fiscal year 2020, we're guiding to $16.25 billion at the high end of the range, representing 22% projected growth year-over-year, and that's up $200 million from 90 days ago when we had our Q4 earnings call. No other enterprise software company of our size and scale is growing at this rate.","Just last month, IDC Worldwide Software Tracker ranked Salesforce the number one CRM for the sixth year in a row, and I'll tell you that is more important than ever, especially so many of our customers are going through these tremendous digital transformations and we all know every digital transformation begins and ends with the customer. And when I'm with these CEOs all over the world, this is really front and center in their mind. It's probably as exciting to them and it's important to them as it was to CIOs who were buying for Y2K, which is almost 20 years ago. I think the digital transformation remains just a huge growth opportunity for our entire industry.","And it's not only that, in 2018, Salesforce gained more CRM market share than the other top vendors combined, 15 top vendors combined, that's amazing. We're number one in sales, we're number one in service, and we're leading in so many other areas. We're number one in model-driven application platforms driven by our amazing community of 6 million developers. We're also a leader in marketing and commerce and continue to gain share, and with MuleSoft we also have this number one integration platform, it's incredible.","We have amazing opportunity ahead of us and we're taking advantage of that through a relentless focus on innovation, which is why Forbes has ranked Salesforce as one of the most innovative companies for 8 years in a row. We have a powerful vision for the future, with intelligent Customer 360, giving our B2B and our B2C customers a unified 360-degree view of their customers across every touch point, sales, service, marketing, commerce, communities, and more, and I'll tell you, this vision that has been so well articulated now by our product organization that we call Customer 360, this is really driving tremendous opportunity at the highest levels in these customers, and we'll talk about that, but every company needs to have this Customer 360 capability. It doesn't really matter what industry you are, even the Federal government, it's just a tremendous driving force.","And Customer 360 will continue to be a major growth engine for Salesforce going forward. At its core, it is our, core Salesforce Platform, which is the most powerful and easy way for companies to build modern, intelligent applications. In Q1, we announced our new Einstein Platform Services that enable everybody, regardless of their technical skill, to build custom AI-powered apps with just a few clicks, and that has been so important for our customers because just as we've infused these Einstein AI capabilities across our entire product line, and made Einstein Voice and also Einstein Vision capabilities available to every Salesforce app, we're now doing this exact same thing with another critical technology for our customers, which is blockchain.","So, when you look at our platform, you see this incredible capability of not just AI, not just blockchain, not just mobile, I mean there's so many things that are in the platform and the ability for our customers to easily build these state-of-the-art applications, it's pretty awesome or just simply extend our CRM apps. Last week, at TrailheaDX, our sold-out developer conference in San Francisco, we introduced Salesforce Blockchain. It is a breakthrough. Every customer app can have blockchain capabilities. It's the world's first declarative blockchain service solution, and it's built in deeply now into all of our apps. It's built in deeply into our platform. It's built natively on our platform enabling customers to easily create blockchain applications with simple drag-and-drop as they can with every other Salesforce app. And I'll tell you, in Minneapolis, on Friday, demonstrating it to one of our very large customers and showing how they can use it for their supply chain, and it's just incredible what it's going to do for so many of our customers in every industry.","Also, our ecosystem is just developing in a huge economy around Salesforce, one that is going to create more than 3 million jobs and more than $850 billion in GDP by 2022, and that is why we're so excited about Trailhead, which is our online learning platform and our online reskilling platform that empowers everyone.","Now we have more than 1.4 million learners changing their careers and their lives on Trailhead, and I'm sure so many of you have met these inspiring people and their incredible stories of how they transformed themselves using Trailhead. And in the quarter, our new myTrailhead product became generally available and now any of our customers can actually create their own branded service just like what we have done and reskill all their employees, customers, and partners too.","So it will be a huge driver of workforce development, which is why we are so excited that two weeks ago, we were with Ivanka Trump at our First-Ever Trailblazer Day in Indianapolis, in our headquarters in Indiana, where we signed the White House Pledge for America's Workers, and we plan to give more than 1 million Americans the skills they need and earn these Salesforce credentials and badges and do everything necessary to make them successful and to get top jobs in our ecosystem over the next 5 years.","Finally, at Salesforce, our vision has always been to change the way the world does business, and at the same time improve the state of the world. And that's why I'm extremely excited today that salesforce.org is reunified officially as part of Salesforce, providing an even better experience for all of our non-profit education and philanthropy customers, empowering them to fulfill their missions and tightly unifying our .org employees with our company \u2013 they are already sitting in our buildings and are already here with us, but now they're fully part of our structure as well and it's tremendous opportunity to accelerate our work in this incredible non-profit world. And now, as you're going to hear from Keith, we're well positioned to continue on our path to organically double our revenue again in the next four years, achieving a revenue target of $26 billion to $28 billion for fiscal year 2023. ","And now, over to Keith.","Keith Block","Thanks, Marc. Thanks, everybody, for joining us in the call today. As Marc said, we have never been positioned for the future better than we are right now. We delivered strong revenue growth in the quarter and we're seeing great momentum across all of our clouds and all of our industries. In fact, for the first time ever, sales cloud \u2013 Service Cloud exceeded $1 billion in revenue for the quarter, becoming our second cloud. That is pretty awesome, right? That is admittedly.","Mark Hawkins","$1.25 billion for Service Cloud, you know a lot of these other cloud companies that we read about all the time, they're not even doing $1 billion quarters in their VIM, service clouds, congratulations.","Keith Block","No. It's pretty amazing. So it is becoming our second cloud, as Marc said, to surpass an annual revenue run rate of $4 billion, which is pretty incredible.","Marc Benioff","It is pretty awesome.","Keith Block","And MuleSoft, by the way, also had an outstanding Q1, capping off a record first year in celebrating its anniversary here as part of Salesforce. Now, we are well prepared, as Marc said to deliver on our FY 2020 goal and also our goal of $26 billion to $28 billion in revenue for fiscal year 2023. So we're all excited about that. Quarter-after-quarter, we continue to take share and outpace the competition. I think that's pretty clear.","As Marc alluded to, we have been meeting with CEOs around the world and the common theme that we're hearing is the importance of transforming their customer experience and the value of providing a 360-degree view of the customer. And that's something that Salesforce does better than anybody, and that's why we continue to see massive demand for our solutions from both new customers and existing customers across the world, every industry, every market segment. And you can see this, it's in our results, 25% year-over-year revenue growth in the Americas; 27% in APAC; and 32% in EMEA in constant currency, very, very proud of those results.","Now a great example of a customer who understand the importance of transformation in the customer is Dell, who's really done a fantastic job in their transformation around customer experience. Dell is a long-time customer, they're a strategic partner. In the quarter, they expanded with us to deliver more automated and intelligent customer service experiences with Einstein Bots and predictions and Next Best Action, very, very important.","In Q1, we've also built and strengthened relationships with some of the leading companies around the world including Tokio Marine Holdings, one of Japan's largest insurance providers. They're standardizing sales and service and marketing on Salesforce which is very, very cool. And they also were deploying Financial Services Cloud to a million of agents in over 50,000 agencies.","We also expanded with Hera Group, an Italian utility company. I just came back from Italy, last week. This is a company that is serving over 4.4 million citizens. And we also formed a new relationship with People's Choice Credit Union, one of the largest credit unions in Australia. We can see this as an ongoing phenomenon globally. Again, very, very excited with what's happening. We continue to deepen our relationship with the U.S. Federal Government. The Department of Education recently selected Salesforce as its platform to modernize and streamline the experience of millions of citizens with federal student loan.","Southwest Airlines, which has won awards for their world-class customer service is creating an entirely new employee experience with a centralized knowledge and to build on Salesforce using certified communities. Southwest is transforming delivery of their HR services with new sales service chat and mobile capabilities for more than 60,000 employees.","It's also about our partner ecosystem. We all know the importance of our partners and they continue to play a critical role in our customer's transformation and not only were partners involved in 63% of our new business in Q1, but they were some of our leading adopters as well.","Accenture selected myTrailhead, this is very important, still their culture of continuous learning and provide top talent for their clients business and leveraging custom content for re-skilling employees on topics like artificial intelligence, networking and leadership development. Again, think about the business that Accenture and these other providers were in, it's all about talent and bringing value to the table.","We're also seeing strong momentum beyond the United States, Australia's Telstra with another great myTrailhead win for the quarter. I was recently with their CEO and board discussing the strategic importance of reskilling the workforce is the common theme and its top of mind as Marc alluded to for every CEO in the world. It comes up in every single conversation.","Our vertical solutions continue to drive success and value for our customers. In Q1, we launched Einstein Analytics for financial services. This is the first complete intelligence platform for wealth and banking. In the quarter, we had incredible Financial Services Cloud wins with clients in CIBC. We also released new health cloud capabilities to provide a complete new factor's that contribute to a patient's health, again, very, very important, enabling providers to deliver better care and improved outcomes.","In Q1, Cerner, a leading provider of health care information and EHR technologies chose to replace their current CRM in Salesforce to continue transforming how they engage with their consumers and their providers. Finally, as I mentioned, it's been a year since we acquired MuleSoft and we're absolutely thrilled with the combined success. In April, MuleSoft was named the leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Enterprise Integration Platform as a Service and that makes us the only company \u2013 the only company to be recognized as a leader in both these and Gartner's most recent Magic Quadrant for Full Life Cycle API Management. So to close, I want to thank our customers, our partners, our employees, our strong results this quarter.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mark Hawkins.","Mark Hawkins","Well, thanks, Keith. And as you've heard from Marc and Keith, we're pleased with our first quarter results, delivering strong revenue growth across each of our clouds and geographies, year-over-year operating margin improvement and a record quarter of operating cash flow.","Let me take you through some of the details for Q1. First quarter revenue grew 24% in dollars and 26% in constant currency. As you can see, we experienced FX headwinds in Q1, which on a dollar basis represented $61 million or two full points of growth year-over-year.","Our industry-leading product portfolio continue to deliver strong subscription and support revenue growth in U.S. dollars year-over-year. Sales Cloud grew 11% in U.S. dollars; Service Cloud grew 20%; and this quarter, as noted, eclipsed the $4 billion annual run rate. Marketing and commerce grew 33%. Platform and Other grew 46%, including approximately $140 million in subscription and support revenue for MuleSoft, of which 55% is treated as term license.","Keep in mind, the FX headwind for total revenue affected each of the clouds on a similar proportional basis. Driving into MuleSoft a bit more, we continue to execute well with MuleSoft contributing $170 million for total revenue in the first quarter. While this is our final quarter of discrete revenue reporting for MuleSoft, we intend to provide additional color on MuleSoft going forward as appropriate.","Our renewal rate remained healthy in Q1 and dollar attrition continues to remain below 10%. In fact, our attrition rate continued to improve modestly in the first quarter year-over-year similar to the year-over-year improvement in attrition that we saw last quarter in Q4 2019. Q1 GAAP EPS was $0.49 and non-GAAP EPS was $0.93. Required mark-to-market adjustments of our strategic investments benefited both GAAP and non-GAAP in the first quarter by approximately $0.27.","Turning to cash flow. I was very pleased with our strong cash collections in the first quarter, which drove the operating cash flow of $1.97 billion, up 34% year-over-year. In fact, in Q1, we generated more operating cash flow than we did in our entire fiscal year 2016.","CapEx for the quarter was $159 million, leading to free cash flow, as defined as operating cash flow less CapEx of $1.81 billion, up 34% over Q1 of last year. Our remaining performance obligation representing all future revenues under contracts ended the first quarter at approximately $24.9 billion, up 22% over the last year.","Current RPO balance or cRPO, which is business that is both billed and unbilled and is expected to be recognized as revenue in the next 12 months was approximately $11.8 billion, up 23% year-over-year. On a constant-currency basis, cRPO was up 24% year-over-year after considering an FX headwind of more than $100 million. While we make changes to our sales organization as we do every on Q1, we did not see a material impact to our cRPO, as you can see in these results.","Before I turn to guidance, let me turn -- touch on the FX environment and the combination of Salesforce.org and the related impact to in Q2 FY 2020 guidance. First, regarding FX. As is evident in our results, we're seeing a substantial decline in our FX rates since our Q4 call. The Great British pound, for example, decreased approximately 5% since our fiscal fourth quarter 2019 earnings call and our euro declined by approximately 2% over the same period.","Second, regarding Salesforce.org. With the recently announced closing, we continue to expect to Salesforce.org to contribute approximately $150 million to $200 million in revenue in FY 2020 with approximately $40 million to $50 million of this revenue recognized in Q2. And as previously discussed, we will incur a one-time non-cash accounting charge of approximately $200 million in second quarter related to our settlement of the reseller agreement with Salesforce.org, which impacts our Q2 GAAP to non-GAAP EPS guide by approximately $0.20. We expect the combination of Salesforce.org to be additive to our long-term revenue targets and we'll provide more detail during our annual Analyst Day in the fall.","Now turning to Q2 and FY 2020 guidance. We are now expecting north of $200 million in FX headwinds for the year. And given this context, we are pleased to be able to absorb these headwinds and still finish FY 2020 revenue guidance of $16.1 billion to $16.25 billion for 21% to 22% growth year-over-year and with the dollar strengthening relatively to GDP and the euro, we're not only experiencing headwind to revenue, but also have an increase in pressure in operating margins as well. And that context along with the integration of transaction expenses associated with the combination of Salesforce.org, we were also pleased to be able to maintain our plan of delivering flat to 25 basis points of non-GAAP operating margin improving year-over-year.","As a result, we are raising our FY 2020 GAAP diluted EPS to $0.78 to $0.80 and our non-GAAP diluted EPS to $2.88 to $2.90. And as a reminder, our EPS guidance assumes no future contribution for mark-to-market accounting as required by ASU 2016-01.","For operating cash flow, we maintain our FY 2020 operating cash flow guidance of 20% to 21%. For Q2, we expect revenues in the range of $3.94 billion to $3.95 billion; GAAP diluted loss per share of $0.08 to $0.07; and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.46 to $0.47. We are also expect cRPO approximately 20% to 21% year-over-year in the second quarter.","To close, we had another quarter of strong results and we maintain to be on track for FY 2020 revenue and profitability goals and achieve our long-term organic target of $26 billion to $28 billion in FY 2023. I'd like to thank our employees, customers, partners and shareholders for their continued support.","With that, I'd like to open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Heather Bellini","Good morning. Thank you so much for taking the question. I had a couple. Marc, I was wondering if we could spend a little bit more time on MuleSoft. And if you could just share with us some examples of how it's helping you expand your reach within your existing customers. And any success you might be able to share about how it's brought new customers into the Salesforce fold?","And then I just had a quick follow-up for Mark Hawkins. Just -- you mentioned the cRPO that you -- the headwind in the quarter from FX. Were you expecting -- could you share with us were you expecting an FX headwind in the quarter for cRPO because that's where we're getting things as well? So thank you.","Marc Benioff","Well, thanks. Let me just check on that just briefly. And I'll tell you right now, we really pivoted our entire company into something that we call Customer 360. It's a pretty hard pivot for our company, and we're so excited about this opportunity, and a lot of it is because of tremendous momentum that we've seen over the last year with MuleSoft. And this idea that what our customers want us to do is to be able to take everything they're doing in regards to their customers.","So that is their sales, their service, their marketing, and their journeys, their commerce and their customer engagement systems, apps they're building, APIs that they're building for developers to integrate with those customers. All the analytics, custom applications by industry, the communities, the learning and reskilling systems that I mentioned, and the employee experience as well. And to bring it all together, using all these amazing technologies that you know are becoming so important to us like blockchain, AI, whether it's vision or voice, it's incredible what has happened just in the last two years or three years, put it all on a phone, deliver it all as a programmatic capability, make it secure, and then wrap it all together, put a bow on it and call it Customer 360. And we're the only ones who are really trying to do this. It's kind of interesting because as I meet with customers all over the world, and in this quarter, I've been basically nonstop on the road. I've been in Japan, I've been throughout the United States, I've been through Europe, and Keith as well.","And when we basically \u2013 come back and go \u201cwow,\u201d this is what all these customers are trying to do and this is really our vision. And what has accelerated it for us, and our ability to execute it and yet it's a hard tidbit for us is MuleSoft because MuleSoft has given us the ability to come into the customers and say we're going to bring in everything you have into that 360.","We're not going to be a silo, we're not going to be all about this application that we're building that our platform is giving you the ability to connect all of your systems together into one. And so, so many exciting customer stories around that that I could touch on, but Bret, do you want to just kind of go a little deeper into that vision.","Bret Taylor","Yes. I mean, it's actually a great time. We just had our TrailheaDX Developer Conference in San Francisco last week, and MuleSoft was really highlighted. One of the stories that was on stage, and the keynote ASICs, they really capture that vision of Customer 360 that Marc was talking about.","In that story, we were just talking about that ASICs was building their mobile app and their e-commerce experience, and as Marc said, [indiscernible] customer 360, so every ASICs customer has a personalized one-to-one experience. It wasn't just about our technology, it was about the order management system, the on-premise systems, the legacy systems, and all that data is trapped.","And if you talk to the CEOs who are trying to do these digital transformations, they are trying to create those next-generation customer experiences to integrate with smart watches and smart speakers and smart TVs and smart thermostats. Their barrier is the legacy systems that are data trapped in legacy systems and MuleSoft has been such an accelerator for that vision technologically, which is why if you walked around the floor in TrailheaDX last week, MuleSoft was on everyone's mind.","We launched this product called MuleSoft Community Manager, which enables companies create ecosystems around their APIs. APIs are becoming the lingua franca of how companies communicate with each other, and you can see really the convergence of our technologies and our Community Cloud and the API orientation of MuleSoft I think really transforms the way companies are thinking about the data and thinking about integration strategically.","Heather Bellini","The another thing that really comes across when we're talking about that, Bret, is this vision of building a Customer 360, and much of the story that happened just last week where I was with a customer at a lunch, and we\u2019re talking about everything you just said but they're concerned because maybe they are going to make a decision about what their social implementation is.","Maybe they're making the decision about their customer service call center over here, maybe they're making a decision around their marketing systems or their sales force or their apps. They want to bring it all together. They need to be able to have a unified customer view. So, is that a daunting challenge for these companies or how are you going to make that easy for them?","Keith Block","Yes, it is. Let's take e-commerce as an example. We were just talking about ASICs. If you are a modern retailer, it's not just about making a storefront anymore, you have to integrate with Pinterest and Instagram, you have to be able to show where your customers are, and that's evolving day by day, week by week, month by month.","The MuleSoft team will tell you, MuleSoft is a technology that increases the clock speed of digital transformation. And I think what I hear from the most strategic Chief Digital Officers and CEOs is, their focus isn't just deploying a solution, it's making sure that the pace of integration as a company increases. And I think fundamentally that is more profitable.","Heather Bellini","Okay. And unfortunately, Keith just left the room, Mark, do you just want touch in a little bit and give us some fill on MuleSoft color and how important this been to company?","Mark Hawkins","Well, for sure. I mean, MuleSoft has been just a great offering for us. It's a great customer response. We're super happy with it, that's for sure. It's been great to customers who have them. When we talk about our entire Customer Success Platform and how this is going to helping us more enable that. So that is more positive marketing.","The only thing I might touch on is the second question that had been asked regarding the RPO, cRPO in particular. And we did incur the $100 million FX headwind. This is clearly significantly incremental to anything we would have expected for sure. And the only thing that I would like to call out, and we talk a lot about as a management team, we're looking today on a hunt for $200 million at our revenue level for FX headwind this very moments.","This is clearly something different that's happening. What I'm pleased with is we're able to absorb this and still deliver our fiscal year high-end guide number of 16250 or 22% growth this year.","Heather Bellini","You touched on this a little bit in your script for foreign exchange, but we have gone through foreign exchange environment making it really heavy for us. Like how much foreign exchange headwind do you have for the year?","Keith Block","For example, in the first quarter, we took a $61 million headwind in revenue alone, for example. We have $200 million that we're looking at as a headwind for this year thus far. And I think the good news is we've got that covered within a plan and -- and little place that we can deliver what we deliver with that.","Marc Benioff","And it's amazing you're going to deliver 16,250 for the year but you're still picking up all these foreign exchange. This thing that I appreciate is our predictive business model, it's really something that we talk a lot with our customers about and that really helps us what is a lot or things I think our investors understand.","Keith Block","You can't predict foreign exchange very well, which is hard to \u2013 that\u2019s what Marc was suggesting that and I would second that as well\u2026.","Marc Benioff","Backing agreement, technically keeping together.","Keith Block","I don\u2019t know \u2013 something is not working. I am not saying enough. ","Heather Bellini","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Karl Keirstead","Thank you. Marc Benioff, I wanted to ask you, I think everybody on this call realizes that it's -- there's a little bit more macro uncertainty out there, but I wanted to ask whether as you and Keith and Mark Hawkins sat down to set the guide for 2Q and the full year, whether you're assuming any broader spending environment change for Salesforce? Thanks very much for any comment.","Marc Benioff","I think that's a really good question. I mean I'll just give you my -- I mean, I'm not an economist. Everyone on the call knows that. I'm just out in the field talking to customers like all of you are. And I've been all over the world the last 90 days and I've talked to hundreds and hundreds of customers face-to-face.","And I would say that this is -- we're still in a very strong economy. Maybe this is not 2018 economy, but it's a 2017 economy. I think last year, of course, we have that radical crazy acceleration because of the tax cuts, but there's still a strong buy-in emotion by all these CEOs.","But I will say that I think they do all have some anxiety around what's going on with this trade situation. And even in a customer that I was with as early as last week, they -- I think are not very happy with how that could potentially impact them, but I don't see it coming in on the economy right now.","Now, we don't do business really in China, so we're not a good company to talk about that kind of trade situation as these trade things don't affect us. We're mostly free of that. But when we look into the customers' eyes, we're always like saying to ourselves, are they buying? Are they investing? And the thing that hits me and this is where I am, and I'm going to -- I'll let Keith talk about this, again, which is that I have just been really impressed with how every CEO and really C-suite that I'm talking to is actually quite obsessed with digital transformation. And I think they all see the tremendous revenue growth opportunities now from these new technologies.","Maybe they didn't understand what blockchain was, maybe they didn't understand AI, maybe they didn't understand some of the subtleties of mobility and all of the opportunity, but something is going to change that in the last, I would say, 18 to 24 months. And sitting at this very table that we're at right now, we have the CEO of a very large healthcare company here I guess maybe about two weeks ago, through the demonstration show them, talking to the computer, your artificial intelligence sales understand and talking back to us which was amazing.","And then also we use the camera to have a direct artificial intelligence analysis of what was going on in a retail shop which was so cool. And we've demonstrated that before. And now how we integrated into the blockchain where you see the whole transparency of the supply chain was amazing. And of course, we didn\u2019t allow mobile phones, it was secure. And then bam, we had Customer 360.","And the CEO was not shocked. They're kind of following along as we got at that level, I think that CEOs have very much become Chief Information Officers or Chief Digital Officer themselves, and we're now rolling into that level of executive.","And because of that, I think they really have the ability to transform their companies, in many cases, those visions are not coming from middle managers who are obviously deeply involved, but from the chief executives or C-suite themselves. And if you try to lay back, you can. You're the right person to talk about blockchain by the way.","Keith Block ","So, many, many points here. None of us are economists, Mark that we have to anybody in the conference but that being said, I do think we're in an enviable position for the company what's going on with digital transformation around the world. I wish we could return from EMEA and I was with CEOs from financial services institutions of the U.K., France, and Italy and they're all talking about digital transformation and the customer experience and the importance of providing that customer experience and customer loyalty, and providing higher levels of service with our technology.","I was also with the CEOs of few retail companies in the U.K. and France and before I left for the United States, and obviously, retail is a challenged market. And these companies are reinventing themselves and the experience they have at least with the CEO with the largest companies in the world, and he's talking about a direct relationship directly with a patient for the drugs that they're bringing to market. And these are things that we couldn't think about two years ago, three years ago, four years ago or consumer packaged goods companies begun with the largest CPG companies in the world, I was sitting here, talking about how that CPG company gets closer to their end consumer and how they can optimize their own retail execution where there's so many possibilities here.","And Marc nailed it. I mean the CEO [Indiscernible] has become a Chief Digital Officer, Chief Information Officer and that's why the company keep coming to Salesforce. Because we really are the only company that can provide this capability and this 360-degree view of the customer. This is the Holy Grail. Marc and I have been in this interview for quite a while, this is the Holy Grail for customers, and we're in a great position for them.","Karl Keirstead","When you look at customer's ability to have full effects of this technology. Where are they? Are they at this point really able to see this technology and deploy it? Are you seeing that transformation? Or is there still technology transfer issue?","Marc Benioff","Well, there's many, many companies, I think are in very early days. In fact, if you talk to one of our largest consulting partners, they'll tell you less than 20% of their strategic customers have been engaged in the digital transformation, but there's a lot of room for them in the marketplace.","Going back to the first question about MuleSoft, who would've thought that a CEO would be thinking about integration and the importance of data being strategic to their transformation. And that is the value and the beauty of what MuleSoft brings to the table.","So, we have an opportunity here again around this digital transformation and one of the beauties of a product like Trailhead and My Trailhead is helping these companies through their transformation and scale them up with modern technology because the modern worker has to have modern skills. And that's what Trailhead and My Trailhead really provide the customers. So we really are coming out with an amazing innovation at the right time to satisfy the needs of these customers [Indiscernible].","Karl Keirstead","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And. Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Derrick Wood with Cowen and Company. Your line is now open.","Derrick Wood","Great. Thanks. I guess for Keith. Headcount adds in the quarter were quite strong for Q1, and up 24% on a year-over-year basis. It's almost the highest in two years. So, are there any areas you would highlight you're accelerating investments whether at certain function, geography or product area? And I guess, as a follow-up, since you're getting so large and almost 40,000 employees, can you just touch on how you ensure you continue to manage onboarding and the threshold and maybe how attrition is tracking these days?","Marc Benioff","So, thanks for the call. Look, I think you know that we've got a very, very strong international strategy, so we've invested significantly globally, but certainly outside the United States as we continue to take share. We've obviously made a commitment to our industry strategy so you continue to see a verticalized with our product, whether it's our customers and our partners and our headcount as well.","MuleSoft, of course, is certainly a growth area for us, it's our core cloud. So, there's a lot of opportunities for us to make these investments. But at the end of the day, all the investments that we make rotating around making sure that we're driving success for our customers. And when we think about on-boarding and as we bring in all these new people, one of the advantages that we have in the marketplace is that we have this amazing technology called Trailhead. And we -- all of our employees get upskilled using Trailhead. And it allows us to get these people hitting the ground running a lot faster than you would say through traditional learning system.","So, we will continue to invest internationally and we'll continue to invest internationally in our key markets, in our international geographies, of course, in the United States. We'll continue to invest in our customer success because at the end of the day, the customer success is what it's all about. That is an amazing transformation under Brian Mill in our customer success organization and we'll continue to leverage Trailhead which I think has been very, very important to us. In fact, I would encourage all of you to go ahead and go to our website and try Trailhead and see how it can change your life. How's that?","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","Kirk Materne","Thanks very much. Keith, I actually wanted to follow-up on -- your comments around myTrailhead, especially as it relates to the comment you had on Accenture. Can myTrailhead become a force multiplier for you from a go-to-market perspective, especially in places like Europe and Asia where you might not have the reach historically? It seems to me that, that could be a potential way for you guys to accelerate even faster in those markets where you have the demand but maybe not the people on the ground to go capture the demand. So would love just kind of your thoughts on that. Thanks.","Marc Benioff","Yeah, let me answer this and then I'm going to pivot and ask Bret to comment on it from a broader prospective. Look, as Mark and I go around the world, every CEO has this something that is top of mind besides digital transformation. And that is around their workforce development and their reskilling. That's why myTrailhead is so powerful. When you think about the digital transformation that these CEOs are going through, whether it's in the United States, quite frankly, or whether it's internationally, responsible CEOs were thinking about how do they absorb this amazing technology, how do they reskill their workers as they think about digital transformation. How do they act responsibly from a social perspective because if you think about it, these CEOs, they're in charge of tens of thousands, hundreds and thousands of people, and they care about their people?","And that's where myTrailhead is an excellent example and an excellent solution, not just how they can scale their people up on this modern technology, but also to prepare them for this modern world. And we see this again everywhere in the world. And we have special programs with companies all over the world to talk about how they reskill the workforce. I mentioned in the opening comments the meeting I had with the CEO of Telstra and his executive team and how concerned they were about the modern reports and what they wanted to do with our reskilling their workforce. Marc and I have the same conversations with CEOs all over the world. So myTrailhead is a force multiplier. It is so important on so many levels when you think about modern skills and we're very, very excited about that. Bret, do you want to comment more from a product perspective?","Bret Taylor","Yeah, I'll bring up this TrailheaDX conference because I think, Keith is talking about is really came out strong at that event. One of the women that we highlighted in this event was a woman named Angela Mahoney, she runs a certain vision called RAD Women which it\u2019s her condition to train women to become experts on the Salesforce technology in just 10 weeks and get them into the Salesforce ecosystem.","This is entirely done by independent organizations who are just trying to help people with this, big problem of workforce development and empower people to get into the technology ecosystem. And what's incredible about it, at the end of this conference, we still need to bring into I think 100 something cities, but that wasn't us, what we did is, we put all of our content in a box and our ecosystem, our community is going to put on these events because they want to spread the word about the opportunity of this technology and the opportunities at Trailhead.","That's exactly Bellini mentioned in her question, which is our community is spreading the word on our behalf because there's so much opportunity on the other side. It all comes from the completely ablative view, so we really think the Trailhead is one of the most significant differentiators of our platform. Our community is helping to teach other people about native technologies. It is also helping us with findings of our result that are helping I think a lot more members of our society benefit from the economic case of technology which is incredible opportunity for the world.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from Tom Roderick with Stifel. Your line is now open.","Tom Roderick","Hi guys, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. So I know you've been getting a lot of questions this quarter just around not just the general environment, but also some of the strategies related to the install base and how you're handling renewals. I'd love to hear beyond just what is happening and what you're doing with, but what is reported strategy as you go to market, and this is probably a good question for Keith, as you think about the role of renewals and customer success with respect to the broader portfolio, how do you approach that customer? And is that philosophy changing at all? Thank you.","Marc Benioff","So thank you for the question. Look, I think you know from our business model, the importance of renewal, that's why customer success is one of our most important values. We have entire organization, the customer success team that is focused on success, but it goes beyond the customer success to admit a cultural thing. I believe amongst the 40,000 employees we wake up every day, having a focused on customer success.","So renewals, which are very, very small, and our attrition is excellent. I mean it's unprecedented, particularly for a company of our size and scale. That is obviously an indication with our customer satisfaction. Now we have doubled down in this transformation. We're all making sure that our customer experience is second to none. And what's interesting about that is if companies become a large companies of our size, they forget they are focused on the consumer. This is a company Salesforce that since day one, we\u2019ve benefited to driving successful customers. And a lot of companies along the way, they just loose their focus on the customer. And we have doubled down and renewed our focus on the customer. And again, part of that is renewals. But it really is about providing an incredible experience, a seamless experience at every single touch point that the customer have. And that's why Gartner recently recognized Salesforce as an incredibly strong company as it relates to customer experience, giving us that recognition. They know what's going on the marketplace. And it's -- because it's part of our culture, we're dedicating ourselves to it and we're not going to lose who we're, whereas other companies have made that strategic mistake along the way.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from Alex Zukin with Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open.","Alex Zukin","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Two really quick ones. Maybe first for Marc, you mentioned some Salesforce reorganization and the fact that didn't any impact on current RPO this quarter. Can you maybe touch on what kind of reorgs or what are you doing this year from a strategic go-to-market perspective around the sales team that's little different from last year? And then maybe just given the continuous mention around Trailhead and talent as being important strategic differentiators, have you given any thoughts to expanding your role in the talent kind of market from organic or inorganic matter?","Keith Block","Hi, Alex, this is Keith. Why don't I take the question. So look, at the beginning of the fiscal year, we made some adjustments. You know we periodically do that and we do it to take advantage of the market opportunity that support the long-term growth plan that we have that's why we make adjustments. When you think about the endgame here, these decisions are really about getting close to our customers, right? And that is about driving the highest level of our customer success. Any of these adjustments that we made, they are essential, they are important and strategic in fueling our long-term growth which has been exceptional, as we know, at the size and scale. And we are very optimistic about where we are in FY 2020 and the demand that we are seeing in the marketplace and we're excited about where we're going with these adjustments. So we feel strongly about where we are.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question -- go ahead.","Marc Benioff","I just wanted to touch a little bit on the part of that employee experience. I just think and I think Bret should probably touch on this too which is this is really become I think a critical part of Customer 360 is that the employees inside of our customers, they need to have a good experience and have access to all of those customer information as well. And probably a great example this quarter was Southwest Airlines, since actually long-term customer of ours, he has been using our Service Cloud to deliver amazing customer service experience, and we've really enjoyed working with them.","But now, Southwest is really turning to this employee experience. And they use our communities product and they use Service Cloud and they use a centralized HR help desk for 60,000 employees to check their benefits, manage rotation time and questions via chat and also in a mobile device. I don't want to think in any way that we're going into HRMS or anything like that. This is really something that's very much enhancing the customer experience and regards to employee experience and the interception between employees and customers.","And there's many areas where this is touchdown for us. It could be our employee portal that we've provided for our customers, it can be provided in this HR help desks, it can be the integration of the customer information into the employee collaboration system and it's one of the key reasons we acquired Quip which has been just continues to be a tremendous success at Salesforce. And Quip is all about getting employee productivity and the productivity up in collaboration. And Bret, do you want to handle your vision here on employee experience and all the things that you're doing in our product to enhance the employee's experience with Customer 360?","Bret Taylor","Yes. Whether you're in the airline industry or the hotel industry or the retail industry, the most important thing is you're empowering your employees for really touching the customer community and the customers provide that Customer 360. And really the words that I hear, time and time again, from CEOs is around enablement. How do I help my employees through this transformation, this digital transformation of technology and it's not just about the technology, it's about the human beings going through that change.","So that's why we have things like myTrailhead, which speaks of learning platform that Keith and Marc talked about. They enabled something that you did for your own transformation. That's why Quip for Salesforce which is embedding productivity and collaboration into every single one of our products. And we think it's so important really to focus on this trailblazing employee and not just the technology and have enablement strategic capability of our platform.","Keith Block","Yes. I will just add that I think one of the key things, and I'd love your take on this Bret, is that when we're talking with our customers and when we're talking to specifically the C-suite positioning ourselves, one of the things that I always say specifically is what we need to understand, we only have really one word in our company and that's customer. We're just here to do that for you. We're not going to do the HR fees, we're not doing the financial fees, we're not doing all these other things. We\u2019ll never do that as a company. What we do this -- we got but one of the things after 20 years I've been focused on this word customer and it has morphed, it has changed, it has evolved. When you look at the Customer 360, approach is very different, of course, where we were even just 10 years ago or 5 years ago. So how do you see that intersection between employee and customer and where you see that transformation going?","Marc Benioff","Mark, I think the main word I am thinking is stakeholder. When you think about what it means to provide a Customer 360 now surrounding everyone engages with your customers with the right information. It might be a pharmacist, it might be a doctor, it might be a gate agent, it might be someone, a the customer service agent talking on the phone with your customer and we really even make sure we're serving every stakeholder that makes up that Customer 360 which is why the employee is a key constituency in providing us. But to me, it doesn't really deter from that those become the customerswhether it's helping you unlock your data for that Customer 360 through MuleSoft or enabling your employees with Quip and Trailhead, it\u2019s all about enabling this digital transformation to start presenting to the customer.","Mark Hawkins ","Well -- and [indiscernible] so I thought I'd really be remiss if I didn't say that one of the key players on our team is here, what Amy has really given us is a light on privacy and the security of our data and making sure that our customers have that privacy because when you take all these Customer 360, Amy, how do you see that evolving over the last quarter or two in regards to privacy which has been a major shift going on. I think worldwide, certainly going through the GDPR shift, where are we going with that?","Amy Weaver","Sure. Thanks, Mark. GDPR, as you mentioned, just celebrated its first birthday. So we are through the first year and I'm happy to have that going on. I think the really the next big step in United States is looking for a federal law. At California, as you know, passed the CCPA and that's an important first step, but with the all Americans regardless of the code, which state they're in, very strong privacy protection and that's why we've been advocating our IDC advocate for a comprehensive federal privacy law.","Marc Benioff","So this would be like national privacy laws which speak nationally state-by-state California is the first \u2026","Amy Weaver","Yes. ","Marc Benioff","\u2026 like a domino effect, we want to have the federal government step up and really deliver on national privacy law, is that what you are saying now?","Amy Weaver","That was one of the real benefits of GDPR. We went from a patch work of privacy law all over Europe to one law that companies can work with as well as all of the systems know what to expect wherever they are in Europe. That's what we need in the U.S. and we need something which really required companies to be transparent about their privacy practices for individuals they have more control of their personal data than they do currently. And also frankly for companies to be held accountable for their actions.","Marc Benioff","Well, I think that's just an awesome vision. I don't think anything would accelerate our Customer 360 vision more than having that in the United States as Europe. Thank you for that.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Terry Tillman with SunTrust Bank. Your line is now open.","Terry Tillman","Yeah. Thank you for fitting in gentlemen. My question just relates to as we progressed to the rest of the fiscal year and Customer 360 with the last couple of questions and the answer has been focused on that, how do we help investors in terms of looking at metrics and barometers of success? Is it seven, eight figure deals? Or certain cloud products more likely to be pulled through or cash because of a Customer 360 conversation? Just wanted to learn some more perspective on that. Thank you.","Keith Block","Well, this is Keith. Let me answer that. So if you go back to where we are in this modern age with this amazing technology where there is incredible disruption which is really should bring opportunity and we're really in a growth era. When you think about what's important to a CEO besides taking care of their employees, they're thinking about growth. We're not in the age of cut your way to prosperity anymore, that's a 20-year-old phenomenon. This is really about growth. And the most important thing about growth is with the customer in the center of the world and that means Customer 360. ","So when we're out there talking with our customers, we're looking for a solution, we're looking for a platform to grow, they want to think about Customer 360. So the way I would think about it is that every CEO has a strategic mission and an obligation to all their stakeholders around growth and success. And it is all about putting that customer in the center of the world. So that's just being that when we were out talking solutions, we will become more strategic, have a deeper relationship with these CEOs and C-suite because we're solving their number one problem. Their number one problem is about growth and putting that customer in the center of the world. ","So that is the way I would be thinking about this is that this brings Salesforce through a whole new position in terms of this relationships and deep meaning into the strategic strategy with the customers. We also have this amazing motion going on in the organization. MuleSoft, we have been providing the organization, but then some has worked maybe on single one of our clouds, if you will, the sales cloud, the service cloud, the cloud, integration cloud that Bret was talking about a little bit.","And then once you have a new logo, then you have this kind of transactional throughput whereas you go to work and make them a multi-cloud customer or a vertical customer or taking on the vertical applications, how do you see that balance between new logos and existing customers and continuing to build market share.","Marc Benioff","Well, we do have a new logo motion as well as an install base motion, they're both very, very healthy and continue to be a focus area for us. But at the end of the day, we're here to solve these customer solutions and drive success for them. And that means we position the right solution at the right time which may be a particular product or maybe a whole transformation.","That's the case and still that is [indiscernible]. And that is why a new logo motion or what we call land and expand receding growth has been successful for this company and also more recently we're able to enterprise transformation and we prepped those amazing customers on the call, some of it were not the logos for the first time with one or more clouds and some were turned the deep transformation like that and that will continue to be a successful motion for us as we march on to our hard goals in 2023.","Operator","Thank you.

Let me turn the call over to Marc.","Marc Benioff","Hey, thanks, David, for the world's largest IR introduction. We're having an outstanding year of growth, and I'm absolutely delighted to share our second quarter results with all of you today. Revenue for the second quarter rose 34% from a year ago to $732 million, and constant currency revenue grew even faster at 37%. Just one year after surpassing a $2 billion annual revenue run rate, we now expect to break through that $3 billion annual revenue run rate threshold next quarter.  Pretty awesome. It was only a couple of years ago that I remember was on the phone with all of you talking about a $1 billion revenue run rate, and now we're at $3 billion.","Operating cash flow exceeded $130 million, an increase of more than 60% year-over-year. Operating cash flow is one of the very best measurements of success at salesforce.com, and I'm delighted to see this great result. Deferred revenue was more than $1.3 billion, which is up more than 40% year-over-year, and the dollar value of booked business on and off the balance sheet now tops $4.1 billion, up more than 50% year-over-year.","Given our strong financial results and pipeline of new business, we're thrilled to announce that we're once again raising our full fiscal year 2013 revenue guidance. The high end of our guidance puts us on pace to deliver a full year revenue growth rate of 34%.  Awesome. Since we first gave guidance in November last year, we have now raised our forecast for the year by more than $100 million. This is evidence of continued growth and execution at salesforce.com and the industry's move to social enterprise.","Salesforce.com is leading customers in their transformation to become social enterprises. Social enterprises are able to connect with customers, partners and employees in entirely new ways. And with our 6 product lines, the Sales Cloud, the Service Cloud, the marketing cloud, Salesforce Chatter, Work.com and Salesforce platform, our customers have the tools to create a true social front office and are revolutionizing the way they sell, service, market, collaborate, work and innovate.  You'll be hearing a lot about that at Dreamforce on September 18 to 21, but more on that later.","Salesforce.com is the clear leader in sales, service, marketing and cloud platforms. Our flagship, Sales Cloud, is once again the undisputed leader in Gartner's Magic Quadrant for Sales Force Automation this year, in cloud or on-premise.","The Service Cloud is also the undisputed leader in Gartner's Magic Quadrant for customer service and support in cloud or on-premise, and I'm thrilled to announce that the Service Cloud has broken through the $500 million annual revenue run rate milestone and is well on its way to go to $1 billion. Congratulations to our Service Cloud team for their outstanding execution.","And you will see at Dreamforce the Salesforce Marketing Cloud, the next $1 billion product line in the making. Gartner predicts that CMOs will soon outspend CIOs over the next 5 years as the social revolution sparks the biggest transformation that the marketing industry has seen since the birth of television nearly 60 years ago.","With the acquisitions of the 2 #1 social media marketing companies, Buddy Media and Radian6, salesforce.com is now the clear choice for brands to listen, engage, advertise and measure their social marketing programs in a whole new way. And Salesforce's Marketing Cloud already manages more than 10% of Facebook's ad spend.","The Salesforce platform has been our fastest-growing product line over the past year and will be our fourth $1 billion opportunity. It is the only solution rated by Forrester as a leader in every single platform-as-a-service category for coders and for business experts, for ISVs and for service providers. That's why developers today have coded more than 300,000 applications on our Force.com service and more than 2 million apps on Heroku, making the Salesforce platform the #1 platform for business applications.","As cloud, mobile and social go to the [ph] heart of salesforce.com social enterprise architecture, the possibilities for innovation are really endless.","Now let me share with you a few examples of new social enterprise wins from the quarter. Allergan, a growing multi-specialty health care company, is transforming the physician experience with the Sales Cloud, Service Cloud and Salesforce platform. They're building a private social network that are going to give sales and service reps a 360-degree view of the physicians they support. And by moving a number of its apps under the Salesforce platform, Allergan is now -- is delivering a unified brand experience to its global community of physicians on any browser, on any mobile device, across any network.","And Virgin America is one of the fastest-growing airlines in the country is consistently voted #1 for its customer experience. Virgin is a highly distributed workforce where more than half of its teammates, such as pilots and flight attendants, are constantly on the move. With Salesforce Chatter and Work.com, Virgin is creating a wall-to-wall employee social network to align, motivate and drive teammate performance across its entire workforce, and I'm looking forward to welcome their Chairman, Richard Branson, to Salesforce's Dreamforce on September 19.","Nestl\u00e9 is the world's leading nutrition, health and wellness company. They chose salesforce.com to connect more than 300,000 employees in what will be the largest Salesforce Chatter deployment ever. With Chatter, Nestl\u00e9 plans to drive a whole new level of employee collaboration from inside the office for any mobile device.","And Aeon is Asia's largest retailer, with thousands of supermarkets, drug stores and other shopping outlets. They're transforming the supply-chain experience by connecting thousands of suppliers, distributors and employees in a partner social network with the Salesforce platform and the Sales Cloud.","In addition, Burberry expanded its relationship with salesforce.com in the quarter with a new Social Enterprise License Agreement. Burberry plans to transform the retail store experience for customers by standardizing its entire army of service professionals on the Service Cloud and extending it into the stores with its client selling app. Burberry also plans to use Salesforce's Radian6 to listen and engage with customers right where they are in social networks and will be using Site.com to allow teams to build web pages on the cloud. This complements Burberry's worldwide social enterprise network built on Chatter that's already been deployed to all of their employees.","Other new or add-on transactions in the second quarter included Axiom, Ashland, Cigna, KBDI, Levi's, Merrill Lynch, Office Depot and Vonage and much, much more.  In every one of these transactions, companies are becoming social enterprises by using our social and mobile cloud platforms to redefine their front office and to reposition their old enterprise software as their back-office solutions.","Look, there's no better barometer for customer usage than its success in delivering the number of transactions that Salesforce is doing each and every day. Our service continues to support and deliver transactions for customers at an unprecedented scale. Today, our customers have created 1 million workflow rules, which is an increase of 50% year-over-year; 2 million custom objects, which is up nearly 60% year-over-year; and nearly 3 billion lines of Apex Code, which is twice the number from a year ago.","And I'm delighted to announce that we delivered nearly 60 billion transactions in the quarter, up 66% from a year ago. That's about 900 million transactions every business day. Salesforce.com is now waiting with anticipation for its first billion-transaction day. That will be a huge milestone in enterprise cloud computing when Salesforce delivers 1 billion transactions in a single business day, and it's coming very, very soon.","In 3 weeks, salesforce.com will host Dreamforce 2012. It will be the largest event in the history of enterprise software. If you thought last year was unbelievable, wait and see what we have in store this year. We're expecting to reach over 100,000 total attendees, 70,000 registered on-premise attendees and over 30,000 attending online. Dreamforce takes place from September 18 to 21 right here in San Francisco.

And just as we heard on Kimberly-Clark's earnings call how salesforce.com was paramount in helping them to achieve next-generation revenue growth, we continue to see salesforce.com's customers grow at a much higher level than any other customer of any other software company.  In fact, salesforce.com's customers say that their revenue growth is, on average, 47% higher than their next-stage peers.","Join me on stage with a number of special guests talking about growth, innovation and execution at Dreamforce, which will include Richard Branson; Jeff Immelt; Angela Ahrendts; General Colin Powell; as well as a special appearance by motivational guru, Tony Robbins, who will run an entire day focused on how to transform yourself into the next-generation social enterprise; and our musical guest, the Red Hot Chili Peppers.","We'll also be hosting the third annual benefit concert for the UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital on Thursday, September 20, which will feature 7-time Grammy-award-winning musical group, Lady Antebellum; and comedian Dana Carvey.

And also please catch me on Mad Money tonight with Jim Cramer in about an hour. I'll look forward to seeing you there.  And with that, let me turn this call over to Graham to discuss the financial details of our second quarter.","Graham V. Smith","Thank you, Marc. Well, we delivered another quarter of great operating results in Q2. In the face of significant FX headwinds, we posted strong year-over-year revenue growth, balanced with more than 200 basis points of operating margin improvement.  We also delivered outstanding operating and free cash flow in Q2. In fact, this is our best-ever second quarter cash flow result.","So let me take you through the financial highlights, starting with revenue. The second quarter revenue was $732 million, that was up 34% over last year and our sixth consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue growth in the mid-30% range. Excluding a foreign exchange headwind of $17 million, revenue grew 37% over Q2 last year. There's no other enterprise software company of our scale growing at this rate.","From a geographic perspective, we continue to deliver strong year-over-year revenue growth in each of our major regions. Revenue in the Americas grew 38% to $508 million. Revenue in Europe grew 40% on a constant currency basis and 22% in dollars to $125 million. And finally, revenue in Asia increased 28% in constant currency and 29% in dollars to just under $100 million.","So with our Q2 results, we achieved a number of regional milestones. We now have a $2 billion annual revenue run rate in the Americas. We have a $500 million annual revenue run rate in Europe and a $400 million annual revenue run rate in Asia.","In addition to solid new business growth, second quarter revenue was also assisted by our efforts to reduce attrition. Attrition continued its slow but steady decline in dollar terms and remains in the low teens on a percentage basis.","Moving to the income statement. Non-GAAP operating profit was up 60% over Q2 last year. This translated to improving non-GAAP operating margins of just over 200 basis points year-over-year, driven principally by improvements in G&A but also through better execution in sales and marketing.","It's worth noting that second quarter year-over-year operating margin comparison is apples-to-apples since the first anniversary of the Radian6 acquisition was at the beginning of Q2. We continue to grow headcount in the second quarter, adding 430 net new employees to bring our total employee population to more than 8,700.  That's up 38% from the second quarter last year. And as we look to Q3, we expect continued year-over-year headcount growth as a result of organic hiring and from our acquisition of Buddy Media, which will add about 300 new employees to total headcount in the third quarter.","Turning to earnings, non-GAAP EPS was $0.42 in the second quarter or $0.03 above the high end of our guidance range. While approximately half of our overachievement was driven by the improvement in our operating margin, EPS also benefited from a lower-than-projected share count.","Turning to cash flow, second quarter operating cash flow was $136 million.  That's up 64% over last year. An increase in accounts payable, partially offset by an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets, contributed approximately $15 million of benefit to operating cash flow in the second quarter. Even excluding this amount, it was still a strong cash quarter.","For the third quarter, we expect operating cash flow to be lower sequentially and year-over-year for several reasons: first, we expect the approximately $15 million benefit I just described will reverse next quarter, creating a roughly equivalent headwind in Q3; second, we will pay approximately $10 million as the final settlement for the California State wage and hour lawsuit we discussed during the second quarter of last year; and then, third, we expect the acquisition of Buddy Media to reduce operating cash flow by approximately $5 million. Nevertheless, with our strong Q2 and first half cash flow, we still expect full year operating cash flow growth in the low-20% range.","Cash and equivalents increased by more than $550 million in Q2, driven primarily by a shift from marketable securities as we prepared for the acquisition of Buddy Media. Accounts receivable, which was up 30% over Q2 last year, continues to be well managed, with DSO at 55 days, that's down from 58 days in Q2 last year.  And CapEx in the second quarter was approximately $29 million, that was down 35% over Q2 last year. The year-over-year decline in CapEx is really the result of the exceptionally high level of data center investments we made in Q2 last year.","For the second half of the year, we expect CapEx to increase meaningfully on a year-over-year basis, driven by new office build-outs and other leasehold improvements. These will be primarily related to our new space in San Francisco at 50 Fremont Street and new offices where -- we've opened in Chicago.","Free cash flow, which we define as operating cash flow less CapEx, was $107 million in Q2. That's up 182% over the second quarter last year. For the first half of fiscal 2013, free cash flow was up 83%.","Turning to the balance sheet. Deferred revenue in the second quarter was approximately $1.3 billion, that's up 43% over Q2 last year. And excluding a year-over-year foreign exchange headwind of approximately $26 million, deferred revenue actually increased 46% over the second quarter last year. And on a sequential quarter basis, in other words, going from Q1 to Q2, deferred revenue was impacted by foreign exchange headwinds of approximately $14 million.","Deferred revenue in Q2 continued to benefit from the shift toward annual billing that we've discussed on the last 2 calls as well as some of the large multiyear invoice we discussed in Q4. The benefit in Q2 was approximately $120 million. That's compared with a benefit of approximately $145 million in Q1 and approximately $155 million in Q4. We expect this sequential decline in dollar benefit to continue in Q3.","Excluding these invoicing benefits, second quarter deferred revenue grew by approximately 30% year-over-year, just as it did in Q1, and we expect a similar organic growth rate to deferred revenue in the third quarter. Looking ahead, given the effects I've already described, we now expect reported deferred revenue to grow slightly slower than the 43% growth rate we just reported in Q2.","Off-balance-sheet backlog or unbilled business that is booked on the contract but not yet invoiced was approximately $2.8 billion in Q2.  That's an increase of more than 50% over Q2 last year. Deferred revenue plus this unbilled backlog now exceeds $4.1 billion.","Before I talk through our Q3 and fiscal 2013 guidance, I just want to highlight the impact that the weakening euro is having on our financial results. The change in the euro-dollar rate from just 3 months ago has decreased our second half revenue outlook by approximately $10 million. As Marc mentioned earlier, we've increased the high end of our fiscal 2013 guidance range by $115 million since our Q3 call last year, including Buddy Media, while the euro-dollar rate change since November has reduced our full year revenue forecast by approximately $30 million.","In the context of these FX headwinds, we're delighted to be raising our full year revenue outlook to $3.025 billion to $3.035 billion, which represents growth of 33% to 34% over FY -- fiscal 2012 and, obviously, includes approximately $25 million from Buddy Media.","So we now estimate full year non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.48 to $1.51, which reflects our stronger second quarter results as well as the previously announced dilution in the second half from our acquisition of Buddy Media.","For Q3, we anticipate revenue in the range of $773 million to $777 million for year-over-year growth of approximately 32% to 33%, and we expect Q3 non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.31 to $0.32. All of the underlying assumptions for our non-GAAP guidance as well as our GAAP guidance and a complete GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation can be found in our earnings press release issued today.","So to wrap up, we had another great quarter with strong revenue and deferred revenue growth despite considerable foreign exchange headwinds. At the same time, we demonstrated the strength of our operating model by delivering significant operating margin improvement and cash flow growth. This momentum positions us well for a strong [indiscernible]","Before I turn the call over to the operator for Q&A, I just want to encourage you all to register for Dreamforce, where we will be holding our annual investment community forum. Contact David Havlek or the rest of the Investor Relations team for registration details.","With that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Rick Sherlund with Nomura Securities.","Richard G. Sherlund - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Marc, I'm curious at Dreamforce if we're going to hear a lot more about Rypple and your plans in the HR market. And I wonder if you could address whether it would be logical for us to assume that you're ultimately going to address the broader HR market and financials as well, if that's a logical extension of your business.","Marc Benioff","Thanks, Rick. At Dreamforce, we're going to be announcing Work.com, which is our rebranding and redevelopment of Rypple. You'll be seeing the kind of the new version of that and our direction there. You'll -- we'll also have with us Aneel Bhusri is the CEO of Workday, and you'll see how we are working hard to integrate with them to deliver a full HR suite to our customers between salesforce.com's Work.com system and Workday. And you'll also see Workday's integration with Chatter as well. We're very excited about our initial focus here into HR.","Operator","Our next question comes from Adam Holt with Morgan Stanley.","Adam H. Holt - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I guess my first question is for Marc. Marc, could you talk about what you saw from a large-deal perspective in the quarter and maybe give us an update on how some of the especially large transactions that you did in the fourth quarter and first quarter are ramping in terms of getting up and running?","Marc Benioff","Sure. The first thing that I'll say is, of course, salesforce.com is not dependent on any one type of transaction to make its quarter happen. We have a rich and full portfolio across small, medium and large business as well as small, medium and large transactions. Salesforce.com had an outstanding quarter in large transactions. We profiled some of those, including Allergan and Virgin and Nestl\u00e9 and others. And we also closed a very large transaction, in fact, one of our very largest transactions ever, with a large networking technology company, which consisted of both a very important renewal plus an extremely large additional ACV or what we call first-year contract component, and so it was really a great quarter for large transactions.","Operator","Our next question is from Brad Zelnick with Macquarie.","Brad A. Zelnick - Macquarie Research","Can you give us some insight into how signings performed from small business, medium business and large enterprise and of the 3, whichever performed least favorably? Is there anything that you could have done better there?","Marc Benioff","We saw really excellent performance across enterprise and medium business through all geographic regions, and we saw some softened sales in very, very small businesses in the U.S. that we think are related to the economy.  But as you can see, it didn't affect our total performance as an organization.","Operator","Our next question is from Walter Pritchard with Citigroup.","Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Marc, you mentioned the 10% of Facebook advertising is going through your recently acquired Buddy Media asset. And I'm wondering as you think about sort of your long-term role in the world, is that a role you wish to play sort of an intermediary? And I'm just curious how you're thinking about your need to build out more assets in the social space. It seems like it's kind of the wild, wild west at this point, and you've got a pretty good collection, there's others that are out there. Just curious how complete you view that solution at this point.","Marc Benioff","I'm really focused on how do we get the marketing cloud to $1 billion in revenue. And our strategy is really, first and foremost, to pick up the #1 asset in the social media marketing, which was Radian6, which we did a year ago. I think when we did that, that would -- made it really clear to everyone that we were going to be a player in marketing for the first time. That was driven primarily by our customers. You probably saw Dell and the Gatorade and even the American Red Cross all had built these social media command centers and started to promote them on YouTube and other vehicles and came to us and said, \"This is a company that you should be paying attention to.\" And we acquired the company for over $300 million. And as part of that transaction, we really started to look at what was happening on the total marketing space. After successfully integrating them a year later, we saw that there was going to be a consolidation in social media management. And our strategy was very simple, we had to once again acquire the #1 player and leave the #2 and the #3 and the #4 player to others, and we did that with Buddy Media. And by putting those 2 #1 players together and 2 outstanding leaders, with Michael Lazerow and Marcel Lebrun, we were able to reconceptualize what those 2 products now have created, which is really a 1 plus 1 equals 3. And we'll demonstrate for that for the first time at Dreamforce. Now as you probably know, just before we acquired Buddy Media, they had acquired Brighter Option, which is a major visionary in terms of how ads will be acquired and placed in social media. And you'll see that as a strategic part of our marketing cloud. Now in terms of that as part of the marketing cloud, we believe that CMOs are going to want their own cockpit to fly, their own fighter jets, because honestly, CMOs are going to start spending much more than CIOs in technology. IBM has said that, a lot of companies have said that. We agree with that and we want to invest so that we can take advantage of that spend. But what no one has delivered yet is really that cockpit for the CMO and for all those marketers integrated with the sales and service solutions so that companies can have a total 360-degree view of their customer from advertising to close.  And we're going to offer that solution at salesforce.com. We're already #1 in sales. We're already #1 in service. It's very clear to everyone, I think, we're going to be #1 in marketing, and of course, we're #1 in business platform. These are really our 4 major strategic growth levers for the company, and then it's complemented by our support of Chatter and collaboration and our entry into work.","Operator","Our next question is from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs.","Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Marc, I wanted to follow up, you said you're focused on getting the marketing cloud to $1 billion. I guess given -- I was wondering if you could share with us how much evangelism do you think it takes to get to that $1 billion level? And secondly, do you think -- is that partly when you put the collection of assets together, including Buddy Media, including Radian6, is that kind of the type of evangelism that you need is showing kind what the full suite could look like, whereas that wasn't a possibility in the past, for one person to offer everything?","Marc Benioff","Well, Heather, if you go to our website, you'll see yesterday, we started to roll out the next generation of our home page, which is the next generation of our positioning. And you'll see how sales, service and marketing are at the core of how salesforce.com positions itself. First and foremost, Heather, you know that we've made a dramatic investment over the last decade in building out really the single most productive Salesforce in enterprise cloud computing. And that Salesforce is able to sell a lot of different types of solutions. We've demonstrated its ability to sell sales solutions. We've demonstrated its ability to sell service solutions, and we believe this year we have already started to demonstrate its ability to sell marketing solutions. We have to be able to sell to that chief sales or chief revenue officer. We have to be able to sell to the chief service officer. We have to be able to sell to the chief marketing officer, and we have to be able to sell to the chief information officer. And when you get to Dreamforce, you'll be surprised to see how many chief executive officers are there. In fact, many chief executive officers of our customers already signed up to come to Dreamforce, including, as I mentioned, Richard Branson, and even Jeffrey Immelt is coming in a nonpaid capacity to talk about the transformation that GE is making into a social enterprise. And we will demonstrate for the first time how General Electric's aircraft engines are integrated into Salesforce's Service Cloud and Sales Cloud to offer a complete picture to their sales professionals and service professionals on how their technology is operating, and they're going to talk about how that's made them more efficient or, what they say, how it lets them start to speak machine for the first time. And we think that this is the transformation that all companies are going to have to go through, and we're leading that. And I don't think we can make that transformation without marketing. And that's why we've made the investment in marketing. We've made the bets, and we are now executing. It's not going to happen overnight, but it's also not going to take that long, honestly. And I fully expect that, just as today we announced that we're over $500 million annual revenue run rate on service and well on our way to $1 billion in the Service Cloud, very shortly, we'll be talking about the same kind of numbers with the marketing cloud.","Operator","Our next question is from Brent Thill with UBS.","Brent Thill - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","On Europe, you've showed the third quarter of accelerating constant currency growth. If you could just maybe give us a sense of what you're seeing from a bookings perspective and with the dynamics helping shape the great performance in Europe.","Marc Benioff","One year ago, we made a dramatic management shift in Europe, where we brought in the #2 from Oracle, Miguel Milano, to be our President of Salesforce Europe, and he has done a phenomenal job. And we're extremely excited about the performance of our European organization, and we really expect a continued delivery in Europe through the year. Our pipeline in Europe has never been more exciting, and our ability to do -- talk to and work with the largest European organizations has really -- has never been as confident as it is today, and we're continuing to invest. And in countries that we have not had a presence that are significant IT-oriented countries, we've talked about this in the last 36 months, we have invested not only in the U.K., which has been an anchor for Salesforce in Europe, but we've also made major investments in France and Germany, and those are paying off. And that is the acceleration that you're seeing today. We, as you know, have shied away from countries like Spain and Italy, and we're really focused on the U.K., France, Germany and the Netherlands as the heart of our first stage of Salesforce's growth in Europe, and we're really getting ready for that second stage of growth. And as we prepare to add more countries in Europe, we will bring you online and explain that strategy to you.","Operator","Our next question is from Jason Maynard with Wells Fargo.","Jason Maynard - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I just have one question about your shift into the multiproduct company, especially with Service Cloud in its ramp [ph].  How would that impact as you go to market, and how are you dealing with partners when they are [ph] looking at the some of the largest system integrators today versus, say, a year or so ago?","Marc Benioff","Well, I really appreciate that question, Jason. Thank you. I don't see this as a shift, honestly. The way I see salesforce.com is we're a company that helps our customers connect with their customers, employees and partners in a whole new way. And many of our customers view us as the customer company. When they want to connect with their customers, they come to salesforce.com. And what I can tell you, Jason, is that means that we have to deliver sales, service and marketing as a complete solution to those customers so they can connect with their customers. And of course, our platform is primarily used for those types of applications, whether it's Heroku, which I know you're very familiar with, our Force.com platform or our Site.com platform. In all examples, customers use those platforms as customer connect. They are working to connect with their customers in a whole new way. Their customers are in new places. They're on Facebook. They're on Twitter. Or in the case of Kimberly-Clark, like they talked about on their earnings call, their salespeople need to go with iPad into their customer premises to sell them their products. In all cases, we're prepared to support our customers. And when we get to Dreamforce, we're going to be showing you the next version of Salesforce's platform, which is the Salesforce Touch platform. And the Salesforce Touch platform, you'll see at Dreamforce, we're going to go into general availability pilot on our core Salesforce automation application running in HTML5, on multiple devices, and you're also going to see that we are delivering a full set of services for our customers to build their own services in HTML5, so they can have heterogeneous device delivery. Now when you look at our competitors, whether it's competitors who deliver their own operating systems or whether it's competitors who are just specific to enterprise apps, none of them have done this platform transformation. That is not only how we delivered the first platform success, but we have now delivered our second major technology platform, which is our HTML5 platform. And you're going to see that delivered in our core apps as well as right out of our Force.com, Heroku and Site.com services as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kash Rangan with Merrill Lynch.","Kash G. Rangan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Marc, good growth rate in revenue. I was just wondering how we should think about the relationship between billings growth rate and revenue growth rate? Typically over the last quarters, most of your quarters, your billings growth rate has been faster than revenue growth rate. I'm wondering if there's any cross -- or maybe economic cross currents, larger deals being cut smaller, or maybe not. And maybe there's a shift to the marketing side of the business where the billings happens in a different way than the regular annual multiyear contracts. Just wondering how should we think about the relationship between these 2. That's it for me.","Marc Benioff","Well, Kash, I really appreciate that. You probably know we don't give billings guidance, and I wouldn't know how to answer that question specifically to you. What I can tell you is we're working hard to deliver a full range of transactions, but there's no transaction that has changed salesforce.com more than a transaction that we introduced at our last Dreamforce conference, which is our Social Enterprise License Agreement. That really redefined for our customer that they could sign an SELA with us and acquire all of our products in one concept: sales, service, marketing, platform all as one unit and without a focus on a per-user pricing. And we'll reveal at Dreamforce how many of these SELAs that we have signed, and I think everyone will be impressed to see so many customers, and so many customers in the room will sign SELAs with us. And I thing that's one of the core drivers of our growth. I mean, we had a great quarter, 37% on a constant currency. I don't think we could expect more than that, and I think we've got a killer strategy going forward as a customer company delivering sales, service, marketing, platform, collaboration and work to reconceptualize how our customers connect with their customers.","Operator","Our next question is from Brendan Barnicle with Pacific Crest Securities.","Brendan Barnicle - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","Marc, historically you guys have partnered around lead generation piece on the marketing side. Would you continue with that with -- as you build out this cockpit? Or is that something you feel like you need to have internal?","Marc Benioff","Well, that's a great question. When we look at a lot of the traditional marketing vehicles, like the lead-generation vehicles or the e-mail marketing vehicles, those are areas that we did not jump into, because we just didn't see the same rate of growth that we saw in social media marketing. And to that extent, we've mostly seen those companies be flat to modest growth and, in some cases, down. And we believe that fundamentally companies are moving away from e-mail as their marketing vehicle and lead nurturing, away from lead nurturing as their marketing vehicles and towards social media management. And that's why we're excited. Now I'm not saying that we won't include at some point e-mail and lead nurturing into our marketing cloud. If that's what our customers want, make no 2 ways about it, we'll deliver it to them. But right now, it's through partnerships. And one of the great things that Salesforce has developed is the AppExchange. If you go to the AppExchange, you're going to see thousands of pre-integrated applications into these services, all of our services: sales, service, marketing, platform.  The AppExchange has a full range of those capabilities, and you're going to see an awesome, awesome range. There's been over 1.4 million installations of applications from the AppExchange, and it's been a heart of how we deliver value to our customers. And that's a way right there that we're already delivering that lead capability.","Operator","Our next question is from Karl Keirstead with BMO Capital Markets.","Karl Keirstead - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","I've got a question for Graham. Graham, I wonder if you could update us on the invoicing duration shift at salesforce.com. I think you mentioned in the last couple of quarters that the percentage of new billings billed on a 12-month cash pre-pay basis might be about 2\/3. I'm wondering did it inch up again in the July quarter? Has it peaked? And have you seen any kind of pushback on a full annual prepaid, given the weaker economy?","Graham V. Smith","So first, no, it's actually really gone very well. We've seen very bold acceptance from our customers, and clearly, there are always a small number of exception cases that I get involved with. And remember, I have to approve all the exceptions to this personally, so I'm able to sort of get a sense of how this is going very directly. We've seen a very consistent shift, actually, over the last few quarters.  So looking at whether we look at Q4 or Q1 or Q2, the overall shift has been around 5 percentage points to annual away from semiannual, quarterly, monthly. So that's sort of the shift, and certainly, as you say, we're right around 2\/3 annual in most quarters. As you know, that goes a little above 2\/3 in Q4 because we have more large annual contracts typically in the fourth quarter, but roughly a 5-point shift for the last few quarters since we've initiated the program.","Operator","Our next question is from Terry Tillman with Raymond James.","Terrell Frederick Tillman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Graham, also had a question for you in terms of this unbilled deferred revenue number. I'm assuming -- I mean, it looked good, extremely well, actually, year-over-year, up 50%. You added $100 million sequentially in unbilled deferred revenue. Now that is down from the $500 million you added last quarter. Maybe you could kind of reconcile that. And then as we go forward with these Social Enterprise License Agreements, is this actually a metric that's going to jump around quite a bit and be volatile?","Graham V. Smith","Sure. In terms of the off-balance sheet backlog, I mean, that number is going to -- the sequential change is going to be up and down. So for example, in Q1, we had our largest transaction ever and at that point, we renewed our largest customer ever for multiple years. And so some quarters, we'll have a very large replenishment into that backlog. And then some quarters, we won't get quite as much. And again, we disclosed that as an approximate number just to give people a sense for what we have contracted. It's not meant to be a super-precise number. And then the second question you had was around SELAs and are we going to see volatility. I mean, I'm not sure if you mean the number of SELAs we're signing. I think, obviously, we've been, as March outlined earlier, we're very pleased with our large transactions each quarter. Certainly, this quarter was a great quarter, and we outlined some of those on the call. And in terms of pricing, again, we've seen very, very consistent pricing over the last 8 quarters, that's kind of the window I look at for all of our major additions and geographies and sales segments, and we see very consistent pricing level. So we don't see volatility there at all.","Operator","Our next question is from Tom Ernst with Deutsche Bank.","Thomas Ernst - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just a quick follow-up on -- so you took us through the 300-basis-point hit essentially due to foreign exchange -- excuse me, 300-basis-point hit due to the change in billing terms on a sequential basis to a billings calculation. How much would it have been for just the foreign exchange? I think you only gave us the year-on-year change.","Graham V. Smith","No, we gave you 2 numbers. We gave you the sequential change, which was $17 million. That was the headwind sequentially on deferred revenue -- sorry $14 million, I beg your pardon, and year-over-year is $26 million. So we gave you both those numbers, foreign exchange impact on deferred revenue.","Operator","Our next question is from Robert Breza with RBC Capital Markets.","Robert P. Breza - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Graham, I guess, just quickly, as you think about foreign currency going forward here, obviously, it was a major headwind here. How should we think about it going into the kind of the second half of the calendar year and how you guys are looking to offset that?","Graham V. Smith","Well, as I mentioned earlier, we've essentially absorbed a, roughly, $10 million headwind in the new guidance range that we put out today. So we've sort of -- we've tried to incorporate what we see as the likely FX environment for the second half. And we, obviously, each quarter, when we give guidance, we kind of take a small hedge against where the rates are. But clearly, this quarter, rates moved a lot. So clearly, we try and build in a reasonable assumption around FX rates for the second half when we give guidance. And we, obviously, just try to do the best job we can in this very, very volatile environment.","Operator","Our next question is from Tom Roderick with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Tom Roderick - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Graham, I want to follow up on Karl's question earlier, just around this deferred billings adjustment. I realize you're getting into the weeds here just a little bit. But I wanted to understand just your perspective on how this plays out for the rest of the year, because it does look like it was about just under a 400-basis-point impact to the calculated billings number this quarter. So it looks like next quarter, it moves down a little bit again, but as you lap the annual effective of beginning this adjustment or this move to collect annually in Q4, is there any reason to think that goes off a cliff? Or conversely, is there any reason to think that the annual renewal cycle moves that number in the opposite direction, meaning that it could go back up?","Graham V. Smith","So I don't want to, obviously, as you say, get too far down in the weeds. I think when we -- when this anniversaries in the fourth quarter, we would certainly expect the magnitude of the sort of reconciling items we've been talking about to diminish. However, I think we're going to continue to see a shift toward annual billing for at least the next 18 to 24 months from now. We still have plenty of customers. As I mentioned, we've got roughly 2\/3 paying us annually, and the other 1\/3 are paying us either semiannually and quarterly and then a small number monthly. We've still got all of those customers at some point to renew, and we will, obviously, be encouraging them to move to an annual bill frequency, too. So I think this will play out positively over the next 18 to 24 months. But clearly, as you say, when it anniversaries in the fourth quarter, the magnitude of those reconciling items is going to decrease.","Operator","And your final question for today will come from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays.","Raimo Lenschow - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just a quick one on the competitive landscape. Obviously, your big push is coming on the Service Cloud at the moment, and that's where we're hearing from the field there's a lot of positive dynamic there. How is it right now doing now that's part of Oracle? And part of the reason for the purchase is, obviously, to stem that outflow of Siebel customers towards you. Do you see any change there already?","Marc Benioff","We haven't seen any change so far in the dynamics with our Service Cloud besides its outstanding performance for the year. The #1 change that's happened in customer service and support for the year is that salesforce.com moved into the position of absolute leader with Gartner. That was incredible for us, but it's been reflected as well in the market. Customers call Gartner and ask them which products they should buy. And they review the strengths and weaknesses of each product with them, starting with salesforce.com as absolutely the best product in customer service and support, whether it's in the cloud or on-premise. And we have seen so many exciting customers now deploy that product. I was recently on a Procter & Gamble website myself getting some technical information about one of their products that I use. And in fact, up came our Service Cloud, and I was really proud of our entire team. But not as proud as I was to see them go by the $500 million revenue run rate, which was larger than, perhaps, any other customer service and support solution in the market today. And I know they are well on their way to $1 billion in revenue. The growth rate has just been outstanding. The technology is outstanding. And whether it's sales where we're #1, service where we're #1, marketing where we're #1 and\/or on our business platform, salesforce.com dominates the cloud. And we have a great strategy to make sure that our customers have all the tools that they need to connect with their customers and drive top line growth. And in every discussion that I have with a chief executive officer, that's their #1 goal, to have a customer obsession and to grow their companies.  And salesforce.com is doing that. And that's why I am so excited coming into Dreamforce. We're really coming in hot based on all these great technologies that we have and clarity on our strategy and alignment with customer demand. So we're going to look forward to seeing you there.  On September 19 will be my keynote, at 9 a.m. And we've got a great concert that night with the Red Hot Chili Peppers. The next day, we'll be doing some incredible technology programs. Also on September 20, we're going to be doing our Analyst Day, as David said. I hope I'll see all of you there. That night, we've got our Children's Hospital benefit concert with Lady Antebellum. And then Friday is Tony Robbins day at Dreamforce, and if you want to be motivated and excited at a level that you've never been before, we're going to see you on Friday, September 21 for Tony Robbins day. It's going to be like nothing you've ever seen at a technology event. All right, and back to David.","David Havlek","All right, well great. It sounds like Marc has given the final Dreamforce advertisement. I expect to see everybody there, and I will be taking names for those of you who aren't there.","Just a couple of other events you should be aware of where Salesforce will be appearing. Graham Smith will be presenting at the Citi Technology Conference in New York on September 4. Marc will be keynoting at the Deutsche Access Conference in Las Vegas on September 13.

At constant currency, revenue grew faster at 30%. Operating cash flow exceeded $280 million for the quarter also an increase of more than 30% year-over-year and deferred revenue grew to more than $1.7 billion also up 30%. Based on these great results, we\u2019re raising our full fiscal 2014 revenue guidance which we project at $3.835 billion to $3.875 billion and will roll on our way to first $1 billion quarter.","In addition, I\u2019m thrilled that after a decade of growth and market share gains, Gartner announced this quarter that Salesforce is now the largest CRM platform in the world. We\u2019ve displaced SAP to become the number one CRM market share leader regardless of On Premise or Cloud, Salesforce is number one. I\u2019d like to congratulate all of our employees, our customers; our shareholders on this important achievement of become the number one CRM company.","Salesforce has always been a catalyst and evangelist for innovation and enterprise software. We pioneered the shift to cloud, to social, to mobile and today with this next generation of technology, our customers are connecting with their customers in entirely new ways. They are becoming customer companies and they\u2019re transforming for managing systems record to systems of engagement and we\u2019re leading the way. With our full product lines, the Sales Cloud, the Service Cloud, the Marketing Cloud and the Salesforce Platform, customers have the tools to become customer companies and unlock greater levels of growth, innovation and success. That\u2019s why our customers have made us the clear leader in each of our four core markets.","First, our flagship Sales Cloud is the number one app for sales teams helping customers to drive phenomenal sales productivity and top line growth. It\u2019s the only sales platform with built-in tools motivating line teams through Work.com and continuously refresh company and contact information through Data.com and with the latest release of Salesforce Chatter customers can access sales clouds records and files right from their mobile devices.","The new Chatter mobile app is available now from the Apple app store and from Google Play and I recommend that you download and see this incredible new vision of how CRM works in the mobile environment. The Service Cloud is the world\u2019s number one app for customer service and support and it\u2019s the only service platform that ties customer service with sales and social.","In the quarter, we announced our latest Service Cloud mobile innovations including mobile co-browsing, mobile communities, mobile chat and a touch based agent interface and are divided down to just last week. Gartner named Salesforce the clear leader in both vision and execution in the most recent Magic Quadrant for Customer Service. And if you didn\u2019t already know SAP continue to fall behind in the challenge of Quadrant which is why more SAP customers move to Salesforce in the quarter than ever before.","The Marketing Cloud is the world\u2019s number one app for sales, social marketing and the only marketing platform that seamlessly connects with sales and service. Marketers want a unified platform to listen, to publish, to engage, to advertise and giving them the power to target individuals of scale, that\u2019s why we want social.com the quarter, the filtered only advertising app that ties ad campaigns on Facebook and Twitter with real time customer and social listening data.","Social.com is already managing 500,000 social ad campaigns for customers and is Facebook\u2019s largest advertising partner today. The Salesforce Platform is the world\u2019s number one enterprise cloud platform and it\u2019s the only platform with social and mobile built right into the core. Customers while having a fast and easy development platform to go next generation apps that instantly work on any mobile device and with the launch of new mobile services in the quarter including developer mobile packs and Salesforce Mobile SDK, Salesforce then accelerate mobile app for all of our customers.","In addition, we\u2019re filled with attraction of our ISI ecosystem and we\u2019ve doubled the number of ISVs in the app exchange since the first quarter of last year. The combination of our customer company vision and our clear leadership within each of these core markets is what\u2019s driving our success with customers today. That\u2019s why we continue to close some of the most exciting and strategic transactions in the industry. I am thrilled to announce that we closed on our key transactions a quarter, which have been small and medium enterprise agency, a government agency that serves more than 3 million companies nationwide.","We have new partnership with Japan\u2019s government, Salesforce platform and Chatter will touch nearly aspect of the agencies engagement with millions of SMEs. Companies are going to tap in the online marketplaces with service professionals, like attorneys and tax advisors and by connecting Japan to SMEs to each other and information real-time, Salesforce is helping us critical Japanese agency, bolster competition, innovation, and growth in this phenomenal time into the Japanese economy. This continues our commitment to partner with the Japanese government as our most important and largest customer.","And on May 28 at our customer company tour in Tokyo next week, you\u2019ll be hearing more from me about how this agency plans to create millions of SMEs together so onto the Japanese governments first, social business collaboration network. We are thrilled to have you join me in Tokyo. Also on May 28, I\u2019ve been selected to deliver a key note to government leaders at the U.S., Japan, counsel symposium along with U.S. ambassador, John Roos and I hope I look forward to see you there. We continue to deliver tremendous success with companies like General Electric where we had great momentum with major divisions including GE Capital, GE Oil & Gas, GE Energy, GE Power and Water, GE Transportation, GE Aviation and now GE Healthcare joining the Salesforce family.","GE Healthcare is the world\u2019s biggest maker of medical imaging equipment. They are standardizing on Salesforce as their global CRM platform and by connecting their entire front office team directly to the millions of physicians and hospitals they serve. GE will be fueling an order level of customer intimacy. Another great win in the quarter is Toms Shoes. In the quarter Tom selected Service Cloud, Marketing Cloud and Chatter to build the central hub for his entire team of service agents and listen, engage and service customers wherever they are.","While they are great for large companies, we are great for small and medium companies too. And by linking of SAP and Oracle back office systems with Salesforce, Toms would be able to arm agents with a full view of the world that is around each and every customer. In everyone of these examples, companies are transforming their business of Salesforce\u2019s next generation technologies. Our ability to deeply integrate our cellphone and mobile front office solutions with legacy back office systems like Microsoft, SAP and Oracle is helping many of our customers transform into customer companies.","Our other new or add-on transactions in the first quarter included Belkin and Bristol-Myers, Cree, Metso, New York Life, Novartis, Panasonic, and (inaudible) and we continue to crush the competition in the quarter against Microsoft and own significant new or add-on business in companies like Jonathan Press, KDDI, LodgeNet, McGraw, Old Mutual, Regence, and TalkTalk. Against Oracle we won at Baxter, VP, DirectTV at ING at National Australia Bank at NTT, at Virgin and against SAP at Deloitte, Fujitsu, at Juniper, and Lenovo and Millipore, Nokia, Sony, Toms Shoes, (inaudible) HANA, Home Depot and the list goes on. The pace at which these are companies are embracing our social and mobile cloud technologies is phenomenon.","During this last quarter, we passed our first 1 billion transactions day, and already in this quarter we\u2019ve delivered an average of 1.2 billion customer transaction each and every business day, that speaks more to the value of Salesforce. Then the actual usage of our products with the speed, reliability interest that we\u2019ve become known for.","In closing I\u2019d like to invite all of you to join me at one of our customer company tour events to see our new products, to hear our new message, to visit with the customers and prospects we\u2019re making these decisions, I\u2019m transforming our industry into the cloud and seeing why Salesforce has become the number one CRM provider in the world. You could join me in Tokyo or Sydney, Australia on May 28 and S\u00e3o Paulo Brazil on June 11, and New York City on June 14 and Rotterdam on June 18, and Toronto on June 19 and at Munich, Germany on July 2.","More than 15,000 customers across 11 cities have already tendered or sold out customer company tour events. And we hope to see you at one of them soon, so you can feel the energy, the excitement, the momentum and the growth and what\u2019s driving Salesforce into this incredible new position as the world\u2019s largest customer company.","I\u2019m also thrilled to announce that registration for Dreamforce 2013, the world\u2019s largest technology vendor conference has opened today. We expect more than 120,000 registered attendees to join us in San Francisco from November 18 till 21 and I look forward to seeing you there.","With that, let me hand it over to our Chief Financial Officer, Graham Smith.","Graham Smith","Thank you, Marc. We delivered another solid quarter in Q1 with strong year-over-year revenue, deferred revenue and operating cash flow growth. Our success during the quarter was driven by continued demand across all of our cloud solutions supported by further declines in attrition.","Let me take you through these another highlights from our first quarter results, starting with the income statement. Q1 revenue was $893 million, that\u2019s up 28% over last year, excluding an approximately $10 million FX headwind, first quarter revenue was up 30% year-over-year.","Looking at year-over-year growth on a regional basis, revenue in the Americas grew 30% to $631 million. revenue in Europe grew 38% in dollars, and in constant currency to $163 million and revenue in Asia increased 7% in dollars and 17% in constant currency to $99 million.","As I mentioned previously, our dollar attrition continued its steady decline in the first quarter and is now in the low double-digit percentage range. Our first quarter non-GAAP gross margin was 80.2%, that\u2019s about a 160 basis points lower than Q1 last year. Our first quarter non-GAAP operating margin was 10.5% or about 100 basis points lower than last year, leading to the first quarter non-GAAP operating income of $94 million, that\u2019s up 18% over the last year.","Our results in Q1 included an approximately $8 million charge for an IP licensing agreement, which was recorded in costs per revenue. This represented about 90 basis points of margin dilution in the quarter. We added more than 480 new employees in Q1, bringing our total head count to 10,300, that\u2019s up 23% over Q1 last year.","Turning to EPS, non-GAAP EPS was $0.10 for the first quarter. the licensing agreement charge that I just mentioned represented approximately $0.01 of GAAP and non-GAAP EPS.","Turning to cash flow, first quarter operating cash flow was a record $283 million, up 33% over the first quarter of last year. We continue to expect full-year growth in the low 20ish percent range.","CapEx in the first quarter was $54 million, up 20% over Q1 last year. CapEx continues to be primarily driven by new office buildouts related to our growing employee base and remain flat year-over-year to approximately 6% of revenue. Free cash flow which we defined as operating cash flow less CapEx was $229 million in the first quarter, that\u2019s up 36% over Q1 last year.","Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with approximately $3.1 billion in cash and marketable securities, up from approximately $1.7 billion last year. As you\u2019ll recall in the first quarter, we successfully closed a $1.15 billion convertible senior note. Accounts receivable was up 35% over the last year to $503 million.","Deferred revenue ended the first quarter approximately $1.7 billion, that\u2019s up 30% over Q1 last year. Excluding a year-over-year FX headwind of approximately $18 million, deferred revenue increased 31%. On a sequential quarter basis, deferred revenue was reduced by an FX headwind of approximately $16 million.","In addition, please recall that in our most recent fourth quarter we build and collected an approximately $30 million invoice, that was initially build as new business early in the first quarter of fiscal 2013. This also created a sequential headwind to deferred revenue in the first quarter. Deferred revenue continue to benefit from the shift toward annual billing were just under 70% of all invoices in Q1 issued with annual terms, this was about five percentage points higher than Q1 last year.","The dollar benefit to deferred revenue from the shift to annual invoicing together with multiyear invoicing was approximately $100 million, that\u2019s down from $145 million at the end of Q1 last year. Unbilled deferred revenue or revenue that is contracted, but not yet invoiced and is off the balance sheet was approximately $3.6 billion in Q1. That\u2019s an increase of 33% over Q1 last year.","Before I turn to our guidance for the second quarter and full-year, I want to highlight the impact of foreign exchange particularly the Yen is having on our financial results. We\u2019ve had great success in Japan and today our Japan subsidiary represents approximately 6% of total corporate revenue. When we updated our fiscal 2014 guidance in February, the Yen was around 92 to a U.S. dollar. This week, the Yen dollar rate has been in the 101 to 103 range, devaluation of about 10%. In fact, the Yen has been the fastest [growing] major currency in the world this year.","This and other currency fluctuations have reduced our full-year revenue outlook by approximately $35 million, including the $10 million in Q1 that I mentioned earlier. As a reminder, FX rates impact not just revenue, but also operating margins, deferred revenue, and cash flow. So with that context, we are pleased to be raising our full-year revenue outlook to $3.835 billion to $3.875 billion for growth of 26% and 27%.","Taking into account a difficult FX environment and the IP licensing agreement charge, we are also pleased to maintain our full-year non-GAAP EPS guidance in the range of $0.47 to $0.49. This range assumes a full-year effective non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 35% and no mean for contribution from below the line interest or other income and expense.","For Q2, we anticipate revenue in the range of $931 million to $936 million for growth of 27% to 28%, and we expect non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.11 to $0.12. We expect second quarter year-over-year operating cash flow in the mid to high teens percentage range, and then in addition we expect Q2 CapEx as a percentage of revenue to be approximately 11%, that\u2019s a little high than normal, it\u2019s due to the phasing of new office build outs, increased data center investments, and the capitalized portion of the previously mentioned IP licensing agreement.","For the full year, we expect CapEx as a percent of revenue to be about 7%, which is in line with previous year. We anticipate reported year-over-year deferred revenue growth in the mid to high 20% range. As Marc mentioned earlier, Three Force is being held in the fiscal fourth quarter. For modeling purposes, this will affect EPS, linearity for the year as we expect Three Force to reduce non-GAAP EPS by approximately $0.02 to $0.03 in the fourth quarter. As a reminder, Three Force was in our fiscal third quarter last year. All of the underlying assumptions through our GAAP and non-GAAP guidance, a complete GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation to be found in our earnings press release issued today.","So to conclude we kicks off fiscal 2014 with a solid first quarter delivering strong revenue, deferred revenue, and operating cash flow growth, our dollar attrition continues to decline is now the lowest level since we began measuring it more than three years ago. We continue to see strong demand across all of our cloud solutions and are well positioned to deliver another great year of growth. So with that, we\u2019ll open the call out for questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Your first question is from Brent Thill with UBS. Please go ahead with your question.","Brent Thill \u2013 UBS","Hi, great. Marc I was curious if you could just give us your view on the next steps for the Marketing Cloud and if you could also address with Social.com as you mentioned, your pricing is now based on the percent of the ad spend a little different than your past pricing model. Can you talk about \u2013 should we expect more changes going forward in some of the pricing methodologies that you\u2019re unveiling some of the new products going forward? Thank you.","Marc Benioff","","Well, thanks very much for that question. An area where I spent a lot of my time, initially say how I look at this, strategically. number one, Salesforce is now the number one CRM Company in the world. I mentioned that in the script, and that\u2019s an incredible accomplishment for the company. And for us to continue to be number one in CRM world, it means that we have to be number one in three main areas. One, we have to be number one in sales, which we are, and if you can see the new Gartner Magic Quadrant in sales it\u2019s clear as they were number one.","And it\u2019s not any clear, and then if you get the new Magic Quadrant for our customer service and then support and customer engagement that just came out about a week or two ago now. It\u2019s credible market in customer support. we\u2019re number one in service. And that has been an incredible journey, it\u2019s been a fight, it\u2019s been tremendous accomplishment, and especially gratifying when we saw SAP got pushed into the challenge of Quadrant, as we assume this strong position in the Leader Quadrant. And that\u2019s very important to us. so, number one in sales, number one in service. And that\u2019s true in revenue, that\u2019s true in market share, and that\u2019s true in feature functionality.","Now, marketing is an area that we\u2019ve recently entered into, as you know. and it\u2019s not really an area that we\u2019ve gone through into organically or grow our own development, but we\u2019ve acquired our way into marketing, first by purchasing Radian6 and then by buying Buddy Media. Buddy Media had purchased just before, we bought them Brighter Option, which we then have rebuilt and now relaunched as Social.com. And by no means, are we number one in revenue, in marketing. This is the year-over-year marketing revenue well enter its nine digits for the first time and but it\u2019s not a $1 billion cloud yet.","It\u2019s a $100 million plus cloud and our goal is to be number one in marketing, but we realize that to be number one in marketing, we\u2019re going to have to achieve more than $1 billion in revenue in that cloud and these not just number one in listening, not just number one in publishing, not just number one in social advertising but in a number of other key areas as well, I\u2019m strategically, I believe that this is very important to the company and so, I\u2019ve been spending a lot of my time, looking at this and we, you\u2019re going to see us experiment and try things and innovate in as you saw in acquisition which you\u2019ve seen us doing last two years, in pricing like you\u2019re seeing with Social.com, in features and functionality, in position and messaging like we\u2019ve seen us evolved into the customer company messaging.","And what that has meant to our customers is they\u2019re looking to us more and more and I advised you to the customer company tour, presentations, you can meet these customers and validate this but they look to us to help them understand how to connect with their customers in this kind of incredible new way. And our goal is to be the trusted advisor and to do that, it means that we\u2019re going to have to deliver world-class market functionality, we\u2019re focused on that, we\u2019re excited about that, not just in B2B, but in B2C as well and what you\u2019re seeing in those changes or in those pricing that you\u2019re asking about Brent is our innovative and ideas and experiments as we move from $100 million business in marketing, $1 billion plus business.","Operator","Your next question is from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.","Heather Bellini \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Hi, great. Good afternoon gentlemen. I was just wondering Marc, we have a good number of private companies telling us they\u2019re starting to write ease some very big checks for Force.com. I was wondering if you could talk about, what we should be expecting in that business, what type of milestone should be we looking for, I know you mentioned what you did in Japan this past quarter, but is there anything else you could share with us on kind of things we should use to benchmark the business?","Marc Benioff","Yes. There are \u2013 the way to look at this business, which we call the Salesforce platform, is the following way. First of all, where our customers were buying our sales or service or marketing products they\u2019re extending those products with applications that are customer centric and they are customizing, they are enhancing, they\u2019re configuring using the Salesforce platform, which includes Force.com, which includes our APIs, which includes Heroku, which includes Site.com, our website capability, which includes our app exchange where we have approximately 2,000 applications in there. And that stuff, they are extending and complementing the work they have done with sales, service and marketing.","Step two is, a lot of those companies are building their unique custom applications. And those applications are the applications that they need, the apps that they need to run their business. Used to be back in the day, the big companies by Sequel Server, Visual Basic Powerbuilder, sequel forms whatever it was to basically do structured and unstructured data management, and have rapid application development capability. We see those customers turning to our platform to get that same kind of capability rapidly. And we\u2019re very excited about the growth of that brings us, the stickiness that brings us with the customer by starting to manage their metadata, not just the data and delivering those next-generation apps.","And three, the AppExchange, you\u2019ve seen a number of really great ISV\u2019s converge on our AppExchange, many of them who are building natively on our platform. And these app, application companies, I mean just great, great, great companies some that are even going public now, I\u2019m sure you know, with native apps. And we could be more excited for them. And we\u2019re continuing to grow and also partner from a revenue and go-to-market perspective with a lot of those companies. And we have a whole Salesforce dedicated to selling to ISV\u2019s, to help them unify with our platform and to go-to-market to our customers.","And as these three things together that are working really well with the platform. The extending and complementing the CRM capabilities, building entirely new apps and a traditional app dev space, route space. And three, a platform for independent software to the vendors to build their own applications to target our customers or their own customers or to the big industries.","And if these three things have their together then you hear, for some of these what might look like very small companies riding us extraordinary checks as you said, but it\u2019s really because we become partners with them, much in a way that we are partners by the way was our key software vendors. Of course, companies provide us core technology that we write very large text to like Dell, or like Cisco, or like EMC, or especially Oracle, where it\u2019s very important for us to have a strategic relationship with them.","They were writing significant checks to them for their licensing, and then it\u2019s a very important part of our business. You\u2019ve seen that now 14 years of business we wouldn\u2019t be in business without those relationships with those vendors providing us our technology and in the same way that they fuel us and we write them the checks. Those ISVs then write big checks back to us. So, it\u2019s very much a symbiotic relationship between us and those customers or between us and our core vendors. And our job is that rising feel will raise all boats and that\u2019s the economy that you\u2019re getting feedback on today.","","Operator","Your next question is from Mark Murphy with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead with your question.","Mark Murphy \u2013 Piper Jaffray","Yes, thank you very much. Marc, how do you think about the scale of the opportunity in the long-term for becoming the customer company and offering the Force.com platform? And specifically, if you compare the size of that opportunity or that market to other markets such as human resources or financials, what do you think has a more profound impact on an organization between modernizing the front office or automating the back office and therefore what do you think is a bigger opportunity?","Marc Benioff","Well, I\u2019ve got two words for you which is transaction volumes. And I think that you see that with Salesforce, we make public, as you know. In nauseam, we\u2019ve talked about this. I don\u2019t got a revelation anybody on this call or in this room that we publish our transaction rates every single day.","But the reason that you don\u2019t see other vendors provide their transaction numbers is because they\u2019re actually quite low. Now, when we publish a transaction number, that\u2019s a complex transaction; it\u2019s a complex transaction that we deliver.","You saw that in the first quarter, we delivered 78.7 billion transactions in the quarter. And if you think about other cloud providers, who else is telling you how many complex transactions. Now, when I talk about a transaction, what I mean is as defined by the late Jim Gray who basically define in transaction as a complete unit of work in the computing model and the ability to not only to commit that transaction, which is a technical term, but also to be able to roll back that transaction into unit work.","And we\u2019re reporting that transaction number and we\u2019ve done that for quite a few years. I think that you can determine the value that a company is placing on its customers by the amount of data that it holds the amount of metadata that it holds and that is reflected most accurately in the number of transactions.","The transaction number is really the sum of all capabilities of the system and saying we\u2019ve delivered when we are on our way to delivering more than a 100 billion transactions in the quarter. Okay, what\u2019s another one that we follow closely tweets the way that really judge the success of Twitter is, of course, when they had a great quarter, I think it was almost $300 million for the quarter, they are a great customer of Salesforce to keep our eye on Twitter, and how do we manage Twitter, say transactions, we look at their transaction number how many tweets are happening in for Twitter. And in the same way, you can really look and you can track and graphing is quite analytical Salesforce\u2019s transaction number over a period of time.","So I will look to that and what I\u2019ve seen is, I continue to come back to an amount with customers constantly that\u2019s my job. This week I was in New York with dozens of customers and working with one of our \u2013 working with Bank of America\u2019s, one of our largest customers on their next generation. Systems are and it\u2019s all about their customer, you\u2019re following the customer and how do you \u2013 the path of organic growth for our customers is the work with their customers. And that\u2019s why we\u2019re right in the heart of all these companies\u2019 business. We want to help them grow their revenue. We want to help them grow their top line, and the way we are going to do that is by helping them optimize their sales, service, and marketing capabilities grow their channels, and as we do that, it\u2019s reflected in the transaction numbers.","So look, what is my call to arms? My call to arms is for all cloud ISVs to publish their transaction number on a quarterly basis just as we do, because it will give you more prospective on the stickiness and the intimacy and the integrity between the vendor and the customer. I hope that answers your question.","Operator","Your next question is from Brendan Barnicle with Pacific Crest Securities. Please go ahead with your question.","Brendan Barnicle \u2013 Pacific Crest Securities","Thanks. Hi, Marc, I wanted to follow-up on \u2013 it\u2019s been a while since the Rypple acquisition, and at that time you talked of sort of building a whole new class of apps that had more social integrated into them. I was wondering if you could give us a little more update on which of those have been most successful and sort of where you see that effort going.","Marc Benioff","Well, I of course, I\u2019ll talk about Rypple, which is now known as Work.com and if you haven\u2019t seen the new version of Work.com, it\u2019s phenomenal. We\u2019ve owned the company I think for just a little bit over a year now, a couple of incredible founders that joined our company from that company with Daniel Debow and David Stein.","And under the leadership of a tremendous executive in our industry, John Wookey here at Salesforce who is running that capability, as well as our GoInstant acquisition, which is also another phenomenal story underway. but in the case of these small acquisitions that we\u2019re doing like Rypple, like GoInstant and others, a lot of these are, what we are \u2013 acquisitions that we\u2019re going to acquire talent and it\u2019s a kind of extend and complement our capability.","The one that we really kicked all this off with was Jigsaw. You probably remember when we bought Jigsaw for about $150 million and I don\u2019t remember the exact amount. It\u2019s not in front of me obviously at the table. And of course we\u2019ve worked on that. We evolve the team. We evolve the products and the technology. We loosely coupled it into our architecture. We\u2019ve rebranded in Data.com.","And what this year Data.com had a phenomenal quarter they\u2019re probably going to \u2013 I think they\u2019re going to do more than $100 million this year. It\u2019s pretty exciting or approximately that. They\u2019re well on their way to doing that. And it\u2019s a great success story here at Salesforce and it\u2019s a commitment.","I have to tell you we\u2019re in quarter one or quarter two or even quarter five or six after buying a small company that\u2019s not when we\u2019re looking at is this a success or is this a failure. We want to get down the road, the year three or year four and that\u2019s really when we can really judge it. In our industry, people always overestimating what you can do in a year and they\u2019re underestimating what you can do in a decade and that is really true in these kind of technology acquisitions that we make.","Now don\u2019t make any mistakes, these are high risk moves when we buy a small company, there is a high risk that it\u2019s going to fail and exceed. We have to keep these founders in the boat and it\u2019s complex. But I\u2019ll tell you that we\u2019ve had a lot of great success and other great success in addition to Work.com, which is Rypple in addition to Data.com which was Jigsaw is the company called Heroku.","And Heroku has also had some incredible growth rate. It hasn\u2019t gotten yet to $100 million in revenue. We bought the company approximately 2.5 years ago for about $200 million to $250 million. It\u2019s a phenomenal piece of technology and they have just done a great, great job at Heroku, it\u2019s really become a great standard in the industry, it\u2019s huge extension to our platform and gave a lot of confidence to our customers that we\u2019re in the platform area.","In the same way getting back to your original question, Work.com has become a tremendous performance in productivity enhancer to our sales application. And we see customers who are buying the sales cloud look to Work.com as a way to motivate and align and compensate their sales organizations. And you will see in the new version of Salesforce. This summer I\u2019m not going to tip my hat too much, but the deep integration of Work.com into that next gen sales application.","We\u2019ve already seen us include some components of Work.com in the current vision of Salesforce and some customers have been able to deploy that. But soon all customers will be able to and it\u2019s given us a great vision for the future of our company, and I couldn\u2019t be more thrilled to have that group with us. They\u2019re based in Toronto, Canada, and they\u2019re doing a fantastic job. We want to keep them going fueled, and exciting. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from Nandan Amladi with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question.","Nandan Amladi \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question, question on the off-balance sheet backlog. That seem to have slowed a little bit. We\u2019re still up 33% year-on-year. But compared to where it was last year, was it tough comps or were there some other moving parts we need to understand?","Graham Smith","Sure. There\u2019s a couple of things. I think firstly, in Q1 last year, you\u2019ll recall that we signed a largest deal in the company\u2019s history that was signed in Q1 that added a big boost to the off-balance sheet, because it\u2019s multiyear agreement. And also, we renewed one of our largest customers Japan Post for several years, and that\u2019s also I think top five customers worldwide, and so those two transactions in the first quarter of last year made it kind of a tough comp.","And then secondly, I think over the last few years, we\u2019ve seen extension of our average contract length. We talked about that on our fourth quarter call that our average contract length is now just over two years, and at some point that the pace of that contract extension length will slow, and so that will provide a bit of a drag on that off-balance-sheet but it is still a very healthy growth rate of the tough comp. So we were happy with the number.","Operator","Your next question is from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.","Keith Weiss \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Excellent, thank you guys for taking my question and nice quarter. I just want to drill down on margins a little bit and one with a clarification, the licensing impact that was 90 basis points year-on-year on gross margins or operating margins?","Graham Smith","It\u2019s about the same, it\u2019s about $8 million on our revenue numbers, so it basically got the same 90 point impact on, its recorded in cost of sales, so it was in the gross margin number and it was also obviously in the operating margin number.","Operator","Your next question is from David Hilal with FBR. Please go ahead with your question.","Samad Samana \u2013 FBR","","Hi, this is Samad Samana for Dave. We\u2019ve been hearing lot of attraction in the government space; can you give us an update on the government focus and amongst your existing products where you see the biggest opportunity and which could be the most successful there?","Marc Benioff","Okay, yes, I will do that. As you know, Salesforce.com has not focused on the U.S. Government as a major opportunity over the last 14 years.","We\u2019ve been too emerged and amassed really in the commercial markets. It just has not been a major focus for us. A couple of years ago, we started to get much more excited about that opportunity and we really looked at how would we start to build and expand our capabilities.","What we realized was that that would require us to do a couple of things; one, bring in new leadership to focus on not only the U.S. government but also the global government opportunity, which includes the Japan government or the U.K. government et cetera, as well as a new technology capability which would be to build the government, we call it government pod; that is, to build a pod that is a special version of our product that would be accessible only to the government, and that would allow critical agencies that we saw becoming interested in our technology like the GSA for example or others to become more invested in using our technology.","We also had to bring in a new set of leadership and we hired Vivek Kundra who is our Executive Vice President of our Global Government business unit and he is based in Washington D.C. In addition to that, in addition to focusing upon building a new technology platform in addition to focusing on that next-generation leadership, we also recognized we had to spend a lot more time with the government and also do more marketing events in Washington D.C.","And just as an example, yesterday, we had more than 2,000 customers attend our Washington D.C. program. Now, in addition to that, you may know that about 60 days ago, I also personally led a program in Washington D.C. myself which was a sub-1,000 seminar focused on government agencies as well. Now, these are primarily federal agencies; this is not \u2013 this does not also include our work in cities and also in states or in foreign governments.","Overall, we see that as a tremendous opportunity for growth and we\u2019re continuing to invest there. And as you know, it\u2019s a long process, but we\u2019re very excited by our work in a number of agencies, in a number of states, in a number of cities and we\u2019ll be doing more to communicate that progress and success stories in the future. It\u2019s wide-ranging from automating the GSA, which is the government\u2019s determining arm to 311 call centers in a number of cities around the country to foreign governments, and I think a great example is Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry that we talked about today with METI and what\u2019s going on in Japan.","So all of those things together make us very optimistic about our work with the government in the future, and I do think that the government is ready to go to the cloud.","Operator","Your next question is from Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your question.","Phil Winslow \u2013 Credit Suisse","All right. Thanks, guys. A lot of focus has been put on obviously Force.com and the Marketing Cloud. But just wanted to focus back in on the Service Cloud, just curious what trends you are seeing there? Obviously, you\u2019ve had very strong momentum in the past, is that continuing? Then also competitively with write-down having been inside of Oracle for a bit, wondered if you could just talk about the competitive environment? Thanks.","Marc Benioff","I think that it\u2019s really fascinating the competitive situation, because in our industry CEOs like myself tend to basically have to predict the future or do their best to predict the future and then focus in certain areas.","And it\u2019s a great example is \u2013 of course, Microsoft is extremely focused on Windows 8. That\u2019s a huge part of their story. They\u2019re trying to save their operating system business and their Office business through Windows 8, which they\u2019ve seen Windows to accelerate very aggressively as the world has moved away from the personal computer and towards the phone and the tablet and with launching Windows 8 this year, Microsoft basically have said they want to be the Windows 8 company and that in all situations the answer is Windows 8.","That\u2019s true for SAP. You saw Sapphire last week and the main focus of Sapphire was HANA. The focus of HANA \u2013 this HANA application or that HANA implementation or even HANA in the cloud and SAP has said it\u2019s the HANA company. And Oracle, I know Larry extremely well. He has a very impressive piece of technology with Exadata and he is very much wants to be the Exadata company, he views that as the future of the database and the future of its applications, and I get that and Oracle wants to be the Exadata company.","But we don\u2019t want to be the Exadata company or the HANA company or the Windows 8 company, we want to be the customer company. We want to enable our customers to help their customers connect in a new way, and that is along the lines of sales, service and marketing and the development of a customer platform.","Number one, how do you market the customers when they are everywhere? Number two, how do you sell to customers as a team? Number three, how do you service the customers when they\u2019re everywhere? Number four, how do you build a customer platform? Number five, how do you transform the way that you work in the world of social and mobile? These are the five things that I\u2019m personally focused on each and every day at Salesforce.","And look, when I\u2019m working with customers in designing next-generation solutions, we\u2019re looking at doing that. Let me give you an example. This quarter, we had really enjoyed working with Frank Blake, he\u2019s the CEO of Home Depot, and his team on \u2013 they\u2019ve got incredible new business in roofing and sidings and windows, and they need new applications rapidly, and we want to help build those applications, and we want to help connect them with their customers and help them build the quotes and the orders and the sales and service systems for their RSW business, which they see as a tremendous opportunity going forward, and I agree.","And we have to get in there; we have to deliver with speed; that\u2019s critical for their future success. And we also have to build and deliver that technology in radically different form factors than we were delivering in just 24 months ago. So when we\u2019re working with our Home Depot in that environment, we\u2019re coming in against existing and mass competitors in that organization. Of course, they really work with every customer and every vendor in the industry.","We have to show that we\u2019re different, and the way we\u2019re going to show we\u2019re different is, we\u2019re able to take any device that they show us, rapidly deploy an application in that device and make it world-class and that\u2019s what we did with Frank and his team this quarter. And that\u2019s we have to reproduce in each and every situation around the world. And honestly, I think we\u2019re doing a great job of that. I think you\u2019re going to see \u2013 you saw some great new technology from us this quarter. If you haven\u2019t seen what we\u2019ve delivered on the app stores, it\u2019s incredible.","And this summer you\u2019re going to see some more amazing things. We\u2019re going to completely transform the CRM market, and by the time we get to Dreamforce, at the end of this year, I promise you, we will have completely transformed our vision and our core for CRM market and how we\u2019re operating and we\u2019re going to do in whether it\u2019s a user interface or application programming interfaces. And I\u2019ll tell you, it\u2019s not a focus of our competitors, because if you go and look at their conferences that are seminars, they\u2019re webinars, which I do, it\u2019s my job to do that, they\u2019re not focused in this area, they\u2019re focused in other areas. And you know what; they probably should be focused in other areas because that\u2019s their core.","But our core is the customer here at Salesforce. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on moving forward in sales and service and marketing and every day we want to move that technology down the field to make it more social, more mobile, more capable with Big Data, the ability to build and develop new next-generation communities, helping our customers become software companies like we just did with Home Depot in building these next-generation apps for them, get it deployed on the cloud and helping our customers build the next level of trust with their customers.","And those seven tenants and those things that we\u2019re doing every day, that is not what our competitors are doing. They\u2019ve got a different focus. You can read their earnings \u2013 you can attend their earnings calls and read their scripts. It\u2019s not what they talked about. So that\u2019s how I look at the competitor situation and that\u2019s why we\u2019ve become the number one CRM company in the world.","Operator","Your next question is from Jason Maynard with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead with your question.","Jason Maynard \u2013 Wells Fargo","Good afternoon guys. Marc, in your comments you\u2019ve made some really interesting points about the shift to engagement apps and this new customer company point of view. Can you maybe share your vision around how Chatter, the new mobile apps, and the UI changes drive that positioning change?","Marc Benioff","Well, I think it\u2019s a great question, and I\u2019ll tell you that I am not ready to spill the beans which I\u2019m very good at doing. What I\u2019ll tell you is that the world is changing faster than ever and in our industry it\u2019s no different. And you can really see it by what users are carrying with them when they even travel. I used to always have my laptop with me when I traveled, but now I mostly just have my phone.","And that\u2019s amazing to me. And I switch off between an iPhone and an Android device probably like a lot of people. Sometimes I have both with me. LTE networks have really changed this device performance everywhere I go in the world. And the phones are actually quite a bit bigger than they were just a couple of years ago, and I have seen some of the new phones that are coming, and they\u2019re all starting to stretch a little bit more towards the iPad.","I think that that is a very unusual and interesting change in our industry. It\u2019s subtle, but it is seminal. And the reason why it\u2019s seminal is, because it\u2019s not the focus of the enterprise that all of a sudden I feel there like go in the pocket of my jacket and run my whole company, but that\u2019s really my focus. My focus is and really has been that in the shift to mobility, which is way bigger than tablets and just phone \u2013 the billions and billions of devices are phones.","In the world of social, which is billions of users in the social world and the world of next-generation Big Data, which is a lot about the APIs that are coming out of all these systems that we have to reconceptualize what does it mean to manage and build and create compelling enterprise software. The things that we were building when we started our company, we said hey, why are all enterprise apps not like Amazon?","In 2010, we started to ask the question why our enterprise apps not like Facebook? Now, that was about a decade, but I can tell you that by the time that we get to \u2013 by the time that we get to Dreamforce, we have to build ask that same question. But in the same way that Facebook has reconceptualized their company and they run entirely on the phone. And they have these great new phone apps, which I use every day or Twitter \u2013 Twitter is another great example of phone apps. We have to be at that same level of acuity and excellence in that environment, not just for our fixed apps but in the ability to build and deliver custom apps, like I just referenced with some of these big customers.","And this transformation or kind of the re-platforming \u2013 we\u2019ve already re-platformed successfully a couple of times in the company, but I strongly believe we have to re-platform again in today\u2019s world.","I don\u2019t see the competitors doing that honestly. And I really think that we have to do it again and we\u2019re going to have to get ready to do it again because the market is changing. And it\u2019s exciting and I think it\u2019s getting bigger.","I think our ability to reach more users is out there, and we want to build or provide a broader solution that\u2019s agnostic across all operating systems and devices. That becomes the dominant applications that our customers use to manage their businesses.","To back to Heather\u2019s point that we want to have all of those apps right there in the palm of your hand and I think that we\u2019ve got it figured out and I think we\u2019re imminently ready to deliver the next-generation of our platform and our capabilities. Shinal we probably have time for about two more questions.","Operator","","Your next question is from Walter Pritchard with Citi. Please go ahead with your question.","Walter Pritchard \u2013 Citi","Hi thanks. Graham, I wonder if you could talk about deferred sales commission. If we look at the new deferred commissions on the cash flow that was actually down substantially year-over-year, but $32 million comes into about half of that. Can you talk about what the drivers of that number were?","Graham Smith","Well I think we still have some comparison issues with Q1 and Q4 of the previous year, where we had sort of really, really spectacular large transactions closing that drove very high commission payments to sales teams that were involved in those transactions and clearly we have a strong fourth quarter here but we didn\u2019t have some of these marquee transactions that really drive the big, big commission checks.","So I mean other than that, we haven\u2019t I would say year-over-year growth in terms of hiring is a bit slower this year versus the previous year but we haven\u2019t changed the comp plans particularly or anything like that. So I think it\u2019s really the profile and the distribution of the transactions that creates a lot of that change.","Operator","And your final question today comes from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Please go ahead with your question.","Raimo Lenschow \u2013 Barclays Capital","Thank you. My question, just a quick one on the regions, I noticed that Asia has been decelerating of the two quarters and is actually growing at a growth rate, it doesn\u2019t look overly exciting. Could you just talk about some of the drivers there? Thank you.","Graham Smith","So Raimo, I think we have highlighted that on previous calls that in spite the fact that we obviously have some very large, very successful customers in Japan. Generally that market has been quite tough for us, over the last couple of years particularly in the enterprise. I think small businesses continue to kind of move along very nicely but enterprise in Japan has been slow and of course that takes time to kind of feed through into our revenue numbers.","Now you are seeing obviously a different approach to managing the Japanese economy. We will be there next week for a customer company tour and I think our sales team over feel much more excited about the prospects for large enterprise transaction this year but it\u2019s primarily Japan that is affecting that revenue growth number, the rest of Asia, which is sort of Australia, New Zealand and ASEAN has been relatively consistent performer over the last few years.","Marc Benioff","Great. Well, thanks everyone and thanks for joining us today. Just encourage you all again to register for Dreamforce, do that early and we look forward to updating you in August.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Thank you.","I would now like to turn the call over to John Cummings, Head of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin your conference.","John Cummings","Thanks so much, Jason and good afternoon everyone and thanks for joining us for our fiscal second quarter 2015 results conference call. Our second quarter results press release, SEC filings and a replay of today's call can be found on our new IR website, www.salesforce.com\/investor. We\u2019ll also post the highlights of today's call on Twitter at the handle @salesforce_IR.","With me on the call today, are Marc Benioff, Chief Executive Officer, Keith Block, President and Vice Chairman, Graham Smith, Executive Vice President and Mark Hawkins, Chief Financial Officer. The team will share a few prepared remarks and then we\u2019ll turn the call over for questions. As a reminder our commentary today will primarily be in the non-GAAP terms.

And first, let me tell you I am so pleased to welcome Mark Hawkins, our new CFO to our team and he is on the call with us today. And once again, our enduring thanks to Graham Smith for a phenomenal six years as CFO and as you know Graham is still with us as a full time advisor to me and Mark and he is doing that until the end of March and Graham is also participating on the call today; as well as Keith Block our Vice Chairman and President and we\u2019re really excited to tell you all the amazing things going on at salesforce.com.","First I want to tell you. I spent almost a third of the quarter living in Europe and it was an amazing experience. I know many of you followed my trails on social media. I was -- we did very, very large customer programs in Paris, thousands of our customers there, as well as in Munich. We opened our new Paris Headquarters. We opened our new Salesforce tower in London and it was just an incredible time. We profiled our work with amazing companies in Europe, including a huge deal that we launch with Philips, where they are becoming a software company and building their next generation health applications right on the Salesforce platform and I was thrilled to have an incredible press conference with the Philips CEO while I was in Paris. And then we profiled some amazing work that we're doing for Louis Vuitton where we\u2019ve rolled out a global clienteling app really profiling one of France\u2019s most important companies, LVMH, and our incredible work for them.","And then moved on to Germany and we did the same thing. It was an incredible announcement and launch of what we\u2019re doing with Roche and you may have seen some incredible demonstrations of technology at Roche\u2019s next generation equipment built right onto our Service Cloud. It was just awesome. And again a multi thousand person program that we executed in Munich as well. It was really incredible.","Look first of all let me just thank all of our European customers and partners and employees that gave me unbelievable support while I was there and I really want to thank everybody for that. And now I just want to let you know that Salesforce has become the absolute number one CRM platform in the Europe and of course worldwide and also the fastest growing top 10 software company in the world. As you saw, we\u2019ve got accelerating revenue growth to 38% growth in the quarter.","We\u2019ve exceeded the $5 billion revenue run rate, the first enterprise cloud company to do that. Pretty incredible and I don\u2019t think there\u2019s ever been -- I don\u2019t think there\u2019s ever been a software company that has grown at 38% at the $5 billion revenue line and we are thrilled to be that company and we\u2019ve got a huge top line strategy. We also had just phenomenal execution of our ExactTarget acquisition. You probably saw that we bought ExactTarget a year ago. We\u2019ve deeply integrated that into our enterprise and it is just incredible what has happened with them.","We're also honored that Forbes yesterday named Salesforce the world\u2019s most innovative company for the fourth year in row and that is just a testament to our relentless focus on customer success, delivering a truly innovative customer platform and honestly we\u2019re just in shock on that recognition. We couldn\u2019t believe it when we were the Forbes most innovative company in the world and now we're the fourth. We've done it four years in a row. That\u2019s just awesome and of course that Fortune has named us one of best places to work, top 10 recognition and we're going for number one on that as well.","Look, our exceptional second record financial results just speak for themselves. Revenue growth accelerated 38% from a year ago to more than 1.3 billion. Less than a year after we surpassed our $4 billion revenue run rate, we\u2019re now more than $5 billion. Deferred revenue grew by 31%. That really exceeded what we thought we could do and we\u2019ve got dollar value of booked business on and off the balance sheet, grew 32% from last year at $7.4 billion, awesome. And now you can really see that clear trajectory, the $10 billion in revenue which has been our dream and when we start to get a look at our revenue, as well as our deferred business, you can start to connect the dots and see exactly how we\u2019re going to get there and the speed and rate and growth and we\u2019re super excited about our next big goal now after $5 billion which is going to be get to $10 billion.","Operating cash flow rose to $246 million, an increase of 34% year-over-year. That cash flow has been awesome this year, more than $719 million for the year so far and we are now guiding to more than 1.1 billion in operating cash flow for this year, which is really an incredible achievement for our Company and really I think speaks to the power and quality of the business model that we have put together. Not only we\u2019ve got this awesome top line growth but we have phenomenal cash flow as well.","And while we delivered world class growth, we also our grew our operating margin, something we\u2019re deeply committed to and we\u2019re able to deliver non-GAAP EPS of $0.13, which also exceeded our guidance and we\u2019re going to continue to grow and exceed and deliver these awesome EPS results as we head towards that $10 billion number.","Given our strong financial results and pipeline in new business, we're raising our full fiscal 2015 guidance by $30 million and we\u2019re also quite committed to delivering 125 to 150 basis points of operating margin improvement this year as well. I think these two things just demonstrate Salesforce has never been stronger, has never grown faster and it\u2019s just getting to an unbelievably new level.","And since we initiated fiscal year \u201915 guidance November last year, we\u2019ve now raised our guidance by $170 million, which is roughly the same amount of revenue that we delivered in our first year as a publically traded company a decade ago. Of course I think we\u2019ve now delivered more than 1700% return for our investors since we went public and we now are one of the top 10 best performing equities over the last decade.","We had $176 million in revenue in 2005 and we thought that was absolutely great as I mentioned, but it turned out we underestimated what we could do. We underestimated what we could do in a decade and that always seems to be how it is in our industry. We're always over estimating what we can do in the year and underestimating we can do in a decade and here it is, Salesforce did that itself.","Well, it\u2019s amazing. I couldn\u2019t be more proud of our team has accomplished and we\u2019re continuing our growth trajectory, connecting our customers with their customers in new ways and you can see Salesforce just continuing to execute in its sales and service and marketing and platform businesses and now for the eighth year in row the Sales Cloud was just announced as the leader in Gartner\u2019s Magic Quadrant for Salesforce automation.","Last month IDC named Service Cloud the number one in customer service and support and in April we announced Service Cloud SOS which delivers instant and personalized customer service within any mobile app. And so every company, every app, every customer can have their own mayday button right to their customer service and support center. Amazon has shown us an incredible vision of customer service. Every customer wants to do that and we\u2019re making that possible with our Service Cloud, now with the mayday button, so every customer can have that incredible capability in their own apps.","Exact Salesforce marketing cloud was just rated as the top digit marketing solution by Sera magazine and last month we launched a major update to Salesforce Journey Builder, which allows the planning and personalizing or optimizing the one-to-one customer interactions across multiple channels and you\u2019re going to see an unbelievable overview of the new version of Journey Builder, which is coming up at our connections conference and if you don\u2019t know about connections let me tell you, you\u2019re not going to want to miss that. It\u2019s in Indianapolis. It\u2019s going to be happening September 23rd to the 25th and we've got a phenomenal group of people coming in, incredible CMOs, like Beth Comstock of General Electric and we even have Will-I-Am coming in to do some incredible entertainment for us and we\u2019re going to be showing the future of marketing September 23rd and 25th in Indianapolis with Connections.","Look, at the core of clouds and customer platform is Salesforce1, something we announced last year at Dreamforce and it's the world\u2019s number one platform for developing these mobile apps. I mean we\u2019re just seeing incredible growth in our customer base with our ISVs. You can build and deploy an app on Android, on iPhone, on iPad, on any tablet. It\u2019s just awesome and companies are running their entire business right from their phone. I saw that everywhere I was in Europe and Salesforce1 is really the only solution that I\u2019ve seen that can deliver this world-class enterprise capability in the mobile environment and our customers just love it.","We have the largest enterprise cloud ecosystem, more than 1.7 million developers using our leading edge development tools and they are moving to mobile, using Salesforce1, these new open APIs, this incredible infrastructure that we\u2019ve delivered. And also I want to let you know that that app exchange that I just mentioned now has more than 2,000 apps available. A lot of them already moved over to Salesforce1 and both apps have been now installed more than 2.5 million times by our Enterprise customers, which is unprecedented in the Enterprise software market.","We announced a strategic platform and partnership with Microsoft this quarter. As you know we have an incredible situation with Microsoft, who has become I believe our largest customer of our marketing cloud. They've built an incredible new product that they have, called Office 365 right onto the marketing cloud. They use Journey Builder to guide their customers through their journeys and it\u2019s brought Microsoft and Salesforce closer together. We\u2019ve got more involved with Sequel Server than ever before and we\u2019re looking to unite our products more closely than ever before and you\u2019re going to see some incredible things at Dreamforce with Salesforce and Microsoft Office and the new version of Salesforce1, which is coming to Dreamforce and I\u2019ll tell you, it\u2019s a great partnership for our customers. They could not be more excited.","We also launched our new Salesforce Wear initiative, because customers are buying wearables at rates like we have never seen and they want to those wearables deeply integrated with our enterprise infrastructures and we are giving that to them and we are the enterprise leader right now in the wearables market place. Earlier this month, we also completed our acquisition of RelateIQ, an incredible company, which is going to greatly accelerate bringing advanced machine intelligent and data science right into our core platforms, as well as trading an incredible new application as part our family of products, and for those you who haven\u2019t tried RelateIQ, I use it on regular basis, I'd recommend you take a look RelateIQ, you\u2019ll be blown away that the levels of productivity that it brings every user.","And of course nothing is more indicative of the value of Salesforce than the level of customer usage on our platforms and I'm thrilled to announce that last month we delivered our first $2 billion transaction day, an incredible milestone for the entire cloud computing industry. More exciting, our service delivered more than 130 billion transaction this quarter, up 52% for a year ago and you saw exact target delivery and even more transactions on top of that.","It\u2019s been a remarkable quarter for Salesforce. But before I close, I want to remind you that we\u2019re just one month away from the marketing event of the year, Connections and September 23rd to 25th in Indianapolis, I mentioned that, it\u2019s just going to be awesome. You\u2019re not going to want to miss it. I'm going to be there doing the keynote and you\u2019re going to see the future of marketing itself unfold in Indianapolis.","And then I\u2019ll tell you, we\u2019re not that far away. So get ready for the biggest technology event in the history of technology and that is Dreamforce October 13th to the 16th in San Francisco. You\u2019re going to see the future of cloud, social, mobile, the future of the connected world. You\u2019re going to see businesses running -- you\u2019re going to see businesses running their entire business right from their phone. You\u2019re going to see people creating these amazing customer journeys like Microsoft is doing with Office 365 and you\u2019re going to see incredible new capabilities from Salesforce and we\u2019re going be also launching a major new product line there, as we like to call it a new cloud. So we\u2019re going to have the biggest and most exciting and most thrilling Dreamforce ever.","You\u2019re going to hear from global thought leaders. Klaus Schwab, the Head of the World Economic Forum has agreed to come and we\u2019re going to be profiling our work with the World Economic Forum and how they use Salesforce to run their operations. Former Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton has agreed to come and she is going to -- she is also going to be in conversation at Dreamforce with Klaus Schwab. Former Vice President, Al Gore, is going to be there talking about the environment. We\u2019ve got Reid Hoffman coming and whole of PayPal Mafia actually, which is Reid Hoffman, and Jeremy Stoppelman and Max Levchin, all coming to do in innovation panels and discussions on how to create startups and create more value in our industry market and Dreve Send [ph], of course an incredible venture capitalist and a pundit in our industry going to be there to talk about his work and where he feels the world going. Steve Case one the original pioneers in the entire tech industry is going to be there talking about his work and start ups and then you\u2019re going to have motivational speakers like Tony Robbins is going to be there running a huge program for people, showing them how to take their own capabilities and skills to new levels.","Neil Young, rock and roll legend is going to be there, launching a major new product, Pono; and neuroscience Adam Gazzaley is going to be there as well talking about his amazing work with Oculus Rift and how he has created systems that let us fly through our own brains. It's going to be awesome and perhaps I'm most excited about that my old friend Tony Prop from HP, an amazing Microsoft Executive and I will be in conversation on the future of Microsoft Office and how Salesforce and Microsoft are more tightly integrated than ever before. Of course we can\u2019t wait for the talented Bruno Mars, who headlined in Super Bowl, who is going to be headlining a huge outdoor concert at Civic Center. And you\u2019re not going to believe everything that\u2019s going on.","But let me just tell you one thing, if you plan to come to Dreamforce, you also better plan to bring a can of food with you as well, because we\u2019re going to run the world's largest food drive of all time and no one is coming to Dreamforce if they're not bringing food with them and things to help others and we\u2019re going to run the biggest food drive, we\u2019re going to raise huge millions of dollars for philanthropy and we\u2019re going to not only create the future, but we\u2019re also going to create a better future for all of us. I'm looking forward to seeing all of these, Connections and Dreamforce. It\u2019s going to be amazing.","And now I will the hand the call over to our Vice Chairman and President, Keith Block. Keith.","Keith Block","Thanks, Mark. Q2 was absolutely an outstanding quarter. And we continue to acquire and expand meaningful strategic relationships with enterprises of all sizes, in every region across every segment and major industry. That being said, we had significant double digit growth and a number of large deals in the quarter, which was terrific and a lot of them were net new logos, which is really an indication of the type of success we\u2019re seeing in our enterprise growth strategy.","I am incredible proud of the entire distribution team and what we\u2019ve achieved together in a very short period of time. And it\u2019s pretty clear that customers are choosing Salesforce as the trusted advisor for the customer platform. We\u2019re having a huge impact on the marketplace delivering solutions and driving customer success. So we\u2019re very, very excited.","I\u2019d like to tell you about one of our larger transactions in the quarter, which is 3M, a leading manufacturer with a long history of global innovation. This is a great transaction and really is an example of the energy and the success that our team have been delivering in the marketplace.","Salesforce will now be powering 3M global transformation with Sales Cloud and Service Cloud as their global customer platform across 27,000 employees. Salesforce will be the social and mobile front end to 3M's SAP back office and it will provide their sales, service and marketing teams with a 360 degree view of the customers. We\u2019re very, very excited about this. This is a terrific example of one of many eight figure transactions in the quarter and a great example of how customers are returning to Salesforce to unlock the value from their legacy systems.","We also closed another deal with Safeway. They selected the Salesforce1 platform to build next generation applications that will drive greater productivity across their store operations. Store managers and associates will be able to complete all their tasks right from their mobile phones, very, very exciting and leveraging Salesforce communities, Safeway will bring all their stores and associates into a single communications platform, again a very, very powerful story that we\u2019re very, very excited about.","Another large deal that we closed in the quarter is with Fastweb, which is the leading Telco provider in Italy and also a subsidiary of Swisscom. Fastweb selected the Sales Cloud and the Service Cloud to get a holistic view of their subscribers, whether they\u2019re in the store, online or over the phone or with an agent. In the Salesforce community Fastweb partners will soon be able to connect directly with agents to drive a whole new level of customer service. This is really a great example of helping the customer to transform the business model and this what we\u2019re all about, transforming our customers business models.","We're also very pleased to have closed the landmark transaction with a large global manufacturer based in Europe and one of SAPs largest customers, where we will replacing tens of thousands of Microsoft users. We also signed on newer expanded relationships in the second quarter with some great brands, Etna, AIG, Burner, Caterpillar, Cathay Pacific, General Motors, Konica Minolta, [indiscernible] Bank, PG&E, Procter & Gamble, Roche, Singapore Airlines, USAA and Yahoo! and many, many more. These are all excellent, excellent global brands in a variety of different industries and each one of this companies are looking for us to provide them with deep industry expertise.","So whether it\u2019s communications or financial services or healthcare or manufacturing, retail or the public sector, we are delivering the next generation customer platform and help our customer transform their business models for the future. And as you can see from these incredible global brands, we\u2019re seeing tremendous levels of success internationally, as Europe and Asia Pac both deliver strong growth in the second quarter.","We\u2019re just beginning to scratch the surface on our international growth potential. That\u2019s why we\u2019re aggressively investing in our international market by increasing our distribution capacity, building new datacenters that we have announced and expanding our very important partner ecosystem.","And speaking of partners we continue to see tremendous energy and enthusiasm in the ecosystem. The number of ISVs continue to scale. Our systems integrators continue to expand their Salesforce practices and all of this is accelerating our momentum, our reach and clearly our success in the marketplace. So I want to thank the entire organization for their outstanding execution in the second quarter.","And with that I\u2019ll turn the call over to Graham.","Graham Smith ","Okay. Thanks Keith. As you've just heard, we have a really strong second quarter. It\u2019s great to be handing the CFO role over to Mark with the company performing at such a high level. As many of you already know, Mark is an exceptional finance executive and I am fortunate to be transitioning the role to somebody who I\u2019ve known personally for several years, who I admire, and who is really going to be a great fit with Salesforce.","Mark understands the challenges of growing an organization at scale. He was with HP on its journey from $3 billion in revenue to more than 50 billion and took Dell [ph] from $25 billion to more than $55 billion. I'm confident Mark will be instrumental in helping the Company scale to $10 billion and beyond. As you know, I\u2019ll be here until March as an advisor to assure a seamless transition. I'll be on hand to answer any questions this afternoon. Before I turn the call over to our new CFO, I\u2019d like to thank all of you on the phone for your support during my time at Salesforce.","And with that, let me pass it to Mark, who will take you through the financial details for the quarter.","Mark Hawkins","","Thanks Graham. I\u2019m excited to be here and build upon the foundation of innovation and customer success that has made Salesforce one of the truly great software companies. I've been in the industry for three decades and in the last 15 years I've watched Salesforce lead the movement to cloud social mobile and when I think about Salesforce, I think about an absolute leader and pioneer and I am delighted to be here and to help guide the Company through our next phase of growth.","As CFO, I\u2019m going to be focused on three things, driving our strong top line growth while delivering on our commitment to improving operating margins. Number two is ensuring the Company\u2019s infrastructure and operations continue to scale as we grow. And number three is working closely with Graham to insure a smooth transition for the entire Salesforce team.","With that, let me take you through the financial highlights of our second quarter. We ended the quarter with revenue, deferred revenue, cash flow and non-GAAP EPS, all growing above 30% year-over-year. During the quarter we also announced the acquisition of RelateIQ, we reached a one year anniversary of the acquisition of ExactTarget and showed improvement in our non-GAAP operating margins year-over-year. In terms of Q2, revenue was $1.3 billion up 38% over the last year. Now excluding an FX benefit of approximately $9 million, revenue was up 37% and the non-GAAP EPS for the quarter was $0.13.","On a regional basis, Americas grew 39%. EMEA grew 42% in dollars and 36% in constant currency, sustaining a long trend of constant currency growth above 30% and Asia-Pacific grew 25% in dollars and 27% in constant currency continuing the acceleration that we\u2019ve seen over the last few quarters. Looking at the second quarter revenue by cloud, Sales Cloud were $610 million, Service Cloud was $319 million, Salesforce1 platform and other was $181 million and ExactTarget marketing cloud was $122 million. Now second quarter dollar attrition, excluding ExactTarget remains 97%.","And with that now let's turn to margins. Our Q2 gross margin was 79.3%. That was down 140 basis points from last year. The decrease in our gross margin is principally related to our acquisition of ExactTarget late in Q2 of last year, which by the way, prior to acquisition had a gross margin in the mid-60% range. Now going forward, we will continue to seek operational efficiencies from the integration to positively impact our margins. Some of the ideas we\u2019re working on include driving benefits from centralizing procurement, leveraging share infrastructure and increasing the share of projects done by our professional services partners.","Our second quarter non-GAAP operating margin was 11%, up 79 basis points from Q2 last year and up 126 basis points sequentially. From a headcount perspective we had another great quarter of organic hiring in Q2 adding more than 900 employees, bringing our total headcount to more than 15,000. Turning to cash flow, we delivered a strong operating cash flow of $246 million, up 34% over the last year and we now expect our full year operating cash flow growth of 26% to 27%.","CapEx was $72 million in the second quarter, down 30% over last year. CapEx as a percent of revenue was approximately 5%, down from 11% in Q2 of last year. For the full year we continue to expect CapEx as a percent of revenue to be in the range of 5% to 7%. Free cash flow which we define as operating cash flow less CapEx was approximately $174 million up, 116% from last year.","A couple of notes on the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.7 billion in cash and marketable securities. Deferred revenue ended the quarter approximately $2.4 billion, up 31% over the last year. We faced a slight FX headwind to deferred revenue in the second quarter of approximately $1 million on a year-over-year basis and a headwind of approximately $14 million sequentially. In the second quarter 71% of the value of all subscriptions and support related invoices, including ExactTarget were issued with annual terms. This compares to approximately 67% in Q2 of last year. Unbilled deferred revenue or revenue that is contracted but not yet invoiced and is off the balance sheet ended quarter at approximately $5 billion, an increase of 32% over the last year.","Turning to guidance, as Mark mentioned, we\u2019re once again raising our full year 2015 revenue guidance by $30 million at the high end of the range to $5.34 billion to $5.37 billion, for a year-over-year growth of 31% to 32%. Since we first established our fiscal 2015 revenue guidance nine months ago, we raised our full year outlook by $170 million.","We\u2019re also raising our full year non-GAAP EPS guidance by $0.01 to $0.50 to $0.52 and we remain on track to increase our full year, our non-GAAP operating margin by 125 to 150 basis points. For the third quarter we anticipate revenue in the range of $1.365 billion to $1.37 billion, representing year-over-year growth of approximately 27%, as we pass the first anniversary of the ExactTarget acquisition. We expect non-GAAP EPS in a range of $0.12 to $0.13, which includes the cost of Dreamforce and we expect billed deferred revenue in the third quarter to increase approximately 30% year-over-year. All the underlying assumptions of our GAAP and non-GAAP guidance and a complete GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation can be found in our earnings press release issued today.","At the close, I would like personally thank all of our 1,500 employees for their hard work and dedication in achieving these absolutely terrific results. I'm excited to be the part of the Company\u2019s journey to $10 billion in revenue and well beyond and I look forward to working with all of you and seeing you at one of our upcoming events, including Connections and Dreamforce.","And with that, I would like to open the call for questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) You first question comes from Heather Bellini of Goldman Sachs.","Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs","Look I was wondering the movements in wearables and given the recent partnerships with some of medical device companies that were highlighted throughout the last couple of months, can you share with us how you see Salesforce participating in the trend of Internet of Things?","Marc Benioff","Well, thanks so much Heather. I really appreciate that question, and I\u2019ll tell you, it really took me aback honestly. I was in our Paris Cloudforce program. I think we\u2019ve had 3,000 to 5,000 people there with me. You can watch a video of that on YouTube and you\u2019ll see that we get to the wearables section of event and right then, during the wearables section of the event something amazing happened and what happens is you hear just an audible gasp from the crowd when they see the Salesforce information appearing on the wearable and it took me aback, it\u2019s taken me aback since we launched the product as well that customers really can\u2019t see this happening very, very quickly and usually a lot of them already wearing wearables on a regular basis. I know that I am. I bet a lot of people on this are and these wearables are becoming a lot more sophisticated. They\u2019re becoming tethered to our phones. They\u2019re also becoming their phones. And they need to have access to both, not only the consumer cloud but to the enterprise information as well that we\u2019re really pioneering with our wearables as software development kits and applications that we\u2019re building. You\u2019re going to see a lot of that at Dreamforce as well. And when you start to combine it into the different verticals that we are looking at, we can really start to do demonstrations with our customers of what their future looks like, not only in their own productivity but also in how their customers will be automated as well. And you\u2019re going to see this become a huge part of the future.","I'm confident we\u2019re going to see wearables from major providers like Apple and others this year. You\u2019ve already seen wearables emerge from huge companies like Samsung and it\u2019s going to be a huge part of all of our lives and Salesforce has to be deeply integrated as part of that, which is why we launched this Salesforce Wear program. And also I guess I should mention since the CFO\u2019s name is Mark and CEO\u2019s name is Marc, we\u2019ll have to come up with some clever way to figure out who the question is for. I just assumed that question was for me.","Operator","Your next question comes from Matt Hedberg of RBC Capital Markets.","Matt Hedberg - RBC Capital Markets","I was wondering, can you give us a sneak peak at maybe how RelateIQ might hone the basis for your analytics cloud, perhaps what else is needed for that particular product and then maybe if you could help us out with the dilution from that acquisition, that would be great? Thanks.","Marc Benioff","Well, sure. I\u2019ll let Mark and Graham handle the dilution question and let me take the top line and the strategy question. As part of my job as the CEO of Salesforce, I am constantly meeting with and looking at and reviewing startups and new technology and new companies, new entrepreneurs and meeting with visionaries and begin to -- I had an amazing experience. I have dinner that I attend every month with 15 CEOs of mostly very strong and emerging companies, a lot of them who now have become huge companies. And two of them looked me in the eye and this has never happened before and they go, you really need to buy RelateIQ. And I said why do I need to buy RelateIQ and they said, we use Salesforce but we use RelateIQ also and it\u2019s an incredible complement to your product line and it can be a huge part of your future and I started, I knew about RelateIQ, I've used it. I started to spend a lot more time with it and I saw directly what they were talking about. It's really a vision of how the power of data science and the power of relationship intelligence can be applied to very large datasets.","And what we see happening with RelateIQ is unbelievably complementary right now to Salesforce, but we see it just getting Salesforce on steroids. We actually have a huge vision of RelateIQ. We\u2019re currently working closely with the management team and executing that and I expect in about six months we\u2019ll have some very exciting new products and new capabilities to offer our customers based on the RelateIQ acquisition and we are very fortunate as we were with ExactTarget to be able to acquire this company, these entrepreneurs and they just have some of the most incredible visionaries and technologists in the company including the person who invented the very term data science and this is just a huge win -- success for Salesforce.","So let me turn it over to Mark and Graham on the question of dilution.","Graham Smith","Let me take that Marc. Hey, Matt. In terms of the dilution, there\u2019s no affect at all on the non-GAAP basis. So you can say -- obviously, we\u2019re committed to the 125 to 150 basis points of operating margin through the Q1. And on a GAAP basis, keep in mind that this is just closed and we\u2019ll have that calculated GAAP affect by the end of Q3, but on a non-GAAP basis no effect.","Operator","Your next question comes from Karl Keirstead of Deutsche Bank.","Karl Keirstead - Deutsche Bank","My question is for Mark Hawkins. I just wanted to talk a little bit about the up 30% DR guide for the third quarter, I think that implies about 25% billings growth. I had two questions for you. I just wanted to confirm, given that we've lapped ExactTarget, is that a 100% or near 100% organic DR increase? And then secondly, what key assumptions or drivers are you assuming for that October DR guide in terms of large deals or do you have deal strength, any color? Thank you.","Mark Hawkins","Sure Karl. First of all, let me just say a couple of things here. One is that we focus on -- our revenue obviously -- our deferred revenue [indiscernible] and I know billings is a number that you look at. That\u2019s not something that we focus on in the Company. Let me just talk you in a broader sense that you\u2019re asking about, which is when we look at going forward, our guide represents -- our revenue level represents 31% to 32% revenue guide for the entire year, which gives you a sense of velocity. One of things you touched on is, the ET effectively and we did last the ET in this quarter and so when you look at Q3 for example, you can see we basically do that. And I think that\u2019s -- everybody is factoring that in. So, I think the long and the short is you\u2019re absolutely right. We left ET. I think you have a good understanding when you look at our revenue growth at 31% to 32% and Graham I don\u2019t know, if you have any other color to that.","Graham Smith","Yes. I think we haven\u2019t, in terms of specifically forecasting deferred revenue, obviously we try and give you a guide on that, just because we know it\u2019s an important number for you. I would say methodology of how we actually project that this quarter doesn\u2019t change. We have a big complicated model for that, that we use and it's been usually reliable but there\u2019s been no -- it\u2019s not working at the deal level. It\u2019s basically working at overall macro levels, new business, attrition, build frequently, all those kind of things go into that mix.","Operator","The next question comes from Jason Maynard of Wells Fargo.","Jason Maynard - Wells Fargo","I got a question for Marc B and Keith B. Can you just talk a little bit about Europe and Asia, and Marc you spent a lot of time over there in Europe, and I'm curious to get your take, and maybe Keith, you can weigh in on this, where do you think we\u2019re at in terms of the European countries starting to make the move to cloud adoption? Because if we look historically, a company of your size, international would be much bigger if we\u2019re making comparison back to the old days of Oracle and early Europeans have been slow to move to cloud relative to the U.S. So I'm curious, where do you think we\u2019re at in that journey and how do you think about growth rates in each of those regions going forward? Thanks.","Marc Benioff","Yes. I really appreciate that Jason and I\u2019ll tell you that number one, and we\u2019ve talked about this before. It has been a long concerted focus on Europe and obviously this is not my first trip to Europe that I just completed. I have been to Europe with Salesforce many, many, many, many times. And Europe tends to be a laggard when it comes to implementing new technology. And that has not escaped our cloud companies, as well as you can see across the board with all of the cloud companies.","That said, the reason why you see accelerated growth rates in Europe for our business and why we have just seen remarkable deal growth and sales in Europe over the last several years now is because what you said is true. It is a huge, huge part of our information technology market and it\u2019s a huge part of our CRM market and they are now deeply committed and I believe earnestly adopting cloud in a whole new level.","There\u2019s no doubt that we are adopting our model to be more successful in Europe. You probably know we now have a U.K. datacenter and while I was in Europe, we also announced a French and German datacenter that will extremely important for each of these countries to have their own \"clouds\". Germany wants the German Cloud, France wants the France Cloud and U.K. wants the U.K. Cloud and as you know our infrastructure investments and ability to deliver infrastructure, the costs for us were extremely minimal. And it\u2019s very easy for us to deliver that model to those countries. We\u2019ve already done that for example in the U.S., our dominant market but we have also already done that in Japan where we have a Japan cloud. And I believe we\u2019ll have a U.S. Cloud, a Japan Cloud, a U.K. Cloud, a France Cloud and a German Cloud and that in all major markets and you know that we really do business in earnest in about seven countries, we will see a more -- an increasing [indiscernible] of those countries and this is really I think indication that the cloud computing model is going mainstream.","Cloud is going mainstream and these countries want to make sure that these clouds are part of their national infrastructure and are part of their national assets. We saw that first in Japan and we delivered that and we\u2019ll now deliver that in our major markets and that\u2019s going to be very, very exciting for our customers and it has given our distribution organization, the ability to talk about this incredible commitment to our local markets. That\u2019s also why you saw us also double down on our key market headquarters, such as in the UK and France this quarter, as well we have our new Salesforce Tower in Downtown London, which I encourage all of you to visit and is an incredible and very important part of our ability to do business in the United Kingdom, coupled with our UK datacenter.","We also have our new French headquarters directly next the Eiffel Tower, the former headquarters of the French Navy and we have under development and soon to be open our new French datacenter. Again we have so many exciting customers in France that I met with, whether it\u2019s companies like I mentioned like LVMH, or AXA or Renault or so many others who have made massive commitments to us and then we move on to Germany and again we\u2019re executing the same strategy and Japan where the Japanese government now has asked us to move into one of their brand new building which is JP Tower and in Downtown Tokyo in the Maruchi [ph] district and also we\u2019ve coupled with NTT with our Japanese datacenter and I think you\u2019re going to see this as a successful winning combination for delivering our cloud, Salesforce\u2019s cloud in these local markets and accelerating our growth and if you look at how -- as we've implemented that strategy over the last several years, you can see how our international numbers have improved. And now let me turn it over to Keith, who will give you the on the ground assessment.","Keith Block","","Yes, thanks Marc. So, I would echo many of the things that Marc just said. When I come onboard just over 12 months ago, one of the things that was obvious to me was just a tremendous opportunity in international, both in EMEA and Japan and Asia-Pac and we have accelerated our investment in those theaters across the board, whether it\u2019s people and headcount, whether it\u2019s improving our relationship with partners, the key influences in those markets as well as the IFDs. Marc also mentioned datacenters. I think that\u2019s a demonstration of clear commitment to those countries that we\u2019re very curious about the cloud computing business in their theatre. So you wrap up all of those investments going with our general theme of going to market by industry and selling solutions and you can see the response in the numbers that our customers internationally, not just domestically anymore but internationally absolutely wanted to embrace our vision for them around a customer platform. So, we\u2019re very, very excited about the acceleration in the results and you\u2019re going to continue to see that happen.","Operator","","Your next question comes from Brent Thill of UBS.","Brent Thill - UBS","","Thanks, question for Mark Hawkins and Graham on the approach to your hiring in the back half of the year. About a third of your workforce has been added just in the past year and half and I think there has been some questions around are you going to continue at the pace you've been going or is there room for pause as you digest those additions that you made?","Mark Hawkins","","Let me start and maybe Graham can jump in as well here. As you saw last quarter, we did add 900 people. We were glad to do that. We feel like that helps position us as our Company is growing rapidly. We continue to hire. If you look at our Web site, we\u2019ve got lots of stuff out there for [indiscernible] I will even add that obviously we\u2019re having good success in hiring, I think in large part with things like being a great destination to be in terms of a best place to work and such. I think the long and the short of it is Brent, that we continue to hire, we\u2019re going to continue to do that within the envelope of delivering our top line growth that we talked to you about with the 31% to 32% and also with the operating margin, 125 to 150 basis point improvement non-GAAP. Graham?","Graham Smith","","Yes, I would just add I think, we have somewhere over 900 open positions on our Web site. I think [indiscernible] back end loaded hiring in our year. This year we actually got after a really fast start. Employee attrition has been actually very favorable for us too. We ended the first half ahead of our headcount plan, which I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve had in my six years with the company. So we had a really, really strong organic [indiscernible]. So we feel great heading into the back half from a hiring point of view.","Operator","","Your next question comes from Ed Maguire of CLSA.","Ed Maguire - CLSA","","A couple of quick questions. One is on -- thank you for providing some of the granularity around the cloud. If you could provide any relative strength across the cloud, that would be great. And also turning to the industrial side of Internet of Things, you guys have been doing a lot of interesting work with ThingWorx and Etherios and some of those partners, and I\u2019m curious to what extent you expect Service Cloud and platform to really lead adoption here? What are going to be the obstacles to adoption and what are the biggest vectors you see driving growth for connected products? Thanks.","Marc Benioff","Well, the thing I would say is that we\u2019re very lucky to have a full portfolio of product and of course we\u2019ve got our mainstream Sales Cloud product and that product continues to do incredibly well and beyond our expectations and that\u2019s one of the key reasons we bought RelateIQ. It really makes the Sales Cloud so much better and we couldn\u2019t imagine something that could boost us so much, so fast. But RelateIQ did that and so we had no choice but to acquire the company and make that happen.","Then when we look into the service cloud world, well, this is our fastest growing cloud ever and you can just see the revenue numbers are just awesome and it\u2019s unusual for a software company to have $1 billion product line and multibillion dollar product line. We have that with Sales Cloud and now you see it\u2019s happening again with the Service Cloud, we have a second multibillion dollar product line and that product as you know whether -- it doesn\u2019t matter what rating agency is rating it, it says it\u2019s absolutely the best customer service product out there and then we made it so much better with all these new capabilities. And when you see what we come out with at Dreamforce again, you\u2019ll be just in shock at the level of quality and capability of the Service Cloud.","The Marketing Cloud is a product that very much we have built through acquisition. And we of course acquired an incredible company called Radian6. We bought an incredible company called BuddyMedia. But all of that was minimized when we bought this unbelievable company last year called ExactTarget. And that company, as you can see has dramatically accelerated our Marketing Cloud and has given that a very strong trajectory.","And when you get to the Connections conference and you see things like Journey Builder, when you see what Microsoft has built on top of our marketing cloud and with Journey Builder and how they\u2019ve been able to get such incredible success with Office 365 by building customer journeys and how we can deliver this deep customer workflow for any app builder, not just Microsoft but any one building apps or anybody who is trying to deliver customer journeys and communicate with those customers on a regular basis through email and SMS and on mobile phones and In-App, you will see why these companies like Microsoft and Sony and so many others have made such huge investments in our Marketing Cloud.","And then getting to your IoT question, our platform, you can\u2019t do any of this unless you can build your own apps and you've got to be able to build mobile apps, you've got be able to build on an API. You have enterprise quality. You have to be able to have it in country. It\u2019s not like the consumer cloud. We don\u2019t own our customers' data. We\u2019re not like Facebook and Google or Yahoo! We don\u2019t own the data. The data is our customers' and we are just stewards. We provide the applications. We provide the equipment but the use of clouds are very much owned by the customers and the customers are in the data centers and auditing the data centers and reviewing the security and knee deep in all the capabilities.","And the core of that, that\u2019s the platform that is -- the infrastructure is the platform, the APIs are the platform, and then it's a fundamental software that lets them build these incredible next-generation applications like what we see coming out of Salesforce1 with these unbelievable mobile apps and if you go to our AppExchange.com and you look at the Salesforce1 category, you look at some of the demonstrations of that or just talk to any of our customers and have them show you what they\u2019re doing on Salesforce1, we are rapidly moving our user base to mobile and it\u2019s super important for us and it\u2019s our platform, and here it is again, another aspect of our business that has an incredible trajectory.","And then finally and as part of that, we have to mention Heroku. Heroku is the absolute standard in building apps on Amazon Web services. It\u2019s an acquisition that we did now I think about three years ago. It\u2019s become an unbelievable success story. It\u2019s the standard in the industry and if you want to build a standard app that's customer facing on AWS, you\u2019re going to do it on our Heroku platform and you saw incredible integration between Heroku and Salesforce with the introduction of Heroku Connect and that is super-exciting that we\u2019re able to offer our customers the ability to build on the Journey Builder platform for those marketing applications. They can build on the force platform for their employee applications. And here they can build on Heroku for their consumer facing applications and our customers look at that as a complete suite, not just for B2B applications and sales and service and marketing and managing their internal apps, but they also are able to do it on B2C; that is we have a full B2C offering with ExactTarget and Journey Builder, with Heroku and of course you\u2019ve seen what we\u2019ve done with communities where we\u2019re just delivering unbelievable community support and if you go to community.homedepot.com, you look at what Home Depot has done with deep social network that connects their community, one of the largest retailers in the world with all of their employees around the world, it\u2019s an example of what we\u2019re all going to able to do with communities.","So we look at this as -- we look at an unbelievable capability with sales -- the Sales Cloud, the Service Cloud, the Marketing Cloud. We see an unbelievable strength with the platform, with Heroku and then communities and to kind of get your last piece, you\u2019re going to see us move into an exciting new area at Dreamforce and I\u2019m not going to tip my hat to what that is. It's not RelateIQ. It\u2019s nothing that have seen yet from Salesforce and we are going to be introducing a major new product line and category at Dreamforce. So be there during our keynote on the 14th, on Tuesday in San Francisco at 01:30 p.m. because we will show you really the fifth leg of the stool and how all these things come together to create an incredible customer facing environment, whether you are a B2B company, B2B2C company or B2C company, Salesforce has an incredible suite of products that will make you more successful than ever before and also connect with your customers in a whole new way.","Operator","And your final question of the call comes from Kirk Materne of Evercore.","Kirk Materne - Evercore","My question for Keith. Keith can you maybe provide a bit of an update on the industry strategy, how that\u2019s playing out in terms of some of the larger deals you guys have signed this quarter? I'm interested if there\u2019s any industries in particular you\u2019re seeing some accelerating traction, whether it's through your own efforts or through your ISP partners efforts? Thanks.","Keith Block","Yes. Our industry strategy continues to gain traction. In fact if you look at the roster of customers we've identified in the beginning in the opening comments of the call, they fairly represent all the industries that we\u2019re pretty much focusing on. So we continue to get traction. Our customers love the story about our point of view around the industry. They love the solutions that we\u2019re bringing to market. They are enjoying what our partners are collaborating with us on and able to help them drive a transmission of their business models in their particular industries. So it\u2019s early days and early months but we continue to see traction. Not only are we seeing this in larger deals and volume with larger deals, but just bringing in more meaningful dialogue across the board. So I think the prognosis is good. The early results are good. And we will continue to focus on.","John Cummings","So that concludes our call today everyone. Thank you so much for joining. We appreciate it. We'll look forward to updating you on our third quarter results in November.

Thank you very much and thank you to everyone joining us on today's call. I am absolutely delighted to be here to talk about our second quarter results and tell you about everything that is going on at Salesforce.","So revenue, as you see, has grown 25% in dollars and 26% year-over-year in constant currency to more than $2 billion and just congratulations to everyone at Salesforce. This is our first $2 billion quarter and also no other enterprise software company of our size and scale is delivering this kind of growth rate. Congratulations to everyone.","Deferred revenue was $3.8 billion, up 26% in dollars and 27% in constant currency. The dollar value of booked business on and off the balance sheet is now $11.8 billion, which is up 28% from a year ago. We are raising our fiscal 2017 revenue guidance to $8.325 billion at the high end of our range of 25%, and we are delivering on the strong pace of topline growth even as we continue and improve on our non-GAAP operating margin.","Salesforce continues to be the fastest growing top ten software company in the world and last week Forbes ranked us as one of the most innovative companies in the world for the sixth year in a row and has named Salesforce \"the innovator of the decade\". Thank you, Forbes. And that\u2019s a great tribute to our amazing employees, especially our technology and product teams. Dreamforce is coming up and you are going to see an incredible level of new innovation when we introduce Salesforce Einstein, the world's first comprehensive artificial intelligence platform for CRM.","Salesforce Einstein is AI for everyone. It's going to democratize artificial intelligence. It's going to make every company and every employee smarter, faster and more productive. We are going to deliver the world's smartest CRM. And as you know, over the last few years we have acquired a number of AI companies. Incredible companies like RelateIQ, MetaMind, Implisit, PredictionIO, Tempo AI and more with amazing, amazing people and technology. We have been able to stitch all this together into this incredible AI platform and this focus on AI and on the critical aspects of AI as the next wave of our industry has resulted in a machine learning team of more than 175 data scientists who have built this amazing Einstein platform. And that\u2019s really why I am so excited and why everyone in Salesforce is so excited.","And when you come to Dreamforce you are going to see how this fits together and how we are delivering Salesforce Einstein and we are going to have some great new products like Sales Cloud Einstein and Service Cloud Einstein, Marketing Cloud Einstein. We are going to have our Analytics Cloud Einstein and many other artificial intelligence capabilities in all of our clouds and our customers will be able to build their own AI capabilities using Einstein extensions and Heroku. This is going to be a huge differentiator and growth driver going forward as it puts us well ahead of our CRM competition once again.","Salesforce Einstein is also a perfect example of how we have been able to combine organic innovation with some amazing acquisitions. We came into this year with a lot of excitement and energy around the investments we made in our own technology. Earlier this year, as you know, market conditions did change and my leadership, the board and I were presented with some incredible opportunities that we just never thought would be available to us.","We took a look at these amazing acquisitions and our strategy was simple, we will acquire one of a kind companies with unique technologies, amazing engineering teams and of course visionary leaders that fit with our mission and our strategic plan to help our customers connect with their customers in new ways. And some of these acquisitions are helping us build out our CRM today, others are laying out the foundation for our future.","A great example is Demandware. A company we have had a great relationship with and have admired and there is no company like Demandware. It's the clear leader in the multibillion dollar cloud ecommerce marketplace, a natural extension of our platform. It expands our CRM offering with capabilities our customers have been asking for and when we have talked to customers, like Louis Vuitton or Brunello Cucinelli, or See's Candy, or even Adidas, they talk about Demandware as the critical part of their ecommerce cloud, and that\u2019s how it became Salesforce's ecommerce cloud. It's the solution that our customers drove us to and we are absolutely thrilled with this great new family of ecommerce products at Salesforce.","We also take advantage of opportunities to invest in our future with incredible companies like Quip and everyone knows he is the great leader of Quip, Bret Taylor. Creator of Google Maps and also the former CTO of Facebook, who has created this next generation technology of live documents, bringing a new level of content, communication and collaboration right into our platform. And with all of this, we are creating the world's smartest CRM through sales service marketing community, analytics, ecommerce and IoT.","We have never been better positioned for the future. You are going to see that at Dreamforce. It is going to be a rush of innovation. There has never been more new products and more capabilities released at Dreamforce, and you are never going to see a better place to see how all this amazing innovation and products comes together. This is our biggest customer event of the year. Coming very very soon, October 4 through 7. We have got more than 2300 customer speakers inspiring, motivating, empowering, educating our amazing community of customer trailblazers. We also have an amazing lineup of speakers including Melinda Gates, and General Motors Mary Barra, Congressman John Lewis, and many many more. And you are not going to want to miss U2 performing at our Dreamfest UCSF Benefit Concert to raise $10 million for children hospitals. It's going to be an unforgettable event.","Dreamforce is already sold out. So talk to John to get registered and I am going to look forward to seeing everybody there. Now let's turn it over to Keith and talk about our customer highlights for the quarter. Keith?","Keith Block","Thanks, Marc, and thanks to everybody for joining the call today. Overall, we delivered a solid second quarter. Our results reflect our continued focus on becoming more strategic with the enterprise, expanding internationally, investing in our partner ecosystem and broadening our penetration in our target industries. In each of these areas we made good progress in Q2.","Now, at the same time we saw some softness at the end of the quarter, primarily in the United States, and after a thorough operational review of the United States business, from sales to products to marketing, really all aspects of our business, I am confident in our plan for the year. We have a proven and tenured sales leadership team. We have industry-leading products. We have continued high win rates and our second half pipeline is very strong.","We also are seeing very high levels of customer engagement. So let me take you through some of the highlights of the quarter. We continue to close some of the biggest and most strategic transactions in the industry. In fact, we closed another nine figure transaction in Q2 with a Fortune 50 customer. For those of you who are counting, this is now the third quarter in a row where we have established these very strategic nine figure relationships.","On the international front. Over the last few years we have been steadily increasing our distribution capacity, expanding our partner ecosystem, investing in offices and infrastructure and opening new data centers and all of these investments are clearly paying off. Europe was our fastest growing region powered by some great strategic wins with Cellcom, and PostNord and TNT, AXA and Nestle. Great brands. Asia Pac had some great wins with Shinsei Bank, Meiji Yasuda, Samsung, and Telstra. And in Latin America, we expanded our relationship with the largest private bank in Brazil, Ita\u00fa. And in every region our partners, which is so critical to our strategy, have been a huge part of our success.","Our ecosystem continues to expand with incredible ISVs and global and regional SIs. In fact, partner certifications reached 38,000 in the quarter, up 25% from a year ago, which is proof positive that our partner strategy is working and adding to our additional overall capacity. We continue to gain traction from our vertical focus, which produce our momentum in each of our major industries and I would like to share a few of those stories.","In healthcare, UnitedHealth Group significantly expanded with us to help build its next generation of patients and customer engagement for more than 125 million people. This is an incredible vision to make healthcare more cost effective, efficient, predictive and intelligent. In retail, one of the world's largest brands expanded with us to consolidate their entire guest experience to turn the billions of messages they send to customers in one to one journeys that are seamless, intelligent and predictive.","Macy's is another great example of how our retailer can transform with us. They started with Heroku for just portions of their mobile and ecommerce websites. Now, they are bringing Salesforce to 185,000 employees and 1000 plus HR call center agents. And our momentum in retail is only going to get supercharged with Demandware, our Salesforce Commerce Cloud.","In financial services, we expanded with State Farm and Nationwide and Farmers, and the Advisor Group, one the largest networks of independent broker dealers in the country, and they are rolling out the Salesforce financial services cloud to thousands of affiliated advisors. As you now, this is a product we launched just last quarter and their early interest has been remarkable. These are all incredible stories. I could go on and on and at Dreamforce you are going to hear even more from our customers and how they are transforming their business with Salesforce.","Before I close, I would like to thank the team and the company for their hard work and their efforts to driving customer success in the quarter and, of course, to our customers and partners for their trust in us and I look forward to a strong second half. And with that, I would like to turn the call over to Mark to talk about our financial performance in the quarter.","Mark Hawkins","Great. Thanks, Keith. Total revenue for the second quarter was up 25% in dollars and 26% in constant currency, excluding a year-over-year FX headwind of $25 million. Demandware contributed $9 million to revenue in the second quarter which was near the high-end of the guidance we provided in June. Our dollar attrition for the second quarter, which excludes Marketing Cloud, remains below 9% supporting top line revenue growth.","Looking at revenue by cloud. Sales Cloud grew 13% year-over-year in dollars. Service Cloud grew 29%, App Cloud and other grew 43%, Marketing Cloud grew 28% which now includes the subscription and support revenue from Demandware. While many enterprise software companies are aspiring to achieve a billion run rate in one product, we already have three products with revenue run rates of more than $1 billion today with the Marketing Cloud soon to become our four. This gives us multiple levers of growth and provides additional business diversification.","This was another quarter of consistent, year-over-year constant currency revenue growth in our regions with EMEA growing 32% and Asia Pac growing 29%. During the second quarter, FX drove more revenue pressure than expense relief. So I am very pleased that we were able to still deliver 25 basis points of non-GAAP operating margin improvement year-over-year, our ninth consecutive quarter of expansion. And we achieved this even while we began integrating Demandware and other recent acquisitions.","I have already discussed our FX impacted our P&L but the more meaningful impact was to the cash flow statement and balance sheet. Cash flow in the quarter was $251 million, down 18% over the last year. Operating cash flow was principally impacted by FX headwinds as well as continued deepening of the seasonality of invoicing and onetime cost associated with the acquisition of Demandware. However, I am very pleased with our cash generation in the first half of the year of $1.3 billion, which is up 25% over the first half of last year. Deferred revenue ended the quarter at more than $3.8 billion which includes approximately $23 million related to our acquisition of Demandware.","This was up 26% in dollars and 27% in constant currency, when excluding a year-over-year FX headwind of $35 million. Sequentially, deferred revenue had an FX headwind of $41 million. This was the largest sequential deferred revenue headwind we have ever seen. It highlights the dramatic effect that currency had at the end of Q2.","In the quarter approximately 78% of all subscription and support related invoices were issued with annual terms. Q2 benefit to deferred revenue from the change in billing frequency was less than one percentage point of growth.","Moving on to guidance. Just as FX had a significant impact on our Q2 results, we now expect FX pressures to persist for the remainder of the year with a full year revenue headwind of approximately $100 million to $150 million. In this context, I am pleased to raise our full year revenue guidance to $8.275 billion to $8.325 billion. At the same time we are making minor adjustments to our operating model to absorb and integrate recent acquisitions in order to deliver the profitability we committed to. As such, we continue to expect non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.93 to $0.95, which implies approximately 70 basis points of non-GAAP operating margin improvement.","Finally, with FX volatility we have discussed, we are updating our full year operating cash flow guidance to a year-over-year growth rate of 20% to 21% which allows us to remain on track for our first $2 billion cash flow year. For Q3 we are initiating guidance for the revenue of $2.11 billion to $2.12 billion, non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.20 to $0.21, and year-over-year deferred revenue growth of approximately 20%.","To close, we delivered solid results in the second quarter and I am very pleased to be raising our top line guidance while maintaining bottom line guidance for the year. As Keith said, with our strong pipeline of new business and with Dreamforce in October, we have a great set up as we move to the back half of the year and I look forward to welcoming many of you at Dreamforce in October. And with that, we will open up the call for questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley.","Keith Weiss","Keith, you mentioned some weakness at the end of the quarter, I was wondering if you could dig into that a little bit for us? Was it, from like a competitive impact, was it in any particular product segment? Anything you could give us in terms of color, in terms of what happened at the end of the quarter, and to the degree to which it's going to persist into Q3 into the back half of the year? And then, Mark, if you could talk to us, Mark Hawkins, if you could talk to us about how much of that conservatism for the weakness at the end of the quarter is implied into the guidance that we have for Q3 and Q4? Particularly the implied billings guidance for Q3?","Keith Block","Yes. Okay. Keith, thanks for the question. So, listen, we had a solid quarter. Our results were good. We did have some weakness and some softness, if you will, in parts of our business in the United States. As I had mentioned in my earlier comments, we conducted a very very detailed operational review which is, by the way, part of our normal cadence. It's what we normally do. But we took a deeper look given that we had some softness in parts of the U.S. And, look, at the end of the day what I would boil this down to is just a bit of blocking and tackling. And we have taken a look at it, we have made the adjustments, we have looked at our playbooks. We have tightened up on a few things. But in these quarters, things push out, things pull in and that\u2019s happened in every single quarter that I have ever been involved with and I think many of you know that I have been in this business for over 30 years.","So as I said, we have taken a look at the operational aspects of the business. I feel very very positive about the second half. Our pipeline is strong. Our win rates were very strong in the quarter. Our level of engagement has never been stronger. In fact, over the last two weeks I have spent time with three of the CEO and COOs of the top ten U.S. banks in the United States. And all of them are talking to us about transformation and raising their level of engagement with customers and they view us as a trusted advisor and they want to know how we can help them. They are talking to us. They are talking to Salesforce, they are not talking to other customers.","So when I look at the leadership team that we have in place, which has been a very high performing team historically, when I look at our second half pipeline, when I look at our level of engagement which is unprecedented, I feel very very strongly about the second half of the fiscal year.","Mark Hawkins","Yes. Let me pick up on the second point, Keith, the questions you asked there around DR and you asked about billings. Let me just talk about our DR, deferred revenue. Obviously, we have some impact for the foreign exchange. We talked about having such a impact in Q2, it's the biggest sequential change that we have seen ever in the history of Salesforce. So it has to be factored in appropriately. The other thing that I know you will get, Keith, also is the [indiscernible] seasonality and the compounding effect that we talked about at Dreamforce last year, we showed all the map and the multiyear trend that\u2019s happening there. Of course, we would look at that as well.","When I level it up, basically, and say that we think it's appropriate. And when we look at the overall topline demand of revenue growth as described, I am just pleased to be able to have -- this is the third time this year that we have raised our annual guidance for revenue for the year. And we are doing that predicated on all the things Keith talked about, the second half pipeline. Looking at things like our market share. We continue to gain momentum based on the most recent market share data that was released. Win ratios. But at the end of the day, what I am most pleased about doing is doing that for the third time in the face of $100 million to $150 million and FX headwinds at the topline and yet we are still doing a third raise. So I think we have a good setup, as Keith described, and obviously we have to factor in all the things he covered. That\u2019s my point of view. Hope that helps.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs.","Heather Bellini","This question is for Marc Benioff. Marc, there's obviously been a lot of news coming out of Salesforce over the past 90 days. You also had a bunch of comments in the press surrounding LinkedIn. I guess, what I'm wondering is, the last time I believe you set out a big public goal for the company was your $10 billion target several years ago, which obviously, looks like you'll trip over very soon. I'm just wondering if you could share with everyone your vision for the company as you look out over the next three to five years? How you're thinking about the company's revenue potential and how important M&A will be going forward in achieving those goals? Thank you.","Marc Benioff","Well, Heather, I really appreciate that. You know specifically to the M&A question, when we came into this year we didn\u2019t really have M&A on our forecast and the reason why is, because when we look at doing M&A we look for really strategic, great companies that are one of a kind, and also that we are going to get a great price. Then we have a tremendous process in our company that includes our board of directors, M&A committee as well as our internal corporate development group. And when we looked out, we didn\u2019t see that happening. But then there were some pretty big changes that happened in the market and the first one I know, you covered, which was that LinkedIn did not have a great quarter and their stock dropped by 50%. And when that happened, it really triggered our process because all of a sudden they -- a great company that is a unique asset, that\u2019s strategic, was available at a great price.","So we made a bid for LinkedIn and another company as you know, Microsoft, made a bid, and Microsoft outbid us. And that happened for a lot of different reasons but we thought that that was a great asset at a great price. Then as the market continues to evolve, we had an incredible situation occur which, very similar, which is a company that we coveted for many years, Demandware, was all of a sudden approached by another company and they tried to acquire Demandware. And it came to our attention, would we want to buy them, and we put in a bid for Demandware because, again, it's a great company. It was a great price. Tremendously strategic fit for our company and our future, ecommerce platform. And I have just come back from a trip to LVMH who uses Salesforce for CRM and is also standardized on Demandware, and they said, those two solutions combined that\u2019s all they needed to manage all their customer information.","That was enough to me to go the board and say, look, we have been approached by Demandware. This is one of a kind opportunity, there is no other leader in cloud ecommerce. Our customers like LVMH, like others I could go through, are using Demandware. We should acquire this and we were successful in that bid. Now as the summer kind of rolled on, I did not expect to get a call from someone who I have incredible respect for, Bret Taylor, who is the CEO of Quip. I have followed his career for many years, I try to have dinner with him once a month. Everyone knows the incredible work he did with Google Maps. Everyone knows he was the CTO of Facebook and he had accepted an investment from Salesforce to this company and we were talking about the possibility of Salesforce acquiring his company and him joining our team as one of our top technical leaders. And that\u2019s a dream that this company has had for several years.","Everyone here and many people in the industry as well covet and love Bret and when we had that opportunity, we took that. And so, our beginning of our fiscal year plan not to acquire any companies all of a sudden turned into we acquired two very important companies with Demandware and also Quip. And we have also found a couple of other great companies as well. And this M&A window, I talked about that I think on the last call, openly in the press, seems to have opened for the year. I think it will probably close, probably at the end of this calendar year. But it's been incredible time for us to acquire some phenomenal assets and I have never been more excited about Salesforce and our product line and coming into Dreamforce, like I said is, just awesome.","And specifically on the goal, well, I am not giving forward guidance of course but, yes, we are, you are right, you can do the math and so can I. We are about to get very close to being able to start talking about our $10 billion year. We are not doing that on this call, and you can see it in our quarter numbers that when we pass through that, we are going to be taking a very aggressive goal to double the company. I am very committed to topline growth, as you know. I am also very committed to bottom line growth. I will not grow the company without also growing the bottom line and we have proven that, and you can see that on the press release that\u2019s in front of you that the top and bottom line have grown really well this quarter and we will continue to do that and will continue to do that while being able to participate in this M&A environment. Because, as you can see, not only did we buy the companies, but we also beat our numbers. So we will continue to execute that. I hope that answers your questions.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ross MacMillan with RBC Capital Markets.","Ross MacMillan","One for Keith. First of all, if I think I heard right that the Demandware revenue went into the Marketing Cloud segment. So if I took that out and looked at it organically, it seemed that that cloud decelerated to maybe something in the low 20% growth range. And I was just curious, Keith, if the Marketing Cloud in particular was an area of softness in the quarter or if there were any other dynamics going on there that are leading to that business decelerate here?","Keith Block","Yes. So thanks for your question. Obviously, some of this, and Mark Hawkins can discuss it, but some of that effect would come from FX. But, look, generally speaking, we are still very very excited about marketing cloud. I think as you know, we have had a strong push on industry focus and retail is one of our top industries. Marketing cloud obviously plays a big role there. And when you add Demandware in concert with marketing cloud from a portfolio perspective, that just means that we are bringing a very very compelling solution to retail. So we continue to be very competitive with Marketing Cloud. We are locked in a lot of deals. Our win rates have remained the same. And, Mark, I don\u2019t know if you want to make a comment on the FX component?","Mark Hawkins","Yes. No, I think there is that and the only comment I would add is, as recently reported, we continue to take market share in this area as well and that bodes well and it supports our win ratio.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank.","Karl Keirstead","Maybe I'll start with Keith. Keith, you mentioned the second half pipeline looks pretty strong, it gives you confidence, but the 3Q deferred revenue and hence billings guidance doesn't imply that much strength actually. So are we to interpret your comment that you're looking at a fairly strong 4Q print? I guess, that's my question, I'll stop there. Thanks.","Keith Block","Yes. Let me address the pipeline issue and then, of course, Mark, if you want to weigh in, that\u2019s fine. So we are coming into a second half for the year where we feel very very strongly about our pipeline. Of course we have got our big event with Dreamforce coming up in October and that obviously will help supercharge our quarter and we get an incredible turnout from our customers and our partners. But we feel very very strongly about that pipeline. And what gives me so much confidence about the second half is not just the pipeline but it is also, as I mentioned earlier, the level of engagement that we are seeing.","I mentioned the three executives that I recently spent time with. I will tell you a very quick story about the gentleman named Stephen Hemsley, who is the CEO of UnitedHealth Group, who spent hours with me talking about his vision for healthcare and his industry and why he was committed to working with us. Hence, signing agreement with the quarter. But there are dozens and dozens of those conversations that are taking place. Marc recently came back from Europe where he was surrounded with other CEOs, and he may want to comment on, talking about the opportunity to drive transformation in customer engagement in their businesses.","So I think the level of engagement is very strong. The pipeline feels very very good. As I mentioned earlier, again, this is a very high performing leadership team that we have. That has delivered quarter in and quarter out and, obviously, I have enormous confidence. We all do in the company and those folks. And with respect for the forward guide, I will refer that to Mark Hawkins and let him respond.","Mark Hawkins","Yes. Absolutely. Karl, I think at the end of the day, when you take the most significant FX sequential headwind to deferred revenue that we have ever experienced in Q2, obviously that has to be factored into our overall plan. All the context that Keith gave you as well gets factored into our plan for the second half. But certainly in Q3 we had to factor in the foreign exchange and don\u2019t forget what we talked about, I know you know this well too, the continued compounding effect of invoicing that we described mathematically, at Dreamforce continues, and those are things to think about as well. But, certainly, the FX has a real bearing.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with UBS.","Brent Thill","Keith, on the deals in Q2 that slipped in the U.S., it seems like, just implying from your comments that those deals are still in the pipe. You didn't lose them competitively, that it's just a matter of timing. It wasn't an issue of those deals going somewhere else?","Keith Block","Yes. So I want to make sure that I am very clear that what we saw the softness in parts of the U.S. business, it was at the end of the quarter. Really in July. And our win rates continue to be very very strong. As far as these deals that slipped, again, typical of my experience, some of these deals will close in the next quarter or the next quarter, or the next quarter. None of these deals are going away. None of these deals have been lost. They may take different shapes and sized and forms but all of these deals are very very much in play.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Merrill Lynch.","Kash Rangan","I guess a fair question to Marc Benioff, given this potential about three years back. Three years back or so, I think your Q1 new business was a little weak and everybody was worried on Wall Street, and then subsequently the next three or four quarters your billings growth rate went from 17% to 19% in that quarter to, well, north of the high 20%s, 30%s. So is it just a temporary phase with slippage of deals or could there be some broader macroeconomic forces at work that have a fair bit of probability. Just wanted to get your feel for that? And also secondly, more strategically, what could be the impact of Einstein? Could there be a replacement cycle within your base or new TAM ops that you think could be opened to Salesforce that were previously not available? Thank you so much.","Marc Benioff","Well, thanks, Kash. And you are right, and you know, I mean we have been -- Keith and I had a lot of conversation about this because Keith and I have both been in the enterprise software business for 25 years or more, 30 years, and I think we both started at Oracle in '86. And you do get a quarter now and then when some specific geography, in this case the United States, has some softness, and it's just the nature of enterprise software and that\u2019s where we are. I don\u2019t attribute it to any other factor than that and that\u2019s just, it is what it is and you move on to the third quarter and assess your pipelines, and ours are full and rich. And you assess your competitive position and our win rates are strong and you look at where your innovation cycle is and we have never had a bigger, a new product cycle as your question indicates, which is that when we roll into Dreamforce, we are going to have incredible release of Einstein. You are going to see dramatic enhancements to our Salesforce Lightning platform. Now mobile capabilities and enhancements with Salesforce1.","Of course, the productivity tools available through Quip which is remarkable live documents that everyone has downloaded and started using Quip, whether it's on your phone or your iPad or on your laptop. I mean it's just a remarkable piece of technology. And then we, of course, have some of these incredible new platforms that we did not have a year ago, like Ecommerce Cloud. So all of that together provides for a very exciting Dreamforce. And in regards to how we price it, you have seen that Sales Cloud continues to do really even though it's a monster in terms of revenue. And one of the reasons that growth continues is because we have these amazing options available with Sales Cloud like, of course, Pardot, we all know that, which is an incredible product that we picked up when we bought ExactTarget three years ago.","We also have another amazing option on Sales Cloud which is CPQ or SteelBrick, which is another amazing option that we picked up last year. And there will be another amazing option of Einstein for Sales Cloud to give you this incredible intelligence. So you are going to see some awesome capabilities. You can also have those kind of options available with it. For example, Analytics Cloud will have the Einstein option as well to make machine intelligence part of your analytics journey. So there is a lot of exciting things coming for Dreamforce, and nobody likes to softness in any particular region. This did seem quite isolated, in my opinion, to the U.S. Like I said, we really saw some great growth and deal flow in the United States but we did get a big of softness at the very end of the quarter. And then we had a great performance in Europe, we had great performance in Asia Pacific, we had great -- Japan had a record quarter and a record month in July.","So it's just, it's in incredible part of the enterprise industry and it's something that you learn to not only just manage through but use to make your company stronger and stronger and stronger, which is exactly what we did the last time that we saw that which was in the quarter that you talked about.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alex Zukin with Piper Jaffray.","Alex Zukin","So maybe, Marc, one for you, kind of on this theme around digital transformation projects. As you speak to CEOs, do you sense, at least in the U.S., any change in the pace of those digital transformation projects? And then, maybe one for Mark Hawkins, within your framework of growth and profitability, what is the triggering mechanism to kind of start showing incremental leverage if there is some moderation in kind of growth?","Marc Benioff","Well, it's a great question. Last week I was with a lot of customer CEOs. CEO of Unilever and ABB, and Coca-Cola and PricewaterhouseCoopers, and the CEO of Bank of America. And in each and every case, those customers are not only absorbing more and more of our technology than ever before but they are getting more aggressive about their digital transformation. I mean today ABB, which is an incredible manufacturing company based in Switzerland, they have deployed now more than 20,000 users and are connecting all of their machines and building an incredible customer network using Salesforce. When I look at the work that Brian is doing at BofA, again it's a huge fundamental transformation of his business to be a customer first and to be digital and to be integrated.","And both of those companies and the other companies I have mentioned have chosen Salesforce as their CRM platform to do that work. And I could go through dozens and dozens of others that I think that that pace, not just digital transformation but what I would say is customer transformation. Creating a customer first environment that is intelligent and mobile and one that allows their companies to build these one on one relationships with either their BtoB customers or BtoC customers as well. This is a pace of change that I have never seen and I don\u2019t think that there is a company that we are working with today who is reducing their digital transformations. If anything, I think almost every single one that I met with this quarter and I have even spent a couple of weeks in Japan this quarter, are accelerating it.","Mark Hawkins","So, Marc, let me pick up the second part of the question. Alex, thank you for the note on, for revenue, operating margin framework and how do we think about profitability and triggers and such. As Marc said, we think about that a lot. Growth is number one and as we showed this quarter, whether it be at the bottom line as we are showing for the year with our guide, operating margin expansion is important to us as well. Very consistent with our framework. Clearly, when you think about the trigger points of that framework, it's growth rates and we think about those three categories. And what that brings to mind for me, for this quarter and this information that we are sharing with you, we have a guide that\u2019s in the 25%ish revenue growth rate for the year. Again, as we said, the third raise of the year and that\u2019s what that number looks like.","And then, of course, what we haven't talked about as much is an $11.8 billion of billed and unbilled deferred revenue that grew, a big number at 28% in aggregate. So we think about growth a lot. We think about profitability a lot. We think about the revenue framework. It's very much intact. You have heard from Marc and heard from me but clearly, it's keeping growth number one but also delivering a profitability consistent with that framework. But clearly growth is the trigger.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI.","Kirk Materne","First for Marc Benioff. I guess a follow-up on Alex's question around your conversations around digital transformation. Did those conversations already start gearing into AI as well? Meaning, I'm curious with Einstein coming out, do you think that the customer base that's already thinking about digital transformation, are they asking questions about AI from you all? And then, Keith, just on your commentary around the pipeline looking good, as you mentioned at your last company, you have been around this industry for a while, your last company had a modest seasonality in the fourth quarter. Are we just starting to see more seasonality in the business as well as you guys get into larger deals? Thanks a lot.","Marc Benioff","You know, I will tell you that you are absolutely right and it's obviously one of the reasons that we have invested so significantly in artificial intelligence. We strongly believe that when we look at the future of Salesforce, when we look at the future of our industry, of course we have seen the evolution from the cloud. We talked about that on many calls. We have talked about social, we have talked about mobile. I think we are really now evolved into kind of four key areas and my employees and executives all know that I feel very strongly around this. But of course the absolute first one is intelligence. That is companies demand that your software is going to be intelligent, smart. That you are going to have machine learning and deep learning and machine intelligence built in. That it's going to be excellent. That that machine intelligence is going to be declarative as well as programmatic. That you are going to leave no customer behind. If a customer is a programmer, they can use it. If a customer is non-programmatic or what we call declarative, they are going to be able to use it.","This is very important going forward and I really believe we are going to have the best artificial intelligence platform in the industry. We have phenomenal executives, phenomenal minds. The progress so far has been incredible. And I think when you see Einstein, you will see that it is on par and capable to any other AI platform that you have seen like Watson and others. But with Einstein it has these capabilities like non-programmatic capabilities as well as programmatic capabilities that is built into our applications as well as being independent. And I think that will be very powerful.","Two, platform. I think everybody knows that I strongly believe you can't just build a platform today -- can't just build an application, you have to build platforms. And these platforms also have to be declarative as well as programmatic. And I of course am biased, but I believe that our Lightening platform is the best in enterprise software. You can build applications that run on any device, whether it's any phone or any tablet of any PC, or any type of IoT capability. And I believe that Lightening will be an incredible capability for us going forward.","And three, is mobility. That is Salesforce now has millions of users on its mobile platforms. I know many people on this call use Salesforce1 every day. We have many other key mobile technologies like Salesforce Inbox and others available as well and mobility remains a huge focus for Salesforce. When you come to Dreamforce, you are going to see more and more capabilities on mobility as billions of users around the world go online on their phones. They want to be able to do that with Salesforce run their business from their phone and Salesforce1 remains, I believe, the absolute, most popular application development and deployment vehicle for mobile.","And, finally, productivity. We have to have productivity built in. All of our applications need to have core productivity applications, whether it is email, like with Salesforce Inbox or spreadsheets or word processors like Quip, live documents. All of that has to be an integrated part of what we are doing. We believe that strongly. We have obviously done a lot of great work with Microsoft as well, with their products. We have now our own product in this category. And this is going to be really important for us going forward and it's the reason that we bought Quip because we believe the productivity is the fourth leg of the stool and that when you look at artificial intelligence, platform, mobility and productivity, and then you look on top of that our core applications in sales, service, marketing, community, analytics, apps, IoT and ecommerce and you could even break productivity out as its own application category. I think all of you know productivity itself has a huge TAM, $26 billion a year TAM. Those nine applications, differentiated by these four capabilities. That\u2019s how I look at where our product line is going and I hope to be able to articulate that in a much simpler, much easier to understand way when we get to Dreamforce for our customers.","Keith Block","Again, just to respond to the second part of the question. As you know over three years ago Marc and I had many many conversations about coming onto Salesforce which I was super excited about and I continue to be super excited about being here. But a couple of the charters, coming on board here, was obviously to continue the outstanding operational excellence of our broader market or SMB business. But really to accelerate into the enterprise, and I think we have made excellent progress there. But as you continue this SMB business and accelerate into the enterprise, of course you are going to be balancing out the portfolio. And by definition, the nature of enterprise typically is back ended in the second half of years.","So, I think it's natural to expect that that will drive some degree of seasonality for the second half of the year. But we run a balanced portfolio of business and that\u2019s what we strive to every single day.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan.","Mark Murphy","Question for Marc Benioff. So essentially all of the major services firms experienced problems recently, and that included Cognizant and Infosys and Genpact, and a whole bunch of others. And I do believe several of them mentioned softness in digital projects in the month of July. I think some of that was attributed to the big banks that were counting on a midyear interest rate increase which did not happen, partially as a result of the Brexit vote. I'm just curious, do you look at all of that as purely coincidental relative to what you mentioned at the end of the quarter in the U.S.? Or is it possible that there was a bit of a brief pause, maybe a little macro induced, that just potentially may have pushed some number of transactions out of Q2 and perhaps leading into a bigger second half of the year?","Marc Benioff","You know, I honestly really believe in kind of manifest destiny that this is always about us. You know that we always have to just look at our own ability to execute. And as we have driven this company forward over the last 18 years that, I always come back to that. And that this is the most important thing is that regardless of what the environment is, whether it's incredibly strong and robust, or whether if there is a bit of softness. Regardless of what geography you are in, whether it's the U.S. or Japan or whatever it is, that it's ultimately always about you. If you always went to kind of these macroeconomic views and, well, well, it's a low growth rate environment or it's a low interest rate environment, or it's this or it's that, you are not able to really just focus on and work on your own business.","And as an example of that is Japan this quarter. You know I spent two weeks in Japan. Japan is a very exciting IT environment. It still is a huge part of the enterprise software industry and we are just still getting going in Japan. We are at the beginning of our Japan journey. And, yet, we have these incredible relationships with some of Japan's most important companies and government agencies. And that\u2019s how I look at it. If I had listened to what everyone told me about Japan in the last 18 years, we wouldn\u2019t even by doing business there. I just don\u2019t believe in that stuff. I believe that you get what you focus on and you have to answer the question what do you want and then you focus on that and achieve it and keep it positive. Well, Keith, how do you look at it?","Keith Block","Well, I think you are right. I think you have to stick to your netting and our netting is all around the customer and growth for the customer. Specific to our partners, I go back to the statistics I mentioned earlier. We have 38,000 partner certifications. That\u2019s up 25% year-over-year. And I don\u2019t think it's appropriate for us to comment on what they are seeing in their business or the softness in their business. But I think the indication of that level of certification growth says that they are betting on the long-term on Salesforce and I think that is something we all should pay attention to.","Marc Benioff","You know, Keith, you had some amazing transactions in the quarter we talked about. UnitedHealth Group is one of them specifically. But you had some of the other really amazing companies that you were personally in. I know we have talked a lot about the financial service companies that you spend a lot of time in in the quarter and you obviously also travelled a bit during the quarter as well. So when you are out there, what are customers really zeroing on in terms of what they want from Salesforce?","Keith Block","Well, I think the thing that really aligns us with our customers is, if you look at the CEO agenda and of course you are CEO, number one is growth. And followed very quickly with shareholder value and then of course the concern about the employee and the community and all that stuff that\u2019s important to us and our values. But the CEO agenda is [indiscernible]. I mean you listen to our story and our messaging and the value that we bring to customers on a daily basis. It is growth. So there is great alignment there. So when I am talking to financial services institutions, they are talking about streamlining processes around customer engagement and reinventing themselves. And they know that we are an innovative company and because we drive innovation and we inspire customers, that\u2019s why they want to have those conversations with us. And so that\u2019s pretty typical of what I see on a regular basis.","Marc Benioff","So I think that\u2019s consistent with my viewpoint as well.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sarah Hindlian with Macquarie.","Sarah Hindlian","It's Macquarie. First, a question for Keith and\/or Mark B. I don't want to beat a dead horse and I certainly understand the nature of large deals and enterprise software playing at this level and size in particular. But I was wondering, as you guys examine the business do you think there was any impact from the roll out of Lightning with its improved feature set and the subsequent price increases that may have caused some slowness at the end of the quarter? If you guys could talk a little bit about how the market is receiving Lightning prices that would be really helpful to us? And then a second one for Mark H. In regards to billing, Mark, how much of a factor is Demandware in your outlook? Thanks guys.","Keith Block","Let me take the first part of that. So really with respect to the price increase that we have been talking about for some period of time. When I did these full, and I do mean full, operational review of the U.S., every element of the business was inspected. Six ways to Sunday. And naturally one would go to, well, was it pricing, was it this, was it that. And I will tell you, we did not see a material impact on the quarter in pricing. And the thing that we view on the pricing change that we have made, is that it really demonstrates value for our customers and that was the impetus behind it. Mark, I don\u2019t know if you would like to comment?","Mark Hawkins","Yes, sure. Let me just carry on in terms of the second question, Sarah, that you has asked about, in terms of Demandware. Let me just call out that Demandware, in terms of revenue we talked about, when Keith and I were on the call in June, that we expect revenue of around $100 million to $120 million for the year. That\u2019s what we called out when we set that guide. And so that\u2019s something you should think about as you think about billings from that standpoint. By the way, I just want to call out, we are super pleased to have Demandware. It's just an exciting, adding functionality and a unique asset, as Marc called out, that we are super happy to have. So I hope that dimensionlizes and helps you to think about how to factor that into billings.","Operator","The last question comes from the line of Derrick Wood with Cowen and Company.","Derrick Wood","For Keith, I mean you guys put more product out this year than we've ever seen. You've got SteelBrick, IQ, you've got new Wave apps, you've got Wealth and Health Cloud. Now you've got Commerce Cloud. I think IoT Cloud is coming out. Certainly a lot in one year. And I imagine bringing all these products out, go to market varies by product. But you've got to do things like train the sales force, train the channel, may be create new dedicated teams, may be there's new ELA type of engagements now coming into play. So I'm curious, do you think all these product releases may have weighed on near term sales productivity or sales cycles? And then, what's your strategy over the next 6 to 12 months to help push greater adoption of these newer products?","Keith Block","Okay. Great. So that\u2019s an excellent question. Here's the way I would look at this. Number one, I am a big believer in innovation and it is at the core of this company. It's part of our DNA. And we are blessed to be, all of us, to be working in a company that drives innovation. And all these products that you mentioned, whether it's IQ or SteelBrick or our IoT cloud, these are things that our customers are very very excited about. And by the way, the reason why we build these products or acquire these companies is because not only do we have a great strategy but part of that strategy is because we listen to our customers and we think about what's important to their future.","So we have a whole portfolio of solutions. We will continue to enrich that portfolio of solutions. Part of the strategic weapon, if you will, of this company is the focus, a relentless focus on what we refer to as an enablement, which is training our people. We have an incredible platform for that called, Trailhead, which you will continue to hear the company talk more and more and more about because it's an exciting way to enable employees. And we use it on ourselves and all of our people are subject to building trails and taking advantage of the incredible training and content. And I think we do that as well as any company that I have ever seen. And I think that\u2019s one of the things that really separates us from the past.","So, again, when I talk about our optimism around the second half and our pipelines for the second half, it is because we have such a rich portfolio. It's because we have a high performing organization and it's because we know how to enable these people. Now, enablement, I will tell you, for a company like us there is no end of job. So I think we all as leaders in the company, no matter what line of business we are responsible for, we wake up every day and think about what's the best way for us to onboard our employees, what's the best way to continue to educate them on new product releases, what's the best way to make sure that we are prepared so that they deliver value to our customers. And that\u2019s why enablement is so important to us as a company and that\u2019s why we focus so much of our attention to it.","Marc Benioff","Well, thanks so much. Thanks everyone for joining us today. That concludes our call. Just to remind everyone that we will look forward to seeing you on October 4 at our Analyst Day, and of course updating you again in November for our third quarter results.

Sir, you may begin your conference.","John Cummings - Director-Investor Relations","Thanks so much, Katie. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us for our fiscal first quarter 2016 results conference call. As always, our first quarter results press release, SEC filings, and a replay of today's call can be found on our IR website at www.salesforce.com\/investor. We'll also post the highlights of today's call on Twitter at the handle @salesforce_ir. With me on our call today are Marc Benioff, Chief Executive Officer; Keith Block, President and Vice Chairman; and Mark Hawkins, Chief Financial Officer. Marc, Keith, and Mark will share a few prepared remarks, and then we'll open the call to questions.","As a reminder, our commentary today will primarily be in non-GAAP terms.

You can just see why I'm so excited because I'm thrilled to report that we had just an outstanding start to our fiscal 2016 and just a great building on the phenomenal momentum from last year. In this quarter, we surpassed the $6 billion annual revenue run rate, and we did that faster than any enterprise software company in history, and we could not be more excited. Our current outlook puts us on track to reach a $7 billion revenue run rate later this year, on the way to being the fastest to reach $10 billion, which is our dream, and something that we are very focused on.","I'd like to share the results from the quarter, and revenue for the first quarter rose 23% from a year ago to more than $1.5 billion and constant currency revenue grew even faster at 27%. I mean, you can look at all the other top 10 software companies, no one is delivering this kind of performance. And, as I said, we deliver this amazing growth as we push through the $6 billion annual revenue run rate milestone.","Deferred revenue grew more than $3 billion, up 31% year-over-year and 36% in constant currency. And the dollar value of book business on and off balance sheet is now $9.1 billion, $9.1 billion. That's an increase of nearly $2 billion since last year. That is a very clear indicator of the strength of our future business.","Even as we delivered this outstanding pace of top line growth, we also improved non-GAAP operating margin by nearly 200 basis points this quarter over last year. And as you can see, we're not just focused on growing the top line, we're also growing the bottom line. All of this translated into another outstanding quarter in operating cash. We delivered more than $730 million in operating cash flow which is up 54% year-over-year, and that's just an astonishing number. Given our outstanding first quarter results, I'm thrilled to announce that we are raising our guidance for both our top and bottom line for fiscal year 2016. The high-end of our revenue guidance puts us on track to finish the year at $6.55 billion, and we're increasing our non-GAAP EPS guidance by $0.02 to $0.71 at the high-end of our range.","As you can see, our strong revenue, deferred revenue, operating cash performance, along with the incredible momentum of our Customer Success Platform puts us on a trajectory to be the fastest enterprise software company to deliver $10 billion in revenue.","We're achieving this level of performance and growing faster than the competition because we have a unique platform, really a unique company designed for today's connected world, designed for only one purpose: helping our customers connect with their customers in a whole new way, and ultimately creating customer success.","Today, this call is taking place right here from the great city of Chicago. When I've been meeting with some of our great customers today like State Farm and Northern Trust; I've met with hundreds of customer from around the world in recent weeks; I've been on a tour; and next month I'm going to be taking that tour to Europe and spending the summer once again learning from our customers in the region and hearing about all the great things going on over there, and you can just see our European business is just awesome. And every CEO I've met with is feeling the impact of this technology moving faster and faster. Customers and employees are expecting deeper levels of engagement, they're creating these amazing one-on-one journeys, they're more automated, intelligent business processing, everything is going mobile, everything's available on their phone and soon right on our wrist.","Well, they're relying on Salesforce, with our metadata-driven technology platform, our six core clouds and incredible, incredible employees, our customer success services team and ecosystem of software developers, systems integrators, service providers, all of them, the whole ecosystem, helping our customers move faster and transform their businesses to be more successful than ever before.","That's why Gartner has ranked Salesforce as the worldwide market share leader in the CRM market for 2014, continuing more than a decade of growth and market share gains, while Oracle and SAP continue to fall behind.","Well, we can certainly see that from their quarters, can't we? You can see the tremendous growth we've had across our six clouds and how we're outpacing the competition and taking market share at the expense of our competitors.","Sales Cloud continues to be the market share leader in SFA by far, and on its own one of the top pure play enterprise cloud companies by revenue in the world.","Service Cloud displaced SAP in the quarter and is now the market share leader in customer service and support. Sorry about that, SAP. And the Marketing Cloud, which was born out of our acquisition of ExactTarget two years ago, is now the fastest-growing top five marketing vendor according to the latest Gartner report, taking market share while every other top five vendor is losing.","Community Cloud continues to grow its market share and we now have some of our largest partner communities in the world, dozens with more than 100,000 members. Our Wave Analytics Cloud has become a real game changer for us. I've never seen more excitement about this product. I've been demoing it everywhere I go. It's not just an analytics app, it's a platform with a whole ecosystem of partners and development environment that lets you basically build any kind of analytics app our most customers want.","You saw us deepen our relationship with Microsoft this quarter with the launch of Wave Connector for Excel which transforms Excel spreadsheets into visual, dynamic graphs in the Analytics Cloud with just a click and we had a phenomenal demonstration of exciting new technology that we're building with Microsoft at their Build Conference, and we also saw more revelation of that at Ignite. And we also launched Analytics Cloud for the Apple Watch, the first enterprise app for Apple's amazing new wearable, and we're really thrilled that Apple featured Analytics Cloud as one of the marquee apps in their launch.","The Salesforce1 platform, the foundation for everything we develop, has been ranked by Gartner as the leading enterprise Platform-as-a-Service for the second year in a row. We've seen tremendous momentum in the quarter with customers, with partners, with ISVs, now more than 2 million developers building apps on top of our platform, and that's reflected in our customer adoption and usage rates. They are just soaring.","We delivered 211 billion transactions for our customers in the quarter, 211 billion, up 79% from a year ago. That is astonishing. That's an average of more than 3.4 billion transactions every single business day, unprecedented in the technology industry.","Before I close, I want to mention the great work of Salesforce Foundation. Foundation now supporting 25,000 non-profits and NGOs and we've distributed more than $85 million in grants, and our employees have volunteered almost 1 million hours of community service, an increase of 300,000 hours since Q1 of last year; just amazing.","Now I'll hand it off to Keith, who's in London, where he'll be keynoting our London World Tour event tomorrow. And this is the largest cloud computing event in the region, with more than 13,000 people registered to attend. Now, the World Tour that we're all on will follow a record \u2013 that we've had record attendance stops already in Melbourne and Amsterdam, here in Boston, in Chicago, and Toronto. You're also welcome to join us for upcoming Salesforce World Tour stops. The next one's going to be Washington, D.C. next week, which will be incredible. And then we head to New York for Salesforce Connections, the largest digital marketing event in the world. And our New York World Tour which will be June 16, June 17, and June 18. You're not going to want to miss that. More than 15,000 people will join us. And I'll be keynoting the World Tour event in Paris on June 25 and in Munich on July 2.","If you haven't seen what's been going on in Europe, it's worth seeing, just an amazing level of momentum with the cloud. And mark your calendars for the largest enterprise technology conference on the planet, Dreamforce, you may have heard of it. That's going to be happening September 15 to September 18 in San Francisco. That is an event I'm quite sure you will not want to miss.","Okay, Keith?","Keith G. Block - Vice Chairman & President","Thanks, Marc. Greetings, everybody. It's great to be here in London, as Marc said, I love London, I love Europe. We all love Europe. And the reason why I'm here is because the business, as Marc suggested, is absolutely accelerating. This is now our fastest-growing region, where we've now exceeded $1 billion in revenue over the past year, so congratulations to the entire team for really an incredible achievement. Suffice it to say that's proof positive that the investments that we've been talking about and making internationally are absolutely paying off.","As Marc said, tomorrow I'm hosting our London Salesforce World Tour. We will have a record turnout expected. I've got a number of special guests joining me on stage, including executives from Barclays and British Airways, BSkyB will be with us, John Lewis, Vodafone, and many others. We're also going to have an organization called CoderDojo, which is really a very incredible non-profit here in the U.K. which teaches young kids how to code and adopt technology, so this is going to be a great event, really a world-class event. And as you heard from Marc, we had a world-class first quarter. We are firing on all cylinders. You can see that in the results, and this is a great way for us to start our fiscal year. It really does set a terrific tone for the rest of the year and we're very excited about it.","So we continue to broaden and deepen our relationships with our customers of all sizes, all industries, and all geographies. And what's interesting is they're transforming their business models. And they're doing this by leveraging our Customer Success Platform. And this is leading to larger deals in all segments and deeper, more meaningful strategic relationships. In fact, we hit an all-time high in seven-figure-plus transactions of any first quarter in the history of the company.","We saw some incredible wins in the quarter. I'm particularly proud of the fact that 30% of our top deals were net new customers. And I'd like to share a few of these stories. The first one is a company called Bouygues Telecom. It's one of the largest telecommunications companies in France. It's a great new relationship that closed in the quarter. And they selected our Customer Success Platform to create an omni-channel digital experience for their 13 million customers across all their call centers, stores, and online; very exciting.","We also signed a major new deal with a transportation company, really one of the world's greatest brands in their category. They were using on-premise legacy technology from Oracle. And in the quarter, they decided to go all-in with the cloud, and they plan to put Salesforce1 onto mobile devices and into the hands of more than 10,000 field employees around the world. It was really just an incredible win. And I couldn't be prouder of the team for bringing in this new strategic relationship.","Also one of the largest deals in the quarter was a net new relationship with a Fortune 500 leader in retail. They were looking to consolidate all their tools and campaigns and selected our Marketing Cloud as their company-wide digital marketing platform. As Marc mentioned, the Marketing Cloud is absolutely on fire. It is the tip of the spear for us with B2C companies, and it really is in almost every conversation that we're having with senior executives around the world. It's really terrific.","We're also seeing some significant expansions with our existing customers, Tyco, which is a brand that I'm sure many people recognize. It's a great example. They're a $10 billion leader in protection and security. They've been using Sales Cloud for years and they expanded their relationship with us in the quarter with Service Cloud and Community Cloud and Analytics Cloud and the Salesforce1 platform. So their vision is to really bring all their teams together and transform their organization, and build a global Customer Success Platform across sales and service in marketing.","Barclays, another great win. They started with Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, and Communities. And now with the addition of Analytics Cloud in the quarter, Barclays will be putting real-time customer intelligence into the hands of their corporate bankers so they can make faster and smarter decisions right from their mobile devices. It's a great example of impact from the Analytics Cloud. And in my keynote tomorrow, Barclays is going to demonstrate how they use Salesforce to transform their broker journey and build the most qualified digital workforce in financial services.","And speaking of financial services, we expanded our relationship with JPMorgan Investment Management. This is a customer that has been using us in a few of their divisions. And now they will be significantly increasing their deployment of Service Cloud as their CRM platform across their growing mutual fund divisions. So JPMorgan is yet another great example of how financial services companies are moving to the cloud.","Other new wins or expansions in Q1 include the Bank of America, Dentsu, Expedia, Hitachi, Japan Post, John Deere, Medtronic, TELUS, T-Mobile, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Western Union, and Zurich Insurance. So this is really, as you can see, a pretty incredible list of brands, and it shows the continued traction we're getting in our industry strategy. You're also going to see our industry strategy come into greater focus this summer when we introduce our first industry solution in wealth management.","Now I will tell you we've been able to achieve this level of customer success and growth because we are, without a doubt, the trusted enterprise cloud. And with this incredible culture of relentless innovation, a 16 year track record of customer success, no other technology provider is in a position to say this; we are all about customer success. And conversely, if you were paying attention to SAP's event a few weeks ago, the CIO of the world's largest retailer, which is an SAP customer, she said she hopes to see an SAP implementation in her lifetime. And I think that spells it out. That is the difference between on-premise and the cloud. It doesn't sound like customer success to me. And we are all about customer success. So we're seeing a growing trend of SAP and Oracle customers who are coming to us and talking with us and working with us to wrap around their legacy solutions. They want us to be the agility layer to these legacy technologies. They want us to be able to unlock more value from their investments. And ultimately it puts us on a path to a complete replacement in their front office. In fact, I will tell you, a few days ago I had a meeting with the COO of one of the world's largest banks, and they were incredibly excited about a strategy to ultimately replace all their legacy customer-facing systems with our Customer Success Platform. So that's very exciting for us.","So before I close, I want to talk about our ecosystem. Marc touched on it a minute ago. It continues to thrive. We're the largest enterprise cloud ecosystem in the world. We hit a huge milestone this quarter with over 3 million total installs from our AppExchange. We continue to develop more strategic ISV relationships on both the horizontal and vertical basis. And as I travel around the world and speak to customers and partners, it's pretty clear that the relationship with our global and regional SIs, it's just never been stronger.","So with that, I want to thank the entire team at Salesforce and congratulate them for delivering just a terrific and strong Q1 and a great start to the year. So, over to you, Mark.","Mark J. Hawkins - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Keith. As you've heard, we had a strong start to the year with solid growth across the board. And from a top line perspective, we delivered Q1 constant currency revenue growth of 27% year-over-year. Foreign exchange continued to impact revenue with year-over-year headwinds of approximately $52 million and a sequential headwind of around $17 million. Our geographies also delivered strong growth on a constant currency basis with the Americas growth of 27%, EMEA growth of 28%, and Asia Pac of 27%.","Dollar attrition for the first quarter excluding Marketing Cloud was approximately 9%. Now while we continued to deliver industry-leading top line growth, we're thrilled to have expanded our Q1 non-GAAP operating margins by 197 basis points year-over-year. And by the way, this is the fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement. Our top line outperformance along with the improved expense controls allowed us to deliver non-GAAP EPS of $0.16, up 45% over last year, and $0.02 higher than our guidance. Additionally, we made great progress toward GAAP profitability in the quarter including reducing our stock-based compensation to below 10% of revenue.","Now turning to cash flow, we delivered record operating cash flow in the quarter of $731 million. Now that's up 54% over last year. And as we previously discussed, we anticipate that Q1 will continue to be the largest cash flow quarter. Now, this is due to our seasonally strong Q4, and the compounding nature of our new and renewal business in the fourth quarter and the associated collections of our Q4 invoices in the first quarter.","Now, free cash flow defined as operating cash flow less CapEx was $660 million, and that was up 60% over Q1 of last year. Looking at deferred revenue, we delivered another strong quarter with growth of 31% year-over-year, excluding an FX headwind of $69 million. Deferred revenue grew 36% over last year. On a sequential basis, deferred revenue benefited from an FX tailwind of approximately $18 million.","As a reminder, we calculate our FX on revenue using the average rates throughout the quarter; however, for deferred revenue, a balance sheet item, we use the spot rate on the last day of the quarter. Keep in mind, we conduct business in multiple currencies, including the euro, the yen, the British pound, the Australian dollar, and others. While the dollar exchange rates for most of these currencies were roughly flat at the end of the quarter, a stronger pound drove a slight sequential tailwind to the deferred revenue in Q1. In the quarter, 75% of the value of all subscription and support-related invoices were issued with annual terms.","Now let's move on to guidance. With our strong first quarter results, we are raising our outlook for the full year. We now anticipate revenue to be $6.52 billion to $6.55 billion for 22% growth at the high-end. Now this guidance includes an anticipated FX headwind of about $175 million to $200 million. In addition to raising our top line guidance, we're also pleased to be raising our bottom line as well. We expect full year non-GAAP EPS of $0.69 to $0.71. We continue to expect year-over-year non-GAAP operating margin improvement of 125 basis points to 150 basis points this year.","With our strong Q1 operating cash flow, we now anticipate full year operating cash flow growth of 24% to 25%. For Q2, we anticipate revenue of $1.59 billion to $1.60 billion, non-GAAP EPS of $0.17 to $0.18, and deferred revenue growth in the mid- to high-20% range. Our guidance implies that OI&E will continue to be a net expense and we assume a non-GAAP tax rate of 36.5% and that we will not make significant acquisitions.","To close, we are very pleased with our fast start to fiscal 2016. We delivered outstanding results across the board, our top and our bottom line outperformance drove record cash flow and our backlog of book business positions us extremely well for continued growth while we continue to deliver our non-GAAP operating margin expansion commitment.","On that, I'd like to open up the call for questions, operator.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We'll pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster. And your first question comes from Kash Rangan [Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.].","Kasthuri G. Rangan - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Wow, you're the champions, congratulations. Marc, question for you on the Analytics product. What kind of attach rate do you envision for the company, or what kind of attach rate would you be pleased with for the Analytics product as it relates to the deployment of Sales Cloud and perhaps even the Service Cloud in rough timeframe? And secondly for you, CFO, Mark Hawkins, any impact from invoicing duration, early renewals of deals in the quarter that might have helped you one way or the other? That's it for me. Thank you.","Marc Russell Benioff - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, thanks, Kash. And I'll tell you, on the Analytics Cloud, I've never been more excited about a product. I don't think there's a customer that I've spoken to this quarter who hasn't been interested in the Analytics Cloud, and I can't imagine a Salesforce customer that's not going to end up with the Analytics Cloud. This is just a breakthrough product. There's never been an Analytics product that's been built from the ground-up as a multi-tenant cloud service built on a metadata platform that gives you the ability to build apps and deploy them rapidly and I think you're going to see some amazing things with the Analytics Cloud when we get to Dreamforce as well. We've had some huge technical breakthroughs in our ability to build an ecosystem around the Analytics Cloud and we plan to show those off. We've only been in this business about 90 days. I don't know why we didn't get this in a lot earlier. Keith, what's been your experience with the Analytics Cloud this quarter?","Keith G. Block - Vice Chairman & President","Yeah, Marc, I'll tell you, we've had some great wins in the quarter, Barclays, that I mentioned earlier, they were an Analytics Cloud user. Tyco is now an Analytics Cloud user. I will tell you, my entire distribution organization walks around with Analytics Cloud on their mobile phone. They use it every day to run their business, and learn more insights about their customers. If you talk to Mark Hawkins, he will tell you that this finance organization at Salesforce, they are all using Analytics Cloud, our Employee Success organization is all using Analytics Cloud. So this is a very compelling new product. Marc is absolutely correct. Within two weeks of announcing this at Dreamforce, we were closing deals in very large enterprises. So the market reaction has been very good. People are very excited about it. And there's no reason why this should not be in virtually all of our entire installed base.","Mark J. Hawkins - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Great. And so, let me take the second question here. And first before I do, Keith, I totally agree, we use the Analytics Cloud constantly to run our business and it's exciting within Salesforce. In terms of the billing frequency early renewals question, Kash, I think nothing dramatic to share. We made continued improvement and the percent of annualized billings pretty in sync with the rate of improvement that we've made. Before it's been a modest improvement and as we called out we had 75% of our total billings were annual compared to, I think, 69% last year, very in sync with the kind of pace of improvement that we've been making and really nothing extraordinary to report on that side. We're just very pleased with the total deferred revenue and the revenue together, so.","Operator","And your next question comes from Jason Maynard from Wells Fargo.","Jason A. Maynard - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hey, good afternoon, guys, and congratulations to a strong start to the year. There's obviously been a lot of talk in the press about the future of the company over the last few weeks. And I know you can't comment on that, but I think the big question, and probably one that customers are asking themselves is: what do you guys think about the prospects for your own business? I know you have a goal of $10 billion in revenue, but there's an old saying, maybe you trade a player a year early versus trading him a year late. And I wonder if customers and investors and all of your stakeholders are saying, what does Marc see after $10 billion? Do you see a runway to being a multi-teens billion, $20 billion company? Is that something that you have the line of sight on and have the confidence in your TAM, your products, and your management execution to reach?","Marc Russell Benioff - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I really appreciate that question, Jason, thanks so much. And when I started this company 16 years ago, we wanted to do three things. We wanted to create a new technology model now known as the cloud. We wanted to create a new business model, which is singularly focused on the success of our customers and helping our customers to create new ways to connect with their customers and help them to innovate and transform their organizations. And, three, we created a new philanthropic model with 1% of our equity and 1% of our profit and 1% of all of our employees' time and, of course, that was very easy because we had no equity, we had no profit, we had no time, but I would say at this point, I mean, Salesforce has far exceeded our expectations over the last 16 years.","But people are always overestimating what they can do in a year and underestimating what they can do in a decade in our business, and when I look out what I see is we are absolutely committed to being the fastest software company ever to $10 billion. And I'm sure, Jason, if you look at your model now with over $9 billion in deferred on and off the balance sheet, you can start to model exactly how fast that's going to be. I mean, it's record time. And we're going to squarely be very, very shortly the fourth largest software company in the world. Now, when that happens, we are really targeting one company to surpass, which is SAP. Fortunately for us, their kind of lackluster growth, execution and lack of innovation in their core products as we saw in their conference this quarter, well, you know what? They're an easy target, and that's our next goal.","But we've got our minds squarely on the prize which is the $10 billion revenue run rate, and that's step one. Step two is go past SAP, and I think we can absolutely do that. I'm personally committed to making that happen. That's my dream. And I am super-motivated every single day to get up and run a company that is doing well, by doing good. We're not just a software company, Jason, that's building products and selling them every day like the rest of the guys. We are a software company that is working hard to make the world a better place, not just through our innovation, but through our philanthropy and through our commitment to equality for all, and also to inspire other entrepreneurs and other companies to do the same.","I'm sure your experience is the same as mine, when I meet all these new companies, they've all got philanthropy built into their model and they've all got fired up entrepreneurs who are going to add value to their community, not just build products. And I hope that in some small way we've inspired the industry to kind of get off its kind of traditional stinginess and to get out there and do something for other people. And that's what I'm excited about, and those are my goals going forward. Does that help clarify that?","Operator","And your next question comes from Ross MacMillan with RBC Capital Markets.","Ross MacMillan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks a lot, and my congratulations, as well. I actually had one for Mark. Mark, you just delivered close to 200 basis points of margin expansion in what I think was the toughest foreign exchange headwind quarter this year. And that number's above your full year guidance, so I was just curious as to how we should think about the pace of underlying operating expense growth as we progress through the year? And does the guidance imply that you're going to accelerate the rate of investment as we look forward? Thanks.","Mark J. Hawkins - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Ross, first of all, thanks a lot for the note. And yeah, definitely we feel great about the quarter. I think, and one of the things I would say on the \u2013 certainly, the operating margin expansion fourth quarter in a row, we feel really great about the fact that for the full year we guide this 125 basis points to 150 basis points on an even bigger revenue base, right? Because we raised the revenue base and we're showing even more EPS. But I think from an operating margin viewpoint, one of the things that you should think about is that this squares very nicely with our revenue operating margin framework in terms of the rate of growth and the rate of operating margin expansion. So this fits very nicely. But what we're doing also, Ross, as you touch on, is we're making sure to make the investments that are essential to making sure that we grow not only this year but in 2017 and well beyond to fulfill the vision that Marc had articulated earlier on the call. So we feel good about this. It's squarely within the framework. We're delivering on our commitment even on a higher base.","Operator","And your next question comes from Brent Thill with UBS.","Brent J. Thill - UBS Securities LLC","Good afternoon. Keith had mentioned an all-time high for seven figure deals in Q1 and I'm just curious, Mark and Keith, are there any common patterns you're seeing out of these deals when you look across like taking multiple clouds, larger seat counts, all of the above? It'd just be great to get a little bit of color in terms of what you saw and what's rolled out in Q1.","Keith G. Block - Vice Chairman & President","Hi, this is Keith. Listen, thanks for the question. It really is to a certain extent all of the above. I mean, we're clearly signing up some net new logos in some of the largest enterprises in the world. Some of that is one cloud, some of that is many clouds, but I think the overwhelming sentiment here is that there's a real interest in a long-term strategic relationship with Salesforce. And it is a trust-based relationship and a value-based relationship. And customers really want to leverage our Customer Success Platform to help their customers succeed. So it's a pretty common theme around the Customer Success Platform and industry orientation. I mean, if I look at the kind of larger deals in the quarter that I just went through here, many of these were in financial services, many of these were in telecommunications, some in public sector. And these are kind of the strike zone industries that we're focusing our attention on. So we are hitting our cylinders, all of our cylinders, in terms of getting the mind share of these large enterprises, really enterprises of all size and scale and all geographies, and we're running our playbook and we're just executing well.","Mark J. Hawkins - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, I might just add on that to Keith's point. When I think of the patterns exactly what Keith said. But what I really like, Brent, is just this notion about how much our customers are embracing the Customer Success Platform on a multi-cloud basis. Keith and his team knocked out some huge deals that he talked about. You look at like Bouygues, they picked up Service Cloud, Community, Marketing Cloud. You look at JPMorgan, you look at sales, service, marketing. You look at Tyco that Keith talked about. You look at Sales, Service, Community and Wave. I just think it's exciting to see that pattern be so pronounced. So that's the pattern that I see, Brent.","Operator","And your next question comes from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs.","Heather A. Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thank you so much. I had two questions. I guess, the first one is if we go back to Jason's question for a second about the $10 billion sales target, I was just wondering, Mark, if you could just give us a sense, how do you think about what the profitability level of the company might look like, knowing that there's a lot of different things that could happen? But how do you think about the profitability level that you'll be able to achieve, once you get to that $10 billion target that looks increasingly in sight. And then the other question I had, Mark, was just Service Cloud had a big sequential acceleration this quarter. I'm just wondering, are there some factors you could share with us that are causing this? And where are we in the rip and replace of those massive Siebel call center systems that were put in place in the early 2000s?","Mark J. Hawkins - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure, let me jump into this and we'll see if folks add in here. But, Heather, the $10 billion vision Marc articulated, you can see us driving toward that. You're hearing loud and clear. I think that the profitability will be a function of the speed of how fast we get there. And when we talk about the revenue operating margin framework, very much it's correlated with the rate of the growth rate compared to the operating margin expansion. That's a higher level of framework that remains intact. We continue to execute that. And you can see it even in this period in the guidance for this year. But I do want to call out something, Heather, to try to get more context to the spirit of your question. When I look at the unit economics of what's happening in our business, the lifetime economics, I clearly see a business that's in the mid-30%s in terms of operating margin. And that is really I think what we should think about when we get the business at a mature level of growth in the mid-30%s. That would be the key point. And in terms of the Service Cloud, one of the things that was most pleasing to look at is just the amazing amount of market share we took, that Gartner just took, where we made real progress on the market share, where we ripped over 300 basis points, we displaced basically SAP and are making real progress. But let me just see if there's other commentary on that.","Keith G. Block - Vice Chairman & President","Yeah, let me just weigh in here. So one of the themes that we're hearing as we go around the world and we're talking to CEOs, is that companies are transforming themselves and they're differentiating, Heather, around service. If you talk to GE, if you talk to Philips, they are trying to transform themselves into service companies. And they're leveraging our Customer Success Platform to do that. It's very interesting because it's an opportunity for them to change their business model. They're leveraging our platform and many of them are asking us to wrap an agility layer around their existing legacy systems. Now that could be a homegrown system, but more often than not that's Oracle and SAP. And ultimately, the game plan here is to surround them and eventually replace them. So the overwhelming message from customers is they want to get out of the maintenance game. And they want to get into the innovation and transformation game. And that's what they see in the Customer Success Platform, and that's what's going on in the marketplace.","Operator","And your next question is from Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI.","S. Kirk Materne - Evercore Group LLC","Yeah, thanks very much. Since Keith is staying up late with us in London maybe I'll ask him one about Europe while you're over there. Clearly, that business is accelerating. You guys have put a lot of investment into the region in terms of new data centers. Can you just talk about the adoption trends of customers in Europe? Are you seeing them adopt a cloud at a time? Or are you seeing them jump really straight to the Customer Success Platform? And is there anything you all need to do over there over the next 12 months to really see it continue to accelerate or have you put a lot of the programs in place that we should continue to see you all harvesting some of the investment you made over the last 12 months or so? Thanks.","Keith G. Block - Vice Chairman & President","Yeah, yeah. Thanks for the question. Look, obviously, international expansion is a big part of our strategy and EMEA is a big pivot point for that. And we continue to invest. We've rolled out all these programs around industry orientation, additional resources, Solution Selling, a program that we call Ignite, and leveraging this incredible ecosystem that we have built around our partners with a huge focus on customer success from both our own resources as well as the ecosystem partners. And customers are enjoying a bit of our seed and grow strategy but some of them are talking about the wholesale transformation as kind of a long-term strategy with bite-sized chunks, so we are getting incredible traction. We're very, very proud of the results that we're seeing in EMEA and it's pretty clear that our investment strategies are paying off here.","Operator","And your next question comes from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley.","Keith E. Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Excellent. Thank you guys for taking the question. And again, very nice quarter. Two questions from me. One, there's been a ton of speculation out there in the marketplace around the potential of M&A around salesforce.com. How do you guys \u2013 and maybe this is a question for Keith Block, how do you keep your guys focused on the price, focused on execution when there's all that sort of speculation going on externally? And then the second question is just about the industry solutions that are going to be rolling out later this year. Is there anything incremental that you guys need to do in sort of building out the distribution around those industry solutions? Or is that pretty well in place and is it just really putting product into place with what has been a build-out in the vertical distribution capability?","Keith G. Block - Vice Chairman & President","Yeah, okay, so thanks for the question. Look, first and foremost, is we don't comment on these rumors. And our focus has always been and will always continue to be on customer success and that goal of the $10 billion, and as Marc said, in going after SAP and passing them.","So our people are motivated. They are very excited. It's part of our culture, a big part of our culture, to focus on customer success and our people feel really, really good about what they're doing and the success that they're enjoying with our customers.","With respect to our industry strategy and execution around the product, for the most part, we are already starting to pivot around an industry orientation as we're organized in the field. So our distribution model is gradually moving towards an industry orientation over the last couple years. It's hard to believe that in June it will be my two-year anniversary. But over the last couple years, we've started to pivot toward vertical selling organizations, and that is kind of a natural tip of the spear for these solutions that we'll be bringing out.","Operator","And your next question comes from Steve Ashley with Robert W. Baird.","Steve M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thank you very much. I'd just like to ask about the Community Cloud and the success you're having there, if we could get some more color around. Are there vertical markets where you're having more success, are there use cases, and are you able to find any synergy with your other cloud offerings? Thanks.","Marc Russell Benioff - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think one of the really great things about our Community Cloud is that it's so tightly integrated with our Sales and Service and Marketing Clouds, and that when our customers buy our solution, they're not just buying a silo, but they're buying part of an integrated solution.","I think when you look at some of our core deployments of our Community Cloud, companies like Home Depot, and you can see that if you go to community.homedepot.com or many of the other ones, well, you see that we're tightly integrated with their employees, we're tightly integrated with their partners, and it's been a huge boom for them to be able to increase their store traffic, that they get actual results. I mean, I know that because Salesforce uses our Community Cloud every day, but I don't know a customer that's not planning to deploy this product. I mean, this is something that's extremely important for every company whether they're a B2C company or a B2B company in being able to aggregate their customers and unite them with their employees.","As you know, we have a very strong integrated system of engagement with our core product, and that system of engagement is tightly integrated with our system of record, and is now with our Analytics Cloud tightly integrated with our system of intelligence, so a system of record tightly integrated with a system of intelligence, tightly integrated with the system of engagement, and that system of engagement is extended into those core customer offerings through our Community Cloud, and that's the right architecture. That's the right product. It's had phenomenal success, super high growth rate and I expect continued great performance from it this year.","Operator","And your next question comes from Sarah Hindlian with Brean Capital.","Sarah Hindlian - Brean Capital LLC","Hi, gentlemen. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the quarter. I had a couple questions for you. When you're signing customers on Wave, and I realize it's still very early, but do you see this as a product where you're encroaching more on legacy BI vendors or is this an additive to your deployment or a pure greenfield opportunity? And then lastly, I'm just wondering what kind of momentum you're seeing in Marketing Cloud, which is obviously growing nicely at 29%, but not as fast as services and platforms, and so I'm wondering where do you see that trending this year?","Marc Russell Benioff - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, number one, on Analytics Cloud, the answer to your question is, all of the above. I mean, when we're in there, I presented that product today to two executives, one of the world's very largest insurance companies here in Chicago, and they've never seen anything like that. And I don't think anything like it exists.","They probably already own every product, you know? And I don't think that's a reason why they wouldn't buy ours, because they don't use that product. Those other products are really isolated and used by analysts, and they're not analytics for everyone. They're certainly not analytics for the rest of us. They don't run well on iPhones and Android devices. They don't run on the Apple Watch. They don't run \u2013 you can't spin it up instantly in our cloud environment.","So this is just an extraordinary offering, and it is only \u2013 again, I've obviously seen the next two versions, and it is just going to get better and better and better. And we're going to just bring in a very deep ecosystem of developers and apps, and we're going to exercise our magic in regards to building a really broad use of it, and by Dreamforce, you'll see something just awesome. So I hope that answers \u2013 I hope that answers that question.","Mark J. Hawkins - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And then there was the second one, Marc, on the Marketing Cloud momentum.","Marc Russell Benioff - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Oh, yeah, Marketing \u2013 well, I mean, I can't say enough good things about the Marketing Cloud. I'm sure you see that we took this great company in Indianapolis, Indiana, ExactTarget. We've worked with their core management team and transformed that to just turning it into just an exceptional offering, with Journey Builder and our customers to build journeys for their customers, they can build journeys for their employees. They can build journeys for their partners, journeys for their products. I mean, we just used it ourself to build something called Adoption Manager for Salesforce1, and when you are using Salesforce1, you now have the ability to turn on something called Adoption Manager, you're basically turning on Journey Builder in the Marketing Cloud and I know that we saw almost 50% increase in adoption rates using that technology.","And I encourage every one of our customers to move to that model as part of that. I also am extremely excited by the phenomenal success of our Pardot team in Atlanta which is part of our Marketing Cloud. They have done a great job as well, which is the B2B marketing solution.","So we not only have a tremendous B2C solution that has applicability throughout the enterprise, but we have an unbelievable B2B marketing solution and both of those are just executing incredibly well. For those of you who know we have taken a long time to build our Marketing Cloud strategy through \u2013 primarily through acquisition, and we have now had a couple of years to be able to operate it, and we couldn't be more excited about the future. Some of our largest transactions in the quarter were done with the Marketing Cloud and I don't know a customer who's not looking at it. You know, it's just \u2013 it's what you need to be able to connect with your customers on a day-by-day basis, and minute-by-minute basis.","And I'll tell you, I'll give you a little insight into where we're going for Dreamforce, which is, and as it relates to the Marketing Cloud, you know everyone probably who's listening to this call might be wearing some kind of a wearable. All those wearables are probably evolving very rapidly; probably all of us will be wearing some kind of different wearables in the next two years. Everybody knows that we're moving to this incredible Internet of Things that's part of it. We call it an Internet of Customers. Everything is going online. Everything's got an API. We're generating more data than ever before. 90% of the world's data was generated in the last two years. A lot of it is coming out of this machine data.","Well, as all these things are happening, of course, you want to be able to connect everything and then have these directed journeys and messaging and be able to put everything online and have everything deeply integrated into your CRM systems. I don't think there's any other company in the world that's going to be able to show what we're going to show at Dreamforce, which is this idea that everything is connected, everything's online, and that you're basically able to stay in touch with your customer minute-by-minute as it's happening. And that's just all possible because of this Marketing Cloud. So I couldn't be more excited. I mean between the Marketing Cloud, between the Analytics Cloud, between some exciting enhancements that are going to be coming for our core Salesforce Service Cloud offerings and next-generation solutions there, we've got a lot of very, very exciting things planned for September.","Mark J. Hawkins - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, and if I might just add, Marc. Sarah, just in closing, too, when I see 29% in USD and you throw on four points or so of constant currency adder, that's a really attractive growth rate. And the last point I would just say is if you see the Gartner data that just came out, of the top five people in the Marketing Cloud arena, every one of the top four lost share. We gained share. You've seen these persistent trends like SAP losing share again. People are voting with their dollars for the Marketing Cloud.","Operator","And your last question comes from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays.","Raimo Lenschow - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, it's great that Barclays is a customer. And it's great that I get the last question here. Thank you. Mark, a quick question, now that we know the breakout of the different clouds, we see that the Sales Cloud, if I adjust for currency, is still growing strong in double-digit. Can you talk a little bit about the opportunity there? Remember, that's kind of where a lot of people said, \"oh, it's getting mature, your market share is really high,\" but you keep growing, putting up these really healthy numbers despite the size. What are you seeing in that market? Thank you.","Mark J. Hawkins - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Okay, so let me just touch a little bit, and I think maybe I could turn this over to Keith. Certainly I think you hit it right. We were certainly pleased to see the growth rate that was posted in U.S. dollars. Again if you add on the constant currency, you've got a business that's at scale. It's a $2.5 billion business growing really attractively, and again, just the gold standard in the world with lots and lots of opportunity. I'd just like to turn it over to Keith, I know, on other commentary on this as well.","Keith G. Block - Vice Chairman & President","Yeah, thanks, Mark. Listen, I think we've all seen the commentary and the pundits in the marketplace. I think the numbers speak for themselves. This is a terrific product. It is a flagship product, and we continue to take net new logos all over the world in all shapes, size, forms of companies in all industries. And arguably you can say it's the most loved sales app in the world. So we see an awful lot of interest in our Sales Cloud as a standalone product, but also as part of the Customer Success Platform. And it goes back to customers really want to be more engaged, have deeper relationships with our customers and drive success. And that's what this Customer Success Platform is all about .So this is a $2.5 billion run rate business. As a cloud, it's one of the top eight standalone largest cloud companies. We keep getting accolades from Gartner. So this is really a very successful product, a very successful solution as a standalone and it's part of a greater solution. And that's what customers want. They want impact, they want transformational value, they want innovation, and they want success for their customers. And that's why we're so well positioned and we still have so much momentum.","Marc Russell Benioff - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And I'll just add to that, I guess we kind of gave it away, but tomorrow at the London Show, you're going to see Barclays profiled. And we've got an incredible demo as part of the keynote and video, you're going to see some amazing things. You're also going to see some amazing things about some other amazing European customers who we've had substantial breakthroughs with including Vodafone and Coca-Cola. I mean, if you look at this customer list in Europe, which includes ABB and BMW and BT and AXA and Philips and Unilever and so many others and then you look at all the incredible work that we're doing with these non-profits and NGOs in Europe, I mean, we've got just an impeccable brand. We've done a great job with Europe's largest and most important customers. Of course, we also have a very strong small- and medium-sized business there, as well. You're going to see it firsthand. I mean, you're going to see 52 Salesforce demo stations there showing all kinds of amazing things and spots. I mean, you've got a huge ecosystem. No one else has this. They've kind of forgotten how to be successful in the software business. And they're the only innovation SAP has is in rhetoric. They should try writing some software.","John Cummings - Director-Investor Relations","All right, Katie, I think we can wrap up. So thanks everyone for joining us on the call today.

Thanks, John, and welcome everyone to Dreamforce 2013 and we are coming to you live right here in the Moscone Center in San Francisco. Today, we are kicking off our 11th annual Dreamforce, now the world's largest software conference with an all-time high of more than 130,000 registered to attend with today's early start and we expect even more tomorrow. And I am thrilled to report just absolute monster quarter and a new all-time high in our financial results for the third quarter.","Just four years after delivering our first $1 billion year, salesforce is now the first enterprise cloud computing company to report more than $1 billion in revenue in a single quarter and we are projecting more than $5 billion in revenue next year. Pretty awesome. A phenomenal milestone for salesforce and the entire new cloud industry. Congratulations to all of our customers, our partners and our employees for this amazing achievement.","Now let's get to the financial results. Revenue for the third quarter rose to nearly $1.08 billion, up 36% from a year ago. There is just no other Top 10 enterprise software company that is delivering this kind of growth and we are delivering this growth while pushing through the $4 billion dollar revenue milestone and we are heading right to $5 billion. I don't know any company who has delivered a $1 billion quarter and was growing 36% in our enterprise software industry.","Deferred revenue rose by more than 34% year-over-year finishing the quarter at more than $1.7 billion and operating cash flow rose to $138 million for the quarter, an increase of 30% year-over-year. The dollar value of booked business, on and off the balance sheet, is now nearly $6 billion and our momentum going into Dreamforce positions us for a strong finish to the year. We are increasing our revenue guidance range by $30 million to finish fiscal year 2014 now at over $4.05 billion, a growth of 33% year-over-year and we are well placed for even more success next year.","I am thrilled to announce that we expect to deliver fiscal year 2015 revenue in the range of $5.15 billion to $5.2 billion. Yes, it's true. salesforce.com is going to be the first enterprise cloud company to deliver more than $5 billion in revenue next year. s","salesforce.com has always been a catalyst and evangelist for innovation in enterprise software. We have pioneered the shift to cloud, social, mobile and connected. And today, with the next-generation of technology, our customers are connecting with their customers in entirely new ways. We are now entering the third wave of computing where everything is connected and soon there is going to be 50 billion connected products on the internet of things and behind every device, every app, everything is a customer.","That's why customer relationship management have just never been more important than it is today. You have got to be ready to sell, to service, to market to your customers regardless of where the customer touch point is. This is really the internet of customers, where companies connect to their customers through the next generation of devices, apps and services.","Here at Dreamforce, we are unveiling Salesforce1, a radically new customer platform that was built from the ground up to deliver the speed, agility and power of salesforce, but re-imagined for a social, mobile and cloud and connected devices world. A world that we call the internet of customers. It's the world's first CRM platform for everyone, for developers, for ISVs, for admins, for end-users and, most of all, for your customers. So you can go social, mobile, cloud and get connected.","At my keynote, we will demonstrate how Salesforce1 connects everything, all of apps, all of your devices, all of your customer data to completely transform the way customers sell, service, market and innovate. And you know what, in today's world, everything has changed. One of the key tenets of Salesforce1 is that was built API first. It was built mobile first. It was built first for the phone. It was billed first for the tablet.","Everything has changed and we realized at salesforce.com that we have been completely changed ourselves in that why customers have made Salesforce the world's number one CRM platform and clear leader in each of our four core markets with the Sales Cloud, the Service Cloud, the ExactTarget, Marketing Cloud and the Salesforce1 platform.","Our flagship Sales Cloud is the world's number one platform for sales and it's helping customers drive phenomenal sales performance and the top line growth that everyone wants. Partners rated the Sales Cloud of the undisputed leader in its magic quadrant for sales force automation for seven straight years and I am thrilled that Salesforce was recently recognized by CRM Magazine. It's a number one CRM solution and every single category again for enterprise, for midmarket and small business and I want to give you a little secret.","If you want to know how salesforce.com deliver that phenomenal growth at this phenomenal scale, it was through the Sales Cloud, [via through the] Salesforce and the Sales Cloud is a great example where is the key to growing our business at this incredible rate.","The Service Cloud is the world's number one platform for customer service and support and the only platform that ties customer service with sales and social and that's why salesforce.com is the recognized leader in Gartner's Magic Quadrant for customer service as well as the leader in the latest Forrester Wave for customer service and you are going to see some phenomenal, phenomenal demonstrations of the service cloud and the new version of the Service Cloud built on Salesforce1 in tomorrow keynote.

It's the only platform that makes it possible for companies to bring in customer data from any source and deliver highly personalized digital marketing to any customer across any channel whether it's e-mail, social, web, mobile or any type of product.","With the combination of ExactTarget and Radian6, Buddy, media and social comp, we have a powerhouse in marketing which is why Facebook recently gave the ExactTarget Marketing Cloud it's word for innovation.","The Salesforce1 platform is the number one platform for developing next-generation cloud apps and the only solution rated by Forrester as a leader in every single public cloud platform category that's why the growth of our developer and ISV communities been nothing short of spectacular and you are going to see just an increase in that as you see our new Salesforce1 platform now with 10 times more APIs than ever before.

Now, first, I am delighted to announce, we have extended our relationship dramatically with Hewlett Packard in the quarter. HP started sales transformation with the Sales Cloud, and now with the addition of the Service Cloud and the Salesforce platform, HP plans to transform the way they connect with their entire ecosystem of customers and partners. Just moments ago, Salesforce and HP also announced a new strategic partnership in cloud computing to jointly develop and market the Salesforce HP Superpod.","The Superpod gives our largest customers the choice to have all the speed of performance of the salesforce multi-tenant software with a dedicated instance running on HP hardware and you will hear more about our partnership tomorrow when Meg Whitman joins me on stage with my opening keynote to announce the Salesforce HP Superpod. It is phenomenal what our two companies have done by working together.","Another great capability in the quarter came out of Roche, the global leader in research-focused healthcare. In the quarter they decided to standardize globally on the Service Cloud for its major divisions to create a 360 degree with every customer. Roche will be able to connect their diagnostic equipment with doctors and lab technicians giving them real-time alerts and notifications on patient tests and with salesforce communities powered by the salesforce platform Roche, we will be able to instantly connect sales reps and service engineers and all of their healthcare stakeholders to create a community that puts the patient at the center of their care.","And I am thrilled to announce that we have closed an exciting transaction with Safeway, one of the largest and most important grocery retailers in North America and Safeway chose salesforce to be its new e-mail, mobile, push and notifications platform for the internet of customers. Safeway will us the exact target marketing cloud to scale its personal customer communications and deliver a consistent experience across through e-mail and mobile channels and with the salesforce platform, Safeway will be able to connect its entire team of marketers, giving them a single place to manage and track campaigns. No matter what the customer touch point, Safeway will be there to reach them with a consistent clear message using the new salesforce ExactTarget Marketing Cloud and it's a new capability to connect to the Internet of customers.","And in every one of these, examples companies are transforming their businesses with salesforce's customer technologies. Other new or add-on transactions in the third quarter include Ace Hardware, AMEX, Australian Post, Bristol-Myers, Cond\u00e9 Nast, Fujitsu, Intuit, Merck, Nippon, Nissan, Novartis, Pfizer, U.S. Department of Labor, and we also welcomed Vanguard as a new customer for salesforce. The pace at which these companies are using embracing our sales, service, marketing and platform technologies is phenomenal.","Our service continues to support and deliver transactions for customers at an unprecedented scale. I am thrilled to announce that we delivered nearly 100 billion transactions in the quarter, up 47% from a year ago, an average of more than 1.5 billion customer transactions every day. And guess what, that's just salesforce's core service. It doesn't include the 1 billion transactions every single day in ExactTarget. Nothing speaks more to the value of salesforce than the actual usage of our products with the speed, and reliability and trust that we are known for.","I look forward to seeing everyone at our Dreamforce keynote tomorrow at 9:00 AM Pacific and you better get there plenty early if you want a seat. Because with 130,000 people arriving here in San Francisco to attend this conference, it is going to be hard to get in pretty much anywhere. With some of the world's leading companies, ADP, HP, Philips, Sony and others that I have mentioned on this script are going to making major announcements and showing some phenomenal new technology in the keynote.","Now if you can't get there physically, it is also going to be broadcast live on Dreamforce.com. So tune in that way. It is just like having a front row seat, while without having one. So, also joining me on this week on that stage will be a number of special guests including Sheryl Sandberg, Marissa Mayer, Prime Minister of Haiti, motivational guru Deepak Chopra, Wayne Dyer, oncologist David Agus, UCSF Chancellor, Susan Desmond-Hellmann, as I mentioned, Meg Whitman and don't forget about some phenomenal events that we are going to have this week.","Tomorrow night, we are going to host a spectacular evening of entertainment for our annual benefit concert, the Concerts For Kids. We have raised over $6 million for our two Bay Area children's hospital, the UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital and the Children's Hospital & Research Center Oakland. And I am thrilled that Green Day is going to be headlining this event in its first private concert ever. Awesome. And with special performances by Blondie and also MC Hammer, this is going to be a spectacular event.","Also don't forget about our top customer event, happening on Wednesday night featuring Jerry Seinfeld and Tony Bennett. Look there is still time to buy tickets at www.theconcertforkids.com. I am looking forward to seeing everyone there.","And with that, I am going to turn this over to Graham to discuss the financial details of our third-quarter.","Graham Smith","All right. Thank you, Marc. We posted another great quarter in Q3, delivering outstanding growth in revenue, deferred revenue and operating cash flow. We saw strength across the enterprise and commercial businesses in both Americas and Europe, with the added bonus of ExactTarget delivering a fantastic first full quarter as part of salesforce. Let me take you through the highlights. Starting with revenue.","Third quarter revenue was $1.076 billion. That's up 36% over Q3 last year or 37% in constant currency. ExactTarget and Pardot contributed approximately $81 million to revenue in the third quarter which was well above what we had anticipated. The sales and renewals teams executed well and in addition messaging and professional services revenue were also really strong. While on the subject of ExactTarget and Pardot, let me just take a moment to provide a quick update on integration efforts. The sales teams are working well together with lead processes yielding some great new customer wins for ExactTarget and Pardot. The engineering organizations are coordinating development plans and you will see some of the initial results as soon as tomorrow's keynote, which are integrated into the ExactTarget Marketing Cloud. We are really pleased with progress today.","Looking at year-over-year growth on a regional basis, revenue in Americas grew 41% to $769 million. Revenue in Europe grew 46% in dollars and 39% in constant currency to $195 million, and revenue in Asia increased 4% in dollars and 17% in constant currency to $112 million.","Dollar attrition continued its slow and steady decline in the third quarter marking more than four years of sustained improvement and remains in the very low double-digit percentage range.","Turning to margins, our Q3 non-GAAP gross margin was 79.3% or about 116 basis points lower than Q3 last year. Our third quarter non-GAAP operating margin was 8.6% or about 118 basis points lower than last year. This is largely the result of the acquisition of ExactTarget and also the Oracle license agreement we signed back in May.","From a headcount perspective, we added approximately 200 net new employees net in the third quarter, which means we have added about 3,000 year-to-date bringing our total headcount to nearly 12,800. That's up 37% over Q3 last year. I would also like to remind people that we did have a reduction enforce of approximately 250 people early on during the third quarter.","Third quarter non-GAAP EPS was $0.09. Our Q3 non-GAAP effective tax rate came in lower than expected, which offset some of the extra investments and marketing programs we made ahead of Dreamforce in our fourth quarter. Our third quarter operating cash flow was $138 million. That's up 30% over Q3 last year. Operating cash flow was a little ahead of our expectations due to strong collections and improving ExactTarget cash performance.","CapEx in the third quarter was $73 million, up from approximately $51 million in Q3 last year. The year-over-year increase in CapEx was principally related to ExactTarget capital expenditures and new office build outs. CapEx as a percentage of revenue in the third quarter was up slightly to 7% from Q3 last year, and for the full year we now expect CapEx overall as a percentage of revenue to be about 7%. That's a little less than we had previously anticipated. Free cash flow, which we define as operating cash flow less CapEx was $65 million in the third quarter. That's up $10 million or 90% from Q3 last year.","Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with approximately $1.1 billion in cash and marketable securities. Accounts receivable was up 44% over last year to $604 million. Deferred revenue ended the third quarter at $1.73 billion. That's up 34% over Q3 last year, including approximately $65 million related to ExactTarget and no meaningful impact from year-over-year foreign exchange.","On a sequential quarter basis, deferred revenue benefited from an FX tailwind of approximately $12 million. Deferred revenue also continued to benefit from the residual effects of our multiyear invoices and from the continued shift toward annual billing. The combined benefit to deferred revenue in Q3 was approximately $67 million. That's down from $85 million sequentially and from $110 million in Q3 last year.","We were delighted to record a strong deferred revenue results for Exact Target. When we started our efforts to be more deliberate about annual invoicing in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, the deferred revenue benefit from the shift was about $150 million or about 11% of the deferred revenue balance versus the benefit of approximately 4% of deferred revenue in the third quarter results we are reporting today. Given this declining impact, Q4 will be the last quarter. That's next quarter, we will provide the next, the specific dollar impacts to deferred revenue, however we will continue to get a sense of proportion of invoicing issued on an annual terms each quarter.","In the third quarter, approximately 72% of all subscription and support related invoices. This is excluding ExactTarget, were issued with annual terms compared with approximately 65% of invoices in Q3 last year. Unbilled deferred revenue or revenue that is contracted but not yet invoiced and is off the balance sheet, was approximately $4.2 billion in Q3. That's an increase of around 40% from last year.","Turning to guidance, we are delighted to be raising our full year 2014 revenue outlook by $30 million, so the range is now $4.05 billion to $4.055 billion. That's for year-over-year growth of approximately 33%. This guidance includes approximately $180 million of revenue from ExactTarget and Pardot. That's up from prior guidance of $140 million to $145 million. The full year guidance implies fourth quarter revenue in the range of approximately $1.124 billion to $1.129 billion, again that's inclusive of ExactTarget and that represents year-over-year growth of approximately 35%.","As Marc mentioned, we are initiating fiscal 2015 guidance today at $5.15 billion to $5.2 billion. At the mid range of the guidance range is or the midpoint, I should say, of the guidance range is this initial view implies fiscal 2015 full year revenue growth of approximately $0.28. Clearly this guidance is provided without the benefit of knowing our fourth quarter new business and attrition numbers and they can both have a significant impact on the following year. So will clearly update this in February on our call. The guidance also assumes that FX rates remain in approximately the same range as they are currently.","We are narrowing the range on our full year non-GAAP EPS estimate for fiscal 2014 to $0.33 to $0.34. That's versus $0.32 to $0.34 range we gave on the last call, which implies Q4 non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.05 to $0.06. As a reminder, Dreamforce will cost approximately $0.02 cents of non-GAAP EPS and, of course, that is reflected in our fourth quarter guidance. These EPS estimates assume a full year non-GAAP tax rate of 35%, a Q4 non-GAAP tax rate of 36% and a Q4 net interest expense at a similar level to Q3.","The cash flow, we reiterate our expectation for fiscal 2014 operating cash flow will grow in the low teens percentage range year-over-year. Excluding ExactTarget, we expect year-over-year deferred revenue growth in the mid to high 20s percent range. Of course, on top of that, we expect ExactTarget to contribute about $70 million to deferred revenue in Q4. And our forecast exchange rates, we will also face a roughly 2 percentage point FX headwind for year-over-year deferred revenue growth. As a reminder, all of the underlying assumptions for our GAAP and non-GAAP guidance and a complete GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation can be found in our earnings press release issued earlier today.","All right. To close, Q3 was just another great quarter for salesforce. We saw strong execution from our sales and renewals organizations, including ExactTarget. We were delighted by the many exciting customer wins and expansions which reflects our broadening role as a strategic CRM solutions provider. We couldn't be better positioned for a strong finish to fiscal 2014 and for the continued strong growth in fiscal 2015.","So with that, we will open the call up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from Kash Rangan with Merrill Lynch.","Kash Rangan - Merrill Lynch","(inaudible) much. I think it's the 36th to 37th quarter I am following you guys as a public company. Nice to see the $1 billion mark. You have said some time that you could hit the $1 billion in revenue annual but here on a quarterly basis. So congrats on that. Marc, question for you. With respect to the platform business, it looks like we are seeing a big inflection point here, a number of developers and your optimism surrounding the ISV community seems to be ramping up. Can you talk a little bit more about what could be the impact of Salesforce1 in terms of incremental new platform opportunities that you can pursue that you couldn't before? That's it for me. Thank you.","Marc Benioff","Well, Kash, you are going to hear about it tomorrow but let me just give you some highlights. Salesforce1 is a completely new approach to our platform as well as to our sales cloud, service cloud and marketing cloud. I have been using it myself from the last six months and it's completely changed how I run salesforce.com and I think it will completely change how our customers run their company and also connect with their customers as well. And what I can tell you, is the power of Salesforce1 is all the things that our customers expect of salesforce, that is the huge ability to manage information, stored procedures, stored triggers, custom user interfaces but things that they did not think that we would feel to do we are doing.","Number one, Visualforce1. You are going to see that all the huge amount of seen all huge amount of Visualforce development that our customers have made, it's going to start running immediately on phones and on tablets. That's phenomenal and you can see that already happening. All you have to do is go to the App Store or Google Play Store now and you can get the iPhone as well as the android versions of Salesforce1 to mobile app, but all that Visualforce capability coming right down to mobile devices, Visualforce is a phenomenal technology for user interfaces and you are going to see that.","Number two, you will also see 10 times more APIs now available, because if you are going to actually write like we did with these mobile apps directly to Salesforce, you need a huge amount of new API coverage so that you can build super high functionality in your in your app.","Number three, not only via Visualforce not only via the APIs you have this phenomenal new Salesforce publisher, which looks a lot like Line from Naver. The idea is that you can have a portfolio of actions in apps to access Salesforce1 is. So what Salesforce1 is?","Number one, you can build all your own custom actions and those actions appear right inside the publisher. Number two, you can add apps directly into the publisher. Things like Evernote and Dropbox and all kinds of cool ISVs and you are going to see new ISVs appear where you have a ton of ISVs who built these custom objects and it's off the hook. Then it's not just great for developers, but it's also great for admins. You will see that there is a new app in the App Store called SalesforceA. In SalesforceA, is, A is for admins, and that app lets administrators manage their Salesforce applications for the first time right from the phone or a tablet and you can even customize Salesforce directly from SalesforceA. You are going to see tomorrow the ability to have custom branding right from SalesforceA, so you can make it exactly for your company. Then it's not just great for developers and admins, it's also great for end users as well which is super important, because you know I don't use a laptop anymore.","You know that. I don't even use an iPad. I only use this iPhone 5, and I need to run the company from that and I do and that's the power of Salesforce1, which is just tremendous capability, so you got tremendous support for developers, tremendous support for ISVs, tremendous support for admins, tremendous support for end users. Finally, tremendous support for your customers because with Salesforce communities that is the glue that connects everybody back into Salesforce1.","When you [equate] stop one of these Salesforce communities, those committees automatically then integrate into the social network that's built-into Salesforce1. You are going to see a whole new range of applications. I don't know any other enterprise software company who has built both, core apps and platform ISVs for developer support and delivered it on the phone.","The phone dominates how we use computing today, but has enterprise software made it to the phone besides e-mail? I don't think so, but Salesforce1 does it and it's a phenomenal product. We have already had this in the hands of hundreds of customers over last six months, we have been doing extensive testing on it and the feedback has been phenomenal and I expect the feedback will continue to be phenomenal to show and this is only version one, so we have plenty more planned over the next year, because as you know we are doing three releases a year.","Okay. Did you have the second?","Kash Rangan - Merrill Lynch","No. That was it.","Marc Benioff","Okay. All right. Very good. Thanks, Kash.","Operator","Your next question comes from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs.","Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs","Thank you. I had a couple of questions for Graham and one for you, Marc. I guess, one, Marc, given how successful you continue to be in the top line growth that your are posting on top of very large number, how do we think about the leverage that you can start flowing through to the model as we look out and I know that you probably don't want to give fiscal year '15 guidance on that, but if you could just share with us some qualitative thoughts.","Then for you, Graham, I was wondering if you could share with us where you are in the process of migrating ExactTarget customers to annual billing terms. Thank you.","Marc Benioff","Well, here is how I look at it, which is, you know, there's a balance between growth and profitability and we want to continue to do both. We want to continue to grow and deliver these outrageous growth numbers, but honestly we also want to continue to increase our margin. We continue to want to become more profitable. Now there's times when that slows down when we buy a company or we go through a hiring surge or something like that, but for the most part, our goal is to increase our margin and we want to continue to do that in a very strong way and we also, though, want to continue to grow this company and get it over the $10 billion revenue mark. That's also a super strong goal of this company.","So those two things have got to go hand-in-hand. We have learned a lot about how do that. You can see here, Heather. You were there with me in the client server world. You can look back, how many companies when they hit the $1 billion revenue line work delivering a 36% growth quarter. One of the results we are able to do it is because we have got that balance right. We have it right but we also know that there's more that we can do on profitability and that we are absolutely actually committed to that. And as I said, the only time that really ever gets slowed down in a serious way is when we acquire something or do one of these hiring surges.","So, Graham?","Graham Smith","Yes. On annual billings, Heather, we are really pleased with what we saw. I am not ready yet to give a ton of detail on all of the ExactTarget billings performance here. I think we want to see a couple of quarters but suffice to say, when we look at the new business trends versus last year, the annual billing percentage was up very significantly, more than, in fact, on new business. More than we had seen on our salesforce ship. So really very exciting on the new business side and of course, that shows up on the deferred revenue number. We had guided more or less flat on ExactTarget deferred revenue of $45 million and they came in around $65 million. So we were delighted to see that. It's clearly a function that we are shifting customers to annual billing.","Operator","And your next question comes Tom Roderick with Stifel.","Tom Roderick - Stifel","Hi, guys. Good afternoon. So I noticed you spoke very highly about the ExactTarget acquisition, of course, and the numbers keep coming in better than expectation. Can you just maybe give a little more detail in terms of how the topline synergies have worked here? What is bringing the numbers ahead of expectations and relative to any potential cross sell, particularly I am thinking about service cloud opportunities in retail? Can you talk about how the cross sell of that has been going? Thanks.","Marc Benioff","Well, that is phenomenal and you know, I have to say of the reasons we see this increasing growth, one of the reasons you see this kind of accelerated revenue growth this year is, we have got a lot more focused on our core mission which allowed us to cross sell more. You probably remember that a couple years ago that we were really focused on defining the social and enterprise and that was very exciting to us. A highly collaborative enterprise built on social technologies. But what we recognize was, when we went into a customer, who is the buyer of the social enterprise, and it was a little tricky to find that buyer. Now when we go in to find the sales cloud buyer, the service cloud buyer, the marketing cloud buyer, the platform buyer, we know who they are and that has been an accelerator on our growth.","We bundle that together in this approach called the customer company and that we are really the first enterprise software company to be focused on customer technologies because we know who the buyers are and our customers for customer technologies and that has really been an accelerator for us, a focuser for us. And to your point, it lets us cross sell because we have a clear point of focus with our employees that we are the customer company, we are the company that helps you to connect with your customers in the new way with the sales cloud, the service cloud, the marketing cloud and the platform built entirely on Salesforce1. And once you start to build and deploy on Salesforce1, you can have this phenomenal experience.","I was just with Jeff Immelta couple of weeks ago and he took out his iPhone and he said, you know Marc, there is only two apps that use every single day to run General Electric and one of them is salesforce. And he showed me exactly how he uses what is now Salesforce1 and I will just tell you, it just completely blew me away that I can use to it run my company, he can use to run his company. When we are customer focused executives and when we get that kind of environment where a company that has a culture so focused on their customers, we know we are going to have phenomenal cross sell opportunities. When you are here at the show, make sure you talk to our customers. You are going to see a lot of them are starting to buy multiple clouds and that's a huge compensation opportunity as well for us with our own account executives.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jason Maynard with Wells Fargo.","Jason Maynard Wells Fargo","Good afternoon, guys, and congratulations. Marc, I had a question for you. Years ago there was all these (Inaudible) of the sales force automation market and you clearly expanded tam there. As you move in and start messaging more about internet of customers, can you talk a little bit about how you guys are in solve what, I think you are hearing more in the industry that app gap, all of this sort of unautomated you know process and stuff that happens in companies that doesn't really benefit from packaged applications, maybe touch a little bit on what are you guys trying to do to, if you will, drive deeper into organizations and really close, if you will, that technology gap that so many companies have?","Marc Benioff","Well, I will tell you that that's going to be a big part of my keynote tomorrow that most companies don't know who their customers are still. I know that's hard to believe and that most companies feel that they are not ready for this social mobile cloud world and the third one is there is that app gap, which is the half of all companies who want to build and deploy mobile\/tab apps or mobile apps to their employees, customers or partners, don't know how and we are going to fill that gap and that's a huge part of Salesforce1.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brad Zelnick with Macquarie.","Brad Zelnick - Macquarie","Thank you very much and nice job, guys. Marc, with Keith Block on board, there's an expectation around visibility to drive more quarters like this one, particular by driving large enterprise deals given his background. Can you talk at all about large deals in this quarter and the large deal pipeline? Also, with all these great things that Keith should be able to deliver, how do you think about the transition risks associated with changes that he is making? Thank you.","Marc Benioff","Well, there are three things that I have been focused on this year and the three things that are critical for me are that I felt were mission-critical for fiscal year '14, one is Salesforce1, which now I can finally talk about openly and show tomorrow and get everybody on and I think it's an incredible accelerator for this company and really future proves our customers and helps them take that huge investment that they have made in our platform and they thought was kind of glued to PCs and laptops and is running now natively and perfectly in the mobile world.","Number two is, ExactTarget in the Marketing Cloud, we had seen this tremendous demand for marketing technology and we are able to analyze it together and ExactTarget had this monster quarter with us and we are feeling phenomenal about that acquisition. Three is, Keith Block. We have been after this guy for a long time and the we were very, very fortunate that he became available and he has hired several dozen executives now to come along with them into re-conceptualizing and rebuild our customer facing organization. He is on our board of directors, he is our President and Vice Chairman. He is doing a phenomenal job and I couldn't be more excited about the having him as part of our Salesforce management team. I mean it's been really a joy and I think he's absolute the best the customer facing executive ever worked within our industry.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brent Thill with UBS.","Brent Thill - UBS","Thanks. Marc, the reasons Americas and Europe are growing at twice the rate of Asia Pacific, I am just curious, if you could talk through what you are seeing in Asia Pacific? Is there some type of macro overhang or is it execution? How do you think about the gap there that you can close relative to the other geos that you just posted?","Marc Benioff","Well, for us Asia Pacific really consists of two countries Australia and Japan. Japan has been a massive country for us and so as Japan goes so does our Asia Pacific revenue. We continue to see great execution in Japan of our organization, but we also see tremendous opportunity that still needs to be fulfilled.","I was just in Japan two weeks ago. I conducted one of our events there, customer company tour, we had 4,000, 5,000, 6,000, 7,000 people there, I don't know how many. It was our biggest event ever in Japan, phenomenal. What I see is, all the same things I see around the world, which is a phenomenal opportunity for companies to automate themselves in new ways and our ability to grow this Asia Pacific line is really all about our ability to grow Japan. When we look back over the last several years in Japan, it's been tough in the enterprise world there. Yet we have grown really well. It's been much easier in the SMB world, it's constant flux back and forth. It's about building a full portfolio of customers which we have done. And you are going to see it here at this conference.","We have almost 500 guests who have flown from Japan to attend Dreamforce and I think that when you talk to them, we will have an opportunity to introduce them, I think you are going to see incredible demand opportunities for Japan. Our new Japan data center is now open. Our new office in Japan is also now open in JP Tower, which the government invited us into one of their buildings in the Marunouchi district, which is traditionally reserved for native Japanese companies. So they view us very much as a Japanese organization as do we ourselves and I really expect this to be an accelerator for our business there over the next several years.","Operator","And your next question comes from David Hilal with FBR..","David Hilal - FBR","Great. Thank you. Marc, on your comments on Keith's, can you share with us some of the plans to go up the enterprise and more solution selling. I know you guys talked about verticals, maybe timing on when we might see some specific vertical solutions and just other changes that might help you move even further up the enterprise? Thanks.","Marc Benioff","That's definitely part of the strategy. He has a comprehensive strategy developed that the board has approved that he's executing. One of the key parts of his strategy is bringing in a new management team, which he has done and that's now in place. Second part of the strategy is to put in critical new programs like a focus on verticals. And there's other key parts of the strategy as well. I don't want to go through all of it because it is somewhat, I would say, proprietary and competitive and would probably let our competitors know some things that we are going to do which may surprise them.","Operator","And your next question comes from Mark Murphy with Piper Jaffray.","Mark Murphy - Piper Jaffray","Thank you, Marc. I wanted to ask about your potential opportunity to offer Big Data and analytics in the cloud. Specifically, if you look back on it, most traditional data warehouses are on premise technologies, and so as the applications move to the cloud, do you think that the analytics will follow and also move to the cloud? And if it does, do you think there's a bigger opportunity to be providing analytics for HR data or for customer data or for financial data? So, in other words, maybe the relative size of that opportunity for Workday versus salesforce versus NetSuite and other companies.","Marc Benioff","Well, number one, we are the largest provider of cloud based analytics and dashboard in the industry. You just have to look at the millions and millions of dashboards that we deliver to our customers each and every day, reports, analytics on their customer data and you are only going to see that expand and become more detailed with Salesforce1. You are also going to see phenomenal new graphics capabilities directly within Salesforce1 that will let our customers deliver those dashboards and analytics directly to their device.","Now to your point, it's not a general purpose analytics and data warehousing solution, though many customers do use it in that way. Certainly one of my dreams has been to build and deliver a world-class analytics and data warehousing solution with the same type of acuity that salesforce has on CRM, and we have tried that approach quite a few times. We have done a lot of research and development in that area. We have also bought companies in that area but we have not yet created a product.","When we find kind of the magic secret sauce that we somehow can put together at salesforce where the price and the technology and the ease of use is clearly in order of magnitude better than our competitors, like you are seeing with Salesforce1 today, then we will have that type of solution where we will come to you and say, well, yes, we have a world-class analytics and data warehousing solution. Today we are 100% focused on sales, service, marketing and platform. Those are the only four markets that we are addressing. And analytics is within those four, but not analytics as a fifth, if that answers your question, specifically.","Operator","Your next question comes from Kirk Materne with Evercore.","Kirk Materne - Evercore","Hi. Thanks very much and congrats on the quarter. Can you guys just talk a little about Europe? You guys are clearly outperforming than most of your peers in the industry overall. Can you just talk a little bit about what is going on there and some of the efforts you have done in terms of putting in place new sales capacity? Thanks.","Marc Benioff","Europe's execution over the last several years has been phenomenal and I think perhaps some of the best execution I have ever seen in my career. We are continuing to work in that area and a lot of that is because we narrowed our focus in Europe, we realized that the key markets in Europe were the U.K., France and Germany and that we needed to double down in those markets and that we were too prevalent in smaller markets that were not material to our organization.","When we made that strategic shift that was led by George Hu, our COO in an analysis that he did that basically yielded our eight country focus around the world which impacted Europe the hardest, we saw this acceleration in Europe and we continue to see great things ahead there and we have talked about that in previous calls that we continue to see world class execution in Europe. We also saw that same phenomenal execution in North America as well.","Operator","Your next question comes from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley.","Keith Weiss - Morgan Stanley","Excellent. Thank you, guys, for taking my follow-up. Maybe just one on the overall (Inaudible). There has definitely been some mixed signals from some larger legacy vendors out there, how are you guys feeling about just the overall tone of IT spending heading into your fourth quarter, and particularly your ability to get those very largest deals done in your last quarter?","Marc Benioff","Well, I don't think we gave out the specific numbers on large deals and all that, but we will probably talk about that next quarter. We had a monster quarter, okay? And, it was a monster quarter in big deals and small deals in the enterprise and SMB in Europe and in the U.S. and a lot of it has to do with these three kinds of things coming together that I talked about. We have a phenomenal new distribution management team with a phenomenal new acquisition and we have a complete refresh of our whole products family and we are ready and we are excited.","Look, the world has changed it has gone cloud, it's gone social, it's gone mobile and it's gone connected. The companies that are struggling in the market today have not gone cloud, they have not gone social, they have not gone mobile, they have not gone connected. They are still trying to sell the same old stuff. You could see it in this article that in The Wall Street Journal about Steve Ballmer over the weekend, interview that they had where he basically talks about, well it's time for him to move on because he is too representative of the past.","I think for a lot of these companies that quote could be about them. I thought that he articulated it really well. That there is an old philosophy of computing and those companies that are executing that old philosophy are not growing and they are not competing and they are not succeeding and the companies that have adopted the new capability, they are going to see hundreds of those companies here at this show. They are growing and we are one of them and I expect good things ahead, because we got the right products that everybody needs right now and a lot of companies don't, so my message to them is the same as before which is the future is cloud computing. The future is social computing, its mobile computing and it's all about this new connected world or what we call the Internet of customers.","The companies who are aligning with that, I expect will have tremendous success whether they are small, medium or large, but the companies who deny that the world has changed and that they can continue just to sell this old stuff and that people still want it, well, I think that those companies and those CEOs are the ones who are having the problems and they should transform and they should move forward.","Operator","Our final question comes from Rick Sherlund with Nomura.","Rick Sherlund - Nomura","Thanks. Marc, I am curious whether the issues with the NSA has created any concerns on part of customers or prospective customers about multi-tenants and your discussion earlier about HP. Is this to suggest that you could have a private cloud solution if customers were concerned about having data outside their own firewall or potentially outside their country?","Marc Benioff","Well, first of all, the new Salesforce HP Superpod is a Superpod right in our data center with our other pods. It's just a pod that is dedicated to a specific customer that is willing to spend a significant amount of, what we call, AOV with us or Annualized Operating Value, that is the amount of that customer has to be at a certain threshold before we even consider a Superpod and the Salesforce HP Superpod, the first customer is HP because they have exceeded that threshold. Now we have other customers who are also exceeding that threshold and this is a phenomenal opportunity for us and these very large customers to align to offer them our multi-tenant software in a dedicated instance.","Okay, so this is not as other companies call it, you can't get this on your premise. There's no hybrid. There's none of this stuff that other people do. This is our same software but in a dedicated instance in our data center and just for you. And it's our same software and those organizations will still have multi-tenants. So big companies like HP or other companies that use our product, they will still have multiple orbs within one pod, but it will be a Superpod or a dedicated pod.","In regards to changes in the marketplace regarding all these news reports and all this stuff, it's not our world. We haven't seen it. We don't participate in it. We don't hear about it. This isn't an area that we are knowledgeable in. We don't do communications technology or those types of things. We are doing sales forecast and opportunity management and that just isn't part of the world that you have been hearing about. So we feel very much extracted from that.","Operator","And we have no further questions. Back to you, John.","John Cummings","Thanks so much. Thanks, Josh, and thanks everyone for joining us today.

And I just want to congratulate our entire company and all of our shareholders and investors on just what has been an outstanding Q4, and this has really capped off just a truly record year for Salesforce. This has also just been an outstanding quarter of growth. You can see that we have propelled Salesforce over $10 billion revenue milestone, and we couldn't be more excited about that and having that fiscal year behind us because now our vision has never been bigger or more exciting as we have a very clear trajectory to $20 billion in revenue.","No other enterprise software company has achieved this scale faster. Certainly, no other enterprise cloud applications company has achieved this scale faster, and it's our dream to get to $20 billion faster than anyone else. It's been a relentless focus on our customer success. And not just customer, but also all of our community, all of our employees, our customers, our partners, all of our key stakeholders, and the development of just an incredible culture that has allowed us to scale this organization and continue to strengthen our position as the world's number one CRM. There has been incredibly strong demand and execution, especially this quarter, across every industry, across every region, cloud, all customer segments, and as we get through this opening comments, I'm sure you will agree this may be perhaps our best quarter ever.","We're on a path to exceed $20 billion faster than any other enterprise software company in history, and we're all very proud of that. Salesforce is number one today in CRM, which is the fastest growing segment of the enterprise software industry. Fiscal year 2018 revenues finalized out at $10.48 billion, up 25%, and that 25% obviously dramatically above where we thought we were going to be when we first gave you a forecast more than a year ago, 24% in constant currency. We're delighted with that result. Q4 revenue of $2.85 billion, up 24% year-over-year, 21% constant currency.","But perhaps what we're most excited about and speaks to the velocity of the company, more than $20 billion of booked business on and off the balance sheet, up 40%, and that exceeded our expectations. Deferred revenue of $7.09 billion, up 28% year-over-year, and 25% in constant currency; unbilled deferred revenue of $13.3 billion, up 48% year-over-year; Q4 operating cash flow of $1.05 billion, up 49% year-over-year; and fiscal year 2018 operating cash flow of $2.74 billion, also up 27% year-over-year. We are also then able to raise our full year fiscal year 2019 revenue guidance by $150 million, bringing us up to an expected consistent growth rate projected over the next year of more than 21%.","Great companies do more than create great products and great services. Companies like Salesforce build trust with all of their stakeholders, with our employees, our customers, our partners, our shareholders, all of our community, or as we say at Salesforce, our Ohana, our family. That's how we're running Salesforce from the beginning. We establish trust as our number one value. Putting our values in action, we're making our customers successful and improving the state of the world at the same time. And I have to say, I'm here in New York today, just went through our Salesforce tower here in New York.","New York is our largest market in the world. Incredibly exciting what's happening here, and when I see all these incredible people working at Salesforce, they're truly the best and brightest that I've seen. It's why we're recognized now by Fortune as the number one best place to work in the world. That is incredible for us.","And also Fortune published earlier their Most Admired Companies list in the world, and we were ranked the 15th Most Admired Company in the world. And Forbes said we're the most innovative company in the year and their innovator of the decade. We couldn't be more pleased.","And we could not have done it without all of you. We realize that we are all one family working together. And we're very grateful. And we're looking forward to an amazing fiscal year 2019 ahead of us.","So with that now, let me turn this over to Keith Block in San Francisco. And Keith will give you a perspective of how the company is operating. Keith, as you know, is our Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer. Keith?","Keith G. Block - salesforce.com, inc.","Hey. Thanks, Marc. Good afternoon, everybody. As you've already heard, we delivered just an outstanding fourth quarter to complete an exceptional year. We saw accelerating demand and strong execution coming from every industry and every region and every cloud and across all of our customer segments. More than ever, CEOs are coming to Salesforce because we fuel their growth, and we are fueling their transformation.","Salesforce continues to be mission critical to the world's greatest companies, and our strategic relationships are deeper than ever. In fact, we have nearly twice as many $20 million-plus relationships than we did just one year ago. Twice as many.","And our execution in Q4 was as strong as I've ever seen in my career. We closed more new business in Q4 than we did in the entire fiscal year of 2014. That is just four short years ago, and it speaks volumes to the momentum that we now have in the market.","We are closing more big deals every quarter. In fact, the number of million-dollar-plus deals grew 43% in Q4. And our average deal size continues to expand.","Also in the quarter, leading companies, including Siemens and ABB and Google turned to Salesforce to help them transform and grow.","Now as you know, international expansion is one of our key growth levers. And we delivered very strong growth in the quarter, 31% in EMEA and 26% in APAC in constant currency. In EMEA, ABB, one of the world's leading industrial technology companies, went all-in with us this quarter, and they're using Salesforce to get a broader understanding of their customers across sales, service and marketing. Einstein AI is going to enable them to drive smarter sales and build deeper customer relationships.","ABB also has an incredible vision to combine the power of Salesforce with ABB Ability and their industry-leading digital offering that enables 70 million connected device. Very, very strong partnership with ABB, and we are thrilled to continue to grow along with them.","We also formed a new relationship with Deutsche Bahn, which is the world's second largest transportation company. And we expanded our relationship with BBVA, who is rolling out our financial services cloud for retail banking to more than 24,000 advisors.","We also formed a new relationship with one of the largest insurance groups in Europe, and they're going wall-to-wall with Salesforce to get a complete view of their business. And also to increase their employee engagement and deliver a seamless customer experience across all of their brands. Great success in EMEA.","Also moving over to APAC, we continue to see just excellent momentum in financial services, specifically in Australia, where we are deepening our relationship with AMP, a leading wealth management company. We also had one of our largest platform deals in APAC with an exciting company called Coin (10:54). If you're not familiar with Coin (10:56), they're innovating and scaling their cryptocurrency exchange on the Heroku platform.","And in Japan we had another very strong quarter of incredible growth and strengthened our relationship with companies like Nissan and Amada.","So really to capture the opportunity in front of us, we continue to increase our international go-to-market resources, operations and infrastructure to make sure that we can serve our global customers and continue our enterprise scale. In fact, in FY 2018, nearly 40% of our new hires were in regions outside the Americas.","Now turning to industries, we also had a very strong performance across the board, but specifically in financial services. Now 18 of the top 20 U.S. and European banks rely on Salesforce. And in fact, in Q4, nearly half of those banks expanded their business with us in the quarter. Half of those banks expanded their business with us, again something that we're very, very proud of.","That includes a significant expansion with one of the world's largest banks in the world, which will be deploying Financial Services Cloud across all their retail branches.","TD Bank also selected Financial Services Cloud for retail banking to streamline their mortgage application process for customers. In addition, we expanded our relationship with Transamerica. They are extending Salesforce to an additional 60,000 insurance agents to give them a unified view of their clients. We also expanded with Pacific Life and MassMutual.","In healthcare, we expanded our relationship with Anthem as well as another Fortune 50 healthcare company, who is using Service Cloud to better understand patient needs and provide more personalized care.","We also deepened our relationship with the Cancer Treatment Centers of America, which is using Health Cloud to improve patient outcomes. Now you're going to hear more about our innovative healthcare customers and partners in Las Vegas next week at HIMSS, which is the country's largest healthcare technology conference.","As for our ecosystem, Salesforce continues to be the growth lever for our partners, and more than 55% of our new business is generated with our partners. And at the close of FY 2018, our partners surpassed 110,000 Salesforce certifications. This is an increase of more than 30% over last year.","Today, we have strategic partnerships with industry leaders, including Dell, IBM, Amazon, and in FY 2018, as you know, we went live on AWS infrastructure in Canada and Australia. And at Dreamforce, which was absolutely outstanding, we announced a new strategic partnership with Google to connect Salesforce with Google Cloud and Google Analytics to enable a smarter, more collaborative experience for customers.","On the topic of integration, as you know, this past year we were focused on making sure that we integrated the incredible companies that we acquired in FY 2017, including Demandware. I will report, this is going very, very well. In fact, during the 2017 holiday season, the Commerce Cloud touched 540 million unique shoppers. Commerce Cloud is now one of the largest commerce environments of the world, alongside major marketplaces such as Amazon and Alibaba. Now Marc also mentioned that trust is our number-one value. It's obviously very, very important to us.","But innovation is a core value as well, and in the fourth quarter, we rolled out our Spring '18 release to all of our customers which has over 300 innovations, including exciting enhancements to the Lightning platform and new Einstein innovations across our clouds. And speaking of Einstein, we are seeing tremendous momentum, and we just hit an incredible milestone producing over a billion predictions in a single day, and nobody but Salesforce can deliver these deep customer insights at scale. So it's very, very exciting with that momentum.","Finally, I want to give a quick update on the EU General Data Protection Regulation, which will come into effect on May 25. We welcome the GDPR as an important step for customers to strengthen their privacy programs, and we are committed to helping our customers prepare for it every single day. So in closing, I want to thank our customers, our partners, our employees for their continued trust in us, and for contributing to just an outstanding Q4, and just great full year results. So thanks everybody for that.","And now I'd like to turn it over to Mark Hawkins, who will talk about our financial execution in the quarter. Mark?","Mark J. Hawkins - salesforce.com, inc.","Great. Thanks, Keith. And as you've heard, we delivered another year of outstanding financial performance. We posted strong top line and operating cash flow growth, and we importantly delivered non-GAAP operating margin expansion for the fourth consecutive year. This was particularly significant, given the exceptionally strong new business we achieved in the fourth quarter. Let me discuss the highlights of Q4 and FY 2018. The fourth quarter revenue grew 24% in dollars and 21% in constant currency, excluding the year-over-year FX tailwind of $64 million. We also saw a sequential FX tailwind of $8 million. For the full year, revenue grew 25% in dollars and 24% in constant-currency.","We drove strong year-over-year subscription and support revenue growth across each of the clouds in the fourth quarter. Sales Cloud grew 16% and exited the year at $3.7 billion in terms of the run rate. Service Cloud grew 28% and is now at a run rate of more than $3.1 billion. Platform and Other grew 37% and is now at a run rate of more than $2.1 billion. And Marketing and Commerce Cloud grew 33% and is now at a run rate of nearly $1.6 billion. Each of these clouds benefited from an FX tailwind that was similar to our revenue tailwind of approximately 3%. Dollar attrition for the fourth quarter, including Marketing Cloud was slightly below 10%, which is an improvement over last year.","Turning to margin, you may recall in November we discussed the dynamics of increased operating margin pressure associated with accelerating growth during our Analyst Day presentation. We refer to this as model leverage. This is exactly what transpired in the fourth quarter, as we saw an acceleration in our new business year-over-year and therefore incurred higher commissions and other selling-related expenses. In addition, there's four factors impacting our selling cost; first, our enterprise strength; secondly, our strength in our international businesses; third, the investment and the strength in our newly acquired businesses; and then fourth, the acceleration of our sales hiring. In that context, we're pleased to drive operating leverage in the business, and as a result we delivered 128 basis points of non-GAAP operating margin improvement for the full year.","The fourth quarter non-GAAP EPS was $0.35, up 25% over last year. For the full year we delivered $1.35, up 34% over FY 2017. EPS benefited by approximately $0.02 in the fourth quarter related to net realized gains from our strategic investment portfolio. Q4 operating cash flow was $1.05 billion, up 49% year-over-year. For the full year we delivered $2.74 billion, up 27% over last year. This translated to an operating cash flow yield of 26.1%, which was up slightly over FY 2017. CapEx for the year was $534 million or approximately 5.1% of revenue, down from 5.5% in FY 2017. CapEx primarily consists of leasehold improvements followed by global data center investments. For FY 2019 we expect CapEx to be approximately 5% of revenue.","Turning to free cash flow, and that's defined as cash flow less CapEx, this was $914 million in the fourth quarter, up 63% over last year. And I'm very pleased to report that our full year free cash flow was $2.2 billion, up 30% over FY 2017. Deferred revenue ended the year at more than $7 billion, up 28% in dollars and 25% in constant currency, excluding an FX tailwind of $130 million. On a sequential basis, deferred revenue benefited from an FX tailwind of $56 million. Our unbilled deferred revenue ended the quarter at approximately $13.3 billion, up 48% over last year. And let me elaborate on those results. In addition to a very strong quarter of new business that we discussed, we also had a very strong renewals quarter, including some of the largest renewals in our history.","Looking at our top 10 customers up for renewal in Q4, eight of the 10 expanded their relationships with us in this quarter. Both of these factors drove this outstanding growth in our billed and unbilled deferred revenue. Moving on to guidance, coming off our record fourth quarter we are raising our full year 2019 revenue guidance to $12.6 billion to $12.65 billion, up 20% to 21% year-over-year growth. Our performance in FY 2018 and especially the fourth quarter reinforces our confidence and our ability to reach our long-term target of $20 billion to $22 billion in revenue by FY 2022. With consistent, durable growth guided for FY 2019, we expect to deliver 125 basis points to 150 basis points of non-GAAP operating margin improvement in FY 2019 driven by continued improvements in operating leverage.","We are lowering our fixed long term projected non-GAAP tax rate to 21.5% for FY 2019 from 34.5% in FY 2018, primarily due to the new U.S. Tax Act, and this rate reflects our currently available information. Due to our ongoing analysis for the Tax Act over the measurement period, as well as the rapidly evolving international tax environment and the operations of our business, this rate is subject to change. We expect other income and expense to be roughly flat year-over-year when excluding the net realized gains from strategic investments recognized in FY 2018. Keep in mind that with the adoption of ASU 2016-01 in Q1, there may be additional OIE volatility as we mark-to-mark our investments as required. We are initiating our FY 2019 GAAP diluted EPS of $0.61 to $0.63, and a non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance of $2.02 to $2.04.","We expect the full year fiscal 2019 operating cash flow growth of 20% to 21% year-over-year. For Q1, we're expecting revenue of $2.925 billion to $2.935 billion, GAAP diluted EPS of $0.09 to $0.10, and non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.43 to $0.44. Turning to deferred revenue, as we transition from ASC 605 to ASC 606 in Q1 we will no longer be reporting or guiding to deferred revenue. However, for consistency, we want to provide you with a bridge to the first quarter until we report under the new accounting standard. In that context, we expect our year-over-year deferred revenue growth of 23% to 24% in Q1. Let me remind you that these results in our guidance are all under the prior accounting standards, including ASC 605 and pre-revision ASC 340. We expected to provide our updated Q1 and FY 2019 guidance, including revenue and EPS under the new and revised accounting standards in the first quarter.","So to close, our fourth quarter results drove an outstanding finish to the fiscal 2018, including our fourth consecutive year of non-GAAP operating margin improvement. I'd like to thank our employees, our customers, our partners, and yes, our shareholders as well for your continued support.","And with that, I'd like to open up the call for questions. Thank you.","John Cummings - salesforce.com, inc.","Erica, we can begin the Q&A portion. Thanks.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And your first question comes from Karl Keirstead from Deutsche Bank.","Karl E. Keirstead - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. I wanted to congratulate you on that unbilled backlog number of $13.3 billion. That's amazing. And maybe it's a two-parter, maybe for Keith. Keith, what's causing the unbilled to ramp so high? I know Marc mentioned a lot of renewals. But are these larger deals, longer term contracts that are contributing to that? And then maybe for Mark Hawkins, we don't know what the duration of that unbilled backlog is. Can you offer any color as to how it'll roll into deferred revenue in fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2020? Thank you very much.","Keith G. Block - salesforce.com, inc.","Yeah. Hi, this is Keith. So thanks for the question. I mean, there's a few things here that I think are really contributing to what's going on here. And at the end of the day, it really comes back to the strategic relationships that we're driving with these customers. They are more deeper, they are more meaningful relationships. We're driving their digital transformations, and that results in more large contracts than ever, more large customers than ever, longer contracts in terms of duration, and a lot of multi-cloud solutions, because we're selling solutions and not so much features and functions. So all those are certainly contributing to the financial metrics that you're referencing in your question. But at the end of the day, these are deeper, longer relationships with these customers, and that's why the deals are longer and we're seeing the renewals, which obviously is a huge, huge indicator of their confidence in our solutions, and in our partnerships. And we've had a record number of very large renewals as well.","Mark J. Hawkins - salesforce.com, inc.","Yeah, and I'll just add on to Keith's point. I totally agree. The deeper and strategic relationships, people want to go longer and bigger with us, as you can see with the numbers. In terms of earl (25:07) specifically, the duration for unbilled DR, that duration is up slightly, about a month.","Operator","And your next question comes from Kash Rangan from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Kash Rangan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Congratulations on a spectacular finish. It's been, what, 13 years, 14 years since you went public. Question for Marc. As you look at other large technology companies in software, without naming names, they have had a hard time getting to $20 billion in revenue and maintaining very solid growth rate. How do you think, how should we think about salesforce.com given your organic revenue target of $20 billion? How much can the company continue to grow at an exciting enough pace capitalizing on all the innovation that you see in the industry? What is different about this cycle versus the older peers that have struggled to maintain that kind of growth? That's it from me. Thank you. Congratulations.","Marc Russell Benioff - salesforce.com, inc.","Well, thanks Kash. And I'll really just start out by congratulating Keith and his whole organization, because honestly I've just never seen a quarter like this. This was a blow-out quarter. And just the performance of that organization and their acuity, capability to deliver was shocking even to me. And it shows up right there in that number, and you can see it right there in front of you now. I've been really excited to be able to talk about that with you, more than $20 billion of booked business on and off the balance sheet, up 40%. There is no way we could have said that to you a year ago. That is beyond our expectation, and it really has to do with the performance of the organization, number one.","Number two, and this really gets to your point, I think that \u2013 and I had dinner last night with 20 Fortune 100 CEOs here in New York, which is one of the reasons that I came to town.","And of course, we're all on a very fast moving economic freight train. We've seen incredible increase in investment activity with our customers, especially accelerated with these tax cuts. That has been amazing to us.","But squarely in the center of each and every one of their consciousness is the digital transformation that their company is going through. It doesn't matter if they're a consumer product goods company CEO or financial services or retail or any industry or any geography. Every CEO is thinking about their digital transformation. And I think you and I know that every digital transformation begins and ends with the customer.","This is very powerful. And it's why we have so much activity in our company. Of course, we're the number one customer company in the world. No other company in the history of the software industry has been as focused on customer-relationship management, but how companies can have a customer transformation at Salesforce.","And this, and this alone, focus, has accelerated our growth. You can see that in the numbers. So certainly how we finished our year in fiscal year 2018 is not where we thought we would start. We raised guidance I think almost in each and every quarter, and yet we still ended up above that. And that's why we've raised again here $150 million. This is the most we've ever raised in the history of the company, because we're just ahead of where we thought we would be.","So we are, obviously $10 billion is now behind us, and $20 billion is ahead of us. And it's our dream, we're going to be the fastest to $20 billion.","But when you have $20 billion already on and off the balance sheet, you know that that is \u2013 we're a huge step on the way there. So that's what I couldn't be more excited about the position the company is in, its competitiveness, its ability to perform, the quality of its customer relationships, the quality of the products, the integration of the acquisitions, the culture, Fortune number 1 best place to work. All of these things have come together in just a really beautiful way, and I'm extremely grateful.","Operator","And your next question comes from Richard Davis from Canaccord.","Richard Davis - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Hey, thanks very much. Just kind of a strategy question. So if you think about it, whatever, 15 years ago no one thought software companies could run hardware, and then today you have Amazon, Google, Microsoft with kind of cloud computing systems.","So the question that I wrestle with is, right now you guys kind of use those compute layer firms for surge capacity, you and others. But why or why not would it make sense for Salesforce to push out most of its compute mode to these specialists? Does that ever make sense in the future? Just kind of thinking about full circle in terms of evolution? Thanks.","Marc Russell Benioff - salesforce.com, inc.","Yeah. Well, I think that the way to think about that is, we have a comprehensive integrated approach. And where it makes sense to use infrastructure, for example, in a country like Canada or Singapore, we have tremendous relationships with organizations like Amazon and Google, where we're going to do that.","Even during the quarter we've announced that we're going to be using \u2013 IBM has become one of our preferred cloud providers. That's appropriate to have our ability to operate proprietary data centers like we do here in the United States. We also use that infrastructure, for example, underneath one of our core platforms, Heroku, as you know, which has become one of the largest application development capabilities in the world.","And we are also live on Amazon in Canada and Australia. So we will use the correct provider at the correct time, whether that's us or whether that's Amazon, Google or IBM.","Operator","Your next question comes from Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs.","Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you. Marc, listening to your comment about the macro, I guess I'm wondering, how far back would you have to go to find a time that you were equally as positive on the demand environment? And I guess the second question is just, with Einstein being embedded more and more into your product set, how do you see monetization evolving? Thank you.","Marc Russell Benioff - salesforce.com, inc.","Well, Einstein, let's start there. I mean we're ahead of our predictions there also, and that's what Einstein's all about. We are doing I think it's more than a billion predictions a day with Einstein already.","So our systems are dramatically enhanced through our deep machine intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning architecture, known as Einstein, Salesforce Einstein, which has become a critical part of our CRM, first and foremost, highly differentiated against our competition, who has yet to be able to put in artificial intelligence of a quality, capability and scale that we have it deeply integrated into our application set across the board, whether you're using Commerce Cloud like Adidas is, whether you're using Sales Cloud like Cisco is, or whether you're using an incredible product like Service Cloud like Intuit is, Einstein is in there now.","And customers love it because it just makes their employees better. It's the perfect use case for artificial intelligence, enhancing human performance. And we're going to do a lot more of that. We've only really been at this now for about a year, but it's going far better than we expected, and we'll continue to enhance and extend our artificial intelligence capability. In regards to the overall demand environment, and my personal experience is with Chief Executive Officers over the last month in both international, specifically in Davos where I was with hundreds of CEOs, or in other business forums here domestically where I've also been with hundreds of CEOs, I can empirically tell you I have never seen a demand environment like this.","I cannot quantify that. I can just tell you that every CEO is using the positive economic environment, but also the domestic tax cuts as ways to accelerate their digital transformations, and it is putting it number one on all of their list, which it should be. And this is really exciting for us and for others, of course. But for a company like us, we can help these companies get connected with their customers in a whole new way. And that is, we have the ability, we have the great products and we have the distribution capacity to be able to directly address them. I hope that answers your question, Heather.","Operator","And your next question comes from John DiFucci with Jefferies.","John DiFucci - Jefferies LLC","Thank you. A question I have is on the enterprise business, and I think it's mainly for Keith but maybe for Mark Hawkins too. Keith, from our work, that enterprise business really started to kick in a little more than 2 years ago. And one of the nice things about this segment is that, when you become a strategic vendor or partner to your customer, some of the stuff that Marc Benioff was talking about, in time they come back and they buy more from you, which is often the form of add-on large deals again, and whether it's more seats or more products.","And you talked about this happening in financial services, but we're also hearing about it in your other vertical focus areas. I guess the question is, shouldn't those add-on or follow-up deals essentially be more efficient captures, and for instance, perhaps requiring a shorter sales cycle? Shouldn't this at least directionally be more profitable over time? And I realize you've already given guidance, Mark Hawkins has, and you have other investments to make. But just on this particular, I just want to make sure I understand how this should evolve over time.","Keith G. Block - salesforce.com, inc.","Yes. Hi, John.","Marc Russell Benioff - salesforce.com, inc.","Hey Keith?","Keith G. Block - salesforce.com, inc.","Yes?","Marc Russell Benioff - salesforce.com, inc.","Before you jump in on that, I just want Mark to specifically address that because...","Mark J. Hawkins - salesforce.com, inc.","Yes, happy to do so. And John, thank you for the question. In fact, we are raising our profitability, as we talked about. This is the \u2013 I just guided the fifth year in a row of expanding the profitability. One of the things that we see kind of akin to what we talked about at the Dreamforce Analyst Day is that there are some costs incurred with growth basically that impact the short-term, but we still were able to expand our operating margin.","Marc Russell Benioff - salesforce.com, inc.","Well, what happens when we blow out a quarter like we did in Q4, Mark? Does that impact then the amount of profit we show for that quarter?","Mark J. Hawkins - salesforce.com, inc.","In fact, it does. What happens is we'll take go-to-market expansions like commissions and that type of thing in the short-term, and now you'll see that show up. And then basically what we have is great long-term economics that are going to \u2013 that benefit. So one of the things that I would say is...","Marc Russell Benioff - salesforce.com, inc.","So what you're saying is, you'll see if we have a great quarter in expansion, for revenue for example, but in in-quarter expense for commission is also \u2013 it expands.","Mark J. Hawkins - salesforce.com, inc.","This is exactly right, Marc.","Marc Russell Benioff - salesforce.com, inc.","So should we tell Keith then to be selling less? Is that the point?","Mark J. Hawkins - salesforce.com, inc.","No, I think the thing that's powerful about this is that we have, if you think about creating an annuity, it has a lifetime economics of north of 35% margin. And what we're seeing is the short-term pressure even with add-on businesses, Marc. If we're paying commissions and people finish with a strong year, you're going to have accelerators and that type of thing, people have a strong demand environment, which we saw with the billed and unbilled DR. And in fact, that has a short-term depressive effect. But we still delivered, and this was the point, we still delivered the margin expansion despite that.","Marc Russell Benioff - salesforce.com, inc.","So we should tell Keith then to go ahead and sell in Q1.","Mark J. Hawkins - salesforce.com, inc.","Definitely.","Marc Russell Benioff - salesforce.com, inc.","All right. Very good. Keith, you can go ahead then and sell the first quarter, and if you blow it out again, it's okay. We'll handle it. Go ahead.","Keith G. Block - salesforce.com, inc.","Yeah, I think you gentlemen articulated that very nicely. So I think the only thing that I would add to that, John is, Mark used the phrase lifetime economics. And I think as we all know, we run a balanced portfolio of business, and we do a lot of work in the SMB, we do a lot of stuff in the mid-market. We have focused, as you pointed out, a lot in the enterprise as we continue to become a global company, and become an enterprise class company. That means longer, deeper relationships, as I said in my opening comments. But we really are playing the long game here. And I guess, there are two factors that I think about; one is the fact that we are able to land and expand in these large accounts, and over time build out those very strategic relationships which really culminates in these very large deals.","I mean, when you think about the doubling the number of $20 million relationships that we have year-over-year, that's pretty staggering. But that also bodes well for the long game. And of course, there are natural \u2013 you would expect that there will be natural efficiencies over time. But the other thing you got to think about too is that many of these deals are aligned to the schedule of the customers as they deploy. A lot of this, as you suggested, is when a customer is up for renewal, we have the opportunity to expand the solution because the demand is there or because we've demonstrated our capabilities because we understand their business, because we speak the language of the customer and their industry. And that's why a lot of these renewals also included additional sales associated with them. So we're just executing very, very well across the board in the balanced portfolio. And I will say, I'm proud of every organization in the company that is focused in all these market segments and all these geographies. But yes, we have been focusing a lot on the enterprise. It's relatively a new capability within the age scale of Salesforce, but the execution has just been fantastic.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mark Murphy with JPMorgan.","Mark R. Murphy - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yes. Thank you. So Marc, you described it as perhaps our best quarter ever. And Keith, you said execution was as strong as you've seen in your career, and it's a long, decorated career obviously. The number that is mind-bending is the 48% growth in the unbilled deferred revenue. And so I think that was growing in the 20%s ex-Demandware. Can you help us understand maybe just what that number looks like? If we try to normalize it for renewals and an extra month of duration, I mean, would it be 40%? If we just try to uncover the new ACV bookings growth, and if you can't do that is there just any other way to try to convey the acceleration that you mentioned in new business growth?","Mark J. Hawkins - salesforce.com, inc.","Keith, I can help a little bit on that too, if you'd like on the normalization if that would be helpful. Why don't I just share from that standpoint, if you think \u2013 again, we're talking about only unbilled DR. We put up a number of 48% because of the expanded and deeper relationships that the customers are driving, but if you adjust the term length...","Marc Russell Benioff - salesforce.com, inc.","Except for short that Keith had a good quarter.","Mark J. Hawkins - salesforce.com, inc.","He had a very good quarter.","Marc Russell Benioff - salesforce.com, inc.","A very good quarter.","Mark J. Hawkins - salesforce.com, inc.","And so even if you adjust when the customers want a slightly longer relationship because it's more strategic for the month, you have a number, instead of 48% it's growing closer to 39% on the unbilled if you normalize for that extension that the customers are asking for. So to Marc's point, even with that normalization, this is just a number that, maybe go back a lot of years to try to find that level. I hope that helps, and Keith you might want to add there.","Marc Russell Benioff - salesforce.com, inc.","Well, I think that, Mark, the analysts are probably, investors are looking at this and they're seeing, these are percentages that are much higher against companies that we've seen report this week and last week, cloud companies who are dramatically smaller than we are. So we're seeing much stronger rates. Is that fair?","Mark J. Hawkins - salesforce.com, inc.","I think the demand, the growth at this scale is really \u2013 it characterizes what you and Keith said about an outstanding quarter. I mean, the top line is very, very strong. And I think one of the things that Keith said, that I feel also based on talking to a lot of customers, is the deepness of the relationship is you can feel it, you can see it. We've been talking about this for a few years. But that's something that we really see in the commercial side.","Marc Russell Benioff - salesforce.com, inc.","And Keith, do you want to address that? I mean, coming into the quarter when we're on the earnings call about 90 days ago, you're obviously expecting a good quarter. We gave very strong guidance. How did the quarter play out for you?","Keith G. Block - salesforce.com, inc.","Well, look, I think this is a high performing company with a culture of high performance along with a culture of a lot of great things. And I think in every quarter we expect high performance. Again, I go back to my opening comments about, it was just really outstanding execution. We always expect great execution, and this happened to be one of those quarters for the \u2013 it's one for the ages. And so we're very, very excited about it. But if I think about what happened behind it, we've been investing for this for a very, very long time.","When you think about our industry specialization, when you think about our international expansion, when you think about our partner ecosystem, these are three growth levers that have propelled us past the $10 billion mark. We're hurdling down the highway towards $20 billion, and these are foundational things that will help us turn the corner when we approach $20 billion. So you add all these things up with the right investments, with great execution, with a growth environment, a situation where the agenda for CEOs is growth, and our message and promise is all about growth, everything just aligned very, very nicely. So again, very, very proud of the entire company for just a complete set of execution in the quarter.","Mark J. Hawkins - salesforce.com, inc.","And, Keith, I just want to add one point that you noted here, which is, in Q4 we did invest an additional capacity to get prepared for this $20 billion to $22 billion in FY 2022 in terms of AEs and that type of thing as well. So that's a good attribute for us to position for the future. But that's also important for people to know it's an investment we made in Q4 as well.","Operator","And your next question comes from Raimo Lenschow from Barclays.","Raimo Lenschow - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey. Thanks for taking my questions. Congrats from me as well. I just wanted to see if you could double-click a little bit on the performances you saw in different clouds, especially Service Cloud reaccelerated again, and it's now on track to kind of maybe almost take over from the Sales Cloud. Just talk a little bit to what you're seeing on different ones, especially on the Service Cloud. Thank you.","Keith G. Block - salesforce.com, inc.","Well, this is Keith. I'm happy to jump in on that, and our President of Products is sitting right next to me, Bret Taylor, so he may want to comment as well. But look, we saw a very strong balance across all of our clouds, which speaks to, again, our ability to have multi-cloud solutions. And specifically around service, if you think about how companies are differentiating themselves, they differentiate with service. And we have the leading solution in service. We're the market leader. We continue to separate and take market share in Service Cloud. We've had very, very strong execution, and of course, that drags additional product. But again, service is very, very strong, and whether it's core service or whether it's field service, these are differentiated products. I don't know, Bret, if you want to respond to that.","Bret Steven Taylor - salesforce.com, inc.","Yes, I just want to say, I mean, when you think about transforming a customer experience, increasingly your brand is defined by your customer service, and that's really what this product represents. And beyond that, it's also being served by the technological changes we talked a lot about in the fourth industrial revolution. If you look at the confluence of artificial intelligence, the growth of devices like the Amazon Echo, the Google Home, mobility, they are transforming customer expectations about customer experience and customer service. And I think as consumer demand shifts and our platform really represents the opportunity for our customers to modernize their customer service experience, it's really becoming the tip of the spear for a customer strategy to transform their customer relationships.","Operator","And your question comes from Bhavan Suri from William Blair.","Bhavan Singh Suri - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I'll add my congrats to the host out there. But two sort of strategic questions, I guess, and maybe for everyone on the queue. So first on Einstein and AI, the use cases are pretty broad. So you've got some of this lead-scoring stuff, and then you've got stuff as deep as sort of some of the stuff you're seeing with Coca-Cola, Coors, and things like that. As you think about customers, how are they migrating, and what percentage have use cases that are much more complex?","And then how are you guys thinking about pricing those? Because the ROI and the value-add as you get to more complex AI becomes dramatically \u2013 it's huge. And so how are you thinking about pricing it?","And then my second question, maybe for Bret even, is Dware [Demandware] seems to be doing really well, but obviously that's just B2C. How are you all thinking about the B2B e-commerce opportunity, which, in dollars, may be even bigger than B2C? I'd just love to get some color on those two things. Thank you.","Marc Russell Benioff - salesforce.com, inc.","Well, I think Bret can specifically start with that B2B opportunity, huh, Keith?","Bret Steven Taylor - salesforce.com, inc.","Yes. I mean, I think that \u2013 I think the evolution of Salesforce as a company, we started as a B2B company. Over the past five years or so, we've really expanded our B2C offerings. And the trend we see broadly is those two markets really merging, where B2B companies, their customers are demanding B2C experiences, because their expectations are being set by these best-of-breed consumer experiences and consumer technologies.","And we think that one of Salesforce's unique advantages, as it relates to B2B and B2C, is the fact that we do both. We're really the only company that has a complete customer success platform for both B2B and B2C. And it means that for B2B companies we can enable them to provide consumer-grade experiences, which is very unique in the marketplace.","And for B2C companies, we bring this incredible sort of deep legacy of providing these next-generation sales and service experiences, and that experience is really driving our strategy in the B2C space. So we really view that as one of our strategic advantages is the fact that those are blurring, and we are equally interested in both parts of that market. And I think, Keith, do you want to take the artificial intelligence question?","Keith G. Block - salesforce.com, inc.","Yes, I'm happy to talk about artificial intelligence all day long. Look, I know there was a question about pricing, and Marc Benioff may want to weigh in on this. But look, at the end of the day, we're at the dawn of a new era, and we're very, very excited about Einstein. We've got a lot of momentum. Marc talked about the billion interactions and insights that are provided on a daily basis. And that we're really excited about that. That tells you a lot about what the potential can be.","And we get excited because our AI, Einstein, is applied to specific use cases around sales and service and marketing. And we have companies who continue to experiment and expand with Einstein.","ABB is a classic example of that. Einstein is being used to help bring better experiences in their sales cycles with their customers, as well as the way that they service their customers. And that is all hooked up into IoT.","So you can imagine the possibilities with all this data being collected on their devices and their robots, and how Einstein can help them gain better insight.","So it is early days. I think over time we'll be thinking very creatively and in an innovative way to sort through the pricing of Einstein. But again, our customers seem to really, really enjoy the benefits that we're seeing.","Operator","Your next question comes from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley.","Keith Eric Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Excellent. Thank you for taking the question and, again, good quarter. Marc, I totally agree with you, I'm all for allowing Keith to go out and sign another $2 billion in subscription business, because at the end of the day, we know that's going to generate really good cash flows over time. And you guys are generating a lot of cash.","Marc Russell Benioff - salesforce.com, inc.","I'm glad we're on the same page there.","Keith Eric Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Excellent. And you guys have been generating a lot of cash, it's building up on the balance sheet. There hasn't been a lot of M&A in overall software, and you guys haven't done anything big in a while. How should we think about the M&A environment going into calendar 2018, into the year ahead for you guys?","Mark J. Hawkins - salesforce.com, inc.","Sure. One of the things \u2013 let me just lead with it, if I may, Keith, and thanks for the comments. I think we always look for \u2013 over the history of the company, we look at companies that can add to our customer satisfaction and customer success. We look at great entrepreneurs.","But we look for very unique things in the world that can help and be additive as we go to the future and our market space. So that will not change.","And so you should expect that the way we've operated and the way we think about that, there's real continuity to that from that standpoint. That would be a starting point.","And as far as the cash on the balance sheet, I'll just add that we're always looking at that. We're always looking at our capital allocation. But the number one thing we think about with the capital allocation is the fund growth, and that's our starting point for everything in that respect.","So maybe I'll turn it over to Marc or to Keith or Bret for other comments. Keith, any additional comments?","Keith G. Block - salesforce.com, inc.","Yeah, look, I think we've talked about this historically, that when we think about M&A, we have a thought out process and methodology, and Mark Hawkins is exactly right. We look at a number of characteristics when we think about our growth strategy.","But most importantly, when we think about acquisitions, we listen to our customers. Many times our customers guide us in terms of what we should be thinking about in terms of solutions for them. So whether it's the technology, the people as part of the acquisition, the culture and of course the financial metrics, these are all things that we consider. And again, there is a strategy and it's well thought out and there's a process to it.","Marc Russell Benioff - salesforce.com, inc.","I think we could also have Bret touch on that, since he is a product of one of our great acquisitions. Bret?","Bret Steven Taylor - salesforce.com, inc.","Yeah. I'm personally biased, but I think Salesforce has had an incredible acquisition strategy to date \u2013 just joking. No, I mean, I think it's very important that when we think about growth we align ourselves with our customers and align ourselves with the technological trends that are shifting our customers' customers' expectations.","And fundamentally I think that the reason why our customers have partnered with Salesforce in those increasingly deep relationships is because they view Salesforce not just as a suite of products we have today, but as a partner to help guide them in the technological transformation that are coming in decades to come. And that will always involve a combination of organic and inorganic innovation.","I think I'll just echo Keith's point that we are really following our customers, and also making sure that as we recognize significant technology trends like artificial intelligence that are shifting our customers' expectations, that we are aggressively leading by example there. So that our customers can depend on us as that technology partner.","Operator","And your next question comes from Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI.","Kirk Materne - Evercore ISI","Thanks very much, and I'll add my congrats on the really strong close to the year. Keith, obviously one of the great successes over the last couple years has been your vertical orientation, both from a go-to-market and a product perspective. Obviously, it sounds like a great year for financial services in particular, but I'm sure a lot of other verticals. My question is about healthcare. I mean, healthcare has been a vertical or an industry that's been desperate for innovation for a while as people are sort of changing the way you pay for healthcare. Your strategy would seem to make a lot of sense. I was just kind of curious if you think 2018 or the next \u2013 however you want to sort of couch it from a timeframe \u2013 are the customers poised to start thinking differently? And are they talking to you differently about how you can help them transform into more of a patient-oriented organization? Thanks.","Keith G. Block - salesforce.com, inc.","Yeah. Hey, Kirk, great to hear from you. So look, obviously the vertical strategy is paying off. And you mentioned financial services as well, and we've seen a very interesting change in that dynamic environment. When you think about the ease of regulations, the changes in the tax laws, that has just created an environment where IT dollars can now be spent more on innovation than on maintaining the legacy environments around compliance, as an example. So that's exciting. Similarly, in healthcare, one of the things that's changing the healthcare industry is technology overall, number one. Number two, if you think about it, patients are more empowered by technology than ever before. So these healthcare companies and the healthcare industry overall is ripe for transformation. That being said, it can be unclear at times because of regulations and the regulatory environment where exactly healthcare is going.","In the quarter, we signed up and expanded some very, very strong relationships in the healthcare industry. Fortune 50, that is looking to transform their business with our Health Cloud, one of our organic industry products. I mentioned Anthem, which is obviously a very, very strong and leading healthcare provider. So whether it's patients, whether it's providers, whether it's medical device manufacturers, there are many, many ways to transform those industries around customer or client or patient engagement. Service is an example. It really becomes front and center when you think about the mission of a healthcare provider. So we have a pretty good vision for where the health care industry is going. We try to do a lot of collaboration and co-creation with our customers. We also listen to our customers and let them guide us. But we think this is potentially could be a very, very big area for us.","Operator","And your last question comes from Adam Holt from MoffettNathanson.","Adam Holt - MoffettNathanson LLC","Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. My question is about the Platform and Other business. It looked like it accelerated in the quarter in an environment that some people might characterize as being more competitive with the public clouds and some of the application vendors now more aggressively touting their own platform-as-a-service businesses. How do you think about the drivers of the strength there this quarter and the outlook for the next several quarters? Maybe that's a question for Marc Benioff. I'm not sure. But I appreciate the answer. Thank you.","Marc Russell Benioff - salesforce.com, inc.","Well, I think we've moved into a new world. This is the fourth industrial revolution. We all know that. We can see the huge advancements in technology in our fingertips, how we're running this call, how all the computers and mobile devices that we're using, the artificial intelligence that we talked about, the autonomous vehicles that I saw going down the street today. There's so many exciting things that are happening, information sciences and biotechnology sciences. But as every company sees the fourth industrial revolution underway, they have to pick their place in it, what are you going to do, what is your position, and also what are your values, what's important to you.","These two ideas, your vision and your values, I think will define who will be successful and who will fail in the fourth industrial revolution. For us, it's very simple. We squarely believe that we're in the age of a customer, and that for each and every one of our companies that we deal with around the world, that they have to connect with their customer in a whole new way, and to build this high fidelity relationship, whether they're a B2B or B2C customer, that they need to have this single view of the customer. It doesn't matter, like, in the previous discussion, it could be healthcare, it could be financial services, it could be retail. In each and every case, company-by-company is thinking how do I get to a single view of the customer. That is Salesforce's single focus. And we do that across many product lines, as you know.","And in terms of what is important to us, well, there's nothing more important than trust. Trust is our highest value. And of course, growth is important to us as well. You can you see that in our numbers today. And innovation, as Bret was talking about, the reason that we're the number one CRM in the world is the tremendous innovation that we've brought to customers like we have in things like Einstein, or our new Lightning platform, or even Trailhead where you can learn how to become part the Salesforce economy and jump on this train so that you can be part of the fourth industrial revolution and be part of Salesforce.","These things are so important. You can see how it shows up on our AppExchange with thousands of apps and companies that have been birthed through this vision. And then at the end of the day, we all have to be aware that the fourth industrial revolution has a dark side, and it could be that it creates more inequality. And that's why our core value we talked about is equality that we so squarely believe that we have to keep an eye on the equality of every human being, whether it's our employees, our customers, the communities that we're in, or even the environment or public education systems. And that these four values, trust, and growth, innovation and equality continue to serve us very well in our pursuit in this age of the customer.","Marc Russell Benioff - salesforce.com, inc.","Well, I want to thank everyone for an amazing fiscal year. All of our employees, customers, partners, all of our Ohana, thank you for everything that you have done for us, every single day. We appreciate it so greatly. And we will see you again at TrailheaDX, our annual Salesforce Developer Conference which will be March 28th and 29th in San Francisco. And I hope that all of you will join us for this exciting event. We'll have some very exciting product news and some incredible surprises there. And I'm about to show up on Kramer and from Salesforce tower here in New York City in just a couple minutes. If you'll turn on CNBC, you'll see me there.","So thanks everybody.

Following management\u2019s prepared remarks, we will host a question-and-answer session and our instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded for replay purposes. It is now my pleasure to hand the conference over to John Cummings, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","John Cummings","Thanks so much, Brian. Good afternoon, everyone and thanks for joining us for our fiscal fourth quarter and full year 2019 results conference call. Our results press release, SEC filings and a replay of today\u2019s call can be found on our IR website at salesforce.com\/investor.","With me on the call today is Marc Benioff, Chairman and Co-CEO; Keith Block, Co-CEO; Mark Hawkins, President and CFO; and Bret Taylor, President and Chief Product Officer.","As a reminder, our commentary today will primarily be in non-GAAP terms. Reconciliations between our GAAP and non-GAAP results and guidance can be found in our earnings press release.

A description of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions and other factors that could affect our financial results are included in our SEC filings, including our most recent report on Form 10-K.","So, with that, let me turn the call to you, Marc.","Marc Benioff","Thank you, John, and thank you everybody for being on the call today. As you can see from our results, Q4 capped off another record year for Salesforce. Revenue in the quarter rose to more than $3.6 billion, up 27% in constant currency, truly amazing for a company of our size. And for the full year, we delivered more than $13.2 billion in revenue, making Salesforce the fastest enterprise software company ever to reach $13 billion.","Based on our outstanding fiscal year \u201819 results, we are raising our fiscal year \u201820 revenue guidance to $16.05 billion at the high-end of the range, representing 21% projected growth year-over-year. And we expect this incredible growth to continue which is why we are now initiating a revenue target for fiscal year \u201823 of $26 billion to $28 billion organically doubling our revenue again in the next 4 years. I have never been more excited about the opportunity ahead for Salesforce. Around the world, more and more companies are investing in their digital transformations which start and end with the customer. Earlier this year, I was at the World Economic Forum at Davos where I met with hundreds of global customers. And I have also been on the road meeting with customers across the U.S. And everywhere I go, I hear the same thing. Companies are continuing to make incredible investments in their customer experience. They know they need to invest in becoming more customer-centric, more efficient and more automated. And when they invest, they are looking to do it with companies they trust, and that\u2019s why they are looking to Salesforce.","Salesforce is not only the number one CRM, but we are really their most trusted enterprise software vendor. And whether they are B2B or B2C, they are now becoming a B2B to C company. They are all transforming to connect with their customers in all new better way and we are the only company with an intelligent customer success platform for both B2B and B2C companies. Salesforce is the number one CRM. And as you all know, with MuleSoft, we are now the number one integration platform. We are also a leader in sales and service and marketing and in digital commerce. And in fact, service is on its way to becoming our largest cloud. That\u2019s incredible. That is allowing us to deliver a level of digital transformation never before possible. It\u2019s redefined the CRM experience for so many of our customers. And over the last 20 years, no other company has been more focused on customer relationships. We have not only remained totally focused on CRM. We have constantly redefined and expanded what CRM means. CRM is the largest and fastest growing market of enterprise software today, bigger than operating systems, ERPs and databases and we continue to take share and outpace this market.","According to Edge IDC, Salesforce commands 20% of the overall CRM market, more than the next three competitors combined. With Dreamforce, we introduced the Salesforce intelligent Customer 360 giving our customers a unified 360-degree view of their customers across every touchpoint in sales, service, marketing, commerce, communities and more. And we have a tremendous vision for the next decade with our intelligent Customer 360, a major growth engine for Salesforce moving forward. We are operating at a tremendous scale at Salesforce.","Just look at some of the daily milestones our customers have helped us achieve on our intelligent Customer Success platform. Everyday, 3 million sales opportunities and 3.2 million leads created in sales cloud, everyday 9.7 million cases logged in service cloud, and everyday, 1.9 billion emails sent from marketing cloud, amazing. Everyday, 44 million reports and dashboards created in Einstein Analytics and now, everyday, more than 6 billion predictions in Salesforce Einstein on our AI.","During the holiday shopping season, the Commerce Cloud processed more than 4.2 million orders and supported 690 million e-commerce page views in a single day. No other vendor provides CRM at scale and it\u2019s why Salesforce has been named one of the world\u2019s most innovative companies 8 years in a row by Forbes. Take Salesforce Lightning, we have revolutionized the Salesforce user experience with a redesigned, intelligent and intuitive new platform that is now making millions of users more productive. And Lightning makes it easy for them to build incredible innovation, customer experience, with Clicks, not Code. With Salesforce Essentials, we are now making it possible for millions of small businesses to tap into this innovation and deliver incredible customer experiences. But as we all know, every digital transformation isn\u2019t just a customer transformation, it\u2019s also an AI transformation. It\u2019s an automation transformation. This is a big shift for our customers. And the industry is undergoing it everywhere. That\u2019s why we built Salesforce Einstein AI innovation deeply into the Salesforce platform.","I am thrilled with the adoption of Einstein, which as I said, is now delivering more than 6 billion predictions every day. Now, with Einstein, we are enabling our customers to interact with Salesforce as easily and as naturally as they think and as they talk. Just as Salesforce brought our customers the cloud, social, mobile and AI, we are bringing them voice as well. In fact, half of the U.S. households already have a voice activated device. It\u2019s going to become a dominant user interface. But Salesforce is no exception. We have taken these consumer voice experiences and we have brought them to our customers and make them more productive at work. Now and very, very soon, every Salesforce app that has ever been built will have Einstein available to it. The power of voice isn\u2019t just getting information it\u2019s getting information into your database and into your CRM system. It has to be fully interactive. With Einstein Voice, customers will be able to update all of their data in Salesforce with voice command. AI is critical to every customer transformation. And the automation it delivers is driving the next generation of efficiency for companies. It\u2019s also radically transformation in the nature of work. And it\u2019s why all of the CEOs I have met with are talking about rebalancing and rescaling their workforce for the future.","As automation impacts the workforce, we recognize we have a responsibility to deliver our solutions to help people scale up for the jobs of tomorrow, especially for jobs in the amazing Salesforce economy that is growing around us, one that will create more than 3 million new jobs and more than 850 billion in GDP impact by 2022. That\u2019s why we created Trailhead, a personal learning cloud that empowers everyone regardless of their background, to learn and demand skills for free. We now have more than 1.2 million learners on Trailhead and are changing people\u2019s lives everyday. This week, as we celebrate another record year, we are also celebrating another great milestone, Salesforce\u2019s 20th birthday on March 8.","In 1999, Parker and I could not have imagined that Salesforce would be the company it is today. What I am most proud of is the trust we have of all of our stakeholders. There is a clear connection between customer success and the company\u2019s values and that\u2019s why trust is the heart of our culture. And we have seen this as we have grown our company over the last 20 years, focused on our culture as a key part of who we are as an organization, because we realize exactly as Drucker told us, our culture eats our strategy for breakfast. People are drawn to Salesforce, yes, because we are focused on customer success, but it\u2019s also because of our culture. Companies are excited to do business with us. They trust us to deliver the innovation they need to succeed in this fourth industrial revolution. In fact, Ethisphere just named Salesforce one of the most ethical companies again. Well, all of this is so exciting as we turn 20. Now, together, we build trust with our communities through the impact we have made. And over the past 20 years, together with our foundation and Salesforce.org, we have now given out $260 million in grants, 40,000 non-profits and NGOs use our software for free. And our employees have volunteered nearly 4 million hours in their local communities. I could not be more proud of them. And as Parker and I reflect back on the last 20 years, there is one word that comes to mind, that\u2019s gratitude.","To close, I want to thank all of our employees, our customers, our partners, our shareholders, our investors, our analysts and all of our trailblazers and communities around the world, who joined us in this amazing journey over the last 20 years. I am so deeply grateful and I hope you all celebrate with us on March 8.","Now, let me turn over to our Co-CEO, Keith Block. Keith?","Keith Block","Thanks, Marc. Good afternoon, everybody. As Marc said, we delivered outstanding results. As we continue to take share and lead the market Salesforce pioneered 20 years ago. It\u2019s been an incredible journey to $13 billion in revenue and our relentless focus on delivering innovation and customer success has fueled our growth and solidified our leadership in the market. We continue to grow internationally, expand across industries, and leverage our partner ecosystem as we drive toward our new revenue target of $26 billion to $28 billion in FY \u201823.","Salesforce has redefined the customer experience. We have become mission-critical to companies of every size and industry and we are deepening our relationships strategically all over the world. In fact, our $20 million plus relationships grew 48% compared to last year. This includes two 9-figure renewal expansions in the quarter. Our enterprise class relationships absolutely reflect the unprecedented mindshare and trust we have with CEOs. Take Barclays as an example. At the World Economic Forum in January, their CEO, Jes Staley proudly said that with Salesforce, they have just signed the largest technology agreement in their 300-year history. We are very, very proud to be Barclays\u2019 trusted partner in digital transformation as they deliver faster, more convenient services to their 48 million customers. I remember when our goal was to have the top 10 banks running their business on Salesforce. Then the goal was the top 20 banks. Well now, we do business with nearly every financial institution in the Fortune 500. We also significantly deepened our relationship with one of the world\u2019s largest telecommunications companies. They are leveraging Service Cloud, Marketing Cloud, Einstein and MuleSoft to personalize in-store and online engagement for more than 100 million subscribers. And we are thrilled that today, 96% of the media and communications companies from the Fortune 500 are our customers. And this is just the beginning.","I recently spoke with the head of one of the largest consulting firms who said that roughly 85% of their top 50 customers are just getting started on their digital transformations. So clearly, that\u2019s an indication that we have tremendous runway ahead of us. And this opportunity is global. In Q4, we strengthened our relationships with some of the leading companies around the world from expanding with Toyota, National Australia Bank in Telstra and in Japan and Australia to form a brand new relationship, also in Germany with BASF, the world\u2019s largest chemical maker. These global strategic relationships are driving our year-over-year revenue growth 26% in the Americas, 26% in APAC and 31% in EMEA in constant currency. We continue this momentum and better serve our multinational customers. 42% of our new hires in the fourth quarter were in regions outside of the Americas. Our thriving partner ecosystem is fueling our growth worldwide and making our customers more successful.","In Q4, the total number of global partner certifications increased 41% year-over-year. And in FY \u201819, net new partners grew 79% in APAC and 110% in EMEA compared to last year. In fact, I have met with the leaders of our top 5 consulting partners in the last month. And they have all said they are doubling their Salesforce practices over the next few years. So, not only are our partners investing more in their Salesforce practices, they are also running their business on us. Three of our top SIs expanded their relationship with Salesforce in Q4. We also significantly expanded our relationship with Google. We are excited to support their increased adoption to deliver more connected customer, employee and partner experiences at scale. And we are thrilled with the innovation we are delivering to make our customers more productive, including the integrations between the Salesforce platform and Google Cloud. Also in Q4, we became a reseller of Google Analytics 360, enabling marketers to act on insights and drive smarter engagements with our integrated solutions. Google Analytics remains the number one analytics solutions with our customers which we are very, very excited about. Vertical solutions, Health Cloud, and Financial Services Cloud, they continue to deepen our relationships across industries. Now, earlier I had mentioned Barclays and financial services, but with Health Cloud, in Q4, we had significant expansion with leading biotech company, Amgen. And they are using Salesforce across their business from improving patient outcomes to building apps for commercial applications with Heroku. Overall, we increased our business with Fortune 500 healthcare customers by 22% year-over-year.","Now, we are coming up on 1 year since our acquisition of MuleSoft and we are absolutely thrilled by their outstanding performance and the value we are creating for customers like SunTrust, State of Colorado and Unilever. And to keep pace with increasing demand, we hired more than 450 additional MuleSoft employees in FY \u201819 and we nearly tripled the MuleSoft architects driving our customers\u2019 digital transformations. We added nearly 2,000 MuleSoft developers to that ecosystem. So, it\u2019s something we are very, very excited about. And based on my conversations with our largest SIs, they are also very excited about the growth of their MuleSoft practices.","Now, core to our customer success and to our future success is our people. And recruiting and developing talent is the top priority for us as we head into FY \u201820. We are very, very proud of the strength of our culture. It\u2019s what drives our growth and innovation. It\u2019s one of the reasons companies of every size and industry want to do business with us. And that\u2019s why we are recently recognized by Fortune as the Best Company to Work For, for the 11th year in a row. Again, something we are very, very proud of. So, I want to thank our customers, our partners, our employees for another outstanding year. And I am looking forward to what we will accomplish together in FY \u201820.","With that, I will turn the call over to Mark Hawkins.","Mark Hawkins","Thanks, Keith. We delivered another year of outstanding financial performance, continuing to trend strong, durable top line and operating cash flow growth. We also delivered non-GAAP operating margin expansion for the fifth consecutive year while integrating the biggest acquisition in our history.","Let me discuss the highlights for Q4 in FY \u201819. Fourth quarter revenue grew 26% in dollars and 27% in constant currency. Our revenue had a year-over-year FX headwind of $38 million and an immaterial sequential headwind. For the full year, revenue grew 26% in both dollars and constant currency. MuleSoft continued its strong execution as part of Salesforce, contributing $181 million to total revenue in the fourth quarter. Of the $156 million of subscription and support revenue from MuleSoft, roughly 60% was licensed revenue. For the full year, MuleSoft added $431 million in total revenue net of purchase accounting adjustments. This came in far ahead of our initial guidance as we quickly executed on our plans to integrate MuleSoft and accelerate digital transformation projects for customers around the world.","Let me quickly discuss MuleSoft\u2019s revenue contribution and how to think about it going forward. As you know, the fourth quarter is MuleSoft\u2019s largest quarter of the year and you can see that in the results. However, as you build your models keep in mind that due to the license component, MuleSoft revenue is a bit more seasonal than our core products and can experience sequential revenue declines from Q4 to Q1 similar to the seasonality we see with Marketing Cloud. Our portfolio of industry leading products continued to deliver strong year-over-year subscription and support revenue growth in the fourth quarter. Sales Cloud grew 11% at a run-rate of more than $4.2 billion. Service Cloud grew 22% at a run-rate of more than $3.8 billion. Platform and Other grew 54%, including approximately $156 million from MuleSoft and is now at a run-rate of more than $3.3 billion and Marketing and Commerce Cloud grew 34% crossing a $2.1 billion run-rate. Dollar attrition remained below 10% at the end of the year.","Turning to margin, I am very pleased that we are able to drive continued operating leverage in the business while integrating MuleSoft and other acquisitions and investing in our growth initiatives. For the full year, we delivered 57 basis points of non-GAAP operating margin improvement, the fifth consecutive year of improvement. Fourth quarter GAAP EPS was $0.46, coming in much higher than our expectation. EPS benefited in large part from approximately $0.17 related to the net benefit of tax adjustments and $0.12 related to the mark-to-market adjustments of our strategic investments as required by ASU 2016-01 as well as the outperformance in the quarter.","Turning to cash flow, we had a very strong cash collection in the fourth quarter driving operating cash flow of $1.33 billion, up 27% year-over-year. For the full year, we delivered $3.4 billion of operating cash flow, up 24% over last year, an outstanding result that I am very pleased with, especially considering the impact from the MuleSoft acquisition cost. This translated to an operating cash flow yield of 25.6%. And with these strong collections, we chose to payback our $500 million term loan about 6 months early, saving on future interest expense. CapEx for the year was $595 million, approximately 4.5% of revenue, down from 5.1% of revenue last year. For FY \u201820, we anticipate CapEx to be approximately 12% of revenue. Free cash flow defined as operating cash flow less CapEx was $1.16 billion in Q4, up 27% over last year. And for the full year, free cash flow grew 27% year-over-year to $2.8 billion.","Unearned revenue this year ended at $8.5 billion, up 22% in dollars and 24% in constant currency, excluding an FX headwind of $104 million. On a sequential basis, unearned revenue had an FX tailwind of $42 million. Remaining performance obligation representing all future revenues under contract ended Q4 at $25.7 billion, up 25% over last year, including $450 million from MuleSoft. Currently, RPO a business that is both billed and unbilled and is expected to be recognized as revenue in the next 12 months was $11.9 billion, up 24% year-over-year.","Moving on to guidance, we are raising our FY \u201820 revenue guidance by $50 million to $15.95 billion to $16.05 billion for 20% to 21% growth year-over-year. With a great opportunity in front of us, we remain on track to deliver the $21 billion to $23 billion of revenue in FY \u201822. And we are establishing a new long-term organic revenue target of $26 billion to $28 billion in FY \u201823, representing growth of more than 21% year-over-year in FY \u201823 at the high-end of the range. This long-term target is consistent with the durable growth that we\u2019ve been delivering year after year. With this consistent durable growth, we expect to continue to deliver non-GAAP operating margin in FY \u201820 of 125 to 150 basis points year-over-year driven by continued improvement in operating leverage.","We are adjusting our fixed long-term non-GAAP tax rate to 22.5% for FY \u201820 from 21.5% in FY \u201819. The increase is due to several factors, including changes to our forecasted geographic mix of earnings. We expect OIE to be a net expense of approximately $70 million for FY \u201820. And we expect FY \u201820 GAAP diluted EPS of $0.66 to $0.68 and non-GAAP diluted EPS of $2.74 to $2.76. Our OID and EPS guidance assumes no contribution from mark to market accounting as required by ASU 2016-01. Finally, we expect FY \u201820 operating cash flow growth of 20% to 21% year-over-year. For Q1, we\u2019re expecting revenue of $3.67 billion to $3.68 billion, GAAP diluted EPS of $0.10 to $0.11, and non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.60 to $0.61.","Now, based on your feedback, we will provide the guidance for current remaining performance obligation going forward. And in that context, we expect to see RPO growth of approximately 24% year-over-year in Q1. To close, we delivered another outstanding year of financial performance, durable top-line growth, a fifth consecutive year of non-GAAP operating margin expansion, strong cash flow generation, and the integration of the biggest acquisition in our company\u2019s history. I\u2019d like to thank our employees, our customers, our partners, and our shareholders for your continued support.","And with that, we\u2019ll open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from the line of Brad Zelnick with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Brad Zelnick","Great. Thanks so much and congrats on a fantastic and to a phenomenal year, guys. Your new fiscal \u201823 guidance implies you will organically double the size of the company over the next four years, add massive scale and implying you\u2019ll be able to sustain a roughly 20% compounded growth rate. What gives you both the confidence and visibility, especially as just about every macroeconomic forecast out there has some degree of economic downturn between now and then? Thanks.","Mark Hawkins","Let me start, Brad. First of all, thank you. One of the things that I would say of course, you know we look at a long-range plan. It\u2019s based on the market. We happen to be, as we know, in the hottest part of enterprise software market and CRM, number one. Number two, the TAM in FY \u201822 alone is over $142 billion for all addressable market for us. Number three, our competitive position and differentiation continues to accelerate. You can see that in the market share when you add up the next three most notable competitors. And it\u2019s less than our market share which persists and continues to grow. We feel like we\u2019re in the full position with a great product offering, most importantly with our true north, the customer. I would start with that, Marc or Keith?","Marc Benioff","And I think that when you couple those core aspects of our model, including that the majority of revenue is deferred, and you look at this incredible off-balance basically, the RPO, and then you look at what\u2019s happening in the market today, we see three incredible levels of focus with our customers which, number one, is the movement to the cloud. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s been a more exciting macrotrend in both business and technology where so many companies realized that they can get much great acuity and speed in their business by moving to cloud-based systems. Number two Digital transformation, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a company that I\u2019ve met with of size and scale that isn\u2019t going through a dramatic digital transformation. And each one of those transformations begins and ends with the customer, just as I said. And it doesn\u2019t matter if they\u2019re a B2B company or a B2C company they are all becoming B2B to C companies. And it\u2019s requiring them to fundamentally transform their entire approach to what I would say is the third major trend, the customer. Those three things together, the cloud, digital transformation, and the customer become three dramatic trends that are moving all of our customers forward and have really taken the CRM market and made it the most important market in enterprise software. Last week, I was on the road all week in the United States. And I had the opportunity on Thursday and Friday to meet with hundreds of the largest companies in the world and their CEOs and I continue to see incredible optimism for the year and for the economy. Those CEOs are all talking about growth in investment. And they don\u2019t have what I would call economic anxiety, certainly not in the United States. When I was in the World Economic Forum in Europe, while I also saw a lot of confidence, European CEOs definitely have more anxiety. Yet, they are also continuing to invest aggressively.","The reason why they\u2019re investing so dramatically in these areas is this is critical for their future growth. IT is not an optional area of investment for them. It\u2019s how they\u2019re going to achieve their future results. And I\u2019ll tell you and I\u2019ll end with this. It\u2019s not just about digital transformation. It\u2019s really about digital automation. And that level of digital automation is not just AI. It\u2019s not just RPA. It\u2019s just a broad rethinking of their entire company structures and rebalancing their workforces based on a new level of automation that\u2019s available to chief executives to reevaluate how they run their businesses fundamentally. And that is something that we have really adjusted our company for. That\u2019s why you\u2019ve seen us make major investments in Einstein. And that has really paid out so well for our customers and has kept them really competitive, right at the very top of all digital transformations. The level of AI now in place with our customers is dramatic. And it\u2019s given them the ability to create new levels of efficiency in their organization as well as they\u2019ve seen dramatic increases in their revenues because of it. And I think as all of these trends continue to play out over the next 48 months, you\u2019re going to see us have this dramatic increase in our revenue that we\u2019re forecasting today. And by the way, of course, that\u2019s a midterm forecast in terms of the growth of our business. In the very short-term, I\u2019m excited that not only are we going to do more than $16 billion this year, but you can see we\u2019re rapidly approaching the $20 billion revenue mark for Salesforce. That is absolutely amazing.","Keith Block","I would just add one more comment to that. Marc is absolutely spot-on with respect to the digital transformation. I think if you take a look at the way companies have budgeted their IT spend with a balance of innovation versus maintenance just a few short years ago, for example, in the financial services industry, you would see that 90% of the IT spend was focused on maintenance. And now what you see in financial services is a drive toward more of a 50-50 spend between maintenance and innovation. So, this level of digital transformation is an imperative. And I\u2019ll go back to my opening comments as well. When we have one of our leading partners, one of the best firms in the world talking about how 85% of their top customers are just beginning to think about and strategize and embark on digital transformation that just gives us a lot of runway and confidence.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citi. Your line is now open.","Walter Pritchard","Hi. Questions for Mark Hawkins, [indiscernible] we have gotten pretty accustomed to doing the analysis around billings. And I know in the past, you\u2019ve even said you don\u2019t manage the business for billings. But focusing us on RPO, could you help us understand some of the factors that drive volatility in that number? And as we calculate it, we\u2019re looking at maybe bookings growth calculated off RPO that would imply growth below what revenue grew in both Q3 and Q4. I\u2019m just trying to reconcile that with understanding the drivers [indiscernible]. Thanks.","Mark Hawkins","Walter, thank you. Certainly, glad to talk about RPO. And again, everyone, and when we think about Dreamforce presentation, I want to put that out as a reference for folks too. But the way to look at that, obviously, is we have all - that\u2019s all the revenue under contract both for the current RPO which is the next 12 months that will show up and also beyond the next 12 months which is the long-term RPO, all making up the RPO. The factors that can impact that for sure are the timing of renewals. The attrition can affect that. There\u2019s a number of different things can affect that consistent with our Dreamforce presentation that we talked about. And one of the things when you look at RPO for this particular period, again, as we called out last year in Q4 \u201818, we had a that\u2019s when we were in pre-606 where we had billed and unbilled figure which is not perfectly comparable as we know with the transition, but we had 8 of the biggest 10 renewals in the history of the company. And we called that out distinctly.","The other thing that could impact things, at least on the long-term RPO, is the weighted average term length as well. That\u2019s why we like to focus the most on the current RPO which is the next 12 months that\u2019s coming. These would be some of the factors. The thing that we look at is once you get over a really unusual compare, which we called out last year both in Q4 of last year and at Dreamforce for Q4 of last year, you quickly see a normalization when you come back to Q4 of this year. And we think the 25% growth rate with $25.7 billion of RPO is a strong number and very consistent with the durable growth that we are delivering going forward. So, Walter, those are a few of the things that I would look at. Obviously, there\u2019s some FX headwind even in Q4 even on top of that. But the 25% with a $25.7 billion RPO is a number we\u2019re glad to see.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Keith Bachman with the Bank of Montreal. Your line is now open.","Keith Bachman","Hi. Thank you very much. I wanted to ask either Mark or Keith about Einstein. You mentioned that the uptake rates have been very strong in usage. I wanted to see if you could speak on monetization. Our conversations with customers, including our own bank, are that interest level is very high but, in fact, Salesforce is pricing incrementally that makes it harder to purchase it. And I just wanted to see how are you thinking about monetization. If you could speak more directly about uptake rates associated with payment on Einstein, thanks very much.","Mark Hawkins","Alright, great. I\u2019d love to address that. And I think I\u2019ll ask Bret to take that on and to give us his response. He\u2019s listening to us from Australia. Bret?","Bret Taylor","Yes. It\u2019s a great question. First and foremost, our strategy with Einstein is to improve the value that our customers are getting from our products. And I\u2019m going to give you a very concrete example of this. One of the major retailers I just spent time with a couple weeks ago, over 60% of their customer service cadences are now completely automated thanks to Einstein. They\u2019re doing that with actually improved customer satisfaction scores. So, it means that they can actually use their agents in more productive and for more complex. So, when we talk about Einstein, their satisfaction is through the roof because they\u2019ve been able to take their human capital and spend it in more valuable ways for their customers. Similarly, as I think you\u2019re aware, with products like the Einstein capabilities built into our Commerce Cloud, the value we get and the value our customers get are very aligned because our Einstein capabilities are choosing how to rank product listings and suggest products in a way that improves and increases the gross merchandising value from the retailers which improves the revenue that we get from those customers and improves the quality of our customers\u2019 business by enabling them to sell more. So, across our clouds, we\u2019re trying to align our Einstein capabilities with our customer value and make sure that our pricing is aligned with our customer value because fundamentally, as our relationship with our customer evolves from that of a vendor to that of a strategic partner, we want to make sure our monetization is aligned with our customer\u2019s value. And that\u2019s the strategy that we\u2019re taking. It will vary across our B2B and B2C products. We just want to make sure our packaging and pricing of our intelligence is aligned with the value that our customers get from the products.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Keith Weiss","Excellent. Thank you, guys, for taking the question. And very nice quarter. I think it\u2019s pretty remarkable we\u2019re seeing Service Cloud sustaining its 20%-plus growth into the end of FY \u201819. And like you said, it\u2019s well-positioned to become the biggest cloud into FY \u201820. Can you talk to us a little bit about the drivers of that scale it\u2019s almost twice the growth of what you\u2019re seeing in Sales Cloud and to what extent the vertical solutions that you guys have in the market are driving service cloud more so than a Sales Cloud or the like?","Marc Benioff","Well, hi, Keith. So, look. I\u2019ve long said that especially in this fourth industrial revolution, as our customers think about digital transformations, really, the way that they differentiate themselves and take share is providing the world-class experience to their customers. And that starts with service. So, this is really the heartbeat of a lot of digital transformation. And that\u2019s why you\u2019re seeing such great results with our service cloud. And that\u2019s why we continue to take share in service cloud. The other area that obviously is dragging that is that when we in a positive way, when we go to market, we go to market by industry solution. And so, customers don\u2019t really think about buying point solutions or point products. We\u2019re talking about a solution for their enterprise that will drive a different set of experiences for their customers. And when you think about Financial Services Cloud and Health Cloud and also some of the partnerships we have with other companies like Velocity, those also drag and put at the front and center of any of these transformation service clouds. So, we\u2019ve got a very, very good strategy around our industry solutions. And Service Cloud is really the heartbeat of digital transformation.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Mark Murphy","Yes, thank you. And I will add my congrats. So, when we see this abnormal growth and scale, what crosses my mind is that your competitors are trying to sell software tools to the IT department. And in contrast, you\u2019re really selling transformations at the top levels of the org chart. I don\u2019t think any other software company has ever had this kind of vision of transformation selling. So, I\u2019m curious where are you in that journey of building that muscle across your sales teams. And is that something that\u2019s helping you convert these nine-figure relationships?","Keith Block","So, again, we are in a very enviable position. And there\u2019s been a lot of work on this over time to really change the game in terms of our strategic relationships. And that\u2019s why we do have these trusted advisor type of relationships with CEOs. And it\u2019s very interesting because they\u2019re CEOs from basically every industry and every geography. And they want to talk to us about transformation. We spoke earlier about the Barclays deal. And you\u2019ve heard me talk about this on earlier calls, how CEOs like Jes Staley have brought their entire executive team out to speak with us. I was on the phone with a CEO in Australia last week who is going to bring his entire executive team all the way from Sydney to talk to us about digital transformation. So, we put ourselves in this enviable position because we\u2019re driving transformation. We\u2019re driving value. And they trust us. Obviously, trust is our number one value as well as far as our company goes. So, there\u2019s a lot of work that goes into this. It\u2019s a lot of building muscle and capability and process and methodology. But at the end of the day, a lot of this is our customers trust us. And we have great products and solutions and incredible innovation. Again, it\u2019s one of our core values. And that\u2019s why you\u2019re seeing these great relationships that we enjoy with other CEOs.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Your line is now open.","Raimo Lenschow","Hey, thanks for squeezing me in. Can I stay on that subject, Keith? If you think about, for example, the deal that Barclays is closing versus if you look at some of our customers, you are the guys who\u2019re driving the additional transformation around customers. But there\u2019s no other vendor that is anywhere close to your market reach and scope. So, where are we on the journey then for the other guys because to me that sounds like a massive opportunity. Can you talk to that? Thank you.","Keith Block","So, thank you for the question. Look, I think this is early days. We\u2019ve talked about the Fourth Industrial Revolution for a couple of years. And I still think we\u2019re trying to get our arms around that as an industry and as a society, I mean, there\u2019s a lot of implications across the board. Marc talked about rescaling the workforce and rebalancing workforces. There\u2019s a lot that goes into this, a lot of things that, again, we\u2019re just trying to understand in the beginning. But as far as these transformations go, when you have one of the largest consulting firms in the world say that 85% of their largest customers are just beginning this, and that\u2019s anywhere from having the dialog to planning these transformations. There is a lot of room for us to run, and we are in a unique position. There is no other company like us that has these sort of trusted relationships and earns the trust of these senior executives on a daily basis. And again, I go back to our culture. I go back to the caliber and quality of our solutions. I go back to the levels of talent that we have in the company. And all of these things have come together to put us in this market-leading position and we have really a very bright future.","Mark Hawkins","I\u2019ll just also add to that \u2013 I\u2019ll add to that, that I think that one of the really strong parts of what\u2019s happening in the market today is when you are talking to these CEOs, they are all prioritizing digital transformation as one of the most important things they\u2019re doing. At the same time, the line of business buyers are still out there buying sales, service, marketing, and these other capabilities. It\u2019s an incredible pairing of opportunity for us, and it\u2019s really kind of a nod, which I\u2019m about to give to some of these next-generation products like we\u2019ve mentioned in the call like Einstein and Service Cloud, Sales Cloud and MuleSoft, all of these things together building this intelligent Customer 360. And Bret, you\u2019re in Sydney and you\u2019re \u2013 you have \u2013 you\u2019re sold out, you have over 11,000 people registered to attend your event tomorrow at the ICC Exhibition Hall. Can you give us some insights into what kind of messages and what you\u2019re preparing to say there?","Bret Taylor","Yes. I mean, it\u2019s perfect timing to be here in Sydney. I actually just got off of a Product Roadmap Tour, where I visited 8 cities and 200 customers and shared our roadmap and talked to them about how they\u2019re applying our technologies. And it\u2019s exactly what you said, which is we have some customers who are just starting on this digital transformation journey who are really looking to us as a strategic consultant. One great example here in Sydney is a mattress company that was a traditional B2B seller. And because of a number of direct-to-consumer digital-first company, they\u2019re looking to us to help them become a B2C company. And what\u2019s really unique about that I think really represents the opportunity that you spoke about is, we\u2019ve had a multi-year almost decade-long relationship with this company with our traditional B2B products like Sales Cloud. And now they come to us and say, build on that trust that they have built with us and say, help us transform not just our technology, but transform our business model. And that\u2019s the kind of relationship that I think Keith is talking about where we have this privilege of having earned the trust over many years with these companies. And they\u2019re coming to us with problems that I know kind of geek in the room can look like a technology problem, but to the CEO, it\u2019s a business problem. And I think that gives us the types of relationships that we\u2019re talking about. And as I think Marc said very eloquently in the introduction, the fact that we\u2019re both B2B and B2C and that we are on the forefront of these business model transformations that are happening in every industry give us a very unique vantage point. So, that\u2019s the keynote tomorrow that\u2019s what we\u2019ll be talking about and the customers that we\u2019re highlighting I think are a very interesting combination of B2B and B2C, and as Marc said, B2B2C. And I think that every one of these companies wants to understand their customer and get that intelligent Customer 360, and we\u2019re in a very unique position to be able to provide that uniquely in the marketplace.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Ross MacMillan of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Ross MacMillan","Thanks so much, and my congrats as well. I actually just, Keith, wanted to get your sense of two things around digital transformation and where we are. One is international versus U.S. So, is it fair to say that international markets are a little later on that curve or is that an incorrect statement? And then just by vertical industry, I\u2019m curious as to \u2013 similar question, which vertical industries do you think have got the most opportunity ahead in this journey on digital transformation? Thank you.","Keith Block","Yes. Our strategy as you know has been as we\u2019ve moved into the enterprise to make sure that we\u2019ve had a strong international push and so we\u2019ve made those investments, that\u2019s why 42% of the employees that we hired were outside the Americas in the fourth quarter. That\u2019s because we\u2019re seizing upon the opportunity and working very closely with our customers. I think rather than look at it geographically, I think really to your point, really your second question, you have to look at it on an industry-by-industry basis because some industries are just further ahead, it\u2019s just the way it is. So, for example, a lot of financial services companies historically have thought of themselves as technology firms, so, they\u2019re further ahead. And that is an industry that is ripe for digital transformation and we see it on our results. Another industry that is ripe for digital transformation is the public sector, the governments around the world. And that obviously is a huge opportunity for us to work with the government and to provide higher levels of service through digital transformation. So, I think about financial services, I think about public sector, I think about healthcare. These are all industries that are going through a lot of transformation, retail, but at the end of the day, no industry is immune from digital transformation. If you\u2019re a CEO and if you\u2019re not thinking about your digital transformation strategy, you\u2019re going to miss the market, and that\u2019s playing out all over the world in every geography because it really to me is industry-based.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Phil Winslow with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Phil Winslow","Hey, yes, thanks guys for my question, and congrats on a great end of the year. Just wanted to focus on Marketing Cloud, we\u2019ve talked a little about Service and Sales Cloud. Marketing Cloud still seems to be for MarTechs having great momentum. Can you give us just some color on sort of what\u2019s driving that? And then a question specifically for Marc, when you think about MarTech and AdTech and you mentioned Google in the prepared remarks. Where does sort of MarTech end and AdTech begin? And how do you see Salesforce from a sort of competitive or partnership perspective in those areas?","Marc Benioff","Well, you\u2019re right. You can see it in the numbers. Marketing Cloud has been a tremendous growth driver for us and this year has been no exception. The numbers have been really incredible. And it\u2019s been driven by many things. Of course, as you know, it really is a product line that we have put together through many exciting acquisitions, including companies like ExactTarget, as well as Demandware. And what it\u2019s resulted in is probably the most comprehensive solution for companies, who are building that one-on-one relationship with their customer.","The most powerful part of our Marketing Cloud I really already hit and I\u2019ll have Bret touch on it in a second is that it\u2019s both a great Marketing Cloud for B2C companies and one that can operate at scale, tremendous scale as I mentioned in my comments, I\u2019m sure you saw, when we\u2019re sending out that many emails or addressing that many cases, no one else can really deliver that type of opportunity, but it\u2019s not just for B2C companies, it\u2019s also great for B2B companies too. And in one of the core areas of our Marketing Cloud, which is our Commerce Cloud, you saw how not only do we, for example, run all of the B2C interactions for a major customer like Adidas, but with the most recent acquisition with CloudCraze, we\u2019ll also be able to step in and provide incredible B2C capabilities.","On top of that, we\u2019ve really added tremendous analytics capabilities and that\u2019s in partnership with Google. As you know Google Analytics is really the number 1 analytics solution for companies trying to understand their relationship with their customers. And Google Analytics continues to gain market share with our customers and that\u2019s why we\u2019ve tightened our integration with Google Analytics. And in addition to that, we\u2019ve added our own comprehensive analytics solution, which integrates with that, as well as with all of our clouds which is why we acquired Datorama, which is the Israeli-based company who provides really marketers the ability to have really a mission-critical dashboard that shows them exactly how to invest and how to move forward based on the successes of all their marketing organization. So Bret, would you like to just touch on some of the success of Marketing Cloud this year?","Bret Taylor","Yes. I think Marketing Cloud has really been driven by these trends that keep us talking about this Fourth Industrial Revolution. One of the very unique value propositions of our Marketing Cloud is that, it completely uniquely in the marketplace can do personalization at scale. Now what that means is, every single engagement that you have in our Marketing Cloud whether it\u2019s a push notification or an email or a page that you see in our Commerce Cloud, it is personalized to you and your preferences. And to do that at scale essentially demands the technology that we\u2019ve invested in as a platform like Einstein, so that we can not only know how to reach you, but what message to send and understand all of your previous interactions in this intelligent Customer 360 to provide that personalized experience. And you mentioned MarTech and AdTech, I think it\u2019s a good question. We really view it as a continuum. We want to enable you to discover these products from our customers, we want to engage you, we want to drive you towards a transaction, and then we want to enable our customers to create loyal customers, and we really think of it as a cycle. And as Marc said, thanks to I think our very strategic acquisition strategy here, we have the most complete solution to drive that entire continuum, everything from discovery to loyalty. And that\u2019s why that cloud is growing so quickly because our customers don\u2019t just want the point technology solution, they want to enable themselves to compete with these digital-first retail customers that are really driving the consumer experience in this area, and our cloud is uniquely capable of doing so.","Marc Benioff","And Bret, as you are building this intelligent Customer 360, which is really the next wave of the product line and as you march towards Dreamforce this year to show customers what that next-generation intelligent Customer 360 looks like, what are some of the extensions that we would see to the Marketing Cloud that kind of demonstrate why that vision is so important?","Bret Taylor","Yes, that\u2019s a great question. I think historically, people have thought of things like Commerce and Marketing as separate, but with the intelligent Customer 360, we think of them in a very integrated way, and I\u2019ll give you a very practical example of this. With the intelligent Customer 360, once you\u2019ve purchased a product on our Commerce Cloud, your subsequent email journey will be personalized based on your product history, and that\u2019s enabled by this Customer 360. Similarly, if you added something to your shopping cart and you forgot to actually purchase it, you can be put on a journey to remind you to go back and purchase it. All this drives personalized experience for consumers which is a wonderful consumer experience and for our customers it improves their revenue and it improves their relationship with their customers. And really this vision for this intelligent Customer 360, the reason it\u2019s so strategic, you\u2019ve heard Mark Hawkins talk a lot about the strategy of multi-cloud engagements and how strategic they are to our business. For our customers, it means can we provide a truly integrated customer experience, so you don\u2019t see the seams between your different departments, you don\u2019t see the seams between these different technologies, and that\u2019s really what we\u2019re trying to create with the intelligent Customer 360.","Marc Benioff","The customer that comes to mind when you\u2019re talking about that and I think I\u2019m just cueing off of Keith\u2019s comment is, you saw that Dreamforce that when you see a CEO show up at Dreamforce like Brunello Cucinelli was there, the reason why he\u2019s able to partner so close to Salesforce is and why we become their digital transformation partner is, we\u2019re not there for just one silo of their business, sales or service or marketing or commerce. We\u2019re there to really help him bring his entire company together. And it\u2019s really the comprehensiveness of the solution that then really yields that result for them. And I think that\u2019s what has really given us so much satisfaction especially this year when we see a company like that or like when Keith talks about Jes Staley\u2019s ability to partner at the CEO level and for them to know that we\u2019re going to be able to bring all of these assets to bear and they\u2019re not going to have to just go to individual silo organizations within the customer segment that we\u2019re able to bring that entire CRM solution to them.","Mark Hawkins","Yes, I agree. I just would add one last comment. With all the innovation that Bret talked about with Marketing Cloud and Marc talked about with Marketing Cloud and the Google partnership, Marc that you and Bret had talked about, what strikes me is 37% growth. We\u2019re growing at multiples of the market. And that\u2019s something I\u2019m encouraged to see at a fiscal year level for Marketing Cloud.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Jennifer Lowe with UBS. Your line is now open.","Jennifer Lowe","Great. Thank you. We spend a lot of time hearing about how some of the biggest and leading \u2013 most leading companies are using Salesforce technology to engage in their digital transformations. But the smaller and midsize businesses have been a pretty big part of your bread and butter historically as well. Can you talk a little bit about how \u2013 what you\u2019re seeing sort of in the volume of your business in terms of how they\u2019re thinking about digital transformation? Are they even starting to dream about that at this point or is it still a ways out? And as you think about that longer-term target of $26 billion to $28 billion, how instrumental is the companies outside of those biggest companies going to be in achieving that?","Marc Benioff","Well, I think that as you look at where we\u2019re going \u2013we\u2019re certainly excited to initiate our 4-year guidance. And as we kind of head to $26 billion to $28 billion as we kind of work toward this year guidance of $16 billion and our very short-term guidance of $20 billion, which are just enormous numbers for any technology company. In all of these cases, I think it\u2019s going to really get back to one very important thing and that is something that our company has been very fortunate to build which is a relationship with all of our stakeholders. When we look at all of our employees here at Salesforce and our customers, when we look at our partners, when we look at our trailblazers, our MVPs or like we say at Salesforce when we bring all of these together, it\u2019s really our ohana. And we\u2019re still grateful to be able to have all these relationships with them that we together have been able to build these trusted relationships, that we have been able to focus on customer success, that we\u2019ve been able to deliver this incredible innovation and be recognized for it so broadly, and also at the same time to build a culture here at Salesforce that has been able to stand for so many incredible things especially quality.","Marc Benioff","But I just want to end the call by saying this, that as we approach Salesforce\u2019s 20th birthday on Friday March 8th, that it\u2019s really our fifth core value gratitude that comes to mind, because we are very deeply grateful for everything that has been given to us every single day over the last 20 years. And we want to thank you, thank you for everything that you have done for us. We want to thank all of our ohana, who are listening to us on the call and all those who have done so much over 2 decades, because this business is very much a team sport and we couldn\u2019t be more grateful for all of you. So, thank you very much. And we\u2019ll look forward to talking to you next quarter.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation on today\u2019s conference.

[Operator Instructions] Thank you.","I will now turn the call over to Mr. John Cummings, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","John Cummings","Thanks so much, Torres. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us for our fiscal second quarter 2018 results conference call. Our second quarter results press release, SEC filings and a replay of today\u2019s call can be found on our IR website at www.salesforce.com\/investor.

Thank you so much, John. I really appreciate it. And before I begin the script and talking about our quarter, I really wanted to review something that I sent to the Company last week, regarding some of the things that we\u2019ve been seeing in the world. And I thought it would be appropriate if we just took one minute and just allowed you to hear these words as well.","As the world has watched with all of us the horrors of the last week taking place in the United States and Spain. The pure hatred that we have seen displayed is everything we all want to end. And I\u2019ve been especially disheartened to see the display of symbols of hatred including Nazi flags and salutes to KKK hoods. The horrible tragic death of Heather Heyer was a senseless act of terror and this hatred must end now.","Salesforce is a company that is built on the values of love, equality and generosity. We work hard every day to improve the state of the world through our own work and promote our Company\u2019s mission to others. We all have to recommit to our own personal acts of love and kindness as this is the only way to fight this pure hatred. We can all make our own choices between love and hate, and we can all love more. Now is the time for all of us to remember, love thy neighbor as thyself.","Okay. Thank you very much for allowing me to say that. And now, I\u2019d like to move into the quarter.","We had our best quarter ever and we reached a huge milestone for the company. As you might remember, two and a half years ago, I talked about our dream of surpassing $10 billion in revenue. And at that time, we were just on a $5 billion revenue run rate. While I can remember how many employees and customers and partners came up to me and said there is no way you are going to get to $10 billion. What kind of a dream is this? And now, I am absolutely thrilled that in the second quarter we broke through the $10 billion run rate, doubling the Company in such a short time.","Now, Salesforce is the first enterprise cloud software company in the history of the industry to reach the $10 billion run rate. No competitor has pierced $10 billion this fast, not Oracle, not Microsoft, not SAP and certainly not which has $15 billion of deferred revenue on and off the balance sheet. This makes Salesforce the fastest growing enterprise software company ever to reach this milestone. And this incredible achievement is now coupled with an incredible dream.","We now set our sights on $20 billion and doubling the Company again. And you can see today how we can get there organically with our unmatched product portfolio, world-class team, and as I mentioned $15 billion in booked business on and off the balance sheet. While this was a phenomenal quarter of growth, we continue to improve our profitability, executing at scale and we remain the fastest-growing of all the top five enterprise software companies.","Now, let\u2019s talk about some of the highlights of the quarter. Revenue for the quarter rose to almost $2.6 billion, which was up 26%, and we are heading fast to $20 billion in revenue. As I mentioned, we have more than $15 billion in booked business on and off the balance sheet, that\u2019s up 29% from a year ago. In fact, we added more than $3 billion to this balance since last year.","Based on these strong results, we are raising full year top-line revenue guidance by $100 million to $10.4 billion at the high end of the range, 24% growth for this dream, and I will tell you personally, I\u2019ve got dreams of 25%. This is the second quarter in a row we have raised our revenue guide by a $100 million and only the third time in our history. Now, there is a reason for our incredible success year-after-year and why we continue to be investing at such an incredible rate to be the number one CRM company, is because no other company like ours has ever been as committed to customer success as Salesforce, and that\u2019s reflected in how our customers are driving tremendous success for their customers.","You all know that customer relationship management, whether it\u2019s B2B or B2C, has already become the most important and fastest-growing enterprise software category, growing at nearly 14%, and that\u2019s going to come for years to come. Well, it\u2019s a massive $100 billion plus opportunity that Salesforce is leading, and we are in a phenomenal position going forward. We all see the $1 trillion CRM opportunity in front of us.","Now, we see that by our -- through our number one position and that\u2019s because we are number one in CRM, number one in sales, number one in service, number one in marketing, and we have the number one platform that we have a tremendous opportunity to deliver on these goals. And we are delivering this at a scale every single day, creating nearly 3 million sales opportunities, more than 5 million customer cases sending 1.4 billion emails, processing 1 million purchases, and producing 40 million reports and dashboards every single day, that\u2019s 1 billion reports and dashboards a month, by the way, all while delivering more than 5 billion platform transactions a day. And it\u2019s no wonder that Forbes just named Salesforce the most innovative company in the world again.","We were the first to bring innovations like cloud and social and mobile to CRM, and now we\u2019re the first to deliver artificial intelligence to all of our customers with Einstein, right inside our core platform across all of our products. This is a massive $1 trillion growth opportunity. According to IDC, the combination of CRM and IA - excuse me, according to IDC, the combination of CRM and AI will create more than $1 trillion in new GDP impact worldwide; 800,000 net new jobs by 2021, amazing. And we\u2019re already seeing how Einstein is a game changer for customers, delivering hundreds of millions of critical insights, recommendations and predictions every single day. But, our biggest advantage is more than 27,000 talented employees of Salesforce, these incredible people who are focused on making our customers successful with our products. No other company can match this level of focus on the CRM market.","All of this adds up to Salesforce, becoming increasingly strategic to our customers and to our partners who are trusting us to bring them into this incredible new future. You\u2019ll hear more about that in a second from Keith.","While it\u2019s only August, we\u2019re officially on the road to Dreamforce, which is going to take place in San Francisco, November 6th through 9th, and it\u2019s going to be the most exciting, most inspirational and most innovative Dreamforce ever. And I hope all of you can be there; you\u2019re not going to want to miss one moment. Okay, Keith.","Keith Block","Thanks, Marc. Good afternoon, everybody.","As you can see from our results, Q2 was another outstanding quarter across the board. It\u2019s clear that our strong execution and commitment to customer success are enabling us to build deeper and more strategic relationships with companies around the world of all shapes and sizes. And every conversation I have with CEOs, they mention growth as their number one priority, and getting closer to their customers is a key driver of that growth. That\u2019s why leading companies like Amazon or 21st Century Fox, or Jefferies Investment Bank, Samsung, all of them chose Salesforce this quarter to drive their digital transformation. One of the largest automakers is also going wall-to-wall with Salesforce, building a seamless brand experience for consumers across all touch points and channels.","Today, 8 of the top 10 automakers around the world rely on Salesforce for their digital transformations. We also expanded with one of the world\u2019s leading logistics and transportation firms to transform the way that they deliver service to their millions of customers worldwide across every channel, social, mobile and the web. We continue to establish and grow relationships with marquee brands and unlock new value for customers by delivering innovative solutions and executing on three key priorities, expanding internationally; focusing on industries; and growing our partner ecosystem.","Now, our international growth continues to represent a huge opportunity for Salesforce as we march towards that $20 billion plus goal that Marc mentioned. We continue to make significant investments in our international go-to-market resources, our operations and our infrastructure to serve our global customers. In fact, more than 40% of our new hires year to date have been outside the United States. And in Q2, Salesforce went live on Amazon\u2019s cloud infrastructure in Canada, very, very exciting. Customers can now access Salesforce locally via the AWS Canada Region. And Amazon continues to be an incredible partner as we expand in Canada as well as Australia. These investments contributed to our outstanding international results this quarter with constant currency revenue growth of 31% in EMEA and 27% in APAC, complementing our strong and consistent growth of 24% in the Americas.","In APAC, we had a very strong quarter in Japan, closing deals with established companies including Toshiba and Nomura, and we had some great winds in Australia with Queensland Urban Utilities and Australia Post. In Europe this quarter, we entered into new relationships with Kering, one of the world\u2019s top luxury groups. I think everybody was excited about that one. Salesforce will be their clienteling solution across all of their brands including Gucci and Yves Saint Laurent.","We also expanded with Carrefour, the region\u2019s second largest retailer, formed a new relationship with Groupe Auchan, and we close a strategic Commerce Cloud deal with Sephora Europe. All good stuff, and clearly the leading retailers of the worlds continue to turn to Salesforce.","In fact, companies are coming to Salesforce as their trusted partner in digital transformation. Speaking of trust, we\u2019re committed to helping our customers comply with the forthcoming GDPR, including a GDPR website, a new trailhead module and the contractual addendum to assist our customers with compliance. This fall, we will be publishing product specific best practices and we will have several sessions at Dreamforce.","Now, let\u2019s turn to industries. You\u2019ve already heard about our momentum in retail, we had a great quarter with retail, and we\u2019re very, very proud of those results, but we\u2019re also expanding our relationships in financial services with Hero Price [ph], New York Life, and HSBC. Hero Price [ph] chose the financial services cloud to deliver personalized, highly relevant service to clients across every channel. New York Life, a great customer doubled down rolling out Sales Cloud and Service Cloud to another 6,000 agents and customer service specialists. And HSBC will leverage Marketing Cloud globally across its retail and wealth management divisions to create personalized banking experiences for their customers. In the public sector, the Department of Veteran Affairs which is working hard to improve services for veterans expanded with Service Cloud analytics and platform in the quarter. Lastly, in health and life sciences, we had a very large expansion with one of the top pharmaceutical companies in the world. And today, 15 of the world\u2019s 20 largest pharmaceutical firms rely on Salesforce.","Our success in the quarter was driven by our ability to speak the language of our customers and that is translating into outstanding industry momentum for us.","Now, as Salesforce grows, so does the opportunity for our partners. Salesforce partner certifications have increased 5x in the last four years, and partners are investing more in their Salesforce practices. Accenture is actually a great example. In Q2, they expanded their Salesforce capabilities in the federal market and they are also leveraging the Salesforce platform to provide vertical solutions across many industries. I\u2019m sure, you all saw the announcement that Accenture will provide trade promotion and marketing operations for Unilever, all of which is built on the Salesforce platform.","Now, before I close, I want to give you a quick update on the integration efforts. We\u2019ve moved quickly to integrate both products and operations across the companies that we acquired in FY17 including Demandware, Quip and Krux. And it\u2019s clear that our integration efforts are absolutely paying off. In the case of Demandware and Krux, these products did not only enhance our B2C product offerings and expanded our total adjustable market but they also accelerated our growth.","So, to close, I would like to thank our partners and our customers for their continued trust in us and of course our 27,000 employees who are laser-focused on making our customers successful every single day.","Now, I would like to hand the call over to Mark Hawkins who will share a bit more about our financial execution in the quarter. Mark?","Mark Hawkins","Thank you, Keith. And as you\u2019ve heard from Marc and Keith, we delivered a great second quarter. Revenue grew 26% in dollars and 25% in constant currency, excluding a year-over-year FX tailwind of approximately $7 million. We also saw a sequential tailwind of approximately $23 million. Our portfolio of products performed extremely well in the quarter with balanced year-over-year revenue growth across the board.","Sales Cloud growth accelerated to 17%, driven principally by core Salesforce automation and continue traction of Salesforce CPQ. Service Cloud continued to outpace the market with 21% growth. This is a slight uptick in growth from last quarter, reflecting the investments we\u2019ve made in the product and sales enablement. Platform and Other grew 32% where we saw especially strong growth from Heroku. Marketing Cloud excluding Commerce Cloud grew 36%, touching the $1 billion run rate this quarter and Commerce Cloud contributed $63 million to total revenue with $51 million in subscription and support revenue. Dollar attrition for the second quarter excluding Marketing Cloud and other acquired businesses remained below 9%. We expanded our second quarter non-GAAP operating margin by 195 basis points year-over-year. In the quarter, operating margin benefitted from an FX tailwind that was roughly offset by a margin headwind related to the fair value adjustments of Demandware.","Non-GAAP EPS was $0.33, which was up 38% over the last year. Operating cash flow was $331 million, up 32% over last year. Deferred revenue ended the quarter at $4.82 billion, up 26% in dollars and 25% in constant currency, excluding an FX tailwind of $32 million. On a sequential basis, deferred revenue benefitted from an FX tailwind of $17 million. Commerce Cloud contributed $54 million to deferred revenue in Q2.","Moving on to guidance, starting with revenue. Coming out of another quarter of outstanding performance, we once again are raising our full year FY18 revenue guidance by $100 million to $10.35 billion to $10.4 billion for 23% to 24% growth year-over-year. We are also raising our FY18 GAAP diluted EPS guidance of $0.07 to $0.09 and non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance of $1.29 to $1.31.","It\u2019s important to note that coming out of a strong second quarter, we are accelerating our investments in expanding our distribution capacity, new product initiatives, and Trailhead. These investments are set up for the long-term growth while pressuring our near-term margins. Nevertheless, we remain on track to deliver a 125 to 150 basis points of non-GAAP operating margin improvement in FY18, despite a slight FX headwind. These investments are critical to sustaining our long-term growth and leadership in the largest and most important marketing and enterprise software. And at the same time, we are mindful of how important profitability is to our investors. And we remain committed to ongoing margin improvement year-after-year in our long-term non-GAAP operating margin target in the mid-30s.","Turning to cash flow. We are maintaining our full-year operating cash flow growth guidance of 20% to 21% year-over-year. Among other items, guidance considered one, strong new business in the second quarter, which drove higher cash commission obligations; and two, the fact that Q4 is our second largest cash collection quarter. So, without the benefit of that quarter, it\u2019s difficult to further refine its full projection at this time. That said, we are closely managing our capital expenditures in the second half of the year and now expect FY18 CapEx as a percent of revenue to be approximately 5%. In context, we expect free cash flow to grow faster than operating cash flow for the full year.","For Q3, we are expecting revenue of $2.64 billion to $2.65 billion; GAAP diluted EPS of $0.04 to $0.05; non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.36 to $0.37; and year-over-year deferred revenue growth of 18% to 19%. This deferred revenue guide reflects the continued deepening of invoicing seasonality that we\u2019ve been discussing for the past several years; and as a reminder, the same seasonality also impacts cash flow. And one final item, we\u2019re on track with our implementation of ASC 606 for Q1 of next year. We expect to talk more about this at our Analyst Day at Dreamforce on November 7th. If you\u2019re interested in attending, please reach out to our Investor Relations team.","So to close, our second quarter wrapped up a great first half of fiscal 2018. I\u2019d like to thank our employees, our customers, our partners, and our stockholders for their continued support. And with that, we\u2019ll open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Keith Weiss Morgan Stanley.","Keith Weiss","Thank you, guys, and very nice quarter. And also, Mr. Benioff, thank you for those comments; definitely, I think needed in these times. I wanted to ask a little bit about sort of the margin profile for FY 2018, sticking with 125 to 150. It\u2019s evident that with FX getting a little bit easier into the back half of the year, you guys see something from that to move for investment? [Ph] I was wondering if you could drill a little bit on the decision to sort of keep operating margin guidance where it is. And may be as a follow-up. What are those incremental investments you\u2019re planning on making to the back half of the year to offset that FX alleviation or the pressure.","Marc Benioff","Thank you very much for asking that question. I think that when we think about earnings, and obviously we have this incredible top line growth, and there is one word that really comes to mind and that\u2019s balance, which is that it\u2019s incredibly important as we grow our company and exceed these incredible revenue targets that we also continue to grow our bottom-line. And I am sure that Mark will address the specifics of how much we\u2019ve grown our bottom line in the last few years.","But one of the things that continues to be on our minds is, how -- what are the ways that we can grow our margin while also continuing to grow our top line, and we\u2019re absolutely committed to doing both. And I think that\u2019s on the mind of every single member of our management team. I think we\u2019ve continued to deliver those numbers actually very well and we\u2019ll continue to do that going forward. And that\u2019s also under the guise of pressure that we get from foreign exchange, like every time the euro increases, its valuation that puts more pressure on our bottom-line. Mark, do you want to address?","Mark Hawkins","Sure. I am happy to do that Marc. Thank you Keith for the question. I will address both parts of it, Keith, one is the margin and one is the specifics of where we\u2019re investing. The first thing I just want to clarify is that for the full fiscal year, we\u2019re seeing a slight headwind from an FX standpoint for the full fiscal year. That\u2019s one point I want to clarify. We\u2019re maintaining the 125 to 150 basis-point improvement, again that\u2019s consistent with what the guide has been on a larger base now, as we raise the revenue and other $100 million; second time we\u2019ve raised a $100 million as you know, it\u2019s on a bigger base and consequently we\u2019ve raised the EPS by a $0.01.","And what we looked at in terms of the opportunities, we looked at the big opportunity that Marc has talked about of over a $100 billion in TAM, and we see that opportunity with unit economics that are very attractive in the mid 30s in terms of unit operating margin economics. And so, we\u2019re pursuing that. Obviously, we\u2019re investing and accelerating investing in distribution capacity, number one, Keith, very specifically; and also in new product initiatives, number two; and also Trailhead, number three. These are three things very specifically that we\u2019re doing to really help us even in the growth beyond this current year. And so that is something that we\u2019re mindful of because this opportunity is very, very large, as we described. As Marc called out, this is the fourth year in a row of operating margin expansion. We are mindful of that. We are very focused on delivering this 125 and 150 plus the growth. Hopefully that gives you a little complexion of both.","John Cummings","Keith do you want to address \u2026","Keith Block","Yes. I think that Marks have done a very good job articulating what our strategy is here. I think at the end of the day, we see the opportunity in the marketplace. We are already the market leader and we are expanding our share. We are taking share. But we do see that opportunity. So that means that we have the opportunity to invest and continue to invest in our innovation, in our infrastructure, in our customer-facing assets, to capitalize on that opportunity. And that\u2019s exactly what our strategy is.","Marc Benioff","I\u2019d like to think of this investing in growth by design and enhancing our profitability every step of the way.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Bhavan Suri with William Blair. ","Bhavan Suri","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. And to Keith, Marc Benioff, thank you. Thank you for those comments. It was meaningful. I guess, I\u2019d ask my two questions quickly. One is, you\u2019ve seen acceleration now for a couple of quarters in Sales Cloud, Service Cloud accelerated despite the very, very healthy growth last year, Marketing Cloud on organic basis doing really well. If you were to think about the breakout outside the cross-sell, meaning how are these clouds doing on their own? Because obviously, cross-sell in Keith\u2019s business of sort of doing the enterprise deals is helping. Is there any way to understand sort of how these are doing on their own? I\u2019d like to get a little color on sort of pure Sales Cloud without sort of the cross-sell and its growth. And the follow-up question I had was one of the challenges you\u2019ve had over the years is sales people entering data into a CRM system and obviously Salesforce had a huge step forward above Siebel and Bon [ph] and Legacy Solutions and now Lightning has enabled that. What do you think sort of -- Marc, as you think about sort of acquisitions or organic strategy, like natural language processing, talk to systems as for sales guys enter data themselves is a path you will go? Just wanted to get some color on both of those? Thank you.","Marc Benioff","Well, let me take the last question first, which is that Salesforce actually gets its data from a lot of different places. More than half of the transactions, when we talk about 5 billion transactions a day, more than half of those transactions are API transactions already, that\u2019s other computers filling our database with data. And we have just amassed a huge amount of customer data based on that. We have so many integrations and so many customers so deeply integrated. And then there is many different ways that customers get their information into our system. Of course, we have many natural language type systems like one you mentioned, voice type systems like you\u2019ve seen us do work with Alexa, with Amazon and I think you will continue to see an evolution of that. One area that I am especially proud of is mobile. I don\u2019t think any enterprise software company has done as good a job with mobile as Salesforce.","Salesforce has -- with Salesforce1, with My Salesforce1, Salesforce Inbox, many of our mobile offerings and mobile platform capabilities, more mobile capability than any other enterprise software company. And that has really allowed customers to access and work with an input data in lots of new ways. Because mobile devices are empowered and enabled to so many kind of, I would say, next generation capabilities including many operating systems that have very deep AI, as you know, all of that is already tied into Salesforce. So, it\u2019s a very extremely powerful.","Keith Block","Let me try to address the first part of that question. So, it\u2019s interesting. I think if you look at the history of software, most companies are lucky to have a great first act but Salesforce is a company that\u2019s had a great first act with Sales Cloud, a great second act with Service Cloud, a great third act with Marketing Cloud, a great fourth act with Platform, and we continue to innovate for our customers and we speak the language of the customer. So whether it\u2019s pure play cloud innovation with add-ons or just pure play features and functions, or it\u2019s the solutions that we assemble by vertical, the financial services industry was particularly strong one for this quarter, we have this retail as with HLS. This gives us the opportunity to cross sell and up sell. So, each of these clouds by themselves would be the largest cloud company in the world or amongst the largest cloud companies in the world. So, standing alone, they\u2019re very, very, very strong, they\u2019re each a market leader. But when we have the opportunity to drive digital transformation for CEOs, the walls between sales, service and marketing come down. And we have the right solutions and that\u2019s why you\u2019re seeing these results.","Operator","Our next question\u2019s from the line of Kash Rangan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Kash Rangan","Let me echo my congratulations, one for Marc Benioff, one for Mr. Hawkins. Marc, when you look at your goal to double the Company size to $20 billion in revenue organically, historically you\u2019ve seen some of your peers like SAP Oracle struggle to maintain that hyper growth once they hit the $10 billion mark after the ERP cycle ended. What have you been able to observe from history that gives you the confidence that you can overcome those odds and position Salesforce to be an organic growth company, even at that level at which Oracle SAP could not maintain their growth rate? And one for Hawkins. I calculated your bookings margin. By the way, your bookings growth rate included the off balance sheet backlog change and the on balance sheet for revenue. Your bookings grew about 39%, fully spectacular. And I also calculated your bookings margin to be 30%. And I was intrigued when you said your unit economics were running in the mid 30s. Just wanted to clarify and see what you meant by that. Thank you so much.","Marc Benioff","Yes. Thanks for that, Kash. I think that number one for us, here we are, we\u2019re blasting through $10 billion, all of you have your models for Salesforce, you can plug these preferred revenue numbers into your models and do your calculations of where our revenues going to be in each of the next several years. And I\u2019ll tell you, we took our whole management team offsite two weeks ago to lay out our plan for what we call chapter three. Chapter one for us certainly was zero to $1 billion, it\u2019s well documented in the book Behind the Cloud, how we did it, what we did, all of those capabilities. We want to write a second book now for entrepreneurs of what we did from $1 billion to $10 billion. We think that\u2019s an important story that needs to be told. That\u2019s certainly chapter two. Now, we\u2019re in chapter three, which is to go from $10 to $20 billion. And I\u2019m sure all of you can see that\u2019s going to happen in fairly short order.","I think that one of the things that we have done to focus on and make sure that we blast through $10 billion is to focus on customer success. I think a lot of mistakes that the other entrepreneurs have made and I can go through each one. In enterprise software specifically, it\u2019s not to really double down at this point, again on the customer. Get absorbed in your own myopia, get absorbed in your corporate politics, get absorbed in your corporate bureaucracies and yourselves, and try to break out of yourself and recognize the most important thing, continues to be the customer. And how do we enable that customer and empower that customer and of course, we\u2019re going hold ourselves accountable and we\u2019re also going to deliver all kinds of other capabilities along the way as well. But, that is really our focus, which is how do we make our customers more successful than ever. And I think that\u2019s the heart of our culture. We have a great culture at Salesforce, it\u2019s a culture built on our core values of trust, of growth, of innovation, of quality. But I think nothing is more important to our Company than customer success. And even though the vast majority, let\u2019s say half of the 27,000 employees that work for us today probably were not with us two years ago. So that is something that we really have to spend time with them at. We\u2019re different than other software companies because we really care about that customer and we\u2019re going to make sure that customer is successful.","When you\u2019re an enterprise software, you have to realize, it\u2019s hard work, not everything is going to be perfect all the time, there is going to be problems. That\u2019s why being so committed to the customer I think is more important than ever. And I think that\u2019s why you\u2019re going to see extraordinary growth for years to come, because of this culture that\u2019s really driving it forward. And then we coupled it with this incredible CRM opportunity. And I have to say our competitors have really done a horrible job in last few years. I just would say that a lot of them have abandoned the CRM market. If you talk to the major CRM analysts and we do that, we just had one of them at our management conference, they are shocked, we\u2019re shocked of how these companies have really walked out of the CRM market, companies that had huge multibillion dollar positions in the CRM have ceded that market to us. And that\u2019s very exciting when you look at the huge investments that we\u2019ve made, not just in product but also distribution. More than half of our organization is a customer-facing organization. We sell directly and service directly to the customer. That is going to serve us very well for years to come. So, I feel very good and I think you can see it in the numbers here. As I said, we\u2019re here forecasting 24% growth for the year that\u2019s our official guidance. I have personal dreams of 25%. I think that would be amazing. No software company kind went through the $10.4 billion number at these rates. And so, when we chart, we had a chart couple of weeks ago, Microsoft\u2019s growth over 30 years, Salesforce\u2019s growth, Oracle\u2019s growth, SAP growth and wow, we really separated ourselves from those traditional growth trajectories. And I feel that that\u2019s going to continue to happen.","Mark Hawkins","So, let me take the second part of the question. Kash, thank you for the question. Kash, I haven\u2019t seen the modeling that you\u2019ve done but let me disclose what we disclose, which is around the total book of business, we have billed and unbilled deferred revenue totally at $15.2 billion; the billed portion of course grew 26%; the unbilled portion grew 30% to make up that that total amount of our business. And as we like to think about, that total billed and unbilled deferred revenue is obviously revenue waiting to happen over time. The one thing I would say to you about the unit economics, if we go back to our Dreamforce presentations for the last several years, we talk about life time economics, the cost of book, the cost to serve and then what that results in over time is in the mid-30s in terms of the unit economics at mature growth rates and that\u2019s what we see very specifically. That\u2019s what I can share with you. And obviously that\u2019s against the $100 billion market that we\u2019re pursuing. So, that\u2019s what I would share.","Operator","Our next question is from line of Pat Walravens with JMP Securities.","Pat Walravens","Marc, first of all, thank you for sharing that message and for standing up for what\u2019s morally right. I mean that\u2019s great to see from corporate America. What I would love to hear is your thoughts on the platform strategy, how the environment has changed and how you think the platform strategy should evolve over time?","Marc Benioff","Well, the platform strategy has evolved over time. I mean, one of the cool things for us is we have a tremendous capability with our platform. And that really started with this idea that we are building these amazing CRM apps like sales and service app but our customers wanted apps really designed for them. The traditional approach has been companies building vertical apps, almost from the get-go and creating these customizations and enhancements right inside the hard line code. That never sat well with me, mostly because my background was in application development and deployment tools.","So, we really built our platform in a way that let us build our core applications and let our customers extend them. And that is why so much amount of data has been built inside of Salesforce. I don\u2019t think a single customer has the same implementation of Salesforce. And yet when we upgrade and update our software which we do three times a year, we don\u2019t break links and we don\u2019t break these customizations, and customers get Einstein and mobile and all of our enhancements and yet they have their highly customized capability, no other company in the world has that. Even today when most companies upgrade and update their core applications even in the cloud, they don\u2019t upgrade all customers democratically, they kind of give customers warning bells that we are going to do this but it\u2019s going to break your system. We don\u2019t do that. We have a way through our metadata architecture to really extend that.","And then, as we have acquired companies, we have brought that platform religion to them. So, when we look at all of our core products, they all have core platforms. Platforms are incredibly important because they let customers enhance their system in highly specialized way. Platforms are also extremely important because they drive down attrition. I think as we -- we just ran our numbers for this management conference that I mentioned, two weeks ago, if you look at our attrition rate over the last 10 years, one of the reasons we drive it down is because of our platform.","I think one of the reasons we have been able to deliver so quickly this amazing work and financial services that Keith has led, which is the building of our financial services cloud and our financial services business unit is -- and our success in financial services is because of our platform, rapidly. When we figure out a market or capability that we want to have or focus on, we can rapidly deliver that. That\u2019s also true with Keith\u2019s healthcare initiative as well. And that I think has been a very powerful part of our approach.","Our platform is unique, because not only of course do we have our core platform, which includes our Sales Cloud platform and our Service Cloud platform and our Marketing Cloud platform but we also have extensions of that platform like Heroku, which is one of the most powerful and popular application development and deployment capabilities on Amazon. And we of course have tightly integrated that into our core platform. So, customers for example, I\u2019m wearing this amazing new Louis Vuitton watch today. And this Louis Vuitton watch is connected to something called LV Pass, which is the Louis Vuitton app that helps me manage all of my Louis Vuitton products. And that is built on Heroku. And then all of the CRM data for Louis Vuitton however is built and managed inside our core platform, and all of it is deeply integrated. So, when I walk into a Louis Vuitton store, they know who I am, they know all the products that I bought like the watch, or my carryall or whatever it is that I like of their products, and I am managing it all through that Heroku app on my phone with all LV Pass. That\u2019s a great example of our platform strategy where we let customers build highly complex applications like Louis Vuitton with their icon app and you can see that inside any Louis Vuitton store when you go into work with a Louis Vuitton account executive and you can see it yourself as a consumer with Heroku when you use LV Pass on your phone. I hope that answers your question.","Keith Block","I think it\u2019s great. At the end of the day the other thing is our partners, our ISV community. If you look at the explosion of our ISV community, we\u2019ve now gotten into a situation where our ISVs are building mission critical apps. Just a few short quarters ago, we made an announcement of a company that\u2019s actually building a clinical trial management software, which is pretty interesting, again on top of our allocation. You probably saw the Unilever announcement most recently with Accenture about Accenture building CPG related applications on our platforms. So, it\u2019s very, very robust for our partner community. And of course, we have our largest ISV, which is Veeva, which is unique in the sense that it focuses just on pharmaceutical firms.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Ross MacMillan with RBC.","Ross MacMillan","Thank you very much and my congrats as well and thank you Marc Benioff for the comments. One for Marc Benioff or Keith to start with. Just on Einstein, I know it\u2019s early days. But, we started to see some bigger customer announcements like Airbus and U.S. Bank. I am just curious as to when you think Einstein actually will start to have a material impact on your numbers, on the results? And then a follow up for Mark Hawkins. Just, we raised revenue for two quarters here, we raised EPS for two quarters here but we didn\u2019t raise the cash flow from operations growth guidance. And I just wondered if you could revisit that as to why. Thanks.","Marc Benioff","Yes. I mean, I think Einstein has hugely exceeded our expectations. And I would say from my perspective, it\u2019s already material part of our results. I think it\u2019s a critical part of how we differentiate our product against now all of our competitors because we\u2019re the first company to take the robust AI capabilities including machine intelligence, machine learning and deep learning, and offer that to our customers in a unified CRM platform through our sales, service, marketing applications, commerce applications across the board. That has really happened faster than we expected, more deeply than we\u2019ve expected, and it\u2019s been more exciting for our customers than we expected. I think also, the branding choice that we made with Einstein also exceeded our expectations because it let us rapidly communicate to our customers that we\u2019ve extended our core platform with artificial intelligence.","As we kind of head towards Dreamforce, you\u2019re going to see a lot of exciting things. With AI, I have seen some amazing things. In financial services, I just saw some amazing things in healthcare; I am not going to go into the details on the call because some of the results are still early. But, we\u2019ve seen some amazing breakthroughs in using artificial intelligence with healthcare. I think this is going to be one of the huge new drivers of growth. You can see that the cloud is a huge driver of growth for Salesforce, mobile is a huge driver of growth for Salesforce, and now you\u2019ve got AI as this next generation system. And every company has to look at what are they using -- what are they doing with AI to make their customer relationship better. I just gave you the story about Louis Vuitton. Einstein is built into all of those apps. And I can tell you that helps that Louis Vuitton account executive when I walk in the store; they are able to give me that next best offer. I think it\u2019s probably one of the reasons that we already closed at Kering Group in this quarter, another incredible luxury brand family with Gucci and Bottega Veneta because we\u2019re able to offer these companies the ability to have much better, much smarter relationships and do it so unbelievably quickly.","I also just bought some amazing new sneakers on Adidas and called Primeknit Shoes, checked out some of the stuff they have or some of the stands that tennis shoes or other Yeezy 350s that they have on the Adidas and a lot of the recommendations and capabilities that you are getting already on the platform are through Einstein. So, Einstein is an incredible advancement and it\u2019s great for all of our clouds. And again, I don\u2019t think the other enterprise software companies that moved fast enough into artificial intelligence.","Mark Hawkins","And let me pick up the second part of the question, Ross. Thank you for that. A couple of things here, one is our guide. You are absolutely right. We are holding that at $2.6 billion, roughly speaking. Really two things that I would elaborate on. One is that we have a very distinct seasonality in Salesforce. We get a lot of our cash in Q1 and then the other big cash flow quarter is in Q4. And so, at this time, with the line of sight that we have, I think it\u2019s better to wait and get better visibility than we have today. We think it\u2019s a very solid guide and we will revisit that in November, number one. Number two, I would say to you that, I did call a little bit earlier in the call, but I\u2019ll elaborate a little bit. We had deferred commissions, the obligations on that on a cash basis because we had a strong book of business in Q2, having effect in the year even if the expense is capitalized over a longer period of time. And so, obviously, we try to factor things like that into it.","I would say the third point is just as a matter of reference, if you look at our trailing 12-month operating cash flow and revenue growth, they are pretty close together, looking back. So, that\u2019s where we are at today. We think it\u2019s appropriate. And lastly, we are managing our CapEx tightly and we will talk again in November.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank.","Karl Keirstead","Thanks. I\u2019ve got two questions on two backlog numbers. First is the 30% unbilled backlog you put up, that\u2019s a fantastic number because it\u2019s actually accelerating I think over the last couple of quarters, despite that number getting larger. So, I am wondering, if you could offer any added color, maybe there was more multiyear deals, some larger deals? And then secondly is the 18%, 19% 3Q DR growth. I guess this one would be for Mark Hawkins. Mark, you mentioned that\u2019s due largely -- it\u2019s obviously less than normal seasonality. Is it due entirely to the invoicing seasonality, may be something else going on? I know Dreamforce drops in 4Q this year rather than 3Q. Does that pick any zip out of your 3Q DR growth? Thank you.","Marc Benioff","Sure. Let me jump in and then maybe Keith or Mark might want to add on the first one and I will close loop on the second one on the 18% and 19%. You are absolutely right, Karl. The unbilled deferred revenue at 30% is a slight acceleration and a very, very big number in terms of growth. We have -- I think it\u2019s really reflective of a strong business that we\u2019ve been describing, that Keith has been describing in his dialogue, a large sort of deals over a long time but just overall health, across geos, [ph] across clouds. Keith, if you want to jump more into that, but I think the 30% is a slight acceleration. Karl\u2019s absolutely right. If you want to add any more commentary, I will circle back to 18% and 19% DR.","Keith Block","I think at the end of the day, the strategy around the innovation of our products is very, very compelling and we\u2019re backing it up with incredible execution. So, I want to take you back to our three growth levers of international strategy, speaking the language of the customer, which is the industry orientation of course and our partner strategy. And all of three of those are just executing beautifully right now. We\u2019re very, very proud of the team. And that results in very deep relationships, very strategic relationships, multi-year relationships, multi-cloud relationships across all these different verticals, and that\u2019s why you\u2019re seeing this bit of an uptick. It manifests itself in small companies and large companies, but certainly we\u2019re establishing or we continue to establish these very, very deep multi-year, very strategic relationships with these customers and that\u2019s why you see these financial results.","Marc Benioff","Thank you, Keith. And let me just pick up the second point, Karl. In terms of the DR of 18% to 19%, this is really about the deepening invoice seasonality, it just continues. And one of the things that I would call out to everyone and I think just to share with you is that we have 12 years of history on our webpage, our IR webpage with supplemental information that shows every quarter for 12 years and the sequential impact because this has been a topic we\u2019ve been trying to share at Dreamforces for the past several years. But you can actually see the math and even fit in the guide for this quarter, and it really shows us deepening invoice seasonality continues. And the other thing that I would add and I do think there is one little extra bit of color that I would like to add, Karl, which is look at that trending just as it is and then you take a look at the fact that last year in Q2 2017, we had a seasonally soft Q2 2017 and we had a seasonally strong Q3 2017. And so, you put that and you look at that results delivered at minus 9% quarter-on-quarter and you\u2019ll see it perfectly on the graph but then you put it in juxtaposition to this year in Q3 2018, we have a -- obviously we\u2019re appropriately guided and we had a very strong Q2. So, those are the things to think about as well the bottom line and that\u2019s where we\u2019re at, that\u2019s what you should consider.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Tom Roderick with Stifel","Tom Roderick","Thank you for taking my questions. Nice job on the results. So, Keith, you referenced a great third act here in your Marketing Cloud. And if we look at the numbers, I think you said 36% growth, when you strip out the impact of Demandware. So, can you just talk a little bit more about what\u2019s driving that? What sort of role is the Krux DMP playing here? And then, how is the Demandware integration is going to serve to pull through core growth on the marketing side around the B2C business? Just love to hear little bit more about that. Thank you.","Keith Block","So, there is a lot in there. So, I appreciate the question. So, let me just start by saying that we\u2019re absolutely thrilled with the acquisitions that we\u2019ve made. And they have worked out very strategically, not just in our financial results but more importantly with our customers driving success. If you think about the product portfolio and our pivot here towards more vertical orientation, the assembly of Marketing Cloud plus Krux plus Demadware\/Commerce Cloud is a very, very nice portfolio. If you think about the companies that we\u2019re doing business with, we talked about Kering, we talked about Carrefour, we talked about Groupe Auchan, we talked about Sephora. I mean, we just continue to bring up quite a roaster of some of the world\u2019s leading retailers. And it\u2019s not just retailers by the way, because every company is trying to go from, for example B2B to B2B2C or directly to B2C, and that\u2019s where they are buying for our vision and what these products bring to bear. So, they are clearly resonating from a transformation perspective with these customers, not just in retail space but in other companies who are trying to become more consumer-oriented. We\u2019re trying to get more insights around their customers or just connecting to the customers, like they have never been able to do before.","As far as the integrations are going, we\u2019re thrilled with the way that the integrations have gone. I think we all know that integrations can be difficult, they can be fraught with risk, there is lots of complexities associated with those integrations. And we\u2019ve certainly cut our teeth on a number of acquisitions. And no integration is perfect but I will tell you with Krux and Commerce Cloud, we\u2019re thrilled with the way those integrations have gone. And we continue to invest in those products more than those companies would have invested in themselves had they remained standalone. And again, you\u2019re seeing it with the market penetration. Just to give you an example, Marc alluded to earlier that we\u2019re investing in our second half. Well, one of the things that we\u2019re doing is we\u2019re doubling down on the Salesforce associated with the Commerce Cloud, because we see the opportunity for that particular product. So, the net-net is, I think we\u2019ve assembled a really course at our products whether its Krux across individually, whether its Marketing Cloud which has performed marvelously for us over the last four years or whether it\u2019s a Commerce Cloud acquisition that is resonating with our customers, and that\u2019s why you\u2019re seeing such great results.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Sarah Hindlian with Macquarie.","Sarah Hindlian","I wanted to get to few areas with both Marks. I will start with you, Marc Benioff. I want to pick your brain on the overall macro backdrop and how you\u2019re seeing in particular the federal vertical? Are you seeing anything going around potential debt ceilings and anything there in regard to the federal strategy? And then, for Mark H. Hi, Mark. I wanted to talk to you a little bit about the channel work we\u2019re doing and finding, which has some nice early ASP uplift from new adopters of Einstein, in particular in services, sales as well. So, I really want to talk to you about, what is your Einstein strategy, where it\u2019s evolving, and how you see that uptake impacting the financials going forward?","Marc Benioff","First of all, I think you can see this great win with the Veteran\u2019s administration this quarter is an indication of the government vertical is working better than we expected. We\u2019ve organized by specialized verticals, one I mentioned was financial services and built products there. We\u2019ve also organized by healthcare, we\u2019ve also built products there. Third one is government and we built products there. And I think our win with the veterans this quarter, I think all of us know that nobody delivers better systems and better customer service than our veterans, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re so excited to be able to align with the agency to go to build these next generation systems for them. And I think we started to see government spending come back on line this quarter, really for the first time. And so, we\u2019re very excited about what the future could mean, as the government looks to kind build next generation systems, looks to move to the cloud and provide better service and support to its customers.","Mark Hawkins","Okay. And the second part, Sarah, happy to take this well here, and may be, Keith, you might want to jump in too on the channel work that we\u2019re doing. I think the first thing I would say is that Einstein is early days sort. But with that being noted, to your point, we do see opportunity. Some of the Einstein capability is built into all aspects of our cloud. And some of it is incremental SKUs where there is -- the value is such that they\u2019ll be incremental money on those SKUs as well to deliver that specific value. And so, there will be a combination of those two. Everything gets smarter and then some things will have even more SKUs that will create even more solutions for our customers, which obviously, if done well, creates great growth opportunity for us. And that\u2019s the way we think about it and I think that\u2019s the way it will show up in the financials. And Keith maybe want to elaborate a little on that.","Keith Block","I want to go back to the Marc\u2019s comments about the veterans administration. Our public sector team is one of our highest performing organizations of the Company. And they\u2019ve had over the last four years -- they have done incredibly well in terms of expanding their capabilities in all branches of the government, both federal and state and local. And that has been very, very exciting for us. I think we all know that the government is trying to undertake some sort of digital transformation. This is nothing new. It actually started under the Obama administration. And the CIO under the Obama administration was one of our former employees. And he was very keen on introducing the cloud to the federal government. So, we\u2019ve just picked that up and continued but it\u2019s clear that the government is really trying to accelerate that digital transformation, and that\u2019s why the veterans administration is yet again another example of trying to drive that transformation, leveraging our technology.","Operator","Our last question is from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI.","Kirk Materne","Keith, I want to follow-up on a comment you made around AWS and the partnership there in Canada. When we talk to some bigger financial institutions, data privacy has been something has come up as maybe something that\u2019s been a bit of a gluing [ph] machine in terms of feeling comfortable adopting Salesforce. It seems that this partnerships are opening up that. And as you look across other geos, especially with financial services customers. Do you feel like that that partnership is going to give a lot of leverage and hopefully accelerating there some deals that were stuck on some localization questions? Thanks.","Keith Block","First of all, thanks for the question, it\u2019s great to hear from you. So, look, we have a great partnership with AWS. They are one of our largest customers. We continue to build that partnership out with them. So, we\u2019re thrilled about that. And of course, we\u2019ve chosen them as our platform in Canada and plan for the second half of the year in Australia. I think there is a lot of synergies there in the eyes of financial services customers as well as other customers outside of the industry. And we\u2019re going to continue to leverage that. Some of these customers already are already AWS customers, so there is a natural comfort level as well. So, look, I think at the end of the day, how a strong partner, having a set of very strategic partnerships is a great thing, obviously AWS is one; we have strong partnerships with others like IBM as another. And those things help to play out very nicely for our customers. But AWS, that relationship is strong and that just gives us a lot of flexibility as we continue to focus and expand internationally.","Marc Benioff","Yes. And as you mentioned, IBM, we continue to get more and more integrations with IBM. We\u2019ve had some great early successes with Watson. And our opportunities are to work with all of these amazing companies to deliver a solution that serves our customers. And I think we\u2019ve been probably done a better job I think in forming the strategic alliances and maintaining them than probably any other company in the industry. And I think it\u2019s one of the reasons we had such a great quarter.","Well anyway, thank you everyone for a great call. And we couldn\u2019t be more excited, as I said. I think this is probably our best quarter ever. It\u2019s far exceeded our expectations. We\u2019re thrilled to raise guidance for the year and set our next dream as $20 billion, and here we go. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect."],"19546":["salesforce.com, inc.

My name is Ashley, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Salesforce fiscal third quarter 2016 earnings conference call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to our host, Mr. John Cummings, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin your conference.","John Cummings","Thanks so much, Ashley. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us for our fiscal third quarter 2016 results conference call. Our third quarter results press release, SEC filings and a replay of today's call can be found on our Investor Relations website at www.salesforce.com\/investor, and we'll also post the highlights of today's call on Twitter at the handle, @salesforce_ir.","With me today is Marc Benioff, Chief Executive Officer; Keith Block, President and Vice Chairman; and Mark Hawkins, Chief Financial Officer. Marc, Keith and Mark will share a few prepared remarks, and then we'll open the call for questions.","As a reminder, our commentary today will primarily be in non-GAAP terms.

We cannot guarantee the timing or availability of these services or features, so recommend that customers listening today make purchase decisions based on services and features currently available.","Some of our comments today may also contain forward-looking statements which are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions.

A description with our risks, uncertainties and assumptions and other factors that could affect our financial results are included in our SEC filings, including our most recent report on Form 10-Q.","And with that, let me turn the call over to Marc.","Marc Benioff","Well, thank you, John. And before we start and go into the call, which of course would go through our results, we want to let everybody know that our thoughts and prayers are with everyone in Paris, with all of our employees and all of our customers that have been going through such a horrible situation. And we've also been just especially shaken by our customers, who have lost employees in this horrible tragedy. So we're so sorry, and our thoughts and prayers are with everybody in Paris.","Now, I want to go through our third quarter results and give you an update on how we're doing. Also, joining me on the call is Keith Block, who is in New York City, who just finished the world tour there, and we watched him this morning with his team. Keith, are you there? Can you hear us?","Keith Block","I am absolutely here Marc.","Marc Benioff","Fantastic. All right. Well, Mark Hawkins is also with us, our Chief Financial Officer, and the three of us really feel the duty today to talk about another outstanding growth quarter for Salesforce.","Now, you can see from these results, we are on pace to deliver well over $6.6 billion this year, which is faster than any other enterprise software company in history. And I am thrilled to share with you that we are expecting to deliver more than $8 billion in revenues or $8.1 billion revenue at the high-end of our range for next year. So that is amazing.","And we could not be more excited about the results of the third quarter, we could not be more excited about coming into the fourth quarter and we could not be more excited about the potential for next year. And you can see that we have something in sight, which we have been talking about now for several years, which is our $10 billion a year.","And of course, Salesforce, as you can see will be the fourth largest software company in the world next year, but you can see that we'll be one of the only software companies ever to reach $10 billion in revenue. And as we become number four, we have number three in our sight, and we certainly [technical difficulty] goal as well quite wholeheartedly.","Now, as many of you are predicting, Salesforce will be indeed the fourth largest enterprise software company in the world next year, behind only Microsoft, Oracle and SAP. And we are really making a difference for our customers and the industry, and it's attributed to our employees, almost 20,000 of these employees, who are similarly focused on one thing, our customer success.","I'd like to kind of give you some specific from the results for the third quarter. Revenue for the third quarter rose to more than $1.7 billion, which was up 27% in constant currency from a year ago. That is absolutely I think the best performance that I've seen in the top 10 enterprise software companies. And Salesforce continues to be the fastest growing of the top 10 enterprise software companies, and we are really excited with our 27% number.","Deferred revenue grew to more than $2.8 billion or up 30% in constant currency from a year ago, pretty incredible at our size and scale to see that achievement. And the dollar value of booked business on and off the balance sheet is now more than $9.5 billion. So that, again, is the setting us up very well for next year and the future.","As we delivered on this outstanding topline growth, we also delivered 221 basis points of year-over-year non-GAAP operating margin improvement. And as you know, while we are absolutely committed to be the fastest growing enterprise software company and delivering these phenomenal topline numbers, we are also deeply committed to continuing to increase our profitability, and the results this year are evidence of that.","So let's be clear, Salesforce is the only software company selling billions of dollars at CRM, and we are at the center of what every company is going through is digital transformation, it's what every company wants to be in the 21 century.","So now, during the quarter, I want to tell you, I met with hundreds of CEOs around the world. And I'll tell you, when we're meeting with CEOs, they are not that interested in talking about honestly about the cloud or about social or mobile. They want to talk about their customers and they want to talk about their topline, they want to talk about how they're going to grow that topline, and this is the really, really exciting thing that's going on, which is this customer revolution.","We're really talking about connecting with -- talking about talking with our customers about a connect with their customers in a whole new way, accelerate their growth, creating this one-to-one customer journeys, running their businesses from their phone and making smarter, more predictive decisions. And I'll tell you, one of those customers is us.","And at the end of this quarter it just kind of blew me away. I was using Salesforce One, which has I think almost I think 1 million active users on it now. And my IT department here at Salesforce have built several new apps, which got automatically installed on my phone, because I'm using Salesforce One.","And I'm using this incredible Sales Forecasting app, where I'm just physically touching on the photograph of all of our sales leaders around the world, kind of navigating through our pipelines and through our forecast, and it was amazing just to feel to run my business from my phone, and have that kind of connectivity with my customers. And I think that today more than ever connecting with customers like that is absolutely essential, because as a CEO I can tell you, it puts you on the pulse of your business and what's really going on.","Well, I think that that was definitely evident for everyone who attended Dreamforce. And if you came to Dreamforce, you saw the biggest software conference ever and you also saw not just a huge amount of customers. But we really rolled out incredible new innovations, which is enabling my own personal experience with Salesforce product, but for a hundreds and thousands of Salesforce customers who are using these incredible new product like our new Lightning platform, which is amazing.","You have the ability to build an application and run it on any device on a phone, on a tablet, on a PC, it transcends operating systems, it transcends devices and we have rebuilt our sales and service and our core community products and all of our core platforms on this amazing new Lightening platform. And when it shows up, it's done nothing, like I've ever seen, which gives you this incredible modern experience in mobile environment.","And then of course we also added SalesforceIQ to bring machine intelligence to that. We introduced our IOC cloud, even bring it into the Internet of Things, and maybe you can you can transform that Internet of Things into Internet of Customer.","Well, of course, we also have our analytics cloud with our new Wave app, and there is just still much more. And I'll tell you that walking around Dreamforce, it was just blown away off with our ecosystem, and then hundreds and hundreds of companies who have built on this platform and who have made so much happen.","But I guess what I'm most proud of is that during Dreamforce we also held the largest book size ever collecting over a million book to schools. We also raised over $10 million for the UCSF Children's Hospital in San Francisco and Oakland, and I'll tell you that I want to thank all of our partners and our customers for helping us to achieve those numbers there, because it's really, really awesome.","Well, I'll tell you it's been an exciting few months here at Salesforce, and I would say that nothing is more indicative of how Salesforce is delivering customer success and how this Lightning platform is being adopted. In the third quarter we delivered more than $259 billion transaction, which was up 63% from a year ago. That's 4.1 transactions every single business. There is no other customer platform come close to that level of usage.","And while our transaction continue to skyrocket and our customer success continue to skyrocket, we committed also to reducing our carbon footprint. And the environment is a key stakeholder for us and we continue to show how the multi-tenant cloud platform is 98% more efficient than on-premise software. And we're helping customers avoid a many more than a million tons of carbon each year through our unique architecture of cloud computing.","Well, we have to do more, and we've made significant commitments to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. And over the next several weeks, in Paris at the COP21 Conference, we'll be making more announcements on how Salesforce is focused on the environment.","Well, as you're about to hear now from Keith, we're working with some of these great customers to deliver a fantastic result to accelerate the digital transformation. And I guess there was no more stronger evidence point in the analyst community than Gartner's 2016 CIO Agenda, which I am sure a lot of you follow as I do, and they found that Salesforce is rated as the number one accelerator by the majority of respondents and received the highest digital acceleration score. At a 30 vendors, Salesforce was at the top. And just Gartner did an amazing job on the CIO Agenda Report and we haven't had a chance to look at that, I would.","Well, anyway, let's hear from Keith, he's had a huge day already in New York. I can see him on the monitor here, so he's still there, which is good. And so Keith, tell us how did New York go today?","Keith Block","Thanks, Marc. We had a great day in New York with over 8,000 people registered. So it was a terrific event and well-received and the customers are very, very excited about our messaging.","Marc Benioff","Well, Keith, you know what, I think everyone on the call would love to talk to you now about how your experience was in the field. We obviously had a great Dreamforce. We saw more customers this year. I know you and I this year have been in front of more CEOs and CIOs I think ever in our entire career, and everyone wants to talk about how to transform the customer experience.","I don't know a company today that isn't reviewing on how to transform their customer experience and how to not get, I guess, a lot of them say, they don't want to get uberized out of the world. But some of them I think are don't want to get postmated out of the world, because I just ordered my lunch on postmates here in San Francisco. So maybe you can tell me your experience there in New York.","Keith Block","All right. So thanks, Marc, I appreciate it. And it's great to be here, and obviously thanks to everybody for joining the call. As Marc had indicated, this was just a terrific third quarter. And one that I would characterize, I think we all would characterize, as one of the most memorable exciting quarters that we've had here at Salesforce.","And we heard it today and we continue to hear, the message from our customers is very clear. And while many of our competitors are struggling quite frankly to catch up for the cloud, Salesforce is taking customers and foreigners forward into the age of the customers. We are squarely in this age of the customer.","Marc and I just talked about this, but I had the opportunity to kick off our Salesforce world tour here in New York. Again, over 8,000 people registered for this event. And people want to be here, both customers and prospects, companies like American Express, and Mattel, and Western Union and awful lot of customers through a variety of industries about how they are reinventing their futures and leveraging Salesforce.","And as I speak to you, the top customers around the world, and Marc is exactly right, many of them are CEOs, which is terrific. There is a constant theme that keeps coming through here, and that is that we are clearly in this age of the customer and the time of cutting your way to prosperity is over.","And when you think about it, the agenda for every CEO in the world is growth. And the reason why CEOs are coming to us is because they've see Salesforce as that catalyst for growth, and we are also quite frankly a catalyst for customer success.","So whether it's a company of all shapes and sizes, whether it's a business model with B2B or B2C, large company or small company, regardless of the industry, these CEOs are really looking at us now to be their trusted advisor, and really help them define their new customer strategy, their digital strategy, their engagement model in really new ways to transform into a customer companies, and that's just become super, super important to them.","And all of this has translated some of the most exciting deals that we've done in our industry. We had another huge quarter of fantastic wins. In fact, the total number of our large transactions in Q3 was up significantly compared to last year in terms of value. Our relationships are becoming bigger, they are becoming broader, they are becoming more strategic and deeper. And we are now working with some of the world's greatest brands, and this is a far different roster of companies that we have historically worked with.","A big part of that success quite frankly has been our industry strategy, and we talked about this on many calls, but this is about our ability to speak the lines of customers and to understand their business problems and drive a level of innovation and a point of view. And it's become a regular part of how we engage with customers of all size, from the smallest to the largest of enterprise. And it's really proving out in our results.","And I'll give you a few examples. Certainly, there is a company that we've all heard of called, General Motors. They have 125 million cars on the road. They have a significant vision for the connected vehicle. And in Q3, they selected Salesforce to connect drivers, the cars, merchants and retailer to bring a connected vision, a great experience to life.","And with a push of a button, drivers are going to be able to instantly connect with the OnStar advisor and retailers and merchants, and it doesn't matter where they are, and they're going to get real-time information. And this is an example of a company GM that is really embracing the opportunity around the Internet of Things. And we are really excited about working with them.","We are entering the holiday season, as we all know. We're seeing a lot of traction in retail. And I'm thrilled that we closed the largest marketing cloud deal in the company's history with a very large retailer in Q3. They are taking things to the next level by personalizing the shopper experience across every single channel.","We're going to be at the core of their omni-channel consumer engagement strategy, and they will be able to create a very personalized and predictive one-to-one relationship with customers at every single touchpoint, which is really compelling. And they're also going to be able to anticipate what the next step is and what the next action is, and what customer might need and relevant suggestions at exactly the right moment. So we are very excited about that new partnership.","Another great win was with AECOM. If you're familiar with AECOM, they design and build and finance and operate some of the largest and most iconic infrastructure projects around the globe, including here in New York the World Trade Center and the Tokyo 2020 Olympic stadium, which we're very excited about, as are they. They have nearly 100,000 employees in more than 150 countries. And we are all thrilled that AECOM has decided to move their entire company to our platform.","In finance and services, which is certainly a key focus area for us, we have expanded our relationship with American Express, one of the great brands in the industry, a company that has been delivering world-class service for more than 160 years. In the quarter, American Express selected Salesforce to bring their sales and marketing and product teams altogether to collaborate and to coordinate, so that they can further transform their customer experiences for their business payments. Super excited about that new relationship.","And what's interesting about that deal is that Amex and so many others continue to use our Ignite process to really reconceptualize their futures. And this is a very unique solution selling approach that is all about the art of the possible. We have increased our Ignite tenfold in the past few years. It is a standard part of our selling motion. It is one of the best investments quite frankly that we've made and it's having a significant impact with our customers.","If fact, one of the leading high-tech manufacturing company in the world also engaged with us in the quarter and in ignite. And that resulted in a significance eight figure deal, which we're very, very excited about. And right before Dreamforce, I think as we all know, we introduced our first vertical-specific product line with health cloud and financial services cloud.","We're very excited about the growth opportunity for these clouds. The interest has been very strong. We're excited about their future. And these products are really translating our incredible core technology into the language of the customer, which is part of our industry strategy. And we are cultivating an excellent ecosystem of partners for all of these solutions. So we're excited about that as well.","International continues to be a cornerstone of our growth strategy. And in the quarter we extended our relationship with a company called AB InBev. They've been in the press a lot recently. They are one of the world's top five consumer product companies. They've standardized their collaboration with us globally, and that's after a successful relationship start in Europe. And now they're going to reinforce the consumer-eccentric digital approach and innovation efforts, leveraging our products as well. So we're excited about that.","And AB InBev joined ABB and Barclays and GlaxoSmithKline, Telef\u00f3nica, Virgin Media and so many great leading companies in Europe, again who selected Salesforce in Q3. In Asia-Pac, we continue with our strength. We closed deals with Australian Post and Syntel, Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Toyota, and the list goes on there.","So I really couldn't be more thrilled about the success we're seeing internationally. We continue to invest in our selling capacity, our service capacity, our data centers, our offices, our partners, all to drive growth and to make our customers successful.","Another area where we continue to make progress quite frankly is with our partners in our ecosystem. And I'm very proud of the results we're seeing with regional and global systems integrators. Our partner certifications in the quarter, they were up more than 40% from a year ago, which is outstanding. And with all of our global SIs growing at an even faster rate, this is a great indicator that the most important consulting partners and firms in the world are betting their business and their customers' business on Salesforce.","So we have firms like Accenture and Deloitte, PwC and Cap Gemini, they're all increasing their Salesforce practices. They are walking arm-in-arm into the C-suite with Salesforce. And in addition our app cloud continues to be the platform of choice for innovation by our ISVs.","And a great example of where our industry strategy works hand in glove with our ecosystem strategy, a firm named Accenture we're all familiar with, selected Salesforce as a partner to transform the front office of consumer goods companies around the world. So they will be bringing their Accenture CAS solution on to the Salesforce app exchange, which is a great endorsement of our platform and critical to our join industry strategy.","So in closing I want to say, thank you to all of our customers and thank you to all of our partners for their trust in us and their confidence in us. And I'd also like to thank our incredible employees for their outstanding execution in the quarter and this unrelenting dedication to customer success.","And right now we are firing all cylinders, our investments in the industries, our partner ecosystem, our international regions is all paying off. And we have excellent momentum coming out of Dreamforce. And really Marc, based on what I say in New York this morning, we are very well positioned for a very strong finish to the FY '16, and we're looking forward to a historic close this year.","Marc Benioff","I will tell you, Keith, we couldn't be more proud of you and your sales team, so congratulations. It's so exciting. We really appreciate everything that you're doing. And Keith, I'll tell you, I watched the Sales Cloud Keynote after your keynotes today and Accenture was the speaker with Sarah Varney during the Sales Cloud Keynotes, and what was really interesting, they talked about how not only are they doing this incredible partnership, building products on our platform to sell to their customers, but that they have rolled out 25,000 users internally.","And their speaker today in New York, on the video I watched, talked about what how he learned working with Salesforce is that the key to success is to be bold and go fast and just go do whatever you can and just go as much, much faster than any other platform he had ever worked with. Keith, what are you hearing from Accenture, why are they having such a great success internally and now becoming this incredible reseller partner?","Keith Block","It's interesting. I had dinner before -- last night we had a dinner with 40 of our greatest customers and prospects. And I sat next to the CEO of Accenture, North America. And we had an excellent dialogue about the partnership and the relationship. And Accenture is just a culture that embraces transformation. And so they appreciate the level of transformation.","They know what their customers are looking for. And because of that they want to partner with a company like Salesforce, who understands growth, understands transformation. So it's a very good linkage between the two firms. And that's what we're seeing in interest marketplace and that's why Accenture was happy to establish that a partnership in the consumer packaged good space, that's why Accenture is our number one partner. And that's why they continue to evangelize a great message that we have to our joint customers.","Marc Benioff","Well, it has been impressive to see, Accenture is definitely jumped into cloud computing and the social, mobile and IoTs after than any of the other systems integrators. Even though they're largest, they move the fastest. And now to see them deploy internally and also build these solutions on the platform is still exciting, so congratulations on that, as well, Keith.","And let's go over to Mark Hawkins and hear about the numbers. Mark?","Mark Hawkins","Fantastic. Thank you, Marc. We delivered another great quarter with consistent execution and balanced growth across all of our products and geographies. And our results this quarter set us up for a strong finish in FY '16, as discussed, and another solid year in FY '17.","Third quarter revenue was $1.71 billion, up 24% in dollars and 27% in constant currency. Foreign exchange, continue to impact revenue with a year-over-year headwind of $40 million and a sequential headwind of $6 million. We continue to see strong year-over-year constant currency growth in all of our geographies with the Americas growing 27%, EMEA growing 28%, and Asia-Pac growing 25%","Each of our clouds delivered outstanding year-over-year growth on a dollar basis with Sales Cloud growing 10%, Service Cloud growing 38%, App Cloud and other growing 40%, and Marketing Cloud growing 29%. Dollar attrition for the third quarter excluding Marketing Cloud was approximately 9%.","From a bottomline perspective, we delivered another quarter of improving profitability. In fact, we have now increased our year-over-year non-GAAP operating margin for the sixth consecutive quarters, up 221 basis points over Q3 of last year. Our Q3 non-GAAP EPS was $0.21. Non-GAAP EPS includes approximately $0.01 from our lower than anticipated non-GAAP tax rate, which I'll discuss more in a moment.","Our great topline and bottomline performance in Q3 drove another solid quarter of cash generation with operating cash flow of a $118 million. This was slightly down year-over-year about 4%, while operating cash flow year-to-date was up 37% compared to the same period over last year and that's now up to $1.2 billion year-to-date, which is very exciting. Marc, it took us 15 years to get to a $1 billion in cash flow and we did it in the first two quarters and now we're topping it, so we're really excited about that.","For the full year, we continue to anticipate operating cash flow in the growth of 24% to 25%, consistent with our prior guidance and our revenue growth operating margin framework. Third quarter free cash flow defined as operating cash flow plus CapEx was $38 million, down 23% over the last year. Again, year-to-date free cash flow was $937 million, up 47% over the first nine months of the last year.","Looking at billed deferred revenue, we delivered growth of 28% year-over-year. Excluding an FX headwind of $41 million, deferred revenue grew 30% over last year. On a sequential basis, deferred revenue was impacted by an FX headwind of $7 million.","In the quarter, 79% of the value of all subscription and support related invoices were issued with annual terms compared to 73% in Q3 of last year. This is a bit higher than anticipated and translated into approximately 2 percentage points of deferred revenue growth in the quarter.","Moving on to guidance. With our great performance into the third quarter, we are raising our full year revenue guidance by $25 million. We now anticipate revenue to be $6.64 billion to $6.65 billion for 24% growth year-over-year. The guidance continues to include an FX headwind of approximately $175 million. We are also raising our full year non-GAAP EPS to $0.74 to $0.75 or $0.03 at the high end of the range, which is approximately $0.02, as a result of our outperformance and about $0.01 as a result of our lower full year non-GAAP tax rate.","Now, let me take a minute to discuss our non-GAAP tax rate. We are adjusting our projected full year non-GAAP tax rate to 35.5%, in light of a recent Altera tax opinion. You may recall that we began to compute and use the fixed long-term non-GAAP tax rate during FY '15, and as we said, we would reevaluate this rate annually and\/or as the situation rises where we need to reevaluate that and that is exactly the case as it relates to Altera, and that's just the situation where we needed to true that up. And we'll continue to reevaluate that and give you update as we need to.","For Q4, our full year guidance implies revenue growth of approximately $1.782 billion to $1.792 billion, non-GAAP EPS of $0.18 to $0.19 and billed deferred revenue growth of approximately 23% to 24%. And as you heard from Marc, we are pleased to be initiating fiscal revenue guidance of approximately $8 billion to $8.1 billion for year-over-year growth of 20% to 22%.","In fact, FY '17 feels very similar to last year, as we continue to deliver strong growth at scale. And we will provide additional details about our outlook for FY '17 on our fourth quarter call in February. To close, we had a strong third quarter and we are well-positioned for a great finish to FY '16 and to deliver another solid year in FY '17.","Thanks to all of our employees for continuing to deliver these outstanding results. And with that I'd like to open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse.","Phil Winslow","I have a question on Service Cloud, because obviously the revenue there, which is obviously lagging a bit, continues to grow just phenomenally. No sort of sign of deceleration there. If it continued at this pace, you could almost see within a couple of years, Service Cloud overtaking Sales Cloud.","So the question is what are dynamics that are going on there? How would you compare them to the Sales Cloud, when it was sort of at this point of its lifecycle? And are you displacing more legacy vendors? Is it net new? Is it replacing to give custom developed software? I mean, how should we think about Service Cloud?","Marc Benioff","Well, I think the way to think about Service Cloud is, first and foremost, these are mega markets. Sales, service, marketing, analytics, these are all multibillion dollar markets. We actually called them internally swimmers and we call them swimmers in their lanes. And we look at these products each going down their own lane, and yes, you're right, service is performing incredibly well, but so is sales, so is analytics, so is community, so is our platform, so is marketing, we have many, many high-performing swimmers.","And we don't just look it at that way, by the way. We not only see that, we see it by geography, and we also look at it in verticals. And in each of the strategic areas that we've made this big bets, we continue to see very high performance. And in customer service and support, if you read Gartner's most recent Customer Engagement Magic Quadrant, you'll see Salesforce is number one.","We've displaced Oracle, we've displaced SAP. These were traditionally the leaders in the Gartner Magic Quadrant, and so we're not only now the number one in the Magic Quadrant on sales, which we have been for few years, but now we're number one in the Magic Quadrant for service, which means we actually have the best product possible.","Our customers just have phenomenal success. We have great examples of customers who have tens of thousands of users deployed on this product. We have examples of customers who have tens of users, hundreds of users. But what's unusual our Service Cloud is you could be a very small company or you could be a massive company, and you can use our Service Cloud.","And when you look at requirements for customers to provide extended customer service, especially in regards to areas like the Internet of Things, when our core customers like Cisco or Phillips or even Coca Cola are more connected to their customer than ever before, the first point of access with those customers is customer service, so they better have their customer service act together if they're going to drive the customer revolution. So of course, we continue to do well in all of our core products, but also customer service is a critical part of our portfolio.","Keith, you want to add anything to that.","Keith Block","I think, Marc, you're spot on. I mean, at the end of the day, we are performing well across all of our clouds. And certainly as we talked about service, a lot of companies in a variety of industries differentiate themselves with service. And when you think of this Age of the Customer where there are billions of connected devices and connected things, and you think about what service can do in terms of the business model, leveraging IoT and Analytics it's very, very powerful in terms of disruption and differentiation and changing business models and that is really the level of dialog that we are having with many, many companies and it's very exciting.","Operator","Your next question comes from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley.","Keith Weiss","I wanted to ask a little bit about the platform business, and in two directions. We saw a little bit of acceleration in that business. I think, Marc, you talked a little bit about some of the internal reasons for that. We also see in acceleration in some of the other big platforms out there like Amazon Web Services and Azure, both of them have seen accelerating growth.","So I wanted your view on it. Are we seeing something of a broader industry trend, that's sort of really an acceleration in the move towards those cloud-based platforms, as de facto standard of where we're going to developing applications. So I just wanted your view on that? And two, similarly, do you see Amazon Web Service and Azure increasingly as competitors for their platform business for you guys?","Marc Benioff","Yes, that's a great question, and let me address that. So there is no doubt, we are at a tipping point in cloud platforms. And companies who have been cloud deniers like SAP and Oracle are paying a horrible price in single-digit and negative growth, because companies are not buying their products, because they are not modern. And they are not built-in this kind of modern architecture.","When you look at the cloud opportunity there is different opportunities. And one opportunity is at the applications layer, where we dominate in sales and service and marketing, where we have these multi, multiple billion dollar clouds, all kind of underway, which I've just talked about in the last question.","But the next layer down, which is declarative and programmatic application development and deployment, especially in rapid application development and deployment, this is an area where we also have incredible success. Gartner calls this aPaaS, Application Platform-as-a-Service.","You look at our product like our App Cloud, Salesforce1, Lightning, Heroku, this is an area that's very strategic to us, because our core applications are built with our platform, which gives our customers basically the plasticity necessary to kind of take our applications apart and putting them back together, this is an area that's very important to us.","The next layer down is, kind of what we traditionally call Infrastructure-as-a-Service. Amazon Web Services, which we are a huge customer of Amazon Web Services, Amazon is also a huge customer of Salesforce, and we use the Amazon Web Services to build our products. For example, Heroku is one of the most successful platforms on the Amazon Web Services and has been incredible success for Salesforce.com and also demonstrates the power of Amazon's platform.","Salesforce also has been working with Microsoft on how we're going to be using Azure as part of our product line as well. We're very excited about Microsoft. We also have a great relationship with Microsoft. We've talked about that, and I think Azure is terrific. And Google, by the way, is a huge customer of Salesforce. We use Google's platform very extensively at Salesforce as well. And I'll tell you something that it's critical for the operations of our company, and the Amazon, Microsoft and Google's cloud platforms.","We're a very modern company and how we've deployed IT internally, that's given us the flexibility to grow. We tutor and mentor other CIOs and industry leaders and show them what we've done to build a modern company using this highly flexible IT infrastructure, but it's because we're doing all three of these layers.","One, very flexible dynamic, highly innovative, three releases a year, applications at the top; in the middle, rapid application development and deployment of apps, like I was talking about new apps appearing on my phone instantly from my IT department in that APAS area; and also an Infrastructure-as-a-Service, where we partner with Amazon, we partner with Microsoft and we partner with Google, those are three core strategic partners in Infrastructure-as-a-Service, and that's the modern IT infrastructure.","And of course, what do we all run it on, we don't run it on our laptops, but we run it on our phones. And that's the power of the modern age. And this gives you the level of speed in IT. It gives you much lower total cost of ownership. And it gives you a rate of innovation, because you're not waiting three or four years for a new release, you're waiting three or four months, sometimes three or four days before you're getting incredible new features and functionality.","And so yes, we are at a tipping point. You could see that in the results of Amazon. You can see it in the results of Microsoft. You can see it in the results of Google. And you can see it in the results of Salesforce. And for companies who have denied that this shift is happening, for companies who have fooled customers to be afraid of this shift, and for companies who have tried to stop this shift, look at where they are today. It's quite a good example of Clayton Christensen theories regarding The Innovator's Dilemma.","Operator","And your next question comes from Brent Thill with UBS.","Brent Thill","Question for Keith. On the industry strategy, you mentioned that's providing a very nice tailwind for you in the field. You mentioned the retail case. I'm curious, if you could talk about some of the other verticals that you're starting to see open up given the all the hard work that you've been laying in many of the other vertical segments?","Keith Block","Yes, no problem, I'm happy to fill that question. Look, across the board, I mean if you look at the wins in the quarter, we had some terrific experiences with financial services, obviously with American Express and automotive with General Motors and consumer package goods with AB InBev and Mattel.","So financial services is very strong, healthcare and life sciences is very strong, retail is really picking up, CPG is really picking up, manufacturing has always been a strength for the company, but we continue to do very, very well. I alluded to that deal that we closed earlier. So it really has become a situation where in no surprise customers want to speak to us and we should be speaking to them in their language.","And that is the whole idea behind the industry strategy, and it starts with that. It starts with the messaging and the creation of the solution. It also moved into making sure they're organized carefully and we've done that very carefully over the last 2.5 years in physical organizations that focus on vertical markets.","And then the third is to start delivering product, which we announced, again, just before Dreamforce around Health Cloud and Financial Services Cloud. So it's really a three pronged industry strategy that is resonating with our customers. They want more of it. They certainly don't want less of it.","And we already had a very compelling and differentiated solution, but when you also add this sort of layer on it with the industry messaging and going to market by industry and also adding to this product set, it becomes super compelling and customers really, really like what we're doing.","Operator","Your next question comes from Kash Rangan with Merrill Lynch.","Kash Rangan","Marc, one question for you. When you look at the company from a $1 billion to $5 billion, Service Cloud really led that engine of growth. As you look to expand the business for up about 50% to a $10 billion revenue company, what are the lead engines here? Obviously, service and sales as big as they are, they cannot get you to grow as rapidly.","So are we going to see other engines come to the forefront in order to help you to increase your business by 50%, be it analytics or platform or verticals? And one for you, Mark Hawkins, as the renewal business becomes larger and larger, what kind of impact does it have on your margins?","Marc Benioff","Well, I think this is a great question, Kash, and is something that Keith and Mark and I are talking about with Alex Dayon as well almost every single day, because we're working on our fiscal year '17 budgets. And when you look at the great success of a lot of these core products, we want to continue to fuel them.","Certainly, Service Cloud is amazing. Marketing Cloud, obviously, is also amazing, and Sales Cloud, of course, has achieved a level of revenue that we never could have anticipated and continues to grow. And we have other, as I said, kind of swimmers in their lanes doing very, very well.","Now, in addition of those core products, especially with the tip of the Marketing Cloud and its outstanding performance, especially since we acquired ExactTarget and integrated that very deeply into the company, I think also you have to look at what Keith has done with public sector, which is very exciting for us and is a huge opportunity for our company.","And of course, the verticals where we're continuing to build some new products, including our wealth management product that we've announced and our health product and other applications categories that we see, and that I will also have to say ISVs. So ISVs remains a really powerful growth channel as well.","So if we have any problem with Salesforce, it's that we have a huge amount to invest next year, but we can't just peanut butter and give everybody something. We have to make some bet and to invest in some these winners that I'm talking about, because we have had some phenomenal results as well.","Mark Hawkins","So one of the things that I just want to jump in on, Marc, on that point is, the second aspect of the question, which is around renewals and what we saw there from margins, Kash, I'm happy to address that. The first thing we always think about obviously is customer success.","And we want to make sure that happens and that really promotes renewals. And we'd love the attrition rate, Kash, it's been happening. You track the company for a long, long time, and you watched that come down now into the approximately 9% range and that really helps us.","And so as we think about margins going forward, as it relates to renewals, one of the things I just would almost level it up and say, all of our unit economics suggest that we can hit the mid-30s in terms of our operating margin over the long-term at mature revenue growth rates. And part of that is because we're taking good care of the customer, part of that is because we keep the attrition rate low and part of that is we continue to get scale with unit economics that we can see today.","So Kash, I think the long and the short of it is, as that renewal business continues to grow, our number one priority is to take care of the customer and number two is we will fulfill the operating margin in the mid-30s, long, long-term.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan.","Mark Murphy","My question is for Marc Benioff, Aneel Bhusri recently said that if the first 10 years is about cloud, the next 10 years is going to be about data and analytics. And he commented that there won't be any difference between the transaction systems and the analytical systems. So I was just wondering first off, Marc, what do you think of that statement and how far do you want to push the boundaries of data science at Salesforce?","In other words, do you think you would have more of a focus on analytics to support sales service and marketing or are you thinking very broadly pushing into machine learning, predictive behavioral unstructured data, massive data volumes for Internet of Things, and really becoming a hub for essentially any kind of data?","Marc Benioff","Well, here is how I look at it, which is, Aneel is a very close friend of mine and I just got a text from him, while we're on the call here. And I look at it differently and I'll tell you why. I think the next 10 years is the age of the customer. I don't think it's the age of data science or the age of machine intelligence or the age of cognitive or the age of mobility or the age of social or the age of cloud or whatever, okay, because all of those things are going to be important in the next 10 years.","All of those things, the cloud, social, mobile, data science, deep learning, MLP, machine intelligence, those are table stakes. Those are table stakes. What you're going to do with that technology? Who is not using those technologies? Phillips is using that technology. GE is using that technology. Apple is using that technology. Cisco is using that technology. Coca Cola, Unilever, they're all using.","Look, if the next 10 years for these companies is going to be about customer, what are they doing to build a world-class customer experience? How do they transform from being product companies to customer experience companies? And as millennials takeover in these enterprises, they're going to be much more focused on experiences and that is going to be the transformational lever for growth with these companies.","And I think that if we get to into any one particular technology, or if I was to all of a sudden wave the flag like I used to do 15 or 16 years ago for cloud, okay, that would be a huge misstate for a company, because the number one thing, most important thing to this company is the customer.","So there was a really good discussion between Ginni Rometty, who is the CEO of IBM and John Stumpf, who is the CEO of Well Fargo Bank at a conference that I was just at put on by Fortune Magazine here in San Francisco, and I'm sure that the transcript is available online, but you will see that when she is discussing her strategy is to become the cognitive company. And when he is discussing his strategy it's to become the customer company.","And I think that we too have to decide what kind of companies are we going to be? I'm going with customer-company. I want to be a customer company like John Stumpf does. He is all about the customer, maintaining the integrity and the fidelity of the customer relationship.","I want to help him do that, and yes, will cognitive help him to do that? Yes. Will cloud help him to do that? Yes, it's doing it. Is mobile, yes; social, yes; IoT, yes; all of these things. But let's keep our eye on the ball, which there is a transformational force that is wafting its way through all of these companies and every company is afraid that they're going to be uberized out of the world. And they see it happening. And it could be financial services. It could be IBM, okay.","Every company is worried about -- look at the decline of IBM over the last decade. Technology is shaking every company at its roots. So that's why the companies who will be the most successful are the ones who are most connected to the customers, because the customers are the ones who guide us into the future. They are the ones with the true vision of where we have to go. So I'm going with customer on this one.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank.","Karl Keirstead","First off, Marc, I love the interview format with you and Keith. Please do that again, it makes the call pretty entertaining. I've got two questions for Mark Hawkins. Mark, at Dreamforce in the Analyst Day, you talked a little bit about the renewal activity skewing a little bit more fourth quarter. And I wanted to just check to make sure you're as confidant that that will happen, as you were a few months ago.","And then secondly, you talked about the mix of annual invoicing hitting 79%, that to me as well felt a little high and I thought maybe you could explain why it did? And if that rate of increase is likely to continue?","Mark Hawkins","Happy to do both there, Karl, and again good to talk to you. Let's just talk about the second question first, and then we'll go back to the renewals. I'll say the first thing is that we are pleased, we have been on a path to just increase our invoices to annual from FY '12, so we've been on a steady path with continuous improvement. And we report out when we next progress, and last quarter we continued to make progress.","As you noted, Karl, year-on-year, we went from 74% of our invoices being annual to 79%, and so that is just good progress, good execution. We're pleased to see it. It works well for lots of and lots of different reasons. And that added, as I called out, about roughly 2 points of growth to deferred revenue year-on-year.","But I think we have continued runway on this in the sense that the more enterprise business we get, the more natural it is for people to go to the annual terms that we're looking for. So I wouldn't expect any sharp turns, Karl. I think about this is a steady progression with, yes, more runway in the future. Key thing about it is moderate and that's what we're intending and I think it's just good execution. That's number one.","Number two, in terms of renewals, and one of the things for everybody on the call just as a reminder, we just talked about the quantum of our renewals. If you think about when they show up, and Q4 is when they show up the most, when you think about kind of the historical patterns of our business, and in fact, that is what we expect.","And that's all comprehended in our guidance, which we feel really good about both for Q4, the strong finish, and also as we point into next year. Obviously, hitting something worth $8 billion to $8.1 billion on topline revenue, we feel really good about for the company to continue to grow and execute at the scale. So those are my answers on both points, Karl.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time.","End of Q&A","John Cummings","Great. Thank you so much, Ashley, and thanks so much everyone for joining us. Sorry, we couldn't get to all your questions. If you have any follow-up for us, you can reach out to us investor@salesforce.com. And if you miss the world tour in New York today, you'll have multiple other opportunities. We'll be in Tokyo and Los Angeles in December, in Minneapolis, Atlanta, Houston and Dallas and Seattle. And so if you'd like to hear some of these great transformational stories of how Salesforce is changing customer experiences, you can tune into that. Otherwise, we look forward to giving you an update on our progress in Q4 in February.","Operator","This does conclude today's conference call.

Look, very, very excited to give you this quarter\u2019s highlights and results and thrilled to be on the call with you, and let\u2019s just start out with top highlights for the quarter.","First of all, the San Francisco Giants have won the World Series. Congratulations. Now, in other news, it\u2019s great to be with you today to talk about our strong quarterly financial results, our incredible Dreamforce last month, our contribution to our community, and the significant advancements in enterprise technology that Salesforce is leading. ","And that\u2019s what Salesforce and our commitment to customer success is absolutely all about. Cloud computing is taking over our industry. You can see that at Dreamforce. In the four pillars of cloud computing, the cloud, the social world, the mobile, acceleration and data science are guiding us to transform our customer relationships.","Look, we saw that take form at Dreamforce. We see this where every company is going to be transformed over the next decade with these amazing changes. Salesforce is leading the way, and we look forward to our first $6 billion year next year. We\u2019ve never been more confident or excited to give guidance. It\u2019s completely amazing to me. ","Here it is: Salesforce, the number one cloud computing company in the world, Salesforce the number one CRM company in the world, giving guidance of $6.5 billion in revenue next year as a top five enterprise software company. It\u2019s a huge threshold moment for cloud computing.","Now, before I begin, and I\u2019d like to thank so many of you who joined us at Dreamforce in San Francisco, with over 150,000 registered to attend and over 7 million joined us online to hear our vision for the future of the industry. And I know many of you were as inspired as I was by the attendees and the amazing response to what we have all created.","And at Dreamforce, we\u2019ve held more than 1,450 sessions on how our customers are using these new worlds of cloud, of social, mobile, and data science to transform their enterprises. All of our attendees experienced an incredible Dreamforce trade show with more than 400 partners presenting the next generation of cloud computing, and it was our highest rated Dreamforce ever.","We also had a great experience and we led our commitment to giving back at Dreamforce by running San Francisco\u2019s largest food drive, which raised 3 million meals, stuffed learning materials into backpacks for new mothers, alongside Hillary Clinton. Flew with our veterans on Chinook helicopters to Moffett Field to launch our new VetForce program, and we heard about important advancements in protecting our environment from Al Gore.","At Dreamforce, we introduced important new innovations including the advancement of our core customer success platform and we also introduced our newest cloud, the fastest-growing cloud we\u2019ve ever seen, the Wave analytics cloud, the first analytics product that makes data-driven insights accessible to everyone and on any device. ","And we introduced the new Salesforce1 Lightning platform, which has now been released to developers, the fastest way for every company to build and deploy multiple apps, and you could just see the response from developers quite evident last week on Twitter, how they are receiving this major advancement in our development environments.","We heard from amazing companies like Coca-Cola, Honeywell, General Electric, incredible nonprofits like Donors Choose, the Girl Scouts, and so many others who are using cloud computing and the Salesforce customer success platform to innovate and transform their business.","Coca-Cola Germany\u2019s CEO, Ulrik Nehammer, talked about Dreamforce, and just talked about it again today in New York City at our show, how the most dangerous place to make a decision is in the office, and how he runs his business from his phone with mobile apps built on Salesforce1 Lightning platform, and how it has transformed and accelerated the growth of Coca-Cola Germany.","And I just now have heard that once again with him today. He offers a great description of our vision at Salesforce, how his team is making smarter decisions at exactly the moment and place that it matters. Now, let\u2019s get to the financial results for the quarter.","Revenue in the third quarter rose to nearly $1.4 billion, up 30% in constant currency from a year ago. No other top 10 software company is growing faster, and we\u2019re delivering the growth while pushing through the $5 billion revenue milestone this year. ","Deferred revenue grew by 31% in constant currency from a year ago to more than $2.2 billion, and the dollar value of booked business on and off the balance sheet is now more than $7.6 billion. That is amazing. $7.6 billion and on and off the balance sheet.","Now, as we deliver on this outstanding pace of top line growth, we also remain committed to delivering 125 to 150 basis points of non-GAAP operating margin improvement this fiscal year. You can see that in our numbers and we are committed to making this better next year.","In an exceptionally tough foreign exchange environment that has decelerated this quarter, we are pleased to be initiating fiscal year 2016 revenue guidance, and this is revenue guidance that we\u2019re saying where we\u2019re going to be 15 months from now, at the end of January 2016, of $6.5 billion at the high end of our range, and we are the first enterprise cloud company to be able to say $6.5 billion. ","I\u2019m seeing that every enterprise of every size is committing itself to cloud computing. Today, more than ever, connecting with customers is an imperative, because everyone and everything is becoming digital and connected. And a company\u2019s relationship with those digitally connected customers is the new bottom line, exactly as Ulrik said.","The customer success platform provides what every company needs to connect with customers in a whole new way, and during the quarter, we announced a number of very important innovations. Our new Wave analytics cloud is an incredible achievement by our technology and products organization. I\u2019ve never seen a product as Salesforce, I think in my career actually, get off to a faster start. There\u2019s never been this kind of customer traction and excitement around a new product before.","It\u2019s analytics for the rest of us. Major customers like EMC, Verizon, General Electric all signed up in the quarter, and since launching the analytics cloud just a month ago, more than 45 partners have joined our analytics cloud ecosystem and the pipeline is just awesome. We\u2019ve never seen faster traction for a new product or a new cloud. I\u2019m just confident this is going to be our fastest and most exciting new cloud ever.","And the new Salesforce1 Lightning takes the Salesforce1 platform to a whole new level. There\u2019s no better way to create mobile apps, with drag and drop, interactive process builders that turn businesses users into citizen programmers. And there was a great article about that posted by our developer community last week on Twitter that I retweeted, and our customers are doing better marketing around our platform than even we are doing, because this is such an exciting moment for our developer community around this next generation Lightning platform. ","Salesforce remains the largest enterprise cloud ecosystem in the world. No one else in the industry is providing a software platform that makes it as easy for any company to develop and deploy next-generation apps as well as breakthrough apps for sales, for service, marketing, community analytics. ","Each one of these is a major product line in cloud now for us. Our Sales Cloud, our Service Cloud, our Marketing Cloud, our Community Cloud, our analytics cloud, our platform for building apps, each one of these is a major product line that we have entered the market with and have taken a significant position in the industry.","Our Sales Cloud continues to lead in its category on its way to becoming the first $3 billion app cloud at Salesforce. The service cloud is on a tear with its new SOS functionality. Every company wants to have a mayday button just like Amazon has, and now with the service cloud, they can have one connected all back to their call centers and contact centers.","And with the click of a button, a customer can connect to an agent via video in real time for personal assistance within any mobile app. And I\u2019m thrill that the community cloud and it\u2019s all new public communities, everybody knows how committed we are to social. We\u2019ve pioneered it with employees, we\u2019ve pioneered it with partners, we\u2019ve pioneered it in vendor communities, and now we\u2019re pioneering it again with public communities. All people integrated into all our other clouds.","And you can see that at community.homedepot.com as a great example of this new public community cloud capability. And finally, the marketing cloud introduced a major advancement this quarter with the Journey Builder for apps capability kind of showing the next-generation vision of what the marketing cloud can become.","Look, nothing speaks more to the value of the Salesforce platform, and to our customers, than the actual tool usage of the platform, which we make public each and every day. Salesforce delivered more than 159 billion transactions in the quarter, which was up 64% from a year ago. 64% growth in the use of our platform. That\u2019s nearly 2.5 billion transactions every business day. No other enterprise cloud platform comes close, with the dominant transactions coming from our application program interfaces.","Look, I am absolutely thrilled with the quarter, and congratulations, Keith, on a strong quarter, and now I\u2019d like to turn it over to you. ","Keith Block","Thanks, Marc, and good afternoon everybody. Great to be here, and thanks to everybody for joining the call. So as Marc mentioned, I\u2019m here in New York today to kick off the Salesforce World Tour, and with more than 10,000 people registered to attend, and a million people watching online, which is great, you can absolutely feel the incredible energy and momentum, and all of that driving our customer success and our growth.","Now, I was with some of our top customers last night, including Coca-Cola and Stanley Black & Decker, and GE Capital, and many others, and all of these customers are talking about our customer success platform and driving a more meaningful relationship with us here at Salesforce.","And in fact, Marc alluded to this earlier, but GE Capital is using our analytics cloud, which just launched a few short weeks ago, which is pretty incredible, and they\u2019ve already shortened the cycle time from learning to action, from months to minutes and seconds, and it truly is decision making at the speed of thought. ","And it\u2019s pretty clear that analytics is going to be a game-changer, and based on what I\u2019m seeing from customers, what I saw today in my conversations and today at the conference, I agree with Marc, that analytics will be the most successful product launch in the company history. There\u2019s no question about it.","And with our customer success platform, which brings together sales and service and marketing, communities, platforms, and of course analytics, customers are transforming their business models and they\u2019re looking at Salesforce in entirely new ways.","So here in New York this week, and at Dreamforce last month, certainly when I speak with customers on a daily basis, it\u2019s pretty clear, just like last evening, they want more strategic and meaningful relationships with us. And this was certainly evidenced by the number of large deals that we closed in Q3. In fact, we signed more 7- and 8-figure deals this quarter than in any Q3 in the history of the company.","And what\u2019s even more exciting is that we doubled the number of 8-figure deals in the quarter from a year ago, and I am very, very proud of the entire team for this accomplishment. We\u2019ve added significant relationships with companies like AB InBev, Archer Daniels Midland, and Johnson & Johnson, and that\u2019s just the beginning. And we absolutely strengthened existing ones with customers like EMC and HP and Verizon. And I\u2019ll share a couple of those stories with you right now.","So Verizon, longstanding customer, continues to do business with us, continues to enhance our relationship. It was a great story for the quarter. They selected our service cloud for their entire enterprise team so that they could service customers across all their products from a single platform, the customer success platform.","And interestingly enough, after seeing our analytics product in action at Dreamforce, again just a few weeks ago, Verizon signed up for the analytics cloud to put the power of real time data and insights right into the hands of their reps. It\u2019s a great story.","Another story for the international side of the house is AB InBev, the leading global brewer, and they selected the Salesforce1 platform and service cloud to power their customer success platform in several of their key markets. So now, Salesforce can give AB InBev the ability to sell, service, and market to customers from a single platform. Nobody else can do that.","And leveraging Salesforce1, they\u2019re able to integrate all their legacy systems and develop social and mobile apps on the fly. So again, I want to congratulate the team in Europe for building this outstanding and great brand relationship.","So we also saw strong momentum in the public sector this quarter. As you know, this is an industry that we\u2019re focusing on and it included a significant win with the U.S. Department of Commerce. ","They selected Salesforce for our ability to deliver a mobile-first customer success platform, and that will connect all of their legacy systems again as a common theme, driving from systems of record into systems of engagement. And with our service cloud and community cloud, they plan to put iPads and iPhones into the hands of their employees so that they can better serve American businesses. ","And we also expanded relationships in other areas of government this quarter, including the State of Ohio and the U.S. Department of Agriculture. They\u2019re turning to Salesforce to transform the government experience for citizens, for partners, and for employees.","Our momentum in financial services continues as well. Barclays, a global top 10 bank and obviously a terrific brand, selected Sales Cloud and Salesforce communities in the quarter to connect 15,000 brokers and put them in touch with Barclays experts right from their mobile devices.","Barclays joined a growing list of financial services organizations around the world, including State Street, SunLife, Zurich Insurance, and many others, all of whom are turning to Salesforce as their platform for innovation and growth.","We also signed new or expanded relationships in the quarter with Isuzu, L\u2019Oreal, Merck, NBC Universal, Office Depot - which by the way was a significant marketing cloud win in the quarter - Symantec, Time Warner, Toyota.","And also in Asia-Pac, we signed a significant deal with a large Japanese manufacturer where we replaced Microsoft with Sales Cloud after rolling out a pilot in a matter of just a few weeks. Pretty impressive. And that really speaks to the speed at which our customers want to transform their businesses versus months or years it takes on legacy platforms. So pretty compelling story. ","So just getting started on our international growth opportunity. We\u2019ve been aggressively investing in our international markets by increasing distribution capacity, as you know, and expanding our partner ecosystem into the largest partner ecosystem in technology and building new data centers. In fact, we just opened our first European data center in the U.K. a few weeks ago, and we plan to open two more in Europe in the next year. ","So industries is another growth opportunity, whether it\u2019s communications, financial services, healthcare, manufacturing, retail, or the public sector. Our customers are looking to us for deep industry expertise and a solution that allows them to transform their business models, leveraging our customer success platform.","Our ecosystem, I mentioned that a second ago. Partners are integral to our strategy, and certainly another growth opportunity. The world\u2019s largest and most strategic SIs continue to expand their Salesforce practices, and we recently revamped our ISV model to better focus on vertical markets, and that\u2019s starting to really pay off in bigger and more strategic ways.","So it\u2019s an exciting time for us here at Salesforce as we close our first $5 billion year. I echo Marc\u2019s comments. It\u2019s absolutely amazing. And build the pillars for our next decade of growth. And I want to thank our customers and our partners for their continued commitment, and last but not least, I want to congratulate the team on the quarter for continuing to drive our customer success.","So with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Mark. ","Mark Hawkins","Well, thank you, Keith. I\u2019m very pleased to be with all of you today to discuss the third quarter. Despite a challenging FX environment, we delivered another strong quarter of results. We exceeded our Q3 revenue guidance by $14 million. We exceeded our non-GAAP EPS guidance by $0.01. Deferred revenue was up 28% year over year in dollars and 31% in constant currency, compared to our guidance of 30%. And our non-GAAP operating margin was up 244 basis points year over year. ","The third quarter revenue was $1.38 billion, up 29% over last year. Excluding a year over year FX headwind of approximately $12 million, revenue was up 30%. On a sequential quarterly basis, we had an even larger FX headwind of $15 million.","Non-GAAP EPS for the quarter was $0.14. On a year over year regional basis, revenue grew in the Americas by 29%. In EMEA, it grew 30% in dollars and 34% in constant currency, and Asia Pacific grew 21% in dollars and 25% in constant currency.","Looking at the third quarter revenues by cloud, Sales Cloud was $625 million. Service Cloud was $340 million. Salesforce1 platform and other was $192 million, and Marketing Cloud was $132 million. Dollar attrition for the third quarter, excluding ExactTarget, remained between 9% and 10%.","Now, turning to margins, our third quarter non-GAAP gross margin was 78.4%, down approximately 90 basis points from last year, which reflects the continued investment in our infrastructure, including international data center expansion.","This continued investment is important for us to maintain the high level of trust and service delivery we are known for. We may see a slight impact on the gross margins next year as we ramp up the data center investment in Germany and France. However, we\u2019re still very confident that we\u2019ll be able to improve operating margins in FY16 by gaining efficiencies in other areas.","Our Q3 non-GAAP operating margin was 11%, up 244 basis points from Q3 last year, even as we held our biggest and very best Dreamforce ever, which had, by the way, about a $0.02 impact on non-GAAP EPS.","For the nine months year to date, we are up 90 basis points, and with our Q4 guidance, we\u2019re on track to deliver 125 to 150 basis points improvement for fiscal 2015.","From a headcount perspective, we ended the quarter with approximately 15,500 employees, up 21% over Q3 of last year.","Now turning to cash flow, we delivered cash flow of $123 million, down 11% from last year. Now, this was primarily impacted by the timing of Dreamforce, which occurred in Q3 this year as opposed to Q4 last year. However, year to date, cash flow is up 39% year over year, so despite the modest decline in the third quarter cash flow year over year, we now anticipate a full year operating cash flow growth of 27% to 28%.","Capex was approximately $73 million in the third quarter, up slightly over last year. Capex as a percent of revenue was approximately [5%], and that was down from 7% in Q3 of last year. For the full year, we continue to expect capex and the percent of revenue to be around the 5% to 7% range.","Free cash flow, which we define as operating cash flow less capex, was $49 million. ","Now, moving back to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with approximately $1.8 billion in cash and marketable securities. Deferred revenue ended the quarter at $2.22 billion, up 28% over last year. Excluding a year over year FX headwind of $33 million, deferred revenue grew 31%. FX also reduced deferred revenue sequentially by approximately $30 million.","During the quarter, 73% of the value of all subscription support related invoices were issued with annual terms compared with approximately 69% in Q3 of last year. ","Unbilled deferred revenue, our revenue that is contracted but not yet invoiced, and is off the balance sheet, ended the quarter at approximately $5.4 billion, up $1.2 billion over last year, for an increase of 29%. ","Turning to guidance, based on our results for the quarter, clearly FX has had a significant impact on our financial performance. As I mentioned, we saw a $15 million sequential headwind to revenue in the quarter, and we expect an additional similar sequential impact to revenue in Q4 as well. ","In that context, we are maintaining the high end of our full fiscal year 2015 revenue guidance range and expect revenue to be $5.365 billion to $5.370 billion for a year over year growth of 32%. This full year guidance implies Q4 revenues in the range of $1.436 billion to $1.441 billion, representing year over year growth of 25% to 26%.","We expect our full year non-GAAP EPS to be in the $0.51 to $0.52 range. This implies Q4 non-GAAP EPS of $0.13 to $0.14. We anticipate fourth quarter deferred revenue growth of approximately 27% year over year in reported dollars, and today, we are pleased to be initiating fiscal 2016 revenue guidance at approximately $6.45 billion to $6.50 billion for year over year growth of 20% to 21%, which reflects an expected FX headwind of approximately $125 million to $150 million.","Now, keep in mind we are 15 months away from the end of fiscal 2016, and this is our initial guidance without knowing our Q4 results. Q4 is our biggest quarter, and it provides the most new business and renewals in any quarter. Add this to the compounding nature of the business model, and Q4 becomes especially important to revenue forecasting. We\u2019ll have an update to our FY16 guidance for you when we report on our fourth quarter results in February.","So to close, despite significant FX headwinds, we delivered strong third quarter results. The third quarter sets us up for a strong finish in FY15, and we are on track to deliver all of our key financial goals we set out at the beginning of the year: revenue growth, improving our full year non-GAAP operating margins by 125 to 150 basis points, and strong operating cash flow.","I\u2019d like to thank all of our employees for their dedication in delivering these great results. I\u2019m very excited about how we are positioned for FY16. Now, with that, I\u2019d like to open the call for questions. Operator? ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions.] Our first question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Merrill Lynch.","Kash Rangan","It looks like you did billings growth on a constant currency basis of 29%, which I recollect, Marc, was exactly the same percentage you grew three years back. You\u2019re a much larger company, so the law of large numbers doesn\u2019t seem to apply to you guys.","As it relates to the analytics cloud, Marc, I\u2019m wondering if you could give us some sense of how you expect user adoption to take place. What segments in the global markets do you see this as having a near term impact. And as you look at your fiscal 2016 guidance, typically you guys have been conservative, sort of, which is very much appreciated. ","Are you assuming the full thrust of the analytics cloud in your next year numbers, or do you want to just take it one step at a time, see how it goes for the next couple of quarters, and see what you do about fiscal 2016 as it relates to analytics before you guide the street on the analytics product? ","Marc Benioff","I just want to say, at a high level, what I said in the script is the most important thing regarding the analytics cloud, which is that we have never seen faster uptake and faster traction when it comes to new product. And that gives us a level of incredible excitement. I\u2019m sure if you downloaded the product or seen reviews on the app stores that you realize we had a huge breakthrough in our ability to enter a major new segment. ","For those of you who look at the TAMs of these different markets, and understand how we actually enter a market, what we do is we look at, number one, what is the size of the market that we\u2019re entering into? When we look at sales, it\u2019s obviously a multibillion dollar market service platform, especially marketing is becoming that way. But analytics is already that way. Analytics, business intelligence, is one of the biggest, most exciting markets in the whole industry.","This is not a CRM story. This is analytics for the rest of us, period. And we have the best analytics and business intelligence product on the planet, and we are going to market in a huge way, and I\u2019d just like to ask Keith now to talk about the changes that he\u2019s making to his organization to focus on this opportunity, some of the advancements he\u2019s seen in the pipeline regarding analytics. It\u2019s a super-exciting moment, and Keith can also talk to you about some of the deals he\u2019s already closed in the third quarter.","Keith Block","Thanks, Marc. So let me just give some color commentary on this. So obviously as I said in the opening comments, this is a product that has been around for just a few short weeks. And already we\u2019re starting to see, with some pretty large companies, interest in the product. We\u2019ve already signed some customers. ","So we\u2019re very, very excited about the momentum, and as far as readiness for the organization, we\u2019ve had our entire sales organization go through what we call a black belt process for training, so that they\u2019re completely enabled and ready to engage with our customers around analytics. ","We also have a specialized organization that focuses every day. They wake up every day and all they think about is how to deploy analytics with our customers to make them successful. And we\u2019re seeing some interesting characteristics, and I\u2019ll talk about opportunities. We don\u2019t like to talk about pipeline, but we\u2019re actually starting to see customers who are not Salesforce customers, who are interested in analytics, because they see how robust it is.","So we\u2019re very, very excited about the opportunity. It is an early release product, but we believe that there\u2019s a lot of momentum and we\u2019re off to a very strong start here. So we feel very good about it.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley.","Keith Weiss","Maybe one for Mark Hawkins. Did a really nice job on operating margins this quarter, up 244 basis points. It seems like you\u2019re being a little bit more conservative going into Q4, where we typically see a little bit more flow through on operating margins. Maybe you can give us a little bit of color on sort of the investment profile going into Q4, why you see less of an operating margin gain in that Q4, and some insight on how you\u2019re initially thinking about FY16?","Marc Benioff ","First of all, we are pleased, absolutely, when we look at the operating margin progress just really year to date, and I think Q4 was a really nice step up here. You can see some efficiencies in G&A, and we had talked about, you know, I expect and will be planning and driving toward having G&A [indiscernible] 10% over time. We saw some nice efficiencies in other parts of the company.","Don\u2019t forget, when you go into Q4, as you get to the end of the year, you start to get to things like commissions and things of that nature that obviously have a bearing from that standpoint. We feel great about our recommitment to the 125 to 150 basis points for the year, and obviously we\u2019re always driving to achieve and better. But that\u2019s where we\u2019re at on that.","And then if there\u2019s anything else, I\u2019m happy to follow up on that. I guess also, as you look at FY16 in terms of margins, I think the thing to think about there is this is a period, as Marc teed up, we\u2019re 15 months away from the end of FY16. We\u2019re initiating guidance on the revenue side. We\u2019ll be talking about margins in Q4, at the Q4 earnings call in February, so we\u2019ll get into that for next year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with UBS.","Brent Thill"," ","I had a question regarding the analytics cloud. Do you see that in terms of adoption mainly coming initially from your existing customer base, or a lot of projects from the partner community? And also, in terms of between the midmarket and enterprise, how do you see that going forward?","Marc Benioff","It\u2019s a great question, and it\u2019s something that\u2019s on all of our minds, because the demand that we have is universal, and what you saw at Dreamforce is that whether it was small companies, or medium, or large, they were all extremely interested. Obviously, GE is the launch customer. We just showed them, speaking today. ","If you didn\u2019t see the New York World Tour show, John Sabino, who is a marquee executive at General Electric, who\u2019s [indiscernible] through many different GE units, spoke today on the significance of this product as it relates to General Electric. I think that that sums it up very well for enterprise. ","I haven\u2019t found a customer who doesn\u2019t want to have a significant interest in the product, and that also includes our nonprofit customers. That has surprised me. So for us it\u2019s the staging of which ones we\u2019re going to get on, and how fast we can do it. We have aggressive goals for the product for next year.","And I would also add, and I think this gets to the other part of your question, this is not an app. This is a platform. This is a product that others will build on. Yes, it\u2019s a great end user capability. You can get to that on your mobile device. ","And Alex Dayon and his team have done an unbelievable job. I\u2019ve been personally involved in the development process, meeting with the analytics cloud team every two weeks for the last six to 12 months. And I can just tell you, it\u2019s our absolute highest-performing team, what they\u2019ve accomplished, I have not seen, in my career. So huge congratulations out to Alex.","But there\u2019s been three key design goals. One was the final user interface that you saw, which is obviously super sexy. The second one is that it\u2019s not just for analysts, which are kind of the traditional targets for the products, but for everyone in the organization. ","So you can just ask any Salesforce executive to show you how they\u2019re already starting to use the analytics cloud, because all of our executives are getting teed up on using it. And that\u2019s one of Keith\u2019s goals, is to have every one of his executives using the analytics cloud and be able to demonstrate how they\u2019re using it to run their business. ","And three is, you saw that we have a huge number of partners already, not just the ETL vendors and integration vendors, not just the systems integrators, but also application developers. You know, when we first showed the product, to give you a little inside baseball here, to Gartner, they said to us, well, this is really a great product, and I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve seen now the first draft note. They said this is a really great product, but what we thought you were going to roll out is an analytics app for SFA, for Salesforce Automation. Why are you not delivering the analytics app for SFA?","And we said no, no, no, that\u2019s not our vision. Our vision is we want to be the platform for analytics for all companies. And we don\u2019t want to roll first with an analytics app. I hope that partners out there are building that app on our platform, but this is what\u2019s existing, is that we\u2019re going to have a huge ecosystem around this product, and that\u2019s what\u2019s going to drive it. ","It\u2019s a huge part of our philosophy and our business. We don\u2019t make an SFA app, we make an SFA platform. We don\u2019t make a service app, we make a service platform. We don\u2019t make a community app, we make a community platform. It\u2019s all built on our Salesforce1 platform. If you\u2019ve ever been with a Salesforce employee, just have them show you on their iPhone or their Android device, on their iPad or whatever they\u2019re using, how we run our business on our phones.","And that\u2019s our vision for this analytics app platform as well. It\u2019s really deeply integrated into our Salesforce1 platform, but it itself is also its own platform. I know that\u2019s a little bit of a confusing statement. ","So look, I\u2019m super excited, and I\u2019m sure that\u2019s getting conveyed to you, and it\u2019s going to be a huge focus. We call fiscal year\u201916 at Salesforce the year of analytics. Everybody knows about our V2MOM process. At the head of our V2MOM for fiscal year 2016, it\u2019s the year of analytics. And we\u2019re going to be super excited about [indiscernible] for fiscal year 2017. It will also be a year of analytics, because it\u2019s not just a one-year initiative.","This is going to be a super exciting moment. Keith, do you want to add to that?","Keith Block","Yeah, listen, I will tell you again, there\u2019s just tremendous momentum. Marc mentioned the ecosystem. We signed up nearly 50 partners in just a few short weeks, who have some pure interest. And they see the value that analytics cloud can provide their customers. ","While Marc was talking about platform, just a thought. I mentioned that we are seeing some opportunities, companies that are interested, in analytics cloud that are not Salesforce customers. So it would be natural to expect that we would be able to sell analytics very nicely into our installed base. But if what we\u2019re seeing trends out, we could actually be seeing a Trojan Horse, if you will, of analytics, into the non-Salesforce installed base, dragging our customer success platform.","So the potential is very strong, and again, we\u2019re in the early days, just to temper everybody\u2019s enthusiasm. But our customers seem to be very enthusiastic, and we\u2019re mobilizing the entire organization around making sure that we can drive our customer success. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citi.","Walter Pritchard ","Question for Keith Block. On the sales side, can you give us a sense of how far through the sort of realignment and changes that you feel need to be made to get yourself to this kind of vertical organization that you want to have, and sort of what plans do you have in the new fiscal year to get yourselves there?","Keith Block","I appreciate the question. I will tell you that, you know, this is a great company, and the company is driven by an incredibly strong culture, and it\u2019s a culture of innovation and continuous improvement. And I think we have to start there. And so to that point, our work is never going to be done, and we will always continue to do better and to innovate and continuously improve and experiment, and we\u2019re not afraid to take risks here. ","Obviously, they\u2019re calculated risks and we\u2019re smart about how we do things, but listen, we have said that there are three things that are important as we go to market. One is obviously to speak the language of industry. We think that\u2019s very important, because when you speak to a bank, you need to understand the language of the bank, what the customer challenges are, and what the opportunities are, and how you can apply the customer success platform to that business problem.","The second is to build up the largest ecosystem in the world, and that takes many forms, starting with SIs and boutiques and agencies which are key influencers, obviously. It\u2019s also about ISVs, and we\u2019re doing some terrific work with ISVs. We kind of revamped our ISV process. And then resellers for coverage. So that\u2019s the second area.","And then the third is our international expansion, and you can see the results already starting to happen, for example, in Asia Pac and Europe. And we continue to invest across the board in our distribution capacity, adding more AEs, more reps, more selling capacity, opening our data centers and expanding our partner networks. So this is an ongoing process. We\u2019re obviously seeing traction over the last 12 months. So again, we\u2019ll always, always be inspecting to see what we can optimize. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ross MacMillan with RBC Capital Markets.","Ross MacMillan","Just on the vertical industry strategy, I guess it\u2019s a question for Keith, aside from the actual verticalization of the sales organization, what are the sorts of things we should be looking for in terms of product enhancements or partner enhancements to the platform that could drive further penetration into particular verticals?","Keith Block","So I would look at this in multiple dimensions. So number one is obviously equipping and arming our sales team so that when they\u2019re in front of the customer, they are speaking the language of the customer. So we want to make sure that they\u2019re enabled and ready and we\u2019re giving them the right content.","Number two is in certain markets - and we already have this today - organizing geographically by vertical. So for example in the broader market today, here in the United States, we have a financial services vertical sales team that wakes up every day and they call just on financial services accounts. And we also have the same thing for healthcare and life sciences.","So that\u2019s another access that you can look at. The third is actually developing product, creating product, that Salesforce builds organically, and you know, we have some announcements that we\u2019ll be releasing soon, so we don\u2019t want to get into that right now, but we will be in the position where in certain industries that are very, very important to us and strategic to us, we will be building out some product. ","And then the last is cultivating this ISV community, our partner community, and that is super important. We signed an agreement with one ISV in the quarter that we consider to be very, very strategic, and it\u2019s around really two industries. One is around telecommunications and the other one is around insurance. And they will continue to enhance and extend our footprint so that they have industry relevant apps on our customer success platform. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tom Roderick with Stifel. ","Tom Roderick","I wanted to switch gears and talk a little about the Marketing Cloud, particularly see if we can get an update on some of the technical integration that\u2019s gone on over the last several months. And beyond just the technical integration, as you look at the interplay between Sales Cloud and Marketing Cloud, can you talk a little bit more about how Pardot is progressing in the B2B marketing automation world?","Marc Benioff ","Well, I think starting with Pardot, I mean, it\u2019s one of our heated success stories of the year. We\u2019ve just had a phenomenal growth rate. It was the unpolished jewel inside the exact target, the ecosystem. We broke it off, and we run it separately, and we\u2019ve invested in it very significantly. We\u2019ve also integrated it into our core, and the leader of the unit has done just a phenomenal job. And I could not be happier with that. It\u2019s run out of our Atlanta headquarters, and the team in Atlanta has just exceeded our expectations.","I would also now kind of point to, today, just before World Tour, we had a press event and launched our new Social Studio. You saw the vision for this incredible new capabilities with all of our social products, not just our social advertising products, that you\u2019ve seen at social.com, but the next generation of our social listening products, social publishing and social engagement platforms. The team has done a great job. ","Today, that product is disintermediated from our core marketing platform, and you are correct in intuiting the next step is the social studio will become an integrated part of our marketing cloud, deeply integrated into the Journey Builder itself. And when that happens, I think you\u2019re really going to see all of these assets come together in an incredible new way, as well as deep integration into our Salesforce1 platform.","We\u2019ve now owned the ExactTarget asset just a little more than a year, and it\u2019s been a very exciting year. We\u2019ve obviously created the next generation of the leadership team that has performed very, very well. We\u2019ve also delivered a next generation of a structure where the product teams are deeply integrated with our core Salesforce product teams under our president, Alex Dayon. And distribution is run directly by Keith.","So the functional integration has happened, the product integration is underway, and I think if you saw the demonstrations today, I\u2019m sure you\u2019d say that our products are state of the art, and I\u2019m sure you can see from the financial numbers, we\u2019re very excited about where we\u2019ve gotten. ","Acquisitions are hard. I can tell you that myself. We\u2019ve done a couple dozen acquisitions in the last five years. They\u2019re super high risk. Not all of them are successful. You aren\u2019t able to bring the revenue forward and grow it in all acquisitions. In this case, you see the revenue growing in a significant way, and we have a lot of dreams and hopes for this cloud.","What I\u2019m excited about the marketing cloud is the macro view, is that our customers want from us a customer success platform, and you can\u2019t deliver a customer success platform without a strong marketing component. We have that. We have a best of breed capability. So we\u2019ve got the sales capability in the customer success platform, the service, the marketing, analytics, community, as well as with Heroku, the ability to build highly customized customer facing apps. It\u2019s a very, very exciting moment for Salesforce with these six core clouds, all underway and all engaged.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs.","Heather Bellini","Marc, you\u2019re always great with bold predictions, and given the excitement with analytics cloud and the comment that you and Keith made that you see this as being the most successful cloud you\u2019ve ever launched, thinking about how customers can leverage this product, either existing Salesforce customers and new ones across their businesses, any predictions on how fast this could ramp to a billion in billings? ","Marc Benioff ","Well, I would be happy to give you that, and it\u2019s not that I don\u2019t have that, I certainly do, but I am not going to do that, Heather, and I\u2019ll tell you why, which is that in these new products, you\u2019re never really completely sure what the next step is. You talk to my team, and they know I am super optimistic about what we\u2019ve seen, not just in what we\u2019ve developed, but what we\u2019re seeing with customer traction. We have a few other things we want to deliver in the next six months for this product, which will, I think, blow everyone away.","And I think I can start to make those predictions by, I would say, within one or two quarters of getting fully ramped. We have a big ACB number, which is our kind of first year contract value number, for this product, for this year, and if we deliver that number, then I\u2019ll be happy to give you the billion dollar prediction. ","Make no mistake, Heather, my goal is not just a billion dollars product line that we call [AOV] with the analytics cloud. It\u2019s far beyond that. But I don\u2019t want to get into specifics of when and how we\u2019re going to be able to do that. Just know that I\u2019m extremely optimistic about what is possible. And now Keith just needs to go out and sell it.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jason Maynard with Wells Fargo.","Jason Maynard ","I guess I have to follow up on that question with some more bold predictions, since you seem to be in a good prediction making mood. How about on the service cloud? Service cloud is probably one of the areas, if we look at at-scale, still growing, high growth, big, massive replacement opportunity potential. When does something like service cloud start to match the sales cloud, and what are you guys seeing maybe from a customer standpoint in terms of actually moving off of legacy call centers? And Keith, if you want to talk about the Verizon deal, if you can share any more color on that, that would be great.","Marc Benioff ","Yeah, let me take the first part, and I\u2019ll shoot it over to Keith. You know, number one, you\u2019ve seen us deliver now the first $3 billion cloud with sales, and you don\u2019t have to go very far to put together the numbers that we now report with sales cloud to see that service cloud is probably not far behind. The exact timing of when that service cloud can get to that level, you\u2019re going to have to do the model yourself. I have my model, you\u2019ll have your model. ","But there\u2019s no doubt that service cloud has that kind of capability and more in it, and it\u2019s pure potentiality at this point, and Keith is closing some terrific deals with service cloud, because really these other vendors have not delivered in the service area. ","And by the way, before I move on to Keith, if you haven\u2019t been tracking it, it\u2019s not just service cloud on the high end, it\u2019s also desk.com on the low end. And if you haven\u2019t been to www.desk.com and given yourself an account and seen the huge traction on desk.com or seen what that team has done, we have got an incredible executive running desk.com and is doing a great job at the very, very, very low end of the market. ","But let me have Keith talk about the mainstream, high end enterprise capability, with service cloud.","Keith Block","You know, service cloud, I think, it\u2019s a whole area that I think is very, very interesting, because it certainly is an area where companies want to go and have the opportunity to take on a major transformation, because as you know, many companies are always looking for that area to differentiate themselves, and service is certainly one. And more and more companies want to differentiate from their competition by improving their service in many, many ways. And a lot of that is leveraging our customer success platform. ","And I could talk about Verizon, but Verizon probably doesn\u2019t want me to get into too much detail, specifically, about how they\u2019re leveraging the platform, because there may be some competitive advantage there. So I have to be sensitive to that. ","But just generally speaking, we are finding significant interest from some major corporations to work with us and collaborate with us to extend and enhance our service cloud offering, which gives you an indication of the interest that they\u2019re looking to work with us on. So I think that\u2019s very, very existing. ","We also have some companies that have gone on record. I mean, if you talk to GE, they talk about transforming into a service company, and certainly they want to do that with our assistance by leveraging, again, our customer success platforms. ","Suffice it to say, it is a major transformational opportunity for a lot of enterprise organizations, and the great news is that they want to talk to us, and they\u2019re working very closely with us to make that happen. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brendan Barnicle with Pacific Crest Securities.","Brendan Barnicle","Marc, you mentioned on the call this impressive transaction growth that you had, this over 60% transaction growth. As we were monitoring that through the quarter, we saw a particular spike in September. Can you give us any color on what might be spiking those transactions so dramatically?","Marc Benioff ","Before I get into that, let me just say that when we talk about service cloud, one of the reasons it\u2019s so successful is there\u2019s no technical separation between sales cloud and service cloud and the platform and community. That is, this is one code base, and of course we label it and market it, and we deliver it as different SKUs, but unlike other software companies, these are not like separate disks that you can get, this is one integrated service. ","And of course marketing cloud is an acquisition that we are working to integrate into that core system, but that core kind of if you will it\u2019s a monolithic code base with sales, service, community, and analytics is actually deeply integrated and is an extension of that core. ","It\u2019s kind of unprecedented. When we added Lightning in the service cloud, we added Lightning in the sales cloud, we added Lightning into community. When we add Salesforce1, we add it into each of those things simultaneously, because it\u2019s the same code. And I really want to just point that out as one of the reasons that service cloud has had such an incredible success. ","And if you look at service cloud against any other cloud company, that\u2019s amazing in terms of its size. But also, if you look at our growth for next year, you might note that we\u2019re going to grow more next year than I think the second largest enterprise cloud company in absolute numbers. That is, we will add another cloud company on just through our organic growth next year, which is kind of amazing. And I think it\u2019s kind of lost by a lot of people, about what\u2019s really happening right now with Salesforce. So it is a very exciting time. ","In regards to September, when you see those transaction spikes, and many times it\u2019s actually linked to fiscal quarters associated with our customers closing their quarters. So most companies are organized around fiscal quarters, calendar quarters, and so you will see a spike, for example, in September, like what you saw, because a lot of customer activity tends to happen around a quarter close, and that\u2019s what happened probably at the end of the third fiscal quarter, which is, for most companies, the end of September, not for Salesforce, but for probably the majority of customers that we have on our system. So that probably answers your question.","Anyway, I want to thank you so much. I want to congratulate Larry Baer and the San Francisco Giants for winning the World Series. I want to congratulate my team for delivering the first enterprise cloud company that\u2019s giving $6.5 billion of guidance for a fiscal year, and I want to thank all of you for coming to the New York City event today, as well as for coming to Dreamforce. Okay? And thanks so much for attending the call. "],"19545":["salesforce.com, inc.

At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the CRM Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2016 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you.","And I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. John Cummings, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","John Cummings - Director-Investor Relations","Thanks so much, Jennifer, and good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us for our fiscal second quarter 2016 results conference call. Our second quarter results press release, SEC filings and a replay of today's call can be found on our IR website at www.salesforce.com\/investor. We'll also post the highlights of today's call on Twitter at the handle, @salesforce_ir.","With me today is Marc Benioff, Chief Executive Officer; Keith Block, President and Vice Chairman; and Mark Hawkins, Chief Financial Officer. Marc, Keith and Mark will share a few prepared remarks and we'll open the call for questions.","As a reminder, our commentary today will primarily be in non-GAAP terms. Reconciliations between our GAAP and non-GAAP results and guidance can be found in our earnings press release. During our call we may offer additional metrics to provide further insights into our business or results. This detail may or may not be provided in the future.

A description of our risks, uncertainties and assumptions and other factors that could affect our financial results are included in our SEC filings, including our most recent report on Form 10-Q.","So with that, let me turn the call over to Marc.","Marc Russell Benioff - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, hey. Thanks so much, John, and thanks, everyone, for being on the call today. I'll tell you, this second quarter, well this was just the best quarter we have ever had at salesforce.com, and just one quarter after crossing the $6 billion annual revenue run rate milestone, we have now surpassed a $6.5 billion revenue run rate. That's faster than any enterprise software company in history, and we anticipate we're going to reach a $7 billion run rate by the end of this year and we are now well on our way. I mean, we have a clear trajectory to accomplishing our goal of being the fastest ever to reach $10 billion in revenue, so exciting. And no one in our industry is producing this kind of results of our size and scale.","And also in this quarter we became a Fortune 500 company. That's really exciting for Salesforce, one of the 500 largest companies in the world, a huge milestone. Congratulations to all of our customers, our partners and employees in this incredible job. We continue to be the fastest-growing top 10 enterprise software company that many of you projected. We're going to go from being the sixth-largest software company in the world to the fourth-largest next year. That's awesome. That is next year, only Microsoft, Oracle and SAP are bigger than Salesforce. That is incredible. And then, of course, we're going to go on to our next goal which is to become the third-largest software company in the world, first by market and then by revenue. Then only Microsoft and Oracle are going to be larger than Salesforce. It's just amazing.","Well, I want to thank all of our customers and partners for their inspiration, and all of our Salesforce employees for this unwavering focus on customer success because this is what is driving Salesforce forward quarter after quarter. It just delights us to see our customers so successful with our products.","And now, I'd like to share the highlights for the quarter. While revenue for the quarter rose to $1.63 billion, that is up 28% in constant currency and that's just beyond our expectations. Deferred revenue grew to more than $3 billion, up 33% in constant currency, and the dollar value of booked business on and off the balance sheet is $9.2 billion. It's a great indicator of the strength of our future revenues, and we are just really excited to see such strength in our deferred revenue.","Even as we delivered this outstanding pace of top line growth, we also improved non-GAAP operating margin by 170 basis points year-over-year, and we are committed, very deeply committed to improving profitability quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year as we also grow this business at record levels. All of this translated into another outstanding quarter in operating cash. We delivered more than $300 million in operating cash flow, which is up 24% year-over-year. That brings us to more than $1 billion in operating cash flow for the first half of the year, $1 billion in the first half of the year, and that really demonstrates the cash model built into cloud computing. This is an incredible achievement and demonstrates the power of our model.","Given these outstanding second quarter results, I'm thrilled to announce that we are raising our full year guidance for both our top and bottom lines. The high end of our revenue guidance puts us on track to finish the year at $6.625 billion and we're increasing our non-GAAP EPS by a $0.01 to $0.72 at the high end of our range.","As you can see from our strong results along with the incredible momentum we're having with our Customer Success Platform and our sales and service and marketing, community, analytics apps, we're on a trajectory to deliver $10 billion in revenue faster than any other enterprise software company in history. Did I mention that? It's been a phenomenal first half of the year.","You'll hear more from Keith in a moment about how we've become a catalyst for business transformation and growth and how we're delivering new levels of customer success in every industry in every region every day. And this is especially true in Europe, where I spend a majority of the quarter, and where we're seeing tremendous growth. Our tours in Paris and Munich drew nearly 10,000 raving customers and I've had the opportunity to talk to dozens of CEOs in the region whether it was at AXA or Barclays or BMW or Deutsche Telekom, Eurostar, LOUIS VUITTON, Schneider, Unilever; all of these folks have become very significant customers in the last year with Salesforce and I am even heading back to Europe again next week because we are seeing incredible momentum in our European business.","Right now every company in the world is looking to strengthen how they connect with their customers. This is a massive customer relationship management opportunity. Perhaps it is the largest opportunity in the software industry. Every company is looking to connect with their customer in a whole new way. Every company is looking for a whole new type of customer success and no company is better positioned to deliver this to our customers than Salesforce. There has never been a company of our size and scale focused so exclusively on this customer relationship management opportunity. No other customer relationship management company has 17,000 people, every single employee completely focused on the customer and that's why there's no other enterprise software company selling billions of dollars of CRM and still growing at nearly 30% in constant currency.","Look, Microsoft, Oracle, SAP they're selling millions of dollars of CRM, that's with an M. We are selling billions of dollars of CRM that's with a B and that is the difference between us and the competition. No other enterprise cloud can match the breadth and depth of our trusted cloud platform and complete customer relationship management solutions, whether it's sales or service, marketing, community analytics apps within the Internet of Things and no one can match the strength of the Salesforce ecosystem, our platforms, which is accelerating our growth with SIs and ISVs creating solutions that address any kind of business process.","In addition, the AppExchange, which is now the number one business app marketplace, continues to set us apart from all others. I'll tell you, that AppExchange, our partners, our platform strategy over the last 10 years this is really separated us from the competition. We're not an app; we're a platform and we're not an app, we're an ecosystem, and we're not an app, we're all about customer success and it's our partners that help us to create that.","We're seeing tremendous growth in the adoption and usage of our core platform. We delivered 234 billion transactions for our customers in the quarter, up 79% from year ago. That's an average of nearly 3.7 billion transactions every single business day.","We're also gaining traction as we better integrate acquisitions and invest in deep, organic innovation. Well, those results are just phenomenal. You're going to see more innovation than ever at Dreamforce this year. You're going to see new products and new clouds and we're going to be showcasing incredible new services. I mean, we're going to be breaking through with a whole new level of customer success. We're even going to be announcing this incredible new cloud.","Well, in addition, our strategic partnerships are paying off. There's no better example of this than our relationship with Microsoft and at Dreamforce you're going to hear about how we're making our joint customers, the customers of Salesforce and Microsoft \u2013 well, we're working more closely together than ever before and we're working on making those customers even more successful, delivering deep integration with Office and Outlook and Azure and I'm thrilled that Microsoft's CEO, Satya Nadella is going to be speaking at Dreamforce this year with his own keynote and that Microsoft Chairman, John Thompson will be part of my keynotes.","Well, I have to tell you, but as all of you already know Salesforce just isn't about doing well, we're also about doing good. Giving back has been an integral part of our company culture from the beginning with our 1-1-1 philanthropic model. Salesforce technology now powers more than 26,000 non-profit and higher education institutions and the Salesforce Foundation has provided more than $96 million in grants. That's in addition to the almost $250 million of in-kind services that we've provided to these other non-profits over our life and this quarter we surpassed another huge milestone. Our employees have given more than 1.1 million hours of community service.","Well, that's just extraordinary. It's created an amazing culture at Salesforce. It's an amazing place to work and I think it is one of the reasons that our attrition has remained so low at a time of increased talent wars in Silicon Valley and even in San Francisco, there's no other technology company like Salesforce.","Look, as I mentioned, Dreamforce is on the horizon, it's just 26 days away. It's going to be our biggest and most exciting Dreamforce ever and we expect more than 150,000 people to register for the event in San Francisco and 10 million to join us online. They're going to come from 75 countries.","Dreamforce has become so big, we're bringing in a cruise ship, because we've run out of hotel rooms so we're calling up the Dreamboat and to provide extra accommodations for all of our attendees. We've even partnered with Airbnb to radically expand the number of people that we can house in San Francisco. We've partnered with Uber to make sure that there's more drivers available than ever before. We're even going to have four airstreams in the Dreampark for special events and we even have a few people staying there for additional accommodations because we're completely out of rooms.","Look, you're going to see the future of Salesforce in my keynote with relationship, intelligence, next generation of clouds, the Internet of Things. You're going to see a whole new standard for an industry. We have 1,500 customer-driven breakout sessions at Dreamforce, the world's biggest cloud ecosystem coming together in one place, thousands of solutions from more than 400 companies in our Cloud Expo. Isn't that amazing? And I didn't even mention the huge Foo Fighters concert that's going to be happening on Thursday night and our special event for our very top customers with John Legend the night before that.","We've also gathered an amazing group of global thought leaders. In addition to Satya, we've got an incredible lineup of innovation speakers including, the CEO of Uber, Travis Kalanick; Skoll Foundation's, Larry Brilliant; John Collison of Stripe; William Marshall of Planet Labs, who just launched more of his Doves into the atmosphere; Hampton Creek's Josh Tetrick. George Zimmer is launching his new company zTailors and zTux at Dreamforce. We even have best-selling authors Tom Davenport, Andrew McAfee, Dov Seidman and many, many, many, many others all speaking at Dreamforce.","And we're all going to be talking about the future of business, the future technology, the future of the cloud, social, mobile, the future of data science, Internet of Things, and the future of social responsibility as well and the importance of business to give back and to manage their stakeholders not just their shareholders.","A new Dreamforce Women's Leadership Summit features actress and entrepreneur, Jessica Alba; YouTube's CEO and Salesforce's board member, Susan Wojcicki; and Oscar winner, Patricia Arquette. Incredible focus on the empowerment of women at Dreamforce.","And we have a Startup Summit to inspire the next-generation of entrepreneurs with keynotes from actor and entrepreneur, Adrian Grenier, I'm sure you all loved the movie Entourage; Box CEO Aaron Levie; Pro Football Hall of Famer Steve Young. And we have a Mindfulness Day because we're all going to need to kick back, relax and clearer minds after that Dreamforce and we have one of the world's top meditation teachers, Jack Kornfield, as well as actress Goldie Hawn and fashion icon, Donna Karan, all talking about the importance of taking care of ourselves while we're taking care of the world. And world champion San Francisco Giants' CEO, Larry Baer; the Golden State Warriors President and COO, Rick Welts are going to share the secrets for success in professional sports.","Throughout Dreamforce, we'll have many ways in which attendees can give back. Each day at Dreamforce, there's a focus on an important cause in our world. One day will be dedicated to our veterans; one day dedicated to our K through 12 schools; one day dedicated to women in technology; and one day dedicated to the environment and our oceans. And we're holding a fantastic benefit concert as I mentioned with Foo Fighters and other incredible bands that you're going to love to support children's health and our children's hospitals. Bring all your friends. You're not going to want to miss it. If you buy a sponsorship for the concert, we're going to make sure you get unbelievable seats and recognition.","And we're going to have the world's largest book drive of all time. So if you want to come to Dreamforce, you'd better bring a book for kids, because we're going to be collecting books and putting them in libraries all over the country, collecting more than a million books to support schools and students. So don't forget your books. Don't forget bringing food, because we're running a huge food drive. And I look forward to see you all at Dreamforce and don't forget, it's going to be the biggest, most exciting Dreamforce of all time.","Now over to Keith.","Keith G. Block - Vice Chairman & President","Thanks, Marc. As you said, Q2 was really an outstanding quarter. We are executing like never before and we are seeing exceptional performance across the board in every geography, in every industry and certainly in every cloud.","We saw an amazing number of big deals this quarter. Really, for example, the Marketing Cloud doubled its number of large deals year-over-year, which was terrific to see. And more importantly, the value of our large deals across all the clouds has increased significantly. That is proof positive of the level and depth of relationships that we're certainly driving with customers.","As Marc said, we're now part of the Fortune 500 and that is a great indicator of how Salesforce is delivering customer success and scale. It's pretty clear that Salesforce is taking share from our competitors and we're growing at every segment, in every industry, and in every region as software center of gravity continues its shift from on-premise to the cloud.","In the past year, we have had countless conversations with CEOs of world-class companies. Marc mentioned his trip to Europe around innovation and taking their companies into the future. They are looking to us to help transform their business models to drive growth and to become their trusted advisor.","Every CEO's agenda is about growth and they're looking for Salesforce to be that growth engine. They're looking to us and it all starts with our Customer Success Platform. These are conversations that are driving more meaningful and long-term relationships, quite frankly with some of the greatest companies on earth. And I'm going to give you some examples starting with Enel.","Enel is Europe's largest power company with 61 million customers. This deal was significant in terms of expansion of an important relationship where the CEO was personally involved. We are now Enel's strategic partner for the complete transformation of their customer engagement platform, leveraging sales and service and communities, analytics and platform. But that doesn't stop there.","In addition, we're building an agility layer around their legacy on-premise SAP system and we're helping them extract information from complex order management and inventory and billing systems. They're having trouble getting meaningful and timely information out of SAP and Salesforce is bringing all this data together, so Enel's teams can get a 360 degrees view of their customers. And with Wave Analytics, they can drill down into their customer data right from the mobile phone in seconds. Enel absolutely has a tremendous vision for the future and we at Salesforce are helping them make it a reality.","We also signed a significant deal this quarter with a huge global systems integrator and just as they advised their clients, they themselves are making a major shift to the cloud and decided to replace their aging on-premise software with our Sales Cloud, with our Marketing Cloud and with our platform. I'm also pleased to tell you their doubling down on a dedicated Salesforce practice and we're very, very excited about that. So with this win, with this very large integrator, virtually every global systems integrator globally is running their business on Salesforce.","In fact, the number of Salesforce certified consultants across the globe grew 44% year-over-year, it's pretty staggering. This is a great indication of the type of growth and success that we're seeing in our partner ecosystem which is one of our growth strategies and our partner strategy overall. We're very, very pleased with this.","The U.S. Department of Agriculture is another exciting win for us in Q2. In one of their largest agencies, they standardized on the Salesforce platform to build and deploy mobile applications. In addition their Farm Service Agency is also using our Service Cloud to connect citizens to critical resources.","Our public sector business is just growing off the charts and I'm really proud of the team for their outstanding performance. And just a year after being FedRAMP certified, we're building huge momentum with federal, state, and local governments. In fact, 15 out of 15 federal cabinet agencies now use Salesforce as well as 45 of 50 state governments and we're just getting started in this space.","We also signed an exciting new relationship in the quarter with one of the largest hospitality vendors in the world. Now, they have an incredible vision to bring all of their customer service together under a single platform to deliver a very personalized experience at scale to millions of their guests. The Service Cloud will now be the social mobile front office to the Oracle back-office and allow their hotel associates to better engage and service guests no matter where they are anywhere in the globe. It was a great win over Oracle and they chose Salesforce for our ability to deliver customer service on a flexible platform that would allow them to innovate with scale and speed.","AXA has significantly expanded their seven-year relationship with us and in the quarter they've decided to consolidate 18 systems together onto our Service Cloud to run their entire global front office with more than 26,000 users. They're taking sales and customer service to a whole new level by modernizing their agent engagement platform with Salesforce.","Now, we've also signed new or expanded relationships in the quarter with Barclays and BBC, Comcast, Commerzbank, Cox, Ford, Genomic Health, GlaxoSmithKline, Honda, Honeywell, Renault, listen, this list just goes on and on. It's pretty clear that we're driving success in every major industry and as all of you know, industries have been one of our critical strategies.","We're incredibly excited about our industry momentum. It continues to gain mind share with our customers and our partners. In fact, we will be launching our first industry products at the end of this month. Some of the most influential industry-leading companies are serving as our design partners in the development of these industry clouds. The early feedback has absolutely been incredibly positive and you're going to see these products in action at Dreamforce.","And speaking of Dreamforce, we've tailored the experience for customers with a special industry showcase in the Dreamforce Expo as well as industry keynotes and special sessions. It's going to be four incredible days for banks, for retailers, for manufacturers, telecommunication companies, government entities, healthcare providers. And I really hope that you check it out.","So I want to close by congratulating everyone at Salesforce for their tremendous performance this quarter and, of course, just incredible execution. I also want to thank our customers for their continued commitment and inspiration, and our partners for their ongoing investment in our customer success. With our Customer Success Platform, our six world-class clouds, our industry innovation, our partner ecosystem, our international strategy, we are at the innovation engine and trusted advisor for companies looking to redefine their customer strategies and take their businesses into the future.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Mark.","Mark J. Hawkins - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Keith. As you've heard, we delivered another great quarter. From a top line perspective, we delivered revenue of $1.63 billion, up 24% in dollars and 28% in constant currency. Foreign exchange continue to impact revenue with year-over-year headwinds of approximately $50 million and a sequential tailwind of $4 million.","Our revenue was strong across the board, becoming more diversified across each geography, all of our clouds, and all of our business units. For example, our geographies continued to deliver great year-over-year growth in constant currency basis as Americas grew 28%, EMEA grew 29%, and Asia-Pac grew 25%. We also delivered incredible year-over-year growth in all of our clouds on a dollar basis as Sales Cloud grew 10%, Service Cloud grew 40%, Platform and others grew 36%, and Marketing Cloud grew 29%. Dollar attrition for the second quarter excluding Marketing Cloud was approximately 9%.","And not only did we continue to grow our top line, we also improved our bottom line, expanding our non-GAAP operating margin by 170 basis points year-over-year, and this is our fifth consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement. We've been able to deliver this improvement by driving efficiencies across all our operating expense categories.","As we remain committed to improving our non-GAAP operating margins year-over-year going forward, this is consistent with our operating margin framework we've discussed previously. Our great top line performance along with continued spending discipline allowed us to deliver non-GAAP EPS of $0.19, up 46% over last year.","Turning to cash flow. We delivered another strong quarter with operating cash flow of $304 million, up 24% over last year, and we've already delivered more than $1 billion in operating cash flow this year, up 44% for the first half of the year. Second quarter free cash flow defined as operating cash flow less CapEx was up 37% over last year to $240 million.","Looking at billed deferred revenue, we delivered growth of 29% year-over-year. Excluding an FX headwind of $72 million, deferred revenue grew 33% over last year. On a sequential basis, deferred revenue was impacted by an FX headwind of roughly $12 million.","In the quarter, 74% of the value of all subscriptions and support-related invoices were issued with annual terms, and this is compared with 71% last year. This increase is primarily due to our annual invoicing policy for new contracts and to a lesser extent shifting current customers to annual terms upon renewal. In Q2, this benefited year-over-year deferred revenue by approximately one percentage point.","Moving on to guidance. With our strong performance in the second quarter, we are raising our full year revenue guidance by $75 million. We now anticipate to be $6.6 billion to $6.625 billion, or 23% growth. This guidance includes an FX headwind of approximately $175 million, which is a bit less than previously expected.","Given the spending discipline, I've discussed and slightly lower impact from FX in the second half, we now expect to deliver approximately 150 basis points of year-over-year non-GAAP operating margin improvement. This is the high end of our previous guidance. In that context, we're also raising our full year non-GAAP EPS to $0.70 to $0.72.","Now let's turn to cash flow. We continue to anticipate full year operating cash flow growth of 24% to 25%. For Q3, we anticipate revenues of $1.69 billion to $1.70 billion, non-GAAP EPS of $0.18 to $0.19, and deferred revenue growth in the mid-20% range.","To close, we are very pleased with our second quarter results. We saw strong growth across all of our products and regions and are well-positioned to move into the second half. I'd like to thank the entire Salesforce team for delivering another great quarter. I look forward to seeing all of you at our annual Investor Day at Dreamforce on September 15.","And with that, I'd like to open the call to questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And our first question comes from the line of Brent Thill with UBS.","Brent John Thill - UBS Securities LLC","Good afternoon. A question for Mark Hawkins. On the Service Cloud, the growth rate really stood out, accelerating to 40%, up from what you saw in Q1. Just curious if you could give everyone just a little more color on what you're seeing in the Service Cloud and what you see in the pipeline going forward?","Mark J. Hawkins - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure. I'll start out on this, and then will just turn it over, Brent, to Keith, as well here. But we saw just a tremendous amount of traction in the Service Cloud. I think part of the issue when we see deal after deal coming forward is the ROI. It's just so strong. People are able to help their customer raise their customer satisfaction and also have a really strong ROI from that standpoint. So I saw it coming through in a lot of big deals, and that's probably a good segue for Keith.","Keith G. Block - Vice Chairman & President","Yeah, just a couple comments on that. Obviously, this is proof positive that we're not just a Salesforce automation company, and that we have a very diversified, very, very strong portfolio across the Customer Success Platform.","Specifically around service, as you know, many companies differentiate themselves because of service and the way that they deliver service, so many companies are looking for innovation around how they engage with their customers. And over 70% of all sales, quite frankly, come from great service. So we're seeing this play out in the marketplace. Customers talk to us about how they can transform their business, and our Service Cloud product is best-in-class, so that certainly is what we're seeing going on in the marketplace right now.","Marc Russell Benioff - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I'd also like to add, with the Service Cloud, we've talked a lot about the success of many of our customers, including Home Depot, we've even pointed you to our really cool Home Depot Community site: community.homedepot.com.","If you want to see the Service Cloud in action yourself, you just have to go to support.us.playstation.com. That's Sony's website for supporting the Sony PlayStation. It runs entirely on Salesforce's Service Cloud. It's had over 16 million page views so far and we're doing our Service Cloud, our console, case management, live agent knowledge, and social service with Sony. It's completely cool and it's another great example the success our customers are having with Service Cloud.","Operator","And your next question comes from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley.","Keith Eric Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Excellent. Thank you. Thanks, for taking the question, and very nice quarter. A question for Keith, perhaps. In talking about the vertical solutions that you guys are \u2013 or the industry solutions that you're looking to roll out, the actual product you guys are looking to roll out, can you help us think about two aspects of it? One, how do you think about that expanding the potential market opportunity for salesforce.com? I'm assuming that it's going to let you guys go deeper into existing customers as well as address new customers, but I'd like to get your perspective on that. As well as from a distribution perspective, anything you guys need to change around or expand out to be able to \u2013 a distributor will sell those industry solutions?","Keith G. Block - Vice Chairman & President","Yeah. Listen, thank you very much for the question. So as we continue to fuel our industry strategy, it really starts in a number of ways. Number one is that we want to make sure that we have the right industry messaging, the right content around our Customer Success Platform specific to a particular industry.","Secondly, industries just deepen the relationship with a customer. Marc and I both talked about the level of engagement that we're seeing from CEOs. A lot of that dialog is around specific industry and vertical content. So as we continue to think about our product portfolio and we extend our Customer Success Platform, which is an incredible platform, it's not just things that we extend ourselves. Our customers extend it. We have an incredible ecosystem that extends the capability of the platform. There is a natural play to deepen the relationships, drive more strategic relationships with more industry-focus product.","Specific to your question around how we organize in the field, over the last few years, we have been very carefully and very slowly moving to more and more of a vertical orientation. For example, we have a huge focus on our public sector. We are taking a look at expanding how we go after financial services markets and healthcare and life sciences markets. So we've done this very carefully and very thoughtfully, and it's really paying out in our results.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mark Murphy with JPMorgan.","Mark R. Murphy - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yes. Thank you. Question for Marc Benioff. It seems like a fascinating time in the history of the software industry. You have Sage re-architecting under the force.com platform, the big three traditional software companies are trying to deal with the cloud a bit more actively, and for a couple of them their product revenues are actually declining for the first time ever outside of recession. And then their margins are under pressure while yours are increasing. So I'm wondering as they talk up their own cloud products, to what extent do think the bigger traditional software companies can retain some of their customers versus to what extent \u2013 it feels like they're leaky buckets and they might inadvertently drive more customers to reassess and perhaps move in your direction?","Marc Russell Benioff - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think the way to understand the future is to look at the past, and you can look at IBM with the Mainframe business. I think we all know IBM still sells a lot of Mainframes. That doesn't mean that IBM is innovating, that doesn't mean that IBM is creating value for customers or helping them to transform customers' businesses or align them with modern trends. It just means they're selling them old technology and upgrading it. And that's what you see with companies like Oracle and SAP. These are old technology bases that are kind of meandering along like Mainframes. And I think that is reflected exactly as you said in their license revenue growth, which has been poor, and then their movement to the cloud has been stunted because they don't want to shift those customers into new models. Exactly why IBM lost the PC business because they were too afraid to let go of the Mainframe. It's the past replaying itself. But instead of IBM, you've got Oracle and SAP basically running the same playbook.","We all know that the world has changed, it's moved to the cloud, it's multitenant architectures, it's about meta-database application development and deployment, it's about social user interfaces, it's about mobility, and it's about data science, and it's about the Internet of Things and the integration of everything. And companies who have built platforms, like Salesforce who has done that, deliver world-class growth like we're doing in this quarter. And if you haven't done that, well, then you end up with a quarter like Oracle or SAP had. I think you've seen in the last four or six or eight quarters, they've missed almost all of them. And that's because their technology bases are degrading the way Mainframes have. But they can hang in there with their revenue, and it's meander along like big dinosaurs moving down the desert for a while.","But nothing can stop the movement of new technologies and the key to being successful in the technology industry is to kind of transform that innovator's dilemma, to kind of constantly rethink and re-conceptualize yourself, to have a beginner's mind. And if you can do that, you can create something amazingly new. And you're going to see at Dreamforce more examples of Salesforce doing that. I've never been more excited about our technology base and what we're delivering to our customers, but ultimately, I've never been more excited that customers just love using our solutions, love working with us, and you feel that when you're at Dreamforce, and you're going to feel that in a bigger way than ever before.","Operator","And our next question comes from Richard Davis with Canaccord.","Richard Hugh Davis - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Hi. Thanks very much. So in my opinion, you guys have really improved and frankly continue to improve on force.com. And so my question is, by running a platform operation, you've seen successes like Veeva emerge, which is kind of win-win, but you also get to see kind of emerging promising companies. Could you either \u2013 you may not be able to name the firms, but at least \u2013 by name, but at least by segment what do you see kind of emerging? Because you guys get a free look at some of the interesting things that are out there that are pretty exciting. Thanks.","Marc Russell Benioff - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, one of the things that we've done is not only become an amazing platform company, which has spawned incredible companies like you've seen like Veeva, which has become one of our largest customers, or even FinancialForce which has become one of our largest customers. We've also had the chance to help our customers build and create their own applications using our platform, and I think that's been actually by far the most exciting thing for us, because it's taking us from just having a static application to something that customers mold and shape like they would with Play-Doh or Lego and they can create everything they want.","And when you get to Dreamforce, you're going to see the next iteration of our Lightning Platform that we released last year and you're going to see a level of application, the creation capabilities that's never been before possible in our industry, and the ability to execute that on everything from an Apple Watch to a phone, to a desktop or a tablet.","And that idea that we do have that super dynamic app\/dev environment and that's how we built all of our applications means that we can help execute that vertical vision or that line of business vision or the vision for any specific customer so much more rapidly. I think it's also one of the reasons we've been able to create this incredible venture fund, I think you've seen we've been able to deliver amazing returns with our venture fund because we do see everything and we've been able to have incredible relationships with all of these new companies and get them to integrate and work with our platform and you're going to see that show up at the show as well. Burke Norton is actually sitting at the table who runs our venture fund and sees a lot of these new companies. Burke, would you like to add anything about that?","Burke F. Norton - Secretary & Chief Legal Officer","Sure. I think that the amazing thing is that just over the last year alone, we've really massively increased the level of investment in the investment program. We don't reveal these numbers, but it's several orders of magnitude larger than how much we've invested previously. So we're really excited about what the returns we're going to be seeing in the coming years. And we couldn't be happier about the opportunity we have to see these companies in their very earlier stages.","Richard Hugh Davis - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Tom Roderick with Stifel.","Tom M. Roderick - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Good afternoon. So a question here about RelateIQ. Going on a little over a year since you made the acquisition, been seeing more in the way of marketing, advertising, just more socialization of what RelateIQ is and what customers are using it for. Can you talk a little bit more about what the plans are for that technology? How you think about maybe potentially integrating it with other clouds outside of the Sales Cloud? And just anything else you sort of have planned for RelateIQ as it pertains to integrating it with the broad organization? Thanks.","Marc Russell Benioff - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I think you're going to have to come to Dreamforce because it's going to be one of the most exciting announcements that we have at the show.","Operator","Your next question comes from Kash Rangan with Merrill Lynch.","Kasthuri Gopalan Rangan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, guys. Thank you very much. By my calculations, it looks like billings grew 30% \u2013 almost 30% on a year-over-year basis. Pretty spectacular if I take into account the year-over-year changes in deferred revenue or impact of deferred revenue and revenue. So Marc Benioff, question for you. Oracle Executive Chairman said sometime back that in their next fiscal year that they will add more cloud subscription revenue than salesforce.com. Just wondering what you think of that.","And also secondly, look at some of your businesses, your platform business, congratulations, almost $1 billion business today. Service Cloud almost $2 billion. As you march up and try to be the next $20 billion revenue company or whatever, what are the products that are going to look like the big successes tomorrow? Is it going to be Wave, or is it going to be platform, or is it going to be marketing? Which is going to be the next Sales Cloud? Which is going to be the next Service Cloud? I'm trying to get your view for the future. Thank you.","Marc Russell Benioff - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, Kash, I think we've mostly seen Oracle actually fail in the cloud market, I mean, for a long time, Larry said that the cloud was ridiculous and then he started taking it more seriously, but I just haven't seen any competitive cloud solutions from Oracle. And I think that's the shame. And I do view Larry as one of the most capable leaders in our industry. He's amazing. Of course, he's one of my mentors. But in this area of the cloud, Oracle has not delivered. And I think a great example of that is in the CRM marketplace. Here you can see Salesforce is selling billions of dollars of CRM in the cloud this year. Oracle is selling millions of dollars. And I think if you are selling millions and you have a competitor who is a relatively new entrant selling billions, well, then I would chalk that up as a failure in the cloud.","Operator","Your next question comes from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs.","Heather Anne Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi. Just had a sort of follow-up to what Kash was asking, but specifically wanted to focus on Wave and talk a little bit about how you've seen adoption since you launched it at Dreamforce a year ago and kind of what typical rollout pattern looks like from customers, from the ones who've become big adopters, kind of how does their footprint evolve? And also, what are you hearing from the field \u2013 maybe Keith Block, as to what the next level or next stage of innovation that customers are looking for on the analytics side? Thank you.","Keith G. Block - Vice Chairman & President","Okay. Hi, Heather. Thanks for the question. So, as you know, we are very excited about announcing Wave at last Dreamforce and very quickly, we were able to sign up some large, very strategic deals. In fact, if I go through the roster of customers that I just mentioned in the earnings call, many of them were existing analytics customers or had signed up net new as analytics customers and part of the solution that they're looking for to transform their businesses.","So we have gotten some tremendous feedback about the capabilities of that particular cloud, and how it fits relative to the customer engagement and driving customer success and how it does against the competition. I'll tell you, it will be the fastest launch of any product line that we've ever had here at Salesforce. So, there's a lot of enthusiasm, there's a lot of innovation, there's quite a bit of traction with the product. We're getting some great feedback from our customers. We're getting great feedback from our partners and I think that \u2013 it is very differentiated in the way that it drives insights to actions and that's not something that you see from the legacy BI product lines that have been entrenched for 20 or 30 years. So customers think of it as innovative and game-breaking and we're starting to see the results.","Operator","Your next question is from Alex Zukin with Stephens.","Alex J. Zukin - Stephens, Inc.","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe Keith, you mentioned the growth of Salesforce consultants worldwide at 44% and I'm wondering how has your messaging changed to the SI community or what has changed about their practices that they're making these types of investments today.","Keith G. Block - Vice Chairman & President","So there's several things going on. First of all, I think everybody knows that one of our growth strategies was to really expand our ecosystem and that takes a couple of flavors. We talked a little bit on this call, couple questions ago around our platform and our ISVs focus, but another very important piece of that, obviously, is the systems integrators globally and the regional boutiques who have influence in the boardroom, who have industry expertise and deep content and are at the forefront of helping our joint customers transform their businesses.","Really what's happening is that we're moving away from the legacy world of on-premise into the cloud and the integrators and influencers in the world, they see it, they want to be part of it, they see new business opportunities, they want to drive unprecedented levels of customer success, and we're the only company that can bring that solution to bear with our Customer Success Platform at scale.","And that's why these integrators and influencers are really latching onto us and partnering with us and locking arms and they are making the investments in their Salesforce practices and cannibalizing their legacy SAP and Oracle practices. And that's exactly what's happening. They see this huge shift in the marketplace and they want to be able to respond to it with us.","Marc Russell Benioff - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I think they also \u2013 just to add on to Keith's point \u2013 they clearly see that the world is going to the cloud and they want to be part of it, no doubt.","Operator","Your next question comes from Karl Keirstead.","Karl E. Keirstead - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. A question for Mark Hawkins. Mark, congrats on the margin and cash flow performance during the quarter. I actually wanted to ask you a question about your guidance on both margins and cash flow. You've guided to non-GAAP operating margin improvement of plus 150 basis points. I think in the first half you were plus 180 basis points so the guide implies a little bit of a slower rate of improvement in the second half and it's not obvious why that would be.","And then on the cash flow side to get to your 24%, 25% growth given your great first half performance, operating cash flow in the second half would actually have to be negative year-over-year and we haven't really seen that since the recession. So, my take is that you're appropriately keeping expectations low and there's some conservatism built into both margin and cash flow guide, but I wanted to give you an opportunity to flag anything that might be informing your guidance on those two metrics in the second half? Thank you.","Mark J. Hawkins - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure. No, I appreciate the question, actually. Let's just break it down one question at a time. Let's start with the operating margin. We're super-pleased with the operating margin. As you've heard we've expanded the operating margin for five quarters in a row year-on-year. Moreover you've heard from Marc and I, just absolute unequivocal commitment to the revenue operating margin framework that we talk about in terms of the rate of growth and the rate of operating margin expansion. That's really clear, and you're seeing period after period after period of demonstrating that with action and results. And we're committed to the increase, obviously. And so, at the same time, it's obviously our priority as a company to be a growth company and to take full advantage of investing to go tackle this amazing TAM that's out there, that's north of $50 billion today. It's a double-digit growing TAM, a huge opportunity.","And so, clearly what we're doing is we're growing rapidly, fastest-growing top 10 software company in the world, and we're expanding operating margin just exactly as we said we would do, just exactly consistent with the framework, so obviously, making sure that we're investing in growth as well.","So I think that's a key point there. We feel great about the guide. We've raised the guide. Effectively, it was 125 basis points to 150 basis points, as you've said. Now we've taken it up to 150 basis points approximately, and we feel good and confident about that. So we'll get a chance to revisit that as we go, but that's where we're at. Point one.","Point two is on the operating cash flow. One of the things that is pronounced, not only in operating cash flow, but in a number of the metrics of the company, we've talked for, actually, quite some time around the compounding effect of more and more of our invoicing showing up in Q4. And as we know, one of the effects of that shows makes our cash flow growth more by bimodal, it (48:12) shows up more in Q1 and then it shows up more in terms of Q4, and that's no shock.","And one of the things that we want to make sure, we think we have a very solid operating cash flow guide \u2013 by the way, that's exactly consistent with the revenue operating margin framework that we put out, right now the exact framework that we added.","And at the end of the day, when we see \u2013 when we have \u2013 we're closer to Q4 and we have more visibility around Q4, we'll revisit that and we'll have a better sense of, is there anything we want to change there? But we think it's an appropriate guide. So hopefully that's helped on both sides.","Operator","Your next question is from Brendan Barnicle with Pacific Crest Securities.","Brendan John Barnicle - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc.","Thanks so much. Keith, I had two quick follow-ups for you. One on Wave, when might you take that more down market? We've heard about a lot of success at the high-end of the market. And then second on the Marketing Cloud, obviously, great momentum there. Is there a point at which you need to have an ecommerce engine that you partner with or build? Increasingly we're hearing that about something that CMOs are looking for in their marketing applications. Thanks.","Keith G. Block - Vice Chairman & President","Yeah, so thanks for the question. Just a couple of comments. I mentioned earlier on Wave how excited we were at Dreamforce and demonstrated some proof points very quickly and we continue to gain momentum in that marketplace. I think one of the things that the Wave team has done just an outstanding job of is to get feedback and that's what great companies do, they listen to their customers and their customers inspire them. And that's what Salesforce is all about.","And so, we have gotten some great feedback on analytics. We are well-positioned in the marketplace. We've got a great ecosystem associated with analytics. We've got more than 80 partners. We've done some great things with Merck and Barclays and Genomic Health, and we'll continue to evolve and augment and enhance the product so that it is far-reaching. So we're excited about the future of Wave and we think it's going to be an incredible product. It's already had a great first year, almost first year, I should say.","We're very proud of our Marketing Cloud performance in the quarter. That cloud is gaining momentum. It has really been an incredible part of our Customer Success Platform. It completes our solution for our customers to transform their businesses as far as how they define their digital strategies and their customer strategies. And so we will continue to see, again, as all innovative companies do, but none like Salesforce, we will continue to innovate our product line and enhance our product line, and there are natural adjacencies that you look to and we'll continue to innovate. That is the DNA and heart and soul of this company. We are all about innovation. So, you'll continue to see great offerings coming out of this place.","Operator","Your next question comes from Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI.","Stewart Kirk Materne III - Evercore ISI","Thanks very much, and congratulations on the quarter. Marc and Keith, I was curious about your comments about Europe. Obviously, you're starting to see some really nice momentum in that region. I assume a lot of that has to (51:25) investments on the data center side. I was curious about sort of your thoughts on is the market over there getting better or are you guys taking share? And I guess in particular around your cloud offerings, are there any solutions in particular that are resonating with customers over there, whether it's the Service Cloud or Marketing Cloud, that's really helping you guys gain some momentum? Thanks.","Marc Russell Benioff - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I think the most important thing that we did in Europe, we did quite a few years ago, which was decide that Europe was extremely important to Salesforce. And we refined our distribution strategy really being focused on seven core countries which we've really just expanded to nine core countries. The idea that we were going to be super-focused in Europe and the UK, France and Germany was a huge reset for us, because ultimately what we're doing is building the UK cloud, the French cloud, the German cloud, and we're paying more attention to these customers inside these countries than ever before. Of course that doesn't mean that we don't do business in other countries, or don't have customers in other countries, but this extraordinary focus in these core countries where the buyers are has paid off in spades for us and it's allowed us to scale distribution, scale service, scale marketing and make sure our products are right for those products in those core mega-markets. That has resulted in numbers in Europe and growth in this company. We haven't seen numbers like this growing like this in Europe in other software companies. That's the power of what's going on.","So I only see more of that. I'm heading back to Europe next week because I am so excited about the European opportunity, and the customers that I met with and spent time in Europe, well, that has escalated. I mean, I'm really not meeting with the CIOs anymore, or the Chief Revenue Officers or Chief Service Officers. When I get over there were meeting mostly with the Chief Executive Officers because they're more committed to delivering their customer capabilities than ever before. Keith, do want to add to that?","Keith G. Block - Vice Chairman & President","Yeah. I would echo what Marc said. We made a conscious decision, as a company, to focus on international growth. We saw Europe as a huge opportunity. The European market has been shackled by legacy technology for decades, quite frankly, and they are screaming for innovation. The CEO dialogue, the agenda of the CEO, is growth. Our message is all about growth and customer success. So there's an alignment here that is fantastic and we're seeing it play out in the marketplace. We have made significant investments and those bets are paying off internationally in all the areas that Marc has mentioned.","So international is a strength area for us for sure. EMEA, in particular, is a great story. We have a great team and all of our senior executives spend plenty of time talking to senior executives in our customer base in Europe.","Stewart Kirk Materne III - Evercore ISI","Okay. Investments on the data center piece (54:38)?","Marc Russell Benioff - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I'd just like to add that, if you go to my Facebook feed or my Twitter feed you'll see I posted a video that summarizes our Q2 results. And I spent the majority of the quarter in Europe. I lived over there. It's the third year in a row that I've done that, and the video covers some of our activities in Europe for the year and the quarter, as well.","Mark J. Hawkins - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Just to chip in one last point. Kirk, you'd asked about market share specifically, I just want to add \u2013 since you asked it, address it directly, we're globally taking market share. It's been a persistent trend in CRM. And Gartner's report just show we took another 200 basis points of market share, so that's exciting and I just wanted to get that out since you asked about it.","Operator","And our final question comes from Philip Winslow with Credit Suisse.","Philip A. Winslow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thanks, guys. Obviously you guys have had a great quarter of billings growth but also balanced that with margin expansion and cash flow. The question here is to Mark and then to Keith, as well. I mean, obviously there's lots of areas that Salesforce can continue to expand and you definitely have a broad vision here. And then if you look at where some of the leverage is coming from it's definitely the sales and marketing line. Sort of how you're balancing for this broad vision and kind of continued growth aspirations with the margin expansion? (56:02) I have one quick-follow to that.","Marc Russell Benioff - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Go ahead (56:08).","Mark J. Hawkins - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","(56:11) just initially, and then perhaps Marc Benioff will chip in as well. But I would say, the way we're balancing that, Phil, is that, clearly we have a huge opportunity as articulated by Marc Benioff. It's an amazing market space and the way we balance it in terms of our different offerings in our company in total is we're a growth company, number one, and we have the revenue margin framework that we look at to try to make sure we're fully taking advantage of really helping our customers in these markets, and helping them be successful. And at the end of the day, we want to also expanded our operating margins in a framework consistent with our revenue growth. And so we try to balance that at the highest level and then obviously it goes down to each of the different clouds. A lot of companies have one single product that they're driving. It's unprecedented to have the number of clouds that we have that are huge, either a billion, multi-billion, so on and so forth and there's a portfolio that people look at. But Marc and Keith, do you want to add more?","Keith G. Block - Vice Chairman & President","Yeah, I think I'll would just follow that up. This is an incredibly successful company that it's just an execution machine with great products and great customers and great innovation and great partners. And as part of being a growth company, we invest in our customers, we invest in innovation, we invest in our employees, and we invest in our partners. And when you are the leader and viewed as the trusted advisors to the most significant and important companies in the world, that's what you do, that's where you place your bets and that's where you innovate and invest in and that's what this company is all about. It's innovation and growth and customer success.","Operator","We have reached our allotted time for questions.

After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.","I will now turn the call over to our host Mr. John Cummings, SVP of Investor Relations. Sir, please go ahead.","John Cummings","Thanks so much, Doris. Good afternoon, everyone and thanks for joining us for our fiscal third quarter 2017 results conference call. Our third quarter results press release, SEC filings, and a replay of today\u2019s call can be found on our IR website at www.salesforce.com\/investor.","With me today on the call is Marc Benioff, Chairman and CEO; Keith Block, Vice Chairman, President, and COO; and Mark Hawkins, CFO.","As a reminder, our commentary today will primarily be in non-GAAP terms. Reconciliations between our GAAP and non-GAAP results and guidance can be found in our earnings press release.","Also, some of our comments today may contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions.

A description of these risks, uncertainties, and assumptions and other factors that could affect our financial results are included in our SEC filings, including our most recent report on Form 10-Q.","So, with that, let me turn the call over to Marc.","Marc Benioff","Hey, thanks John and thanks to everybody for joining us on the call today. We are coming live to you from New Jersey where we have the whole team and we spent the whole week here in New York and having a great time. And it\u2019s been great to be here. We just opened our new Salesforce Tower which is the former MetLife though at Bryant Park, really cool, great new space for customers, partners, employees, love to invite all of you there to see what we are going to do with this incredible new building in New York. And Salesforce Tower New York is open and all the signage is going to be going up over the next six months. We are really thrilled. And we\u2019re in the first floor, it\u2019s really -- I couldn\u2019t be more excited to be here. We are looking forward to having you all visit us there. Okay, let\u2019s get right to it.","You can see from our results, we had an exceptional third quarter. Revenue rose to more than $2.1 billion, up 27% in constant currency from a year ago. You know already, there is no other top 10 software company delivering that 27% number. And what I am really excited about is we expect to deliver more than $10 billion in revenue in fiscal 2018. I think we initiated guidance at $10.15 billion at the high end of our range. And now, we are setting our sights on our next goal, $20 billion. Look, no other software company, no enterprise software company\u2019s delivering this kind of growth at this scale, size, and we are already off to a great start.","Deferred revenue in third quarter grew to $3.5 billion, up 25% in constant currency from a year ago. Dollar value of booked business on, off the balance sheet more than $12 billion, up 27% year-over-year. That\u2019s a great predictor for next year and why we are so aggressive about giving this incredible $10.1 billion to $10.15 billion number now because we have that $12 billion on the balance sheet, this in the deferred. So, let\u2019s talk about this.","We are really well-positioned for the future. Everyone at Dreamforce saw that. We are having an incredible year. We are growing in this mid- to high-20s range and we have scaled from $4 billion three years ago to $8 billion this year. We see tremendous opportunity ahead.","Now, today, we are trusted by a global community of 1 billion customers, consumers, citizens, partners and employees, and that\u2019s a huge responsibility on our shoulders. What we are excited about is serving all these incredible people all over the world with our services. And just look at our new Commerce Clouds supporting 300 million unique shoppers a month. And you saw adidas and I love this story. 10,000 pairs of easy shoes, Kanye West, you did a great job on the shoe in a single hour through the Salesforce Commerce Cloud. Thank you, Kanye, thank you adidas. That\u2019s amazing. And our Marketing Cloud processing 600 million social posts and more than 1 billion messages a day, really, really exciting, and 400 million consumers are using that service. So, you just look at customer facing apps, global Salesforce, Heroku, companies like Macy\u2019s, Toyota, and we are operating at incredible scale and now an incredible level of momentum as well.","Over past several months, I have been spending a lot of time on the road with our customers. I love being with our customers and this week of course was no exception. I\u2019ll tell you what I continue to see is this incredible community that surrounds us and it\u2019s been awesome to experience that. I just went through that. I just did the Dreamforce keynote again yesterday, here in New York and just having all of these customers so excited about our future, understanding this amazing platform that we\u2019ve built, the future and B2B and B2C CRM. And you saw this come to life at our sold out Dreamforce conference in September, which was way beyond our expectations. I know a lot of the conferences this year have not delivered their results, but Dreamforce did; that was awesome. And you saw not just 170,000 people registered and everyone was there and you saw a pack, but more than 15 million joining online. That was a huge surprise for us. And at Dreamforce, you also how we\u2019re continuing to innovate with Lightning, with Einstein, it\u2019s been really, really awesome.","Of course, probably the most exciting announcement at Dreamforce for a lot of our customers has been Salesforce Einstein. We\u2019ve extended our Salesforce platform, not just with this incredible UI with Lightning, not just with this incredible BI layer with Wave, but now we\u2019ve extended our Salesforce platform once again with an AI layer with Einstein and it\u2019s really world\u2019s easiest AI, that is all of these partners, all of these customers are able to easily inherit, all of the most state of the art, artificial intelligence, whether it\u2019s machine, learning machine intelligence, deep right inside the Salesforce platform through Einstein. And we\u2019re extending that Salesforce platform with amazing new capabilities, with new technologies, new talent, new platform, functionality and you saw that again this quarter where we have acquired this incredible DMP Krux extending our Marketing Cloud. And of course everybody knows, if you been around, you see how our whole Company now has 20,000 users on Quip. And of course Facebook has thousands of users on Quip and other incredible companies like electronic arts and many others have thousands of users now on Quip.","And if you don\u2019t have Quip on your phone yet and you haven\u2019t experienced Quip, you should just go to the app store right now and download Quip, it will change your life. I\u2019ll tell you, you can really experience next generation productivity but live, collaborate, documents and spread sheets on our platform, integrated media. It is really cool. And Bret Taylor, Former CTO of Facebook is now with Salesforce and of course the former legendary product manager at Google Maps, he and Kevin Gibbs, co-founder did a just a beautiful job on that.","Anyway, I could go on and on and on about our products and technology and on how exciting this quarter was. But let me turn it over to Keith. And Keith thanks for coming down from Boston and being here for the call.","Keith Block","Thanks, Marc Thanks to everybody for joining the call.","Listen, Q3 was an outstanding quarter. We had excellent execution from the entire team and all of our key geographies and industries. We\u2019re really, really thrilled with the results. We also delivered very strong performance in large deals this quarter. Not only did we close a record number of seven figure plus transactions in Q3, but the value of those transactions grew significantly.","We continue to spend a lot of time with CEOs. And at Dreamforce, our CEO summit brought together some amazing thought leaders, and they\u2019re all looking to drive a new level of innovation in their industries around customer engagement. And they recognize that they need an intelligent, customer engagement platform that will help them stay ahead of rapidly changing customer expectations. Now, this level of dialog and engagement with these CEOs of some of the most incredible companies in the world, they have put their trust in us and that has been reflected in our results.","So for example, this quarter we saw huge strength in financial services, where we signed strategic agreements with seven of the premier financial services institutions in the United States, including Citi and PNC Bank. And we are very, very excited about these stories. So, let me tell you a little bit about PNC. This is a new relationship for Salesforce, and we are hoping them streamline operations across all their primary lines of businesses that they can reimagine the banking experience for nearly 11 million customers. All their retail call centers and branches will now be powered by Salesforce and that will help them respond to customers faster. And they will also use Salesforce to mobilize their corporate and institutional banking team, giving them access to customer information on the go.","Salesforce also signed a strategic agreement with Citi in the quarter. And this is Citi\u2019s global consumer bank that will utilize Salesforce for all client facing personnel in their U.S. retail bank, enabling Citi to better serve clients while lowering costs and improving analytics and efficiency. It really is an incredible vision to transform the global consumer bank with a very highly differentiated customer experience.","We had a landmark win with one of the world\u2019s largest consumer package goods companies who needed a complete CRM and ecommerce platform to help them transform from B2B to a B2C business. Now, I am having a lot of conversations with customers about this particular type of transformation. And this relationship was the result of excellent collaboration between Salesforce and the Commerce Cloud, which grew its comparable customer gross merchandise value by 22% in constant currency from year ago. This is an early sign of the power of our combined businesses and it is creating unmatched value.","Other commerce wins in the quarter included GNC and Shiseido. Amazon is a great in the quarter as well. We formed a strategic relationship in Q1 as you all know and in Q3 that relationship has expanded and may have even more services throughout the Company.","International continues to be an important cornerstone of our growth strategy. In Europe, we had a great win with KONE, one of the world\u2019s largest elevator companies. And just last week I spoke with KONE\u2019s CEO, Henrik Ehrnrooth and his team about our partnership to transform the multibillion dollar field service industry together, very exciting. Their vision is excellent and they are using Salesforce to mobilize more than 20,000 service technicians. With real time customer information and service data from connected equipments, they will be able to provide more proactive service and response to service requests faster than ever.","Telecom Argentina, also new to the Salesforce family, they selected Salesforce to power all their call centers and upgrade the in-store and online experience for more than 25 million customers. We partnered very closely at velocity to show them an integrated solution in their industry and then the testimony of the power of our industry\u2019s strategy coupled with Salesforce\u2019s ecosystem and our ability to work effectively with our partners. It is also proof positive that our ecosystem is absolutely blossoming.","So, it\u2019s pretty clear that our enterprise strategy coupled with our continued operational focus is working, our investments in key industries, our partner ecosystem and our top international regions are paying off, and we are very well-positioned for strong fiscal, the remainder of the fiscal 2017.","So, at this point, I would like to hand the call over to Mark Hawkins and he can share some more detail around our financial highlights for the quarter. Mark?","Mark Hawkins","Thanks, Keith. And I am very pleased with our financial results for the third quarter, let me just say that. Total revenue for the quarter was up 25% in dollars and 27% in constant currency, excluding the year-over-year FX headwind of $32 million. The Commerce Cloud is off to a great start and had an excellent quarter, contributing $49 million to total revenue after adjusting for purchase and accounting. Our dollar attrition for the third quarter, which excludes Marketing Cloud, and other acquired businesses remained below 9%.","Looking at revenue by cloud. Sales Cloud grew 13% year-over-year. Service Cloud grew 26%, App Cloud and other grew 38%. Marketing Cloud grew 46% but then if you exclude approximately $42 million of subscription and support revenue related to Demandware, Marketing Cloud grew 21%. In our region, we delivered another strong quarter of year-over-year constant currency revenue growth in EMEA by growing 27% and Asia Pac by growing 29%.","Now, before I move on to cash flow and deferred revenue, I want to remind you that invoicing seasonality is affecting both of these metrics. As we discussed at the last two analyst days, we continue to see an increase in the seasonality of invoicing, primarily as a result of compounding and to a lesser extent contract returning and a shift toward annual invoicing in Q4. In that context, third quarter cash flow was $154 million, down 5% over last year. Deferred revenue ended the quarter at $3.5 billion, up 23%. Deferred revenue includes approximately $30 million related to our acquisitions of Demandware, up from $23 million in Q2. On a constant currency basis, deferred revenue was up 25% when excluding a year-over-year FX headwind of about $49 million. On a sequential basis, deferred revenue had an FX headwind of $33 million.","In the quarter, approximately 80% of all subscription and support related invoices were issued with annual terms excluding Demandware. The Q3 benefit to deferred revenue from the change in billing frequency was less than 1 percentage point of growth. ","Now, moving on to guidance. I\u2019m pleased to be raising our full year revenue guidance to $8.365 billion to $8.375 billion, despite absorbing approximately $100 million to $150 million of FX headwind this year. This implies year-over-year growth for FY17 of approximately 25%. We expect Demandware and other acquired assets to contribute about 1 to 2 percentage points of growth year-over-year. We are also raising our full year non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance by $0.03 to $0.97 to $0.98. This raise includes $0.01 from operational outperformance and $0.01 from an investment gain in Q3 and $0.01 from an anticipated investment gain in Q4. This guide continues to imply approximately 70 basis points of full year non-GAAP operating margin improvement. We continue to anticipate full year operating cash flow growth of 20% to 21% year-over-year. For Q4, we are initiating guidance of $2.267 billion to $2.277 billion, non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.24 to $0.25, and year-over-year deferred revenue growth of 22% to 23%.","And as you heard from Marc, we\u2019re excited to deliver our first $10 billion revenue milestone next year, as we are initiating fiscal 2018 revenue guidance of $10.1 billion to $10.15 billion. This implies year-over-year growth of approximately 21%. We plan to provide additional details about our outlook for FY18 on our fourth quarter call in February.","To close, we had a strong third quarter and we are well positioned for a great finish to FY17 and this sets us up for another strong 20% plus growth year in FY18. At this time, I\u2019d like to thank all of our nearly 24,000 employees for their dedication to customer success and driving these outstanding results.","And with that we\u2019ll open up the call for questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Brent Thill with UBS.","Brent Thill","In Q2, you noted some U.S. weakness. It looks like in Q3 that came back. I was curious if you could just talk about the performance in the U.S. and Keith you were clear that these deals were delayed not lost, did they come back in the quarter?","Keith Block","Glad to answer that question. So, we did discuss on the last call that at the very end of Q2, we did have some weakness in the United States that was attributed to execution issues. And as I said on the last call, we did a very detailed and very disciplined operational review. We made some minor adjustments to our playbook and some changes down the ranks. And I am very, very pleased with the results. This is a high-performing team, it\u2019s been a very high-performing team for number of years, and they have responded in time. As far as deals, in any given quarter, deals, I mean there is an ebb and flow, some come in, some come out. But I am very, very pleased with the execution in the quarter, particularly around these large seven figure transactions. Again, these brands are absolutely fantastic. You talk about a company like PNC Bank or Citigroup, even Amazon in the quarter, KONE, Telecom Argentina, many of these brands are world-class brands. And our performance was strong globally, across all theaters, all markets, all segments, all industry. So, again, I think it is a quarter of execution and very, very proud of how the team responded.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays.","Raimo Lenschow","Can you -- I want to begin a little bit into the different clouds. Can you speak a little bit, how you saw the performance? Obviously platform was, the Sales Cloud continued to be better with the high value SKUs that you introduce. The Service Cloud moderated a little bit. Can you just kind of frame it, how you see it? And maybe, Keith, question for you here.","Keith Block","Yes. So, again, we are very fortunate, based on the vision of our CEO, who is sitting right here, to have an incredible product in set of clouds that is second to none. Obviously, we\u2019re the market leader in virtually every one of these clouds and super excited about the vision that we put for our customers. And obviously based on these results, our customers are super excited as well. And they serve as the inspiration and motivation for a lot of the vision along with of course with Marc and rest of the team comes up with here. But, I\u2019ll tell you that we are very pleased with our Sales Cloud execution, we are very pleased with our Service Cloud execution. And proof positive around Service Cloud is that example I gave on KONE. This is a best in class service oriented company, even though they are industrial manufacturer. And they look to us to help them transform their business around field service, because this is a way for them to differentiate their products. Service is very strategic in their future. And it\u2019s just one example of how companies are looking at a Service Cloud.","Our platform continues, our ISV strategy is very, very strong, our execution around ISVs has been very strong, which speaks to how strong the platform is. We look at Marketing Cloud as a very strong product. We look at some of these acquisitions that we\u2019ve made, the Commerce Cloud. We had a very large global CPG company and very, very recognizable brand. And that deal happened because Commerce Cloud onto itself was very compelling, but when combined with our core products, made us even more compelling to envision for that particular company. So, we love our product strategy, we love our vision, our customers obviously love our vision. This is only reinforced at Dreamforce, which was just an incredible event this year and we say it every year, but it was just incredible event.","And then when you start adding things like Einstein into the mix which really is about the future, it\u2019s just becomes more and more compelling. So, we definitely have the wins at are back in our sales and we\u2019re super excited about the execution in our vision for our customers.","Marc Benioff","And Keith, I just want to add to that, and I\u2019m sure everybody realizes, especially people who were at Dreamforce, this is a balanced portfolio. And we have really a balanced portfolio and what\u2019s great about that is, of course we\u2019ve talked about having a balanced portfolio geographically, we have a balanced portfolio in regard to our small and medium business, as well as our enterprise business, we also have balanced portfolio when it comes to our products. And you can see that in the numbers. Of course, Sales Cloud is one of the largest products in our industry, not just CRM but in the software industry. And to it growing at 13%, I mean, I just think that is incredible to see that reacceleration. And it\u2019s pretty awesome. And I am really excited about that. Again, we service at 29%, we saw App Cloud and other 43%, marketing 28%. But what I really focus on is that we have a balanced portfolio of offerings because as the Salesforce kind of gets different levels of comfort and by geography and by market segment, we see that shift quarter-to-quarter. But like a portfolio manager in a big institution, it\u2019s big financial institution, and they\u2019re keeping a balanced portfolio, so are we. And through that balanced portfolio, that\u2019s how we\u2019re achieving these high performance results.","Keith Block","In fact, Marc, I just would like to add on to that. I really see that when you look at the entire balance portfolio Marc and you look at the growth rate that we\u2019re putting out, which nobody is doing in our industry at this size and scale, what it translates in is this whole market share thing, Marc where we gain market share, we gained 150 basis points at last report and we just continue to watch our competitors fall behind in this respect. And then lastly Marc, to your point on portfolio, 27% growth in the Americas, 27% growth in constant currency in Europe and 29% growth in constant currency in Asia Pac. Marc, I think that underscores portfolio point.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Kash Rangan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Kash Rangan","One question for both Marks. Marc Benioff, with respect to Einstein, when is the product going to be in GA and how are you as a company going to be gearing the sales organization go-to-market strategy around Einstein? And then one for Mark Hawkins. I want to actually finish up the first question before.","Marc Benioff","I think when you look at things like Einstein, you look at kind of these incredible directions, the shifts that are going on and technology, from a customer perspective, and we had an opportunity to meet with all the largest banks here in New York this week. Customer service, sales, marketing, these things -- it\u2019s going to have an incredible shift. And that is really what is just surprising to me. I don\u2019t think -- when you look back, we started this company 17, 18 years ago. And where we are now, I mean, this was unexpected. And from a technical perspective, and I went through some of those things, but whether it\u2019s our UI -- the demos that I did with customers today were entirely on my phone that was -- I\u2019ve given CEOs of Fortune 100 companies, hey, I run my whole business on my phone that surprises a lot of people. And to see the amount of information and insights that you can get from that is just incredible; and not just the UI, but business intelligence as well, I have Wave running on my phone. Mark Hawkins has Wave running on his. We both gave a Fortune 10 CEO a demo on our phones, and they just couldn\u2019t believe that.","And then, I\u2019ll tell you that it\u2019s now this -- AI, artificial intelligence where everything is getting just smarter and is helping all these users to actually point the direction of success. They know where to go. That is what is so cool. And of course, we\u2019re complementing that with the speed of our platform, with this unbelievable mobility, with this productivity from Quip. I think I talked about that earlier but that\u2019s a huge game changer for our customers. This is really awesome and they see it as the integrated platform that our Company -- our customer can execute against is very motivating for them. And I think that that\u2019s really cool. And of course Einstein is a huge part of it and you\u2019re going to see Einstein of course deeply integrated in everything that we do. And customers get that Einstein is different than other AI solutions.","I\u2019ve met with all the tech CEOs of course, the cloud CEOs, and they all have AI. It\u2019s table stakes AI. AI is table stakes, you all know that; everybody has got it programmatically; we\u2019ve got the best AI, no, we\u2019ve got the best AI, we\u2019ve got -- okay, fine; but have declaratively, through our platform, because we need to bring it to millions of people, not just a few -- there\u2019s only 15 million programmers in the world. We\u2019re much bigger than that. We have to bring this to people who don\u2019t code or low coders or citizen developers, need to have the power of our artificial intelligence, they need the power of mobility; that\u2019s why Salesforce platform is exciting and that our core app -- cloud like sales and service are built on it; that is a huge differentiator for us and it\u2019s -- you can see it just in our win rates and also our competitive position has never been stronger.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citi.","Walter Pritchard","Mark Hawkins, I guess I\u2019m wondering if you could talk a bit about the synergies that you\u2019re starting to see or if you\u2019re starting to see synergies out of Demandware principally from a revenue perspective. And I\u2019m curious, in your Q4 guidance if you\u2019ve embedded anything additional to what you were maybe thinking three to six months ago?","Keith Block","Let me just jump on that and anybody else can add in if they\u2019d like. We\u2019re so pleased with Demandware; we\u2019re so pleased to have this asset. It rounds us out, it\u2019s a unique asset\u2026","Marc Benioff","That was just good fortune.","Keith Block","Oh, my gosh Marc...","Marc Benioff","I mean Keith you agree, don\u2019t you?","Keith Block","Yes...","Marc Benioff","We can\u2019t believe it. First of all, Keith was having a company in Boston. So, [Multiple Speakers]","Keith Block","He\u2019s got a big smile on his face, but Walter, I appreciate the question because\u2026","Marc Benioff","Are you wearing the easy shoes [Multiple Speakers]","Walter Pritchard","I\u2019m going to go get them right now, Marc. [Multiple Speakers]","Keith Block","But, Walter, I think what\u2019s interesting about this is we put out in the stub period announcement $49 million in revenue. And of course you know that it was haircut by about a third. We snapped this in and we talk about execution. Everybody has been on it. We have a great team that\u2019s been joining us. They\u2019re working in with our broader company and we\u2019re starting to see the momentum pick up. And Marc alluded to that in some of the activities but we see lots and lots of opportunity. And from a synergy standpoint, we have a plan, we can\u2019t go into a great detail on all of that about where we\u2019re going take this long-term including as you\u2019d expect Walter, lifting the company and synergies and really leveraging some of the best practices of Salesforce and some of the best practices of Demandware. So, watch this frame to come but the overall performance, I love what I see.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley.","Keith Weiss","One of the areas that we\u2019re seeing really nice acceleration in over the past couple of quarters has been the application platform. Anything in particular that\u2019s kicking in gear there, is it the SIs building, helping to build applications on it, is Wave starting to be a more material contributor? Can you give us any incremental color on what\u2019s really working there? And then mainly on the flip side, wondering there has been decelerating in marketing cloud. And one of the things we are hearing all about it\u2019s in the marketplace is increasing competition potentially from the alignment of Microsoft and Adobe. Is that having any of an impact on Marketing Cloud given any pressure on that business and causing the slowdown there?","Marc Benioff","Well, I mean I think number one, when you look at Microsoft, we sold more CRM software this quarter than Microsoft has sold in last decade. It\u2019s just empirical. And that is what is really awesome about our performance against Microsoft. And I\u2019ll tell you also, when you look at marketing cloud, I really look at that against we have so many undeliverable products, I just -- Keith knows I feel this way, and I\u2019m going to ask Keith to come in. I really feel we\u2019re distribution constraint. We have so much products, we are in so many amazing markets whether it\u2019s sales, service, marketing, communities, analytics, application development like you talk App Cloud, whether it\u2019s commerce, whether it\u2019s IoT, whether it\u2019s productivity with Quip. And the Salesforce is going to have that full portfolio of products and they are going to move back in forth against those. And we\u2019ve seen that. Look at our results over the last five years and you are going to see that constant up and down of those clouds based on that distribution organization performance. But, Keith, you are the absolute leader of the distribution organization and you probably have unique perspective on this.","Keith Block","Look, I think the bottom line is that we have an abundance of riches [ph] particularly as it relates to our product portfolio. And if I look at our field organization and the value preposition and the solutions that they can put in front of a customer, whether it\u2019s a line of business executive whether it\u2019s from an industry perspective, it is incredibly compelling. And that is really manifesting itself from these results. So, I would echo with Marc\u2019s sentiment about what people have to carry in their bag and what they can put in front of customers. I also want to go back to the part of the question around the platform and why we\u2019re seeing such great results in the platform. There is a bunch of reasons for this.","And let me start with the systems integrator. I think as everybody knows, we have really emphasized the importance of having an incredible partner ecosystem and particularly over the last 3.5 years. And that has just paid dividends when you are talking about the largest SIs of the boutiques. And we still have work to do there but the team has really done a fantastic job there. But those SIs are really recognizing the value of the platform and what it can bring to their client. So that\u2019s one point I would raise.","The second point that I would raise is that initially when we sell our position of products with customer, like Sales Cloud or Service Cloud, customers are overwhelmed by how incredible it is but then they realize that the power of the platform extending sales and extending service and that just lends itself to more usage adoption and utilization of the platform product. And then, finally back to my partner comment, we have had a huge emphasis on ISVs and the growth of the ISVs and making sure that we reinvigorate our app exchange. But particularly around our industry ISVs, we are seeing tremendous success. And why is that? Number one, they love our platform, they see all the capabilities, they see all the potential and they want to build mission critical applications on top of that platform. So, we do have a lot of great products in the portfolio that our sales team can deliver and our service teams can provide service to and our partners can deploy. But we also have an incredible platform and that is a lot of the secret sauce that we have in the company.","Mark Hawkins","Keith, I love your comment of abundance of products, abundance of riches [ph] in that way, just adding Heroku, even on the B2C side and it\u2019s been added to all the things that you talked about. And then one of the things I see with customers is this whole notion of using force.com. And I would like to self brand and they add-on using force.com which is really need that they can do?","Marc Benioff","And Keith, I think you also have to really hit on some of these specific relationships, you have the world\u2019s top SIs, you\u2019ve built phenomenal practices, heading toward $1 billion practices which is incredible for them with these unbelievable service organizations. And you and I had meetings with CEOs of these top SIs who are at other user conferences this quarter, we are not going to mention any names because the CEOs are very sensitive in this industry. But this bigger sides go into these other conferences and they say where is the energy, where is the momentum, where is the growth, where is the innovation and they are pivoting back to us. And that\u2019s exciting to us, because we can bring a large systems integrator and we have talked -- and by the way standardized on us internally, companies like Deloitte, Accenture and so many others who are building these incredible fast growing practices. And customers are paying attention to that as well. Is that right?","Keith Block","Yes, these SIs, critical part of our strategy, these SIs are in the boardroom along with us and they are key influencers. In fact Marc, you and I have presented to a quite a few with their boards. Now, I don\u2019t believe that Microsoft or SAP or Oracle are being asked to present in the boards of these incredible SIs. So, it\u2019s a big part of our strategy. If you look at their growth and their practices, I mean they are exploding. And they can\u2019t get enough talent. So, they are cannibalizing the legacy practices of the companies that I mentioned earlier.","Marc Benioff","So, why is that Keith, why do we have so much CEO and board level attention compared to like when we sold it, Oracle -- I never made a call to a CEO or board member. I don\u2019t know how many of those you made; you were there probably longer than I was. But just put it in perspective.","Keith Block","I thinks it\u2019s very simple, these companies, these CEOs have an agenda of growth. Our story is about growth, they are imperative is about growth. And we are uniquely qualified as a company with this product portfolio and quite frankly our culture is an example of how to grow.","Marc Benioff","Right, because we\u2019re a double digit grower and all these other software companies are just single digit growers, and they can\u2019t break out of that.","Keith Block","Yes, it\u2019s really\u2026","Marc Benioff","And this is what these customers want; they want to be double growers.","Keith Block","That\u2019s exactly right. And we have the product portfolio and the vision to help them do that.","Mark Hawkins","I am smiling, Marc. I was looking at Keith, we were in Dallas, I won\u2019t mention the name. One of the biggest SIs that you talked about in the world, talking about standardizing on Salesforce. And Keith, you remember that discussion and just that all came to be and it\u2019s great to see that not only partnering with us but using.","Keith Block","Yes, I mean just to that point and both of you guys have mentioned this, it\u2019s one thing to build a practice but when you also bet on your business, because you are running Salesforce to run your business. I think that speaks volumes, and all the major players do.","Operator","Our next question is from a line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs.","Heather Bellini","Hey. This question is for Marc Benioff. Marc, it wasn\u2019t long ago that you set a $10 billion target and obviously, you\u2019re going to achieve that next year based on your guidance. It does seem like you have a very good crystal ball versus others. And I guess, I am just wondering, if you were to fast forward to Salesforce hitting your new goal of $20 billion, what do you think would\u2019ve been the biggest drivers if you were to look back, which products do you think would be giving you or driving the most incremental revenue, if you had to guess? And how would you think about the margin trajectory of the Company as you surpassed that feat?","Marc Benioff","Well, I really appreciate that, Heather. And I\u2019ll tell you that I really think that in my core, I think that I\u2019ll get back to my comment about that balance portfolio in our platform. It\u2019s unique, Heather, about our capability, and you know this is that we have an integrated platform. And the integrated platform is exciting, because not only is the number one Sales Cloud in the world, not only is the number one Service Cloud in the world, not only is it the number one declarative platform, but it has all of these other capabilities, mobility and AI and so forth, analytics and so forth. And so, I think that when I look at the most incredible things that our customers have done, they weave these things together in really smart and creative ways, build these, they build these apps, they deploy these things internally and they look for speed. They\u2019re looking for speed. Of course they want productivity, of course they want intelligence, of course they want mobility, they want that core platform. And that because I think we built it right and of course we\u2019ve also bought some great things that are outside of our core that we\u2019re integrating into our core like our marketing cloud, like our commerce cloud, like Quip. But with Lightning that\u2019s an incredible UI layer that no one has ever seen anything like this componentized application development UI layer, it\u2019s almost like a visual ETL.","These customers are now integrating this stuff together at the UI layer and of course at the data layer, but that is what I think is going to really drive us forward. I think it\u2019s going to be our platform. And I think that when you look out, and obviously we have short-term goals around that $20 billion number, I mean you have -- I am sure you have your own model of when you think we\u2019re going to hit it. But I think that for us, we want to make sure that -- I don\u2019t know exactly when we\u2019re going to double the company by, but my dream certainly is to double this -- I would just tell you, my dream is to double this Company within the next three to four years for sure. That\u2019s really important to me.","Amy Weaver is here who works directly for me as my General Counsel, and she doesn\u2019t want me to go any far. Amy, do you want to comment on that.","Amy Weaver","Not at all, Marc.","Marc Benioff","Anything you want to say?","Amy Weaver","No, I think you\u2019ve said.","Marc Benioff","I think so. But obviously, we have -- we\u2019re performance oriented and we\u2019ve got a great team, we have great culture, you know that. We have a great brand reputation with our customers. We also have a transparent -- a level of transparency with you, the financial analysts and media that cover us, when you come to Dreamforce, you\u2019re untethered. We want you to go and talk to and be with our customers. And you can feel the vibe. And you know you can come to all of our events. I am going be back. In three weeks, I am going to be in Tokyo. So, please come and see, for those of you who still have not come to Japan. You really should come and see something incredible in Tokyo that we have in three weeks. And then for those of you who don\u2019t want to go Tokyo in three weeks, we\u2019re going to back here in New York for a multi-thousand person event, which is our world tour. So, that\u2019s so exciting. The world tour, Tokyo and San Francisco are on the same day for all the types of purposes. So, you\u2019re going to see a lot of market momentum this quarter as well as Keith you\u2019ve got the fourth quarter coming up, are you ready?","Keith Block","Oh, I\u2019m ready Marc. Don\u2019t worry.","Marc Benioff","You are working out, aren\u2019t you? [Multiple Speakers]","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Tom Roderick with Stifel.","Tom Roderick","Keith, a question for you; you made a comment that your big CPG win was driven by a customer whose desire was I think to shift from B2B more to B2C. So, can you talk a little bit more about that deal in particular and are you seeing other customers trying to make that shift? Also with your portfolio now, with Demandware and ExactTarget fully integrated, is that something they\u2019re coming to you and asking particularly for your help? Just talk a little bit more about that transition with your customer set out there.","Keith Block","I love this question. So, listen, we live in a world where -- and Marc talked about this, where speed, mobility and productivity, innovation, intelligence are paramount. This has become table stakes. If you want to be part of the next wave of great companies, and if you think about the classic business problems that any consumer package goods company has right now is they have to have a connection with that end consumer. Many times they go through a retailer or distributor or whether it\u2019s a classic industrial company or whether it\u2019s a consumer package goods company like a Unilever, they want that direct connection to the consumer. So, moving that shift, keeping the B2B relationships but also establishing a new model of B2C is very critical to their future. I mean, think about -- we live in this world, we call the age of the customer. And think about cloud, mobile, social, data science, IoT, analytics and artificial intelligence, all coming together, new companies have born overnight. Barriers to entry into markets are being brought down.","And if you\u2019re not thinking about the future and how you\u2019re going to engage with your customer, whether you\u2019re a B2B company or a B2C customer, you\u2019re going to be in trouble. So, this is becoming a regular dialog and even more meaningful for us at Salesforce because of the Commerce Cloud. So, this is just another part of our portfolio that really helps to complete the package around these transformations. So, it is becoming a regular part of the conversation and that particular win that I mentioned earlier. This is one of the world\u2019s greatest CPG companies in many regards and it is exactly about moving from B2B to B2C.","Operator","Our next question is from line of Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank.","Karl Keirstead","This question is for Marc Benioff or Keith Block. I know forecasting deal timing is awfully tough but you\u2019ve been generally pretty bullish about the fourth quarter. And I\u2019m curious if you\u2019ve got any different confidence level about those deals in the pipeline dropping in the fourth quarter. And I know it\u2019s very early but based on your recent customer conversations, I\u2019m just wondering if the business uncertainty is stemming from recent political events, might have any bearing good or bad on the timing of large enterprise deals closing this quarter?","Marc Benioff","Okay. I think Keith and I both want to talk about that. I think there\u2019s a couple of things going on that are very important. And I want to make a few different comments. Number one, you all know that in the second quarter, we experienced bifurcated headwind which was not just in foreign exchange which came out of Brexit and the Great British pound which we\u2019ve continued to kind of suffer all year, that is our numbers would be even more incredible if we didn\u2019t -- right Mark? What have separated for foreign exchange this year?","Mark Hawkins","For FY17 Marc, we had to absorb between a 100 million and 150 million headwind. [Multiple Speakers]","Marc Benioff","So, number one, in that second quarter, we have this with the Brexit and the Great British pound situation and then at the very tail end of the second quarter as we discussed, we saw a little bit of weakness. And to Keith\u2019s credit, and he said this, but I think it\u2019s a very subtle. So, I think it\u2019s worth amplifying. He made a number of changes. We made a number of changes I think that really let us perform well in the third quarter because we did see the market shift a little bit in the second quarter, we told everybody that. And it\u2019s not the first time that we\u2019ve seen that in our careers. Keith and I have been through -- have been to this road even before and the selling motion had to change. I think in companies that you\u2019ve seen report in the last month or so who kind of saw or seen in that kind of market shift, they also will change in the coming quarters their selling motion because the selling motion has had to change in fiscal year 2017. We changed you can see the results incredible even with this foreign exchange headwind. So that\u2019s number one. ","Number two, in regards to specifically to our fourth quarter, we don\u2019t talk about this specifically but one of the reasons that we do have confidence around the fourth quarter is a certain percentage of that revenues is kind of contracts we have already signed that is we know we are going to get bookings in the fourth quarter because we have signed these agreements. And so that is coming in. And so that gives us a leg up. And then Keith has an incredible focus through the sales organization, which is as you centrally half of our Company is in sales, customer facing and that customer facing organization, which is I think the best in the world, all wants to have a great fourth quarter. And they are focused and we have made these cool adjustments.","So, do you want to jus amplify any of that or augment or highlight any of that because I actually think there is a lot to learn. You and I have been coaching CEOs on how to kind of survive some of the ebb and flow because I think that we both have a lot of confidence that we\u2019re going to see a lot of exciting things happen.","Keith Block","I think, there is a number of things going on here. I mean, we all know the story of the second quarter, I don\u2019t think we need to talk about that but at the last earnings call we said that we had a high degree of confidence in our Q3. And obviously we delivered the goods and we said we also had high degree of confidence in Q4 and we did make those adjustments. I do think that we -- I\u2019ll echo Marc\u2019s comments; I think that we do have the best distribution organization in the world in certainly in this industry. But it also allows us to talk to our customers about the things that they can do and adjust the way that they think about their customers and how they can sell to their customers and service to their customers and market to their customers. ","Marc Benioff","We\u2019re not abstracted from our customers, we are with these people every moment.","Keith Block","We are and this is what\u2026","Marc Benioff","We\u2019re living with them.","Keith Block","We live with them and this is what we do.","Marc Benioff","And I\u2019ll tell you the other thing is and in regards to the election, I think is really important. Look, some of us many not have had the outcome that we want, some of us have the outcome we did want. In my view, it\u2019s in the past. We\u2019re moving forward and we have, at Salesforce, an open heart, we have an open mind and we also expect the best. That\u2019s what we\u2019re positive. And we talk about that in everything we do. We\u2019ve talked about how we cultivated beginners mind. You\u2019ve heard us talk about, well, it\u2019s not just in regards to running our business but even when there is an election, things have change -- yes, everything is changing but we have a beginners mind and we have a sense of optimism for the future and we\u2019re going to cultivate that optimism and we \u2018re going to manifest it into our business because that is how we operate here. We are positive people. And we are moving forward. And I have talked to now a number of customers this week, and I have met with CEOs of some of largest companies in the world this week. And in each and every case, all of them are moving forward, okay? And that is -- we all have our -- we know what we have to do and we know how to execute. So, I hope as I said the 2008 is behind us, okay? I\u2019ve said this before.","I have been optimistic about 2017 on growth. I have been counter to a lot of the global economists and I am going still continue to feel positive about growth in the coming years because I really hope that 2008 tail that we\u2019re finally through it. And now that this election is also behind us and I hope absolutely for the best now for everything going forward, this is what I want in. Mark and Keith are here with us in the room here and you guys weigh in here on this.","Mark Hawkins","Thank you. I\u2019d love to add on that. Because when we talk about that market, that looking forward and the view and the tail that you talked about, and Keith hit something really key building on this confidence in Q4 Keith that you talked about. But one of the things that we have chatted about and I think it\u2019s good to share on the call is when we execute the Q4, we are going to exit with a $9 billion rough run rate in terms of revenue run rate. So, we are not only achieving our plan but we are actually going to exit with a run rate of $9 billion. It\u2019s going to position us in the guidance you heard for next year is going to be $10.15 billion at the high end. So that\u2019s another really big milestone. But Marc, this guidance for the year with a confidence you have talked about also implies two other milestones we have never hit in the history of the company; one is that in this FY17, our guidance implies $1 billion plus operating margin non-GAAP milestone. This is something we have aspired to, and that\u2019s going to achieve with this particular guidance for this year, Marc. And the last thing we are going to achieve is another milestone we have never ever done which is $2 billion plus on the operating cash flow. So these are things Marc that I think quantitatively are milestone to support this idea. Keith, I don\u2019t know if you have a comment.","Keith Block","Yes. Look, I think the results speak for themselves. There is a lot of dialog out there. Marc mentioned about the tail from 2008, the presidential election. Looking at the end of the day, at Salesforce, our story is about growth, our message is about growth, our products and vision inspire growth, what CEO does not like growth? And I think that says it all. So, I think we are well positioned\u2026","Marc Benioff","This is best for our employees\u2026","Keith Block","Absolutely.","Marc Benioff","Our customers, for our partners, for shareholders and for our community and all the organizations that we support, we want that, we want the best for everybody.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Abhey Lamba - Mizuho Securities.","Abhey Lamba","Keith, can you please discuss deal dynamics as you are seeing very strong growth in annual contract value from existing customers? Is it coming from greater penetration of various clouds, more seats or pricing or any color on what -- if you\u2019re seeing accelerated pace of adoption of multiple clouds?","Keith Block","Yes. Thank you for the question. So, go back to what Marc said about a balanced portfolio and that is really what this is all about. Each of our individual clouds are best in class and together it\u2019s even more powerful, and this is a balanced portfolio. And we are out there selling solutions to real business problems and opportunities for these customers. So, it\u2019s a very balanced portfolio, it\u2019s installed base selling, it\u2019s net new customers, I mentioned a few of these who are new customers to us, company like PNC is a brand new logo and it\u2019s a pretty good brand new logo. So, we\u2019re super excited about it. So, it\u2019s just great execution with an excellent platform for customers with our consolidate selling or net new logos and positioning the solutions for growth.","Operator","Our last question is from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI.","Kirk Materne","Thanks very much for fitting me in. Keith, you mentioned a couple times in the presentation just the breadth of your portfolio now. But you not only have a broad portfolio but you guys have been verticalizing your go to market motion at the same time. So, can you just talk to us about how differentiated it is to be able to, not only take a broad product portfolio, but also shape it in a way that you can talk about how customer service transformation differs in the financial services industry versus the telecommunications industry? To me that seems like a massive moat that\u2019s very difficult to get over, and I know you guys have been working on it for a couple years. And to me that seem to be one of the reasons maybe these bigger deals are happening at a faster cadence today versus one to two years ago.","Keith Block","As you know, this is one of our core strategies that we\u2019ve trying to put in place over the last 3.5 years. It\u2019s really to speak the language of the customer and go to market by industry and make sure our messaging and our products and entire portfolio is really in many ways taking this incredible platform of products and portfolio of products and reorient them to solve the specific customer problem. In this particular quarter, we\u2019re seeing something in Q3 around financial services where again the seven of these premier financial services institutions decided to go with Salesforce as they think about their transformation. One of these deals was with a premier wealth management company. And they are going wall to wall with our financial services cloud, which is one of our first vertical products that we have ever had in the Company. And [indiscernible] since March, but this firm is going to wall to wall and that\u2019s because we are targeting a specific problem area in a specific industry. I mean you think about the Telecom Argentina solution that we partnered as part of our ecosystem, with this company like velocity, And this is transformational for the telecommunications industry. It\u2019s a huge win for both of us. And this is probably not the same sort of outcome that we would have gone, if we had not had something that was industry specific. So, whether it\u2019s the PNC story or the Citigroup story or the wealth management story that I referenced, the Telecom Argentina. We are in very early days here, whether it\u2019s organically with our products, with financial services cloud may help or whether it\u2019s with our partner ecosystem. But this is really a hand in glove strategy with our partners, our SIs, our ISVs, the way that we\u2019ve organized our field teams around going to market.","And at the end of the day, all comes back to the platform because everything is built on that platform and leverages the strength of that platform. So, again I think that is the secret sauce. But this vertical and industry strategy is certainly playing off in terms of the level that we call on in the account, these are all very much CEO level sales, the mind share and market share and wallet share that we\u2019re getting as a result of speaking the language of the customer. So, we\u2019ve got some momentum here and we\u2019re excited about it.","Marc Benioff","We are excited and we are going to tell you some more details about our strategy and our plans for the future, because we\u2019re right here in New Jersey at CNBC headquarters and we\u2019re about to walk into the studio with Jim Cramer. So, if you turn on CNBC, you\u2019re going to see us coming and talk to Jim.","Marc Benioff","Thanks everybody.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions].","Mr. John Cummings, you may begin your conference.","John Cummings","Thank you, Erica, thanks so much. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us for our fiscal first quarter 2019 results conference call. Our results press release and SEC filings, including our Form 8-K which contains re-casted financial information under new accounting standards ASC 606 and ASC 340-40 and a replay of today's call can be found on our IR Web site at www.salesforce.com\/investor.","With me on the call today is Marc Benioff, Chairman and CEO; Keith Block, Vice Chairman, President and COO; Mark Hawkins, President and CFO; and Bret Taylor, President and Chief Product Officer.","As a reminder, our commentary today will primarily be in non-GAAP terms. Reconciliations between our GAAP and non-GAAP results and guidance can be found in our earnings press release. Additionally, our commentary and our guidance today are under accounting standards, ASC 606, ASC 340-40 and ASC 2016-01, all of which we adopted in the first quarter.","Some of our comments today may contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Should any of these materialize or should our assumptions proved to be incorrect, actual company results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements. A description of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions and other factors that could affect our financial results are included in our SEC filings, including our most recent report on Form 10-Q.","With that, let me turn the call over to you, Marc.","Marc Benioff","Well, thank you so much, John. And thank you to everyone on today\u2019s call for being here with us. And look, as you\u2019ll recall fiscal 2018 was a record year for Salesforce and Q4 was our best quarter ever. In fact, the most recent Fortune 500 ranking, Salesforce has moved up nearly 200 positions over last two years and based on last year's revenue, we\u2019re now the 285th largest company in United States. And we\u2019re thrilled that our phenomenal momentum continued right now in the first quarter of fiscal year \u201919.","Revenue for the quarter rose to more than $3 billion, up 25%, putting us on $12 billion revenue run rate that was just amazing. And we now have $20.4 billion of future revenues under contract, which is the remaining transaction price, that\u2019s up 36% from a year ago. Based on these strong results, we\u2019re raising our full year top line revenue guidance to $13.125 billion at the high end of our range, 25% growth for this year.","And just as we\u2019ll be fastest enterprise software company to reach $13 billion, we\u2019re well on our way to surpassing the $20 billion revenue goal faster than any other enterprise software company in history. With another quarter of amazing growth, we\u2019ve strengthened our position as the world's leading CRM Company. Earlier this month IDC named Salesforce the number one CRM provider for the fifth consecutive year. In fact, according to IDC, we increased our CRM market share in 2017 by more percentage points than the rest of the top 20 CRM vendors combined. We\u2019re the number one in sales, number one in service, number one in marketing, and we have the number one CRM platform.","We continue to be the fastest growing of all the top five enterprise software companies. And these incredible results are because of our relentless focus on customer success. In fact, I\u2019ve just returned from a series of meetings with customers around the world. I was in Tokyo, Minneapolis, Chicago, New York, I was in Washington DC. And I\u2019ll tell you, everywhere I go, every CEO wants to talk about digital transformation, which begins and ends with the customer. Only Salesforce can deliver a highly personalized engaged B2B and B2C customer experiences, powered by the world's number one CRM customer success platform, across sales, across service, across marketing, commerce, communities, analytics and even application development through our platform. Only Salesforce is giving customers an intelligent 360 degree view of their customer.","And this month, we closed our acquisition of MuleSoft, giving us the industry\u2019s leading integration platform as well. Well, integration has never been more strategic. So many of the CEOs I spoke with told me that data remains locked in their legacy systems, and is holding them back. With MuleSoft, we\u2019re now enabling our customers to connect all of their data across any public or private cloud, and on-premise, to radically enhance innovation and create incredible customer experiences. So we couldn\u2019t be more excited to welcome MuleSoft to Salesforce. And just this morning, Forbes named Salesforce again one of the world\u2019s most innovative companies for the eighth year in a row. Since Forbes started listing in 2011, Salesforce was placed in the top three every single year.","In fact, our innovation in artificial intelligence is delivering incredible value to our customers. Salesforce Einstein now delivers nearly 2 billion predictions every day, and that's a doubling of our daily predictions just last quarter. This is the most strategic technology for our customers. How are we growing so consistently quarter-after-quarter, as I've described before, it's about staying true to our values, including customer success and innovation. But our number one value at Salesforce is trust, earning and keeping the trust of our stakeholders, our employees, our customers, our partners, our shareholders and all of our communities. That's why I called for a national privacy law to protect the personal data of American consumers, and to help restore trust in the tech industry similar to what's happening in Europe with GDPR.","In closing, as I've pointed out before, CRM is the fastest growing enterprise software category. It's a massive $120 billion market opportunity and we are determined to continue leading the way for our customers and for their success. And we're keeping our eye focused on the future after record world tours in New York, Washington DC, Amsterdam, Toronto, London, and Paris. We're looking forward to welcoming 10,000 attendees to Connections in Chicago in two weeks. I hope you all attend. It will be the digital marketing, commerce and customer success event of the year.","And as I said before, we're well on our way to surpassing $20 billion in revenue and doing it faster than any other enterprise software company in the history you can see that in the numbers from this quarter, the trajectory is clear. Anybody who sees the numbers and these financial results could see it's going to happen and we could not be more excited. So we're incredibly proud of another quarter of remarkable growth. Of course, none of this would be possible without the partnership and dedication of all of our stakeholders, especially our 30,000 Salesforce employees, the world's largest team dedicated to CRM, thank you. Thank you. Thank you to all of our Ohana. We're number one in CRM because our employees, our customers are number one, and to all of them and to all of our Ohana again, I say thank you.","And with that, I'll hand it over to Keith.","Keith Block","Thanks Marc. Good afternoon, everybody. As Marc said, we're off to a fast start to the year and we're taking share through our relentless focus on the customer. We continue to grow internationally and expand across industries and leverage our partners on this drive towards $20 billion and beyond. Our momentum from Q4 carried over into Q1, and we signed several significant deals in the quarter, including the largest transaction in the Company's history. And we delivered outstanding performance across all of our clouds.","Sales Cloud grew at 16%, 33% faster than the market, a clear indicator of our strength of our core business, and we are taking share. Service Cloud grew 29% in the quarter as creating connected customer experiences to become a priority for every company all over the world. Field Service Lightning is a key part of that growth. In fact, one of the world's largest food and beverage companies selected Field Service Lightning for retail execution to boost employee productivity and improve customer experiences. Retail execution is the life-blood of consumer packaged goods companies.","Marketing and Commerce grew 41%. In Q1, we strengthened our relationship with Citi, which is rolling out marketing cloud across their business in Asia. And we also continue to see incredible momentum with Commerce Cloud as more and more customers select our platform as part of their broader engagement with Salesforce. We had notable expansions with another leading athletic apparel maker, who is enhancing and expanding their direct-to-consumer business. We also deepened our relationships with one of the largest luxury groups in the world who is transforming their retail experience with Commerce Cloud.","And finally, our Lighting Platform grew 36% as customers continue to build intelligent, connected apps fast with Lightning App Builder and Heroku, and leverage the power of Einstein. In fact, one of the largest media and entertainment companies in the world is using Einstein Analytics to get deeper business insights and build more personalized customer experiences.","Now, we not only delivered strong growth across our clouds but across all of our key regions. EMEA grew 31% in constant currency, fueled by expanding relationships with brands like Philips and Santander UK as our international investments continue to pay off. In May, we opened our first European innovation center at Salesforce tower in London, and announced plans to expand our datacenter capacity in the UK to support our growing customers in the region. APAC grew 30% in constant currency, driven by remarkable growth in Japan where we strengthened our relationships with SoftBank and luxury e-commerce site LUXA.","In Asia, we also expanded with Cathay Pacific Airways and Lazada, the leading ecommerce player in Southeast Asia. Our ability to speak the language of customers is deepening our relationships with the most important companies in the world, and you can see that in our results. In Financial Services, we expanded with Manulife in Canada and formed a new relationship with Investors Bank. And we continue to see incredible momentum with Financial Services Cloud. In Q1, we had a significant expansion with a Fortune 50 financial services firm that is clearly vetting their digital transformation on us, and is now one of our largest customers.","The public sector continues to be a huge opportunity for us as well. We had our most significant public sector win ever with U.S. Department of Agriculture, and they are using service cloud to transform how they engage with constituents across the country. We also deepened our relationship with one of the largest federal agencies in the United States, and they\u2019re deploying Service Cloud and Einstein Analytics to improve the services they provide to millions of Americans every single day.","Our strong ecosystem is helping us gain lion share and drive success for our customers as well. In Q1, partners help generate 59% of new business, and we\u2019re involved in 75% of our largest deals. And Salesforce continues to be the growth lever for our partners. In fact, the top five global FIs increased their Salesforce practices by more than 70% year-over-year. In Q1 alone, Bluewolf, an IBM Company, increased the number of certified consultants by more than 200%, a huge indication of demand. We\u2019re also seeing tremendous momentum in our driving ISV community, which grew 52% year-over-year.","Now, let me give you a quick update on our most recent acquisitions. First, every company launched that delivered the same buying experience to businesses that they provide to consumers. And to capture this opportunity, we acquired long time partner CloudCraze, a leading B2B ecommerce platform, similar to our acquisition of SteelBrick and CloudCraze both natively on the Salesforce platform. So we\u2019re up to a good start on that integration.","Second, as Marc said, unlocking data is critical to accelerating our customer\u2019s digital transformation. Just last week, I was with a CEO of a major corporation and has data trapped in disparate legacy systems, it is a huge barrier to innovation. But through acquisition of MuleSoft, Salesforce now provides one of the world\u2019s leading platforms for building application networks that connects enterprise apps, data and devices across any cloud on-premise whether they connect with Salesforce or not. And that integration is going extremely well.","We have received in overwhelmingly positive response for our customers and those who\u2019ve been incorporated MuleSoft into global strategic events, including world tours and Dreamforce, this has been highly successful thus far. And we\u2019ll continue to invest further MuleSoft\u2019s distribution capacity and R&D to build innovative products that enable our customers\u2019 success. So to close, I want to thank our customers, our partners, our employees, for their continued trust in us and for very, very special start to the year.","Now, I would like to turn the call over to Mark Hawkins, who will discuss our financial execution and updates to our accounting standards. Mark?","Mark Hawkins","Great. Thanks, Keith. Before discussing the results, I want to remind everyone that the results were released today are under the new accounting standards ASC 606, ASC 340-40 and ASC 2016-01. Additionally with our release today, we provided re-casted financial results under the full retrospective method for the full year of fiscal 2017, fiscal 2018 and each quarter of fiscal 2018 under ASC 606 and ASC 340-40. With that, let me turn to the first quarter results.","First quarter revenues grew 25% in dollars and 22% in constant currency, reflecting continued strength in the demand environment, strong organic growth and keeping us on pace to achieve the FY22 target of $21 billion to $23 billion, including MuleSoft. Now, the dollar attrition exited the first quarter below 10%, it was down a bit from Q1 of last year. First quarter GAAP EPS was $0.46 compared with the breakeven last year, and non-GAAP EPS was $0.74, up 155% over the last year.","Mark-to-market accounting for our strategic investment portfolio as required by ASC 2016-01 benefitted GAAP EPS by approximately $0.25 and non-GAAP EPS by approximately $0.22 in the first quarter. We had a record quarter of operating cash flow, delivering $1.47 billion in the first quarter, up 19% over year-over-year. And I'm very pleased with this result, especially coming up our strong collections and cash flow quarter in Q4 of last year. Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less CapEx, was $1.34 billion in the first quarter, up 25% over last year.","Turning to the balance sheet. As a result of the new accounting standards, we now report unearned revenue in place of deferred revenue. And as you know, the new revenue standard has us recognizing certain revenues sooner than under prior standards. And therefore, reduces unearned revenue at a faster rate than historical deferred revenue. This causes our unearned balance to be lower than our historically reported differed revenue.","Unearned revenue ended the quarter at $6.2 billion, up 25% in dollars and 23% in constant currency. As we've always said, deferred revenue was an imperfect growth predictor as it was impacted by a number of factors, including invoicing timing and billing terms. To provide more transparency and a better indication of our future revenues, we are providing a new disclosure called, remaining transaction price, which represents all future revenues that are under the contract. Essentially, our prior billed and unbilled deferred revenue. This balance is broken down into the amounts we expected to recognize as revenue in the next 12 months or current our remaining transaction price, and the amount we expect to recognize as revenue beyond 12 months, which we\u2019re calling non-current remaining transaction price.","At the end of the first quarter, our total remaining transaction price was $20.4 billion, up 36% over last year. And the current remaining transaction price was $9.6 billion, up 26% year-over-year. Now, keep in mind this balance is not impacted by invoicing terms unlike deferred revenue was. We believe that this metric will be a better indicator of our future revenue than unearned or differed revenue.","Before turning to guidance, let me take a minute to discuss MuleSoft's accounting practices going forward. During the transaction close process, we made the decision to conform MuleSoft's revenue recognition policy to Salesforce's policy under the new accounting standard ASC 606. Through this process, it was determined that a portion of the revenue related to on-premise implementations will be recognized as license revenue going forward. As we will be providing MuleSoft results separately for the remainder of the year, this license revenue will be included in our subscription and support line for FY19 and will be recognized upfront upon delivery.","Moving onto guidance. With our strong first quarter results giving us a fast start to the full year, we\u2019re raising our full year 2019 revenue guidance to $13.075 billion to $13.125 billion for 24% to 25% year-over-year growth. The guidance includes approximately $315 million from our acquisition of MuleSoft, which closed on May 2nd.","Turning to operating margin. With the close of the MuleSoft acquisition, we now expect our year-over-year non-GAAP operating margin improvement to be flat to plus 25 basis points. This guidance includes approximately 125 basis points headwind from MuleSoft. We are updating our FY19 GAAP diluted EPS guidance to $0.49 to $0.51, and our non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance to $2.29 to $2.31. Keep in mind that that guidance does not take into account the possible future impact from mark-to-market adjustments related to ASC 2016-01, which may cause EPS volatility based on the market conditions.","We now expect full-year 2019 operating cash flow of 14% to 15% year-over-year for an operating cash flow yield of approximately 24%. This guidance includes a headwind of approximately $150 million related to the MuleSoft acquisition. For Q2, we\u2019re expecting revenues of $3.22 billion to $3.23 billion, GAAP loss per share of minus $0.09 to minus $0.08, and a non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.46 to $0.47.","As I mentioned previously, we believe the current remaining transaction price provides you a better looking metric than unearned revenue. However, given the limited historical remaining transaction price data, we're going to provide incremental transparency by temporarily providing guidance for unearned revenue for the remainder of this year. In context, we expect year-over-year unearned revenue growth of 22% to 23% in Q2, excluding MuleSoft. Once we have full year comparables numbers, we will expect to stop providing unearned revenue guidance.","To close, we delivered a strong first quarter that positioned us well for another year of durable growth. I\u2019d like to thank our customers, our partners, our employees, and our shareholders for your continued support.","And with that, we\u2019ll open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Phil Winslow with Wells Fargo.","Phil Winslow","Congrats on a great start to the year and a particular shout out to Hawkins for the awesome 606 data historically, super helpful. A question for Marc B on MuleSoft, I mean obviously, nobody knows CRM data better than salesforce.com. But wondering if you could talk about Einstein and MuleSoft, and that in the AI context, because obviously you\u2019re delivering already 2 billion predictions? How do you think MuleSoft, or how do you see MuleSoft, augmenting that? And what kind of uptick you think you\u2019ll see their insight customers?","Marc Benioff","Well, as we go deeper into our vision with so many of our customers, the key thing that we are focused on is their single view of their customer. We just talked about so many of our key wins in the quarter. I mean, it could be carrying with their reprocessing incredible brands like Gucci, or Bottega or Yves Saint Laurent, the UFDA and their relationship with their farmers and ranchers, it could be the work that we\u2019re doing with the [Align] [ph], giving their orthodontist the ability to connect with their consumers in a whole new way, or it could be the incredible work that you\u2019re seeing with Adidas.","In each and every case, they\u2019re working to understand and have a 360 degree view of their customer. And the power of that is really augmented by our suite of CRM applications that do that for them. Things like our sales, commerce, service, communities, analytics, our core platform, collaboration, marketing and exactly what you said, by adding integration in that, it helps us bring in data from multiple public clouds, because many of our customers are now using multiple public clouds and\/or they might be, let's say for example, the healthcare company seeking data from the healthcare system itself like an insurance system, or maybe some other type of key databank associated with the healthcare industry, integration is mission-critical for our customers to gain that 360 degree view of their customer.","Now, we\u2019ve always known that at Salesforce, that's why we built up an open system. And that\u2019s why we\u2019ve had an application program interface. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve had an AppExchange. That's why we focused on ISVs and had relationships with companies like MuleSoft. But it has become more important for our customers to be able to have and rely on an integration cloud. This idea of deeply embedded inside our products, they can rely on this technology to be able to integrate all the key data so they can build that single view of the customer.","And we have Bret Taylor here who is our President and Chief Product Officer. And Bret, do you want to just touch on that and your -- I know you\u2019ve been traveling the country and talking to hundreds of our customers about their vision for integration. Can you tap that for us?","Bret Taylor","Yes, sure. When we talk to our customers, they talk about three main priorities as it relates to integration. They want to create customer experiences that transcend individual customer touch points. They want to integrate sales, service, and marketing into a single seamless customer experience. They want to make sure that they have multiple acquisitions and multiple regulatory climates, because they exist across international borders that they can accomplish that with our platform. And they want to unlock the data from other legacy systems, and bring it into these customer systems. So they can do these transformations around their customers.","And about the point you\u2019re asking about Einstein is very insightful. They know that their AI is only as powerful as data it has access to. And so when you think of MuleSoft think unlocking data. The data is trapped in all these isolated systems on-premises, private cloud, public cloud, and MuleSoft they can unlock this data and make it available to Einstein and make a smarter customer facing system. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re hoping to achieve with MuleSoft.","And I think the thing you heard from Marc that I\u2019ve heard over and over again from customers is that integration is a strategic priority for our customers, because without it they can't move fast enough on their customer facing systems. So we\u2019d like to say it unlocks the clock speed of innovation, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re really seeing from our customers. And I hope we\u2019ll accelerate our ambitions with Einstein.","Marc Benioff","And Bret I just want to ask before we go on. When we look at this next generation of intelligence, obviously, Salesforce has done it a little bit differently than other companies, because we've taken a consistent artificial intelligence platform, Einstein, and we've now allowed all of our applications to flow through that. So whether it's our Commerce Cloud our Sales Cloud, or our Service Cloud, they're all augmented now through Einstein. And I guess one of the major results that I'm so proud of your team, and our engineering teams, is 2 billion predictions a day. Where do you see that going?","Bret Taylor","Well, I think the reason why Einstein has gotten so much adoption, so much traction is because it\u2019s simple to use. The power of the Salesforce platform is you just turn it on. And with things like our Commerce Cloud, you can do very simple things with Einstein to sort the products differently in your product listings, and you'll drive more GMV and drive more transactions, because of the better customer experience showing better products to the right people at the right time.","Every single one of our cloud benefits from Einstein in this way. And by making it easy to adopt and easy to use, our customers are actually seeing the value of AI without hiring a legion of data scientists, and that's really the promise of Einstein and really our philosophy behind building AI for CRM is our ability to make it easy for our customers to use and adopt, and benefit from this revolution we're seeing in AI.","Marc Benioff","So what you're saying is just by turning on Einstein our Commerce Cloud customers for example, have seen some incredible increase, what is it 15% or 20% in revenue, just by turning on artificial intelligence the ability for that AI to start working with consumers who are using those Commerce Cloud Services?","Bret Taylor","That's absolutely right. I mean, we see one of the biggest barriers for our customers in adopting AI is just how challenging it is to understand and use. And we view the value of Einstein and the value of integrating it deeply into our platform is that ease of turning it on and actually seeing the impact on your business immediately. And that's what we aspired to achieve with Einstein.","Marc Benioff","It's not a programmatic interface -- I mean, it is programmatic it can be, but it's really declarative. It\u2019s easy to just get going. Okay, great. Thanks so much.","Operator","And your next question comes from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs.","Mark Grant","Mark Grant here on for Heather, just a quick one for me. You saw some acceleration in Service Cloud growth in the quarter. Can you give us a sense of how those conversations are going with customers, specifically around that cloud? And maybe an update on the appetite you're seeing in the market for some of those larger transformative multi-cloud deals?","Keith Block","This is, Keith, let me try to address this. So generally speaking, if you think about how companies differentiate themselves, they do it on service and they do it specifically around the consumer experience. And so that's why we're seeing quite an uptick in our Service Cloud business. Now, also another piece of that is Field Service Lightning. So we see an incredible amount of demand for Field Service Lightning. Again, because customer are taking advantage of these amazing technologies to drive and gather insights around what their customers are doing.","Service Cloud reached about $3.4 billion run-rate in Q1, that's more than double the market, which is pretty amazing. And as Marc has indicated in his early comments, we're number one in the market and we continue to take share in a very, very strategic market for us and our customers. So that differentiation by service is very, very strategic for these customers, many times service is at the core of our all their digital transformations, which obviously peaks the interest of the CEOs that we're having these conversations with. And it's not just service it's all of our other core products that rotate around service that allows to drive these transformations, and that's where you see these very, very large multi-cloud deals that I talked about earlier.","Marc Benioff","Keith, I want to ask you a question about -- in the quarter, you closed one of our largest transactions ever, and also just an incredible transaction with a very large insurance company. And one of the things about working with that company is you\u2019re really building a complete family of applications around the customer, like I mentioned. That is, they\u2019re using just one cloud, right? They\u2019re really looking to us to bring together the entire customer experience. And we see that, I mean, insurance is a great example of an industry where we\u2019ve seen incredible transformation across all different types of insurance, and globally too, not just here in the United States, but in Japan and Europe, et cetera. How is that idea that we\u2019re able to come in with a complete customer experience differentiate you in the marketplace?","Keith Block","I mean, first of all, their blown away when these data capabilities that we have. I was with, just a couple of weeks ago, with the CEO of one of the largest insurance companies in the world. And we\u2019re having a conversation about changing their business model and transformation around how their agents could be more productive, how they can retire all these legacy systems, so that they have a single unified view of the customer, how they can leverage Einstein for artificial intelligence and insights, issues around locking or unlocking the legacy data from their legacy systems. And all of these things together, we\u2019re the only company and the industry that can provide solutions as it relates to that 360 degree holy grail of the customer. And that\u2019s why -- I mean, insurance is obviously a sweet spot for us but all financial services there is sweet spot for us. And that\u2019s why we\u2019re having so much momentum in that industry.","Mark Grant","So you\u2019re able to put together many different types of solutions to offer to that customer then that 360 customer view?","Keith Block","That\u2019s exactly right.","Operator","And your next question comes from Brad Zelnick with Credit Suisse.","Brad Zelnick","I have a question for Marc B on the Marketing Cloud, which obviously had a great quarter in Q1. But one of your competitors in the space is now adding commerce functionality by way of an acquisition, which I think as many investors comparing the different strategies in the market. And if we look out in the future when Salesforce is 20 billion plus in-size and then reflect back and how you got there. How of the battle will have been won in B2C versus B2B, and do you think you need to be deeper in content management to get there?","Marc Benioff","I think that as we\u2019ve expand our vision of what the customer experiences and where the market is going, of course, we\u2019ve inspired other competitors to think about the future as well. And that\u2019s our job too is to create followers, and we\u2019ve seen a lot of other companies, smaller companies like the one you\u2019re talking, really try to look at where they\u2019re going in the future. And I think that that\u2019s great, because of course we want a competitive environment. So our approach is really different, because we really see every B2B company and every B2C company becoming a B2B to C company, and I see that over and over and over. Again I mean, I gave a great example of Adidas.","So I think you know -- when you look at a huge commerce story, like Adidas, of course, when there is new shoe like the Yeezy 350 is launching, we have to go to provide that tremendous customer experience with highly differentiated for Adidas on our Commerce Cloud. But of course that\u2019s not the only cloud that Adidas is using with us, because they need to build to provide many different types of services to their customers. And that\u2019s really where we\u2019re going to build to jump in and offer them great success.","But of course with an example of a company like that, you\u2019re going to find that maybe only 20% of their revenue is in that B2C commerce experience. Many of those companies, 80% of their revenues then complicated in the B2B commerce experience this is why one of the most exciting acquisitions that we did in the quarter was a relatively small company that have been built natively on our platform called CloudCraze, because it really all of a sudden extended us in not just B2C commerce but B2B commerce as well. And I don\u2019t think anybody can really touch the tremendous success we've had since acquire and demand where it's been an awesome journey in just a couple years. But it's really because we've provided that complete experience around the customer.","Now when you think about that, there is three major components to that. There is the system of record of course, which is where Salesforce started. And I would say that we probably have the strongest system of record experience in the industry. Then there is the system of engagement itself, whether it's internal users or externally. Again, we have such tremendous capability whether it's a Heroku or communities, or even our commerce. And three is the system of intelligence, Bret touched on it with Einstein with AI. But even look at our advanced analytics capabilities that we now bring to bear, no one else can provide that experience.","Now, we\u2019re not a close solution, we're going to work with every company, of course we have to, because our customers have many different types of solutions in their companies, and so we're going to do that. But when you look at some of these core areas, like the customer experience; the ability to provide enablement, like you've seen with our Trailhead capabilities; the ability to have that deep engagement, like I just mention, the level of intelligence; and now integration having the number one integration cloud in the world; it really helps when we walk in to our customer and say look, we\u2019re the number one sales cloud in the world; the number one service cloud in the world; we\u2019re the number one marketing cloud in the world according to IDC; and we've done all that in a flash of an eye.","And I think that that's why you can see a very fast line. I mean, you guys were all tremendous financial analyst. You can put the numbers together and figure out when we're going to get to $20 billion. We think that we're going to get there as faster than we could have imagined. And that's why we're so excited about our business. And then we're going on by the way. This is not -- this is I think the most exciting ever in our industry. I've never seen customers more excited about investing, especially in their digital transformation and their customer transformation. And we're well positioned as the number one CRM provider in the world. I hope that answers your question.","Operator","And your next question comes from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley.","Keith Weiss","A question press for Bret and maybe one for Mr. Hawkins as well. I was wondering if we could get an update on the product strategy around MuleSoft, now that's disclosed. I guess, maybe some time frames on when we should see the integration cloud, the Salesforce.com integration cloud rolling out. The product plans for the course of the existing MuleSoft platform that they have. And then maybe one for Mr. Hawkins, any plans on expense reduction, or any expense synergies you plan to get out of the MuleSoft platform as you do the integration with Salesforce.com?","Bret Taylor","So to start to talk about our integration cloud and MuleSoft, our focus right now is bringing MuleSoft to in the Company and making sure that were consulting with every single one of our customers and every single one of our engagements about their integration strategy. Just helping them knowing that every digital transformation starts and ends with the customer, how can we help them set up an application network and unlock this data to transform their customer experience, is not starting now.","MuleSoft has just incredible customers success, and so we're looking to accelerate that with our amazing distribution team, all the deep customer relationships we've had. And really attaching to the strategy that Keith\u2019s team has around speaking language of our customer and talking through the lens of healthcare, through the lens of finance and really helping people realize and transform their customer experience, you need to unlock the data from every system at your company. We\u2019ll be adding to that over the course of connections and Dreamforce with out-of-the-box solutions for across our cloud built on MuleSoft and built on the integration cloud over the course of the year.","Mark Hawkins","Thanks Keith on that point, a couple of things here. One is that, as called out, we know that as per normal protocol, we\u2019ll have the headwind in the current year in FY19 do to things such as deal costs, integration costs, purchase accounting and the entire deal write down. We\u2019re taking all that on board within the guide. And then of course we\u2019re going to invest to accelerate the success of this to really help drive the reality of helping our customer do all the things that customer wants in their success. So we\u2019ll make the appropriate investment.","The key point to your question is yes, we will be driving appropriate progress and synergy over time after we get through the -- bring them on board get them integrated and plugged-in, much like we did with ExactTarget and Demandware. And when you look back and see what the effect was and you see -- you fast forward a little bit, these both penciled out very, very nicely. We pick up gains across where we need and this will be part of the picture where we continue to expand profit, while we grow as well. So you should expect that over the longer term, yes.","Operator","And your next question comes from Walter Pritchard with Citi.","Walter Pritchard","Question for Keith Block, just on large deals. It sounds like this Q1 maybe it was stronger from a large deal perspective, and it\u2019s not usually a quarter with that as a driver. Could you help us understand, are you seeing an uptick in large deals generally that you expect to sustain this year and what's driving that?","Keith Block","So obviously, we have this terrific fiscal year last year, we had this amazing Q4 that momentum, has absolutely carried into Q1. I\u2019d say that is a little bit different than the typical Q1. And we are very, very pleased with all these transactions and these relationships that we\u2019ve expanded and created in the quarter. Again, I just think it's an indication of our position in the marketplace what our customers are looking for and our ability to answer the bell for those customers, and paint a vision around the 360 degree view of their customers. And that is just become more and more important with these amazing technologies.","This notion of the 360 degree view of the customer is the holy-grail and we\u2019ve been talking about it for a very, very long time. And as I said earlier, we\u2019re really the only CRM platform that can deliver on that promise to our customers. So the new wave of digital transformation is all about the customer, everything starts and begins, and ends at the customer. So we\u2019re just in a tremendous position and we have very, very strong execution, and that\u2019s why you\u2019re seeing these results.","Walter Pritchard","And then for Mark Hawkins, just curious on the MuleSoft contribution to Q2, or the year. Any possibility giving us that just so we can calibrate our modeling?","Mark Hawkins","Walter, I think a couple of things you should think about. For the revenue -- top line revenue of $315 million, additive Q2 through Q4, that\u2019s on top of a powerful core growth where you can see we did an organic raise separate from that so $315 million at the top. And again as per expectoration, we\u2019ll have the 125 basis points impact on our operating margin would otherwise be. We\u2019re fully taking that on board with all the deal costs, purchase accounting, a lot of those types of things that you would expect and positioning it for the years ahead. We\u2019re pleased with this, especially post close. I think we like what we see. So that would be the effect there.","On the cash flow side, Walter, we would expect about $150 million impact on the headwind, on the cash flow. Again, putting it together, you think about our core cash flow, absolutely on track with a very attractive cash flow margin. Even with this temporary impact of some of the more transitional issues you would expect with an M&A integration and deal cost and such, we still have an operating margin yield of roughly 24%. So those will be the attributes that will impact us this year, and we look forward to having this also continue to progress much like ExactTarget and Demandware.","Operator","And your next question comes from Adam Holt with MoffettNathanson.","Adam Holt","Just a follow-up on Walter\u2019s question, first for Mark. Could you maybe narrow that commentary around Mule for the second quarter specifically, that was very helpful for the year. But just for the second quarter? And then secondly, for maybe Marc Benioff or Keith. You had another really good quarter on the platform side standalone, 35% growth, now you\u2019re layering in Mule and we\u2019re doing much more big deals. Could we talk -- why don\u2019t you just talk us through the synergies and symbiotic relationships between the larger customer relationships when it might be more integration, more middleware, more what have you have and the business, because it seem like you\u2019re doing so well, both at the standalone and now that you layer in Mule. Thank you.","Mark Hawkins","Adam, I guess a couple of things here. One is that we\u2019re pretty much giving you the attributes for the full year. We haven\u2019t broken it down to guide every single quarter on that side of it. So just to let you know think about the full picture of the year is the view that we\u2019re taking. That would be what I would say there. And I\u2019ll just leave it at that.","Marc Benioff","And I\u2019ll just fill in for you on -- I think that when we, walk-in I was in Europe last week and I was with the CEO of a very large life insurance company. And they\u2019re a very large service cloud customer. And he actually has the service cloud running at his desk and we were going through that. And turned out he is also a very large MuleSoft customer as well. And it expands our relationship with that customer, and it makes us much more strategic with them. And then at that point, my ability to consult with that customer is really around, okay, now let\u2019s look at each one of your policyholders and your ability to have 360 degree vision with them. And that goes everything from their internal systems and their policy management systems, to even their capabilities that they have in other public clouds that they\u2019re using.","We\u2019re going to wrap all of those things with all of our customer capabilities, because what he is mostly focused on is what are his customer relationships and how is he driving those customer relationships forward. And that ability to have that conversation, well, it just gets extended each and every year. I mean, I was even able to start to talk to that CEO about enablement, that we have this tremendous platform, called Trailhead, where we\u2019re giving this opportunity to enable so many of our customers. And now giving that platform to them as well, the ability for them to enable their employees and their customers, it becomes a very critical part of our story. And gives our customers the ability to realize that we are strategic part of their future, and we\u2019re going to help them become more successful than ever through that fully integrated complete CRM platform.","Bret Taylor","One thing I might add on to just one tack on here thing that might help you, Adam, is that one attribute that might help you in Q2 is just to know that when we guided UR, we guided it off of our core which excluded the MuleSoft. And the one thing you should think about is that we think about URs adding for MuleSoft, $75 million to $100 million. So that might be useful to you as one other attribute that might be helpful.","Operator","And your next question comes from Kash Rangan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Kash Rangan","When you look at these mega transactions that's happened in Q1, can you talk about what the pipeline for these mega transactions looks like? Is it from existing customers that had a longest period of run time with Salesforce.com? And this largest deal that you did today, if I heard it right, can you talk -- you've not already spoken about that customer. Can you give us a little bit more color on the deployment what exactly are they looking to achieve, and how much of a driver of digital transformation. I want to wrap it up, but Mark Hawkins. Previously when you announced Q4 results, you gave guidance for deferred revenue growth rate of 23%. Can you -- if you were to recap the unearned reported in Q1 in the light of deferred revenue growth rate, what would did that have looked like? Thank you so much.","Marc Benioff","Mark, why don't you take that last part?","Mark Hawkins","Sure, let me take the last part. Thank you Kash on all accounts here. First thing that I would say here is when you look at our UR, you look at a growth rate of 25%. And again, as described in UR, it's basically DR less the cumulative effect of revenue pull forwards related to the ASC-606 revenue implementation. So by definition, UR, in this particular case, is less than DR. And so one of the things that you could see is when you look our growth rate on an apples-to-apples basis growing 25% adjusted for this accounting change, that's obviously a number that we're happy with. And so in that respect, just look at the growth rate of UR that we're actually reporting compared to the DR apples-to-apples growth rate that we\u2019 re guiding, and we\u2019re actually pleased with the outcome.","Keith Block","Kash, this is Keith, just to answer the first part of your question. We're looking at this market that we've created and we're really driving. And if you go out to 2021, this is a $120 billion plus marketplace. And if you look at every category in that market, whether it's sales or service or marketing or commerce or platform or analytics, et cetera, we are vastly outstripping the market in terms of growth. Again, whether it's sales or service or marketing, in some cases nearly 3 times the pace of the market. So why is that? Well, number one, it starts with the fact that we\u2019re one of the world's most innovative companies. Number two is that with all this amazing technology, again these CEOs are looking for transformation opportunities around the customer, which is the new frontier.","And we're basically the market leader and the only one that can provide the 360 degree view of the customer and the insights associated with that. So we have become and continue to become very, very strategic to these customers. And lastly they trust us. They trust our brand. They trust our platform. They trust our partner. And as they think about their future and the future relationships that they want to have with our customers, they're turning to us. And that's why you're seeing these very, very large deals.","Now, I would love to tell you that we wake up every day and we need a new customer and we sign one of these large deals. But the reality is that we work very, very hard. The team is doing incredible job of establishing that trust, speaking languages of customer, having a global scale and thinking a vision for the future. And that's why you see these large deals. They really represent the customers\u2019 endorsement and trust of us to bring them into the future.","Operator","And your next question comes from Mark Murphy with JP Morgan.","Mark Murphy","Thank you, congratulations. Question for Marc Benioff. Where do you stand philosophically on positioning as 100% pure cloud architecture versus being open minded, which you seem to be acute, crossing over into the edge of the hybrid cloud once in a while if it make sense. And I\u2019m asking in the context of MuleSoft and your future plans for it, because MuleSoft seem to succeed by offering a mix of cloud and on-prem deployments. And I\u2019m just wondering, is that going to be the exception to the rule? Or do you think that your infrastructure layer would actually increasingly have more of a hybrid cloud feel to it?","Marc Benioff","I think that\u2019s a great question and -- yes, MuleSoft, because of the nature of MuleSoft and the nature of integration itself and the ability to do complex integration, which is what MuleSoft is really excellent at and building tremendous integration layer, we call a bus across the enterprise, the ability to have an application interface to that bus, the ability to accelerate innovation, the ability to build the mobile apps or other kind of capabilities, while unifying all these services to provide this 360 degree customer, this is what MuleSoft excels at. I mean, we think it\u2019s absolutely the best in category, and that\u2019s what our customers have said. Of course, we\u2019ve been involved with the company almost from its very start where we were very early investors in the company, and carried it all the way through to IPO.","And it has an architecture where it runs partly on-premise. And that\u2019s one of the reason it's able to do everything that it can do from an integration layer. From Salesforce\u2019s core platform, we\u2019re still 100% public cloud. I don\u2019t see that changing. There's going to be little instances here and there, especially when we acquire a company like MuleSoft or maybe other things in the future. I think that we\u2019ve talked about, we begin and end our day at Salesforce with a beginners mind, and what the Japanese call shoshin, the idea, that look, we\u2019re not attached to any kind of religious dogma around the cloud. We\u2019re going to do what\u2019s best for our customers and what\u2019s best for our company. And in the case of MuleSoft, I think it very much reflects that vision, that idea that we\u2019re going to be able to deliver the best integration cloud. Bret, how do you see this?","Bret Taylor","I think, MuleSoft is interesting, because the power of integration, as you can integrate every system, every device and every user you want to reach, every customer. And that means you have to go wherever your systems are, on-prem, on mobile devices, everywhere. So we are extremely committed to the neutrality of the MuleSoft platform. When I say neutrality, it means it connects every system, whether or not the system is related to Salesforce, because that\u2019s the power of integration. And we want to unlock data from every system and bring all of that data to wherever your customers are, on every device. And so I think MuleSoft is special in that respect, because that\u2019s the power of integration.","And as Marc said, from technology standpoint, we\u2019re committed to the cloud, because it means we can deliver innovation to the customers faster, three times a year, consistently since the company was founded. And we think that\u2019s the power of the cloud. But as you'll see what MuleSoft is, if our customers need us to have different architectures to unlock innovation, we'll go there. And I think you're seeing that with integration. And then we\u2019ll continue to have that beginners' mind, which I think is vital for innovation. But we're committed to the cloud, we're committed to that piece of innovation delivery, which is really the reason why we\u2019ve seen so many customers recommit to us over the years, it's because, they know they are just getting the product through us today, but the products that we\u2019ll be delivering over the coming years.","Marc Benioff","And I think you can see that also in how we deliver our product. Of course, we have many first party datacenters where we have our own proprietary datacenter and capability. But in other cases, we've partnered with great companies like Amazon, like Google and IBM, in many cases at the customers\u2019 request, to be able to deliver an alternative delivery experience. And so if you\u2019re using Salesforce in Canada for example, you're using that on the back of AWS, and there is so many other examples of what we're doing with different type of cloud deployments. And it's really driven by what our customers want for flexibility. And the ability to have great relationships with great alliances with companies like Amazon, or with Google and with IBM, give us even more capability to deliver this, kind of, what I would say, highly flexible execution environment for the customer.","Operator","And your last question comes from Alex Zukin with Piper Jaffray.","Alex Zukin","Marc, maybe two quick one\u2019s for you, you mentioned GDPR and you mentioned the push for data privacy law domestically. I wanted to ask what impacts, if any, have you seen or anticipated on your marketing cloud business? And then maybe bigger picture then as we think about the move from systems of record to systems and intelligence. How are you positioning the Company as a system of automation for customers as well?","Marc Benioff","Well, I think it's a great question. And as we head towards Dreamforce and as we head towards -- if you don\u2019t have it on your calendar, it's the week of September 24th here in San Francisco, it feels like we are just at Dreamforce. But Dreamforce is approaching very fast, and you should all plan coming back to San Francisco for our biggest and best Dreamforce ever.","I think about how does that look for customers, and things are changing and some of that has been induced by our industry, where for the first six months I think that in many aspects of our industry, we\u2019ve been going through a crisis of trust. And where the headlines in many of the newspapers have been about vendors who are having trust issues with their customers, we saw that a little bit last year in San Francisco and this year we've seen it again.","I think from the European perspective the way they look at data is data belongs to you, it's your data. Now for us at Salesforce, we understand that. We've had that position from the beginning. Our customers\u2019 data belongs to them, it's their data. I think in some cases, the companies that are start-ups and next generation technologies here in San Francisco, they think that data is theirs. I think the Europeans with GDPR have really flipped the coin, especially in advertising but in another areas saying hey, this data belongs to the consumer or to the customers, you guys have to pivot back to the consumer, you have to pivot back to the customer. We need a national privacy law here in the United States that probably looks a lot like GDPR.","This is going to help our industry. It's going to set the guardrails around trust, around safety. It's going to provide the ability for the customers to interact with great next generation technologies in a safe way. I think that this is going to accelerate with artificial intelligence. We saw that recently with an AI demonstration from our industry where average customers could not tell, were they\u2019re interacting with a computer or were they interacting with a human being, that starts to cross the line on what is trust. And that's where our industry really has to come forward and say we're going to make sure that these technologies are trust-based. And I think the Europeans definitely got that figured out. And I think the rest of the regulators in the world are looking strongly at that.","When it comes to the advertising industry and companies that serve the advertising industry exclusively, honestly, while I think that that advertising is a model that will continue to be successful and digital advertising, well, I think that the idea that you need to build a one-on-one relationship with your customer, something that we've been saying now for almost 20 years, is probably more true than ever. Because ultimately your ability to have success with your customer will be able to sell or service, or market to them, or conduct with them in a one-on-one way based on the system of record that you have with that customer.","Salesforce is a system of record oriented company, that\u2019s where we started. And then we evolved in the system of engagement. We evolved in the system of intelligence. And in many of way, we\u2019re becoming a system of systems, which I think will show you at Dreamforce. But at the end of the day, where we see the world going is, we have -- we're providing to our customers the ability for them to have that unique customer experience. To say that you\u2019re going to have this fully anonymized relationship with your customer, and if that\u2019s the future, I\u2019m really not buying into that. I know Bret you used to travel both worlds. Where do you think is going?","Bret Taylor","I think the thing that I\u2019ve noticed from the industry is the confluence of the controversy is driving a lot of technology companies and Silicon Valley recently with GDPRs making trust really the number one topic for a lot of our customers with us. And you\u2019ve heard us talk a lot about trust in the context of our customers\u2019 trust in our platforms. We also want our platform to be a mechanism that our customers can use to engender trust with their consumer and with their customers.","As you are a multinational right now, you're dealing with different regulatory frameworks in different regions. And one of the strengths of our platform is to be able to not only have maybe in personalized marketing and commerce experience with your consumers, but do so in a trusted way. They can handle all the different regulatory permutations that you deal with on a daily basis as a multinational company. And when you think of the strength of having one platform for your system of records for your customers, I think it's really the rapidly changing regulatory landscape and the rapidly changing expectation of consumers, is really striking our position with our customers right now, because it\u2019s so challenging for any company to navigate.","And I think that really comes with -- that really amplify the value of proposition of Salesforce, because you can build these systems of engagement and systems of record in a way that actually follow consumer trust, and follows the evolving regulatory landscape. So I think it\u2019s really trending to something that we are really trying to lean into, and really lean into the value of trust is our number one value.","Marc Benioff","Amy, you\u2019ve done so much work with GDPR and you\u2019re helping so many of our customers around the world implement GDPR. And of course, Saleforce has now become a system that is allowing our customers implement GDPR. Where do you see this going from a legal and privacy point of view?","Amy Weaver","I think this is really a critical point for the U.S. with privacy law. We\u2019re seeing the global conversion around the important of privacy. And it\u2019s going to be important for the U.S. to be a leader now, and not just a follower. I think you\u2019re tracing that we really have to focus on as a country. One is insisting that organizations are transparent about the data practices that\u2019s what's collected, how it\u2019s used, who it\u2019s been shared with. The second is giving individuals more rights to control about their personal data. As Marc said, it starts with individuals, their privacy and their right. And then the third that\u2019s holding organizations is it\u2019s truly accountable for the privacy practices. And I think that this is going to be a key for our entire industry and establishing trust.","Marc Benioff","Amy, you see a big movement here in California. There\u2019s a group of very well respected executives, not just from our industry, but also from the privacy and legal community trying to build the California GDPR. We\u2019ve called for a U.S. version of GDPR, a national privacy law. How do you see these things coming together, what is your dream for privacy in the United States?","Amy Weaver","Well, I don\u2019t think that there\u2019s any doubt that federal privacy law is the best for the go. One of the nice things about GDPR is that it replace the patchwork of laws throughout Europe. Now it may be necessary to have a state-by-state implementation in the United States as a practical step forward, but the idea is really to get us to one national privacy law that we can all agree to.","Marc Benioff","What can Salesforce do to help customers implement GDPR today?","Amy Weaver","I think we can do a lot. We had spent the last year working very-very carefully with our customer's data. We have some terrific resources, two things I would steer to, first, if you go to salesforce.com\/gdpr, there\u2019s a trove of resources on that. There\u2019s frequently asked questions, there are white papers, there\u2019s information about all of our system. I can also send people to Trailhead and over 22,000 people have already earned Trailhead badges on the EU privacy basics.","Marc Benioff","So for financial analysts and other people on this call, if they actually want to take a course on GDPR and get up to speed, they can do that right on our Trailhead platform?","Amy Weaver","Absolutely, it\u2019s a terrific place to start.","Marc Benioff","And you just go to Trailhead and do a search on GDPR and that trail will come up and you can get badged and certify a GDPR, terrific.","Alright, well thank you so much everybody, and we\u2019re looking forward to see you at Connections in Chicago in a couple of weeks, which will be marketing event of the year. Bret is going to be doing an amazing keynote there and demonstrating -- I think our vision for customer 360 and the integration cloud, and then we\u2019ll see you again at Dreamforce in September.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s conference call.

First of all, highlights for the quarter. Number one, congratulations to San Francisco Giants for a spectacular World Series win, really great.","Also in the quarter, I'm also pleased to announce we were able to achieve an annual revenue run rate of more than $3 billion. We're one of a small number of software companies to ever achieve this milestone. And this financial achievement also demonstrates the massive shift to social and mobile cloud computing, an amazing level of customer success that companies have had with Salesforce, our technology and our ecosystem.","Hey, let's get right into the results. Number one, revenue for the quarter rose 35% from a year ago to $788 million, pretty awesome, and constant currency revenue grew even faster at 37%. I mean, that is really spectacular growth and I think one of the very best for an enterprise software company this quarter. No other enterprise software company of our size is growing faster than Salesforce. And what's amazing is we're delivering this growth while pushing through this $3 billion revenue run rate, heading right into $4 billion.","Operating cash flow exceeded $100 million for the quarter, our fifth consecutive quarter with operating cash flow in excess of $100 million, just a great job on cash flow over last year. Deferred revenue was roughly $1.3 billion, which is up more than 40% year-over-year. And the dollar value of book business on and off the balance sheet now tops $4.3 billion.","Our top line and pipeline of new business coming out of Dreamforce positions us for a strong finish to the year, with fiscal year 2013 revenue growth of approximately 34% year-over-year. No other enterprise software company is achieving this level of growth. And we are well placed for even more success next year. I'm thrilled to announce that we expect to deliver fiscal year 2014 revenue in the range of $3.8 billion to $3.85 billion, which puts us on pace to exceed that magical $4 billion number annual revenue run rate just next year.","Salesforce has always been a catalyst and evangelist for changing enterprise software. And we've pioneered the shift to cloud, we've pioneered the shift to social and we've pioneered the shift to mobile. Today, we're delivering this next generation of technology.","Look, salesforce.com is the customer company. No other enterprise software company in our industry has defined itself before as the customer company. Companies are turning to us to help them create deep connections with their customers, with their partners, with their employees and between their products and their customers. And with our 6 product lines; the Sales Cloud, the Service Cloud, Marketing Cloud, Salesforce Chatter, Work.com and our Salesforce Platform, our customers have the tools to build a social front office, unlocking greater level of productivity and growth between themselves and their customers using us, using salesforce.com, the customer company.","Our vision has opened a door for thousands of companies and empowered them to revolutionize how they engage with their customers. Nowhere has this momentum been more evident than at our Dreamforce conference, where registered attendees nearly doubled from last year. In fact, for those of you who were there remember that incredible energy, excitement, momentum and capability, where more than 90,000 people registered, learned how Salesforce can drive their businesses forward, and that was just on premise, with thousands more who came to visit us online.","Now more than ever, companies are looking to Salesforce as their platform for growth. In fact, our customers have made Salesforce the undisputed leader in each of our 4 core markets: sales systems, service systems, marketing systems and next-generation cloud platforms.","Our flagship Sales Cloud continues to be the world's #1 app for sales. In the quarter, CRM Magazine named us as the absolute leader in the sales force automation area for the seventh year in a row. The Service Cloud is the world's #1 app for customer service and support. The Service Cloud is the recognized leader in Gartner's Magic Quadrant for customer service and support, as well as a leader in the latest Forrester Wave for customer service. And the Marketing Cloud is the world's #1 app for marketing and the only solution that seamlessly connects social marketing with sales and service. CMOs can now unify and create listening systems, publishing systems, engagement systems and advertising systems and manage all of their marketing activities in one place. The Marketing Cloud has closed some of its largest transactions in the quarter, including Expedia, Fox and HSBC. The Marketing Cloud has been a tremendous addition to Salesforce product line, and we saw great results at both our Dreamforce conference and subsequent Cloudforce events. And we're really excited about this incredible new product line going forward.","Salesforce Platform is the world's #1 enterprise cloud platform and continues to be our fastest-growing product line. The Platform continues to deliver over and over again. The Salesforce Platform makes any app, social and mobile, bringing customers the same development tools that are driving the explosion of consumer apps. It's why more than 800,000 developers have coded more than 345,000 apps on Force.com and more than 2.5 million apps in Heroku and why you saw that incredible developer enthusiasm at our Dreamforce conference, especially as developers move to this next generation of cloud, social and mobile apps. We are the great and most capable company to take them there.","The combination of our vision and our clear leadership in each of these 4 core markets is what's driving our success with customers today. A great example from the quarter is consumer goods giant, Unilever. They're on a mission to become the world's #1 marketing company. Unilever is reinventing the way it builds brands by connecting more than 7,000 marketers and 3,000 agencies around the world with an app that was built in just under 8 weeks. And with the Salesforce Platform, Marketing Cloud and Chatter, the new Unilever app will be the central hub for marketers to manage all of their campaigns, fostering an entirely new way of collaborating.","Emirates, one of the fastest-growing airlines in the world -- well, with the Sales Cloud and the Salesforce Platform, Emirates will be arming reps with a 360-degree view of their customers and drive a whole new level of sales productivity. You already saw how Dreamforce, our incredible work with Virgin America, and now you see with other great airlines, including Emirates, Delta and KLM and others.","And finally, British Sky Broadcasting provides satellite broadcasting, broadband and telephony services to more than 10 million households in Europe. They plan to deploy Salesforce Chatter across 30,000 employees and put every customer-facing employee directly in touch with their Sky Guide experts to resolve cases and respond faster to questions from customers. And by using Salesforce as their social front end to their back-office systems, BSkyB is making their entire business social.","Other new or add-on transactions in the quarter include Asante, Glaxo, Honeywell, GDS, JFE, Luminex, Marina, Olympus, Prudential, Regents, RSA, Seagate, Sumitomo, Vodafone and thousands more. And in every one of these examples, companies are transferring their business with Salesforce's social mobile and cloud technologies and our ability to deeply integrate our social front office with their traditional back-office systems, like SAP and Oracle, and helping many of these customers to transform at the speed of social.","The pace at which these companies are embracing our social and mobile cloud technologies is amazing, and it's driving outstanding levels of usage. I\u2019m thrilled to announce that Salesforce delivered more than 66 billion transactions in the quarter, far more than any of the other enterprise cloud company, that's up 65% from a year ago. This is not shelfware. You can see this on trust.salesforce.com that this is a service that is live and being used by hundreds of thousands of companies around the world. That's 930 million transactions every business day. And now, we expect to deliver that billion transaction in a single business day any moment. Nothing speaks more to the value of Salesforce to our customers than the actual usage of our products with the speed, reliability and capability that our Platform is known for.","Before I close, I want to remind all of you that we're just 2 weeks away from Cloudforce Tokyo, where we'll expect more than 10,000 Japanese enterprises to attend this incredible conference. Japan is a pioneer in social, mobile and cloud computing. And we'd like to invite all of you to come to Cloudforce Tokyo and meet many of our special guests, including Toyota's CEO, Akio Toyoda, and others who will be joining us for this incredible event. And if you want to get a glimpse into why the Japan marketplace has been so incredible for salesforce.com, please come to Cloudforce Tokyo and take a look at this incredible, incredible market known as Japan.","With that, I'll turn it over to Graham and discuss the financial details of our third quarter. Graham, go ahead.","Graham V. Smith","Thanks, Marc. We posted another solid quarter in Q3, delivering strong top line and deferred revenue growth, even as we completed the largest acquisition in our history and hosted our more successful Dreamforce event ever. Our new business pipeline is robust, and we're well positioned for a strong finish to fiscal '13.","Let me take you through our third quarter results, starting with revenue. Q3 revenue was $788 million, that's up 35% over last year. Excluding an approximately $14 million foreign exchange headwind, revenue on a constant currency basis was up 37% over Q3 last year. And as a reminder, our results this quarter included approximately $9 million in revenue from Buddy Media.","Looking at year-over-year growth on a regional basis, revenue in the Americas grew 38% to $547 million, revenue in Europe grew 41% on a constant currency basis and 29% in dollars to $134 million, and revenue in Asia increased 30% in constant currency and 29% in dollars to $107 million. Attrition continued its slow but steady decline, contributing to third quarter top line revenue growth and remains in the low teens on a percentage basis.","Turning to the income statement. Non-GAAP operating income was $77 million in the third quarter, that's up 18% over Q3 last year. Our non-GAAP operating margin was approximately 10% in the third quarter, about 135 basis points lower than Q3 last year, due principally to the acquisition of Buddy Media, partially offset by continued efficiency gains in G&A.","Year-to-date non-GAAP operating margins are up about 35 basis points over last year, and we continue to target a slight improvement in full year non-GAAP margins in FY '13. Looking ahead, we will continue to focus on driving operating efficiencies while investing in areas that propel our growth.","Third quarter headcount additions reflected ongoing investment in sales and R&D. In total, we added more than 550 new employees in Q3, including about 250 people from our acquisition of Buddy Media. This brings our total headcount to more than 9,300. That's up 34% from the third quarter last year.","Turning to earnings. Our GAAP results this quarter include the impact of a onetime, noncash charge of $149 million to establish a valuation allowance against our federal and state deferred tax assets. As a result, we posted a third quarter GAAP loss per share of $1.55. While this is a noncash item and excluded from non-GAAP results, I just want to provide some context.","Deferred tax assets on the balance sheet represent the value of tax deductions and credits to offset future tax liabilities. These assets include net operating loss carry-forwards, R&D credits and book\/tax timing differences, such as accrued liabilities. U.S. GAAP requires companies to regularly assess the realizability of deferred tax assets by evaluating certain criteria. These criteria include whether the company has a cumulative 3-year historical pretax GAAP loss, as well as the timing and likelihood of near-term GAAP profitability.","After performing this analysis in Q3, we determined that a valuation allowance was required as near-term realization of these assets is unlikely. But just to be clear, our deferred tax assets have expiry dates many years into the future. And so we do anticipate being able to use these assets at some point to offset perspective tax liabilities.","The total valuation allowance impact on third quarter GAAP EPS was a loss of $1.16 per share, and the resulting GAAP tax rate was negative 251%. Until a valuation allowance is reversed, our GAAP tax rate will likely fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter.","On a non-GAAP basis, third quarter EPS was $0.33 or about $0.01 above the high end of prior guidance. Non-GAAP EPS was better than we expected due to higher revenue combined with a slightly lower share count and a tax rate that was a bit lower than we projected. That's a non-GAAP tax rate.","Turning to cash flow. Operating cash flow in Q3 was $106 million. While this result is down 18% over Q3 last year, it was a good result considering the effect of 3 unusual items: First, we paid out approximately $15 million extra in accounts payable to catch up on temporary delays caused by a new financial system implementation in the second quarter. Second, we paid out approximately $10 million to settle the California State wage and our lawsuit we discussed previously; and third, the acquisition of Buddy Media reduced cash flow by about $7 million this quarter, which was slightly higher than previously estimated. For the full year, we expect operating cash flow growth of approximately 20%.","CapEx in the third quarter was $51 million or about 6% of revenue. This is consistent with CapEx as a percentage of revenue in Q3 last year. CapEx continues to be driven by new office build-outs and other leasehold improvements related to our growing employee base. Free cash flow, which we define as operating cash flow less CapEx, was $55 million in the third quarter.","Turning to balance sheet. Deferred revenue in the third quarter was approximately $1.3 billion, that's up 41% over Q3 last year. Excluding a year-over-year foreign exchange headwind of approximately $16 million, deferred revenue increased 43% over Q3 last year. On a sequential quarter basis, deferred revenue benefited from a foreign exchange tailwind of approximately $11 million.","Deferred revenue continues to benefit from the multiyear invoice we highlighted in Q4 last year and from the continued shift to annual billing. The increase in the proportion of annual billing, annual invoicing in Q3 was consistent with the changes we've seen over the past 3 quarters.","The dollar benefit to deferred revenue in Q3 from these 2 factors was approximately $110 million. That's down from $120 million in Q2 and $145 million in Q1. Excluding this benefit, deferred revenue on a constant currency basis grew 31% year-over-year, a great result and, again, in line with the underlying constant currency deferred revenue growth rates we've seen over the past several quarters.","As a reminder, Q4 will be the anniversary of both the multiyear invoice and the annual invoicing policy change. And while the shift to annual billing will continue, we expect the incremental benefit to deferred revenue will be lower than it was in Q4 last year. So while we expect our underlying constant currency deferred revenue growth rate in the fourth quarter to be consistent with recent quarters, that's in the low 30% range, because of the anniversary of those 2 invoicing factors, we expect reported Q4 deferred revenue to be lower than the recent quarters, likely in the mid- to high-20% range.","Off-balance-sheet backlog, or revenue that is contacted but not yet invoiced, was more than $3 billion in Q3. That's an increase of more than 50% over Q3 last year. Deferred revenue plus this off-balance-sheet backlog now exceeds $4.3 billion.","Turning to our outlook for Q4. We currently anticipate revenue in the range of $825 million to $830 million for year-over-year growth of approximately 31%. We expect Q4 non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.38 to $0.40.","For the full year 2013, we're raising our revenue estimates to a range of $3.041 billion to $3.046 billion and raising our non-GAAP EPS estimates to a range of $1.50 to $1.52. The midpoint of our full fiscal year 2013 revenue guidance implies growth of approximately 34%.","As you know, Q4 is our largest new business and renewals quarter. And because of the compounding effects of our subscription model, the influence of the fourth quarter on our full year revenue becomes more significant each year. So without the benefit of visibility to Q4, our preliminary estimate for fiscal 2014 is for revenue in the range of $3.8 billion to $3.85 billion. The midpoint of this initial guidance implies FY '14 growth of approximately 26%.","We believe this initial view of fiscal 2014 is appropriate, given continued FX volatility and other macroeconomic factors, such as the resolution of the fiscal cliff in the U.S. We'll obviously have a lot more clarity on FY '14 after our fourth quarter. As a reminder, all of the underlying assumptions for our non-GAAP and our GAAP guidance and the complete GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation can be found in our earnings press release we issued earlier.","So to conclude, Q3 was another solid quarter of top line and deferred revenue growth, and we're well positioned for a strong finish to the year. We continue to see significant demand for our solutions across customers of all sizes, geographies and verticals. And we look forward to updating you on our progress during our Q4 and full year results call in February.","With that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Philip Winslow with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Philip Winslow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Marc, just wanted to get a sense of what you're seeing across the various clouds in terms of demand and any change you're seeing there against the sales, marketing, and obviously, the -- it being [indiscernible] of the Service Cloud, too?","Marc Benioff","Well, we have, of course, had some great success with the Sales Cloud, which has become a multibillion-dollar product line for us. And right behind that, we have had the Service Cloud, which we just have seen some extraordinary results last year and this year. And we are very optimistic in terms of that becoming another billion-dollar product line for Salesforce. And right behind that, of course, you see the speed and the rapid delivery of the Platform. And these remain kind of the 3 major horses in the race to become our 3 core billion-dollar businesses. Now we're making, of course, a major investment, as you know, through acquisition as well as organic development with our Marketing Cloud. And in addition to that, we're going to have an incredible success with Work.com. But at our core, we remain very uniquely focused on Sales, Service and Platform right now.","Operator","Our next question is from Mark Murphy with Piper Jaffray.","Mark R. Murphy - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","I'm wondering if you can update us on adoption trends for the Force.com platform. We seem to be encountering more CIOs of Fortune 1000 companies who are formulating these multiyear, 3- to 5-year plans, where they're trying to move back-office applications onto Force.com. And so to the extent that you might be seeing that kind of deeper commitment, what do you think is driving it? And also just separately, can you comment on whether Hurricane Sandy had any type of impact on the business?","Marc Benioff","Well, I think the #1 thing that you're seeing with Force.com is absolutely something that we have been pursuing over a very long period of time. Of course, we're the very first company to ever use the term Platform as a Service. And we believe there is no faster way to build and deploy an application than a Platform as a Service. And the reason why you're seeing an acceleration of that in your surveys and why we're seeing an acceleration of that in our bookings and our revenue and why the Salesforce platform is the world's #1 enterprise platform and continues to be our fastest-growing product line is because more and more companies are moving to the delivery of next-generation apps, especially mobile apps. And as they look to mobile apps, they are looking to Force.com, and that is becoming a rapid application development deployment vehicle for those mobile applications. You saw that at Dreamforce. You saw us deliver our own Dreamforce application, which was a touch-friendly application that ran on iPads and iPhones, ran on Windows 8 tablets, ran on Kindles. All of these things were easily used to access our Dreamforce app. And that is the use case for our customers. They want to build applications that they can build once and run across all of these things, not just their traditional desktops like their Dell and HP workstations but also their next-generation deployment systems. And we're showing customers how they can build these next-generation mobile apps. And we also released a book at Dreamforce that we had to reprint during the conference because it sold -- it's not sold, but we were giving out tens of thousands of copies of how to use our mobile software development kits. That includes our APIs, which let you deep -- dig in and execute mobile applications. So you can deliver mobile apps using our Force.com system. You can deliver mobile apps using our APIs. You can do some incredible things with the Platform. And these are things that honestly not very many other enterprise software companies have had in mind over in last few years. And we're getting tremendous traction from that, and that's why more than 800,000 developers have quoted the 345,000 apps. At Dreamforce, you saw the developer enthusiasm, and not that we haven't had developer enthusiasm before, but it's definitely turned into a mania. And that's been very exciting for us, and it's a huge tip off our hat to our Platform group, which has done a great job, not just this year and last year but over the last decade, they've been working on this. So it's very exciting.","Graham V. Smith","And I was just going to follow up. We didn't see -- we saw, obviously, some difficulty closing some of the deals in the quarter because of Sandy. But I wouldn't characterize it as having a significant impact on the close to the quarter.","Operator","Our next question is from Brian Schwartz of Oppenheimer.","Brian J. Schwartz - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Marc, I know you mentioned that the HR -- the Work.com solution is not a part of the core. But we have been coming across in our charts some very large companies that are adopting the product. So was wondering if you could just update us on the traction that you are seeing with that cloud within your customer base? And also the size of customers that are adopting it if, in fact, you are selling it into these larger enterprises?","Marc Benioff","Okay. Well, we have a tremendous executive, John Wookey, who many of you know as a leader at Oracle and a leader at SAP, who has been pioneering since he got to our company now a little more than a year ago this incredible vision that he has around Work.com. And first and foremost, what Work.com is, for those of you who are not aware of what we're doing is, it's an -- obviously, it's an application in the HR category. But it's not a traditional HR application. It's an application that gives you productivity. And in today's time and today's age, this is something all of our customers need. And we have deeply integrated Work.com as an extension into our core platform and into the Sales Cloud, into the Service Cloud, into the Marketing Cloud. That means that when you're using in Salesforce Chatter, for example, you're able to now give recognition to other employees. Through that recognition, you're also able to badge other employees, and employees start to build a social profile. We've talked about that for over a year the importance of building that social profile. But when you're going to the social profile, you're seeing all these incredible badges that are coming out through Work.com. And it's a bit of a gamification into our core enterprise application suite. Then as you get to the next level, of course, we can acquire other badges through testing, through quizzing, through other types of mechanisms of certification, and you'll see all of your employees get these kind of badges based on maybe a product certification or a marketing certification or an accounting certification which, of course, happens for every company on a regular basis. But we're building that profile on that employee as part of Chatter and as part of Work.com and as part of our core clouds right in the system. Then not only will you see with our employees but then you're going to go on and see it with our partners. So just as partners can now build communities and deploy our core systems like Chatter and Sales Cloud into partner communities or into service committees, you can now badge those partners. So you can see that, that partner has taken on this incredible new capability. And then finally, you're able to even badge users as well and end users. So this whole concept of productivity, of training, of badging, of gamification, we think is going to drive Work.com very rapidly. It's integrated very deeply with the next-gen HR systems like Workday and others. And I really commend John for his great vision for this. And if you haven't seen this product, I'd be happy to have John sit down with you, and you can take a deeper look into Work.com. It's live at Salesforce, and we're getting some great results out of it.","Operator","Our next question is from Adam Holt with Morgan Stanley.","Adam H. Holt - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","My question is about Europe. You saw acceleration in Europe in a period where a lot of people are seeing deceleration in Europe. Could you drill down on what geographies in particular stood out, if any, products, and really just give us more color on why your business seems to be improving there against what's obviously a very difficult backdrop?","Marc Benioff","I think that when it comes to Europe, of course, Europe has been in a financial crisis this entire year, and you've seen us deliver really outstanding performance in Europe. And that is really based on an investment gambit that we had been making now in Europe for more than a decade. When you look at the major enterprise software markets in the world, 3 of those core enterprise software markets are the U.K., France and Germany. And it has taken us a long time to get these markets online with us, building the distribution organizations, investing in the marketing capabilities, readying the products, building the customer testimonials. Just in the U.S., as you know, where we have a very dominant position in these markets, because of a similar long-term investment, these next-generation markets have taken even longer for us to address. And it's been very exciting for us to get to this next level of performance. And we have a great leadership team in Europe, and you can see that with our Head of Europe. And he's done just a spectacular job. So we're all very excited about the delivery of the European business this year.","Operator","Our next question is from Steve Ashley with Robert W. Baird.","Steven M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Just about systems integrators and their ability just to keep pace with your rapid innovation. Clearly, they've aligned themselves with Sales Cloud and Service Cloud, but now you have some new offerings, Marketing Cloud, Work.com. Have you seen them start to extend practices into those new areas? And what is the opportunity there for greater support?","Marc Benioff","We've been making major investments in the systems integrator world for a long time, and that includes the major systems integrators like Accenture and Deloitte. You've seen them at our major conferences and events and also a whole next generation of systems integrators who have built their businesses using our business. And in all cases, those systems integrators are looking for revenue. And they see the growth and the opportunity to build these next-generation customer systems. Next-generation customer systems are not limited to sales or service or marketing or a platform but really the combination of all of these things. And our system integrators that we work with recognize that and are working to build business capabilities in all of those areas. We have clearly a strong capability to become the customer company, and that is the company that our customers turn to, to provide the systems to integrate with their customers. And that means that we have got to deliver quality capability in Sales, Service, Marketing and Platform. And we need the partnerships with the system integrators because we have such a minor professional services capability at Salesforce by design that we need them to step up and make those investments. And in many cases, they have and I've seen tremendous results from them.","Operator","Our next question is from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs.","Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Marc, my question was -- you guys have added so much product depth and breadth over the last few years with Marketing and Service and Platform, as you mentioned. I'm just wondering, these sales seem to be getting much more strategic and kind of going cross departments. I'm just wondering from a sales perspective, has your go-to-market -- do you see your go-to-market having to change and your sales process having to change versus maybe when you were just focused on primarily on Sales Cloud?","Marc Benioff","Well, when you're a one-product company, it's very easy to execute. It's see a bear, shoot a bear. And that's how it is with Sales Force Automation. And when you become a customer company and you're working on sales and service and marketing and platform and building all the capabilities that your customers need to connect with their customers in these incredible new ways, well, then, you're right in that our employees, our sales reps, our systems engineers need to have the expertise on all of those different product categories. But in terms of fundamental changes to how we sell product, we have not seen a need to make those kinds of changes. And the reason I can tell you that is actually based on experience and testing. We have been testing different go-to-market models. We've been testing not just overlay sales organizations to our core organization but dedicated sales organizations that are align-oriented. We've also had partner-based sales organizations. And in all cases, we've been able to come back to our core Salesforce in the anointment and the acceleration of them to be able to sell all these solutions. We continue to test in different regions and markets in the world and in different product lines, different sales models, different distribution models. But I believe that the fundamental model that we have in place will win out. And in many cases, our sales organization has demonstrated its ability to sell these incredible new acquisitions. You may remember it was just a short time ago, maybe a couple of years ago, that we acquired a company called Jigsaw. And that has been a tremendous new revenue line to our Sales Cloud. And as we look to Data.com, which is kind of the re-branding of Jigsaw, becoming more than $100 million business with us, we are seeing our core sales organization be able to sell and deliver that revenue. And that's been awesome for us, and we started with the direct organization there. It went to a blended organization, and then we can see our core organization being able to sell that. And that's been a great acquisition for us. And it's a great differentiator. It's part of our core technology. It's something that all of our customers need, and it's something that our core sales force can sell. And that's how we want these acquisitions to turn out. It takes a multiyear investment, and it also takes a relentless focus on them. But in that case, Data.com becoming a great differentiator, by the way, on the Sales Cloud and\/or Work.com becoming also another great differentiator on the Sales Cloud, the Platform becoming a great differentiator in the Sales Cloud. In all situations, we're able to see our core sales organization sell those capabilities, coupled with appropriate systems engineering resources and overlays. But it really gets back to our core distribution model that we've invested so much in and continue to do so that could give us the execution capability there.","Operator","Our next question is from Brent Thill with UBS.","Brent Thill - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Graham, just a follow-up on the deferred revenue for Q4. Can you just help us understand some of the assumptions that you're making when you mentioned the growth range bracket in terms of your assumptions just on the macro and large deal flow? I think you've talked about some large deals in the past quarters. We didn't hear that much about it this quarter. Can you just give us a sense of what that range implies?","Graham V. Smith","Well, sure. I mean, we've obviously seen a few quarters now of a consistent trend on the annual bill frequency, which is having an impact on deferred revenue, which we've, I think, gone to some lengths to explain each quarter. And so we've -- we're sort of assuming that we're going to see a little bit of that continue in Q4. The anniversary of that is during the fourth quarter obviously. So that's -- we've assumed a few points of improvement but clearly not the 7 or 8 points of improvement we've been seeing over the last few quarters. We're assuming that we're not, at this point, going to have another large multiyear invoice. That's always possible. But certainly, my deferred revenue guidance at the mid- to high-20% range does not assume another large multiyear invoice drops in the fourth quarter. And then the rest, obviously, the deferred revenue is sort of the underlying trend on deferred revenue, which is related clearly to our revenue guidance. And that's obviously, in turn, based on attrition assumptions and our pipeline ratios that we look at each quarter.","Operator","Our next question is from Kirk Materne with Evercore Partners.","Stewart Materne - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Marc, the federal fiscal year finished up this quarter. And I was just kind of curious on your view on how you guys are sort of taking advantage of the government's sort of view on going to cloud first. I realize it's a small part of your business now. But I guess how do you feel about sort of the momentum in that business and the ability for that business to maybe start moving the needle in terms of becoming a bigger, bigger part of the overall story for Salesforce?","Marc Benioff","Well, as you said, we have not really focused on the government as a traditional acquirer of our technology just because we've seen so many other ready markets. We did acquire an executive and doubled down our investment in the government markets. That was Vivek Kundra, who was the former CIO of the U.S. Federal Government, joined our team. And we're very excited about having him on board, and he is rebuilding our strategy and execution in that area. But this is just not an area that we have traditionally gone after. I think at some point, we will be able to announce some substantial transactions. And the reason why is our main customer in the U.S. government has been the GSA. And the GSA, as you know, is the dominant buying authority for the U.S. government. They are really the ones who have led the cloud-first initiative and execution. They've done tremendous work with us, with Chatter, with our Sales Cloud, the deployment of other cloud-based applications, such as those from Google. And many other government agencies are looking to them like what we've seen in Health and Human Services, Department of Energy and others. Of course, you have to look for our government business being mostly dominant in Japan, where the Japan Post remains one of our largest and most important customers in the world. The Japan Post, as you know, has hundreds of thousands of employees and serves 100 million Japanese customers as their dominant post office, also insurance company and bank. And we continue to expand our relationships with the Japan Post. And you saw other recent announcements with us with the U.K., with the G-Cloud, but those are not material to our revenue today. But we are very focused on showing to others what we've done in Japan and with GSA as our true highlight of our government business.","Operator","Our next question is from Jason Maynard with Wells Fargo.","Jason Maynard - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Marc, I have a question about your small and mid-sized customer base. And I'm curious how you would characterize the multi-product sales into the SMB versus the enterprise, because clearly, with big deals, it's multiple products that are being consumed. What's the trend in the SMB? And how do some of the new products, Desk.com and some of this, fit into the model? And what are you seeing in terms of adoption rates for some of the new offerings?","Marc Benioff","Yes, thanks so much, Jason. We've just had just some great success in the small and medium marketplace, where we've seen that customers, our customers, they're able to really standardize on our products and get to a SELA or Social Enterprise License Agreement much faster than the largest of companies. Over and over again, we see these next generation of companies standardizing on us in that area, and it's been and continues to be a very strong business for us. And while we saw some weakness, for example, in small businesses earlier this year, that cleared up in this quarter. And we saw some very solid delivery from what we call our commercial sales organization. This quarter, we have a great leadership team in commercial, and they did another very nice job and consistent delivery for us. And the customers, and I'm sure you met many of them at Dreamforce, are indeed buying all of those products sometimes as one agreement.","Operator","Our next question is from Laura Lederman with William Blair.","Laura Lederman - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Can you talk a little bit about the marketing suite and whether or not you think that you need to kind of be in the traditional pieces of that, such as campaign management and lead management and email marketing? Or is it really more the newer social pieces that you think are important going forward as you build out a marketing suite?","Marc Benioff","Well, as you know now, just for a little more than a year, we've been very focused on building out our Marketing Cloud. And that started with our acquisition of Radian6, which is a business that will move to over $100 million in revenue next year and that's been very exciting. And now we've coupled that with Buddy Media, which also is a fast grower as well. But we are at the very beginning of our journey with the Marketing Cloud. And while we've made 2 incredible acquisitions with 2 incredible leaders, with Michael Lazerow and Marcel LeBrun, and we've coupled that with our core Salesforce leadership by giving Brett Queener the position of EVP of our Marketing Cloud and also bringing in Susan St. Ledger to run our core sales operations, one of our top performers in sales to run Marketing Cloud sales. What we have been excited about with the Marketing Cloud is that it has a huge runway. Now you've mentioned many of the directions that we could move with the Marketing Cloud. None of those directions are as important as just pure play execution of the assets that we have acquired. And one of the ways that we make our acquisitions successful at Salesforce is that we focus on the day-to-day execution of those assets. And Marketing Cloud has to focus on the success of Radian and Buddy. And then when we see those online, then we move onto the next one. And that's very much what we did with Radian6. We saw some great success; we've moved on to Buddy. I'm sure there will be another chapter. This is an area that we're going to, of course, innovate organically and inorganically in. And as you know by 2017, Gartner says that CMOs will spend more than CIOs on technology, and we want to be prepared for that as the worldwide leader in providing marketing automation to our customers. And there's a lot of exciting opportunities, companies, new technologies, entrepreneurs for us to partner with in doing that. But we have to be cautious in terms of taking on these acquisitions because we have to execute on them. And that's been our focus, and that's what we will continue to do. And then when we feel like those businesses are going well, then we reconsider what the next step is.","Operator","Our next question is from Derrick Wood with Susquehanna International Group.","[Technical Difficulty]","Marc Benioff","No Derrick? We\u2019re moving on.","Operator","All right. And our next question is from Kash Rangan with Merrill Lynch.","Kash G. Rangan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Non-sales mix of the cloud. It's been steadily growing up very nicely, about 45% or so, at the Analyst Day. Now as you look at the non-Sales Clouds, they are the faster-growing businesses. So at some point, it feels like your business -- sorry, this is [indiscernible] the actual rate, although it's actually very good growth rate. You've got non-Sales Cloud businesses growing rapidly. They're getting to be like 50% of the new business mix. And if you staff it properly, it just feels like this could be a market as big as, maybe even larger, than ERP. What's the right way to think about your business mix with different moving parts as you look at your business over the next 4 to 5 years?","Marc Benioff","Well, I think that you went through a lot of it. You know that we have a multibillion-dollar business on our hands with the Sales Cloud that continues to do well. That's highly differentiated with many of the capabilities that we talked about on the call today, including the Platform, Data, Work and also including the service systems and marketing systems. You know that we continue to grow Service Cloud, which has been rated by Gartner and Forrester as perhaps the absolute leader in the customer service community. And that's becoming very rapidly a billion-dollar business for us. And then you also know that we have a barn burner on our hands with Platform. And those things are changing the mix of our revenue because our sales reps have more to sell than just the Sales Cloud. In addition to that, we have future revenue opportunities with product lines like Marketing Cloud and others. But we've moved to, successfully I would say, from being a single-product company to a multi-product company. And we also moved successfully from having a single billion-dollar business to what will clearly be multiple billion-dollar businesses. And that is very important for the future success of our company and our shareholders. Very hard to do as very few companies in the software industry have ever pulled that off, as you know. And we continue to focus on our core execution across those product lines, and you articulated our product strategy very well. It's not hidden. We're focused on sales, and we're focused on service, we're focused on marketing as our 3 core application areas. And then we are focused on Chatter, Platform and Work as some of our very core differentiation and also future revenue lines. And in all cases, all 6 of those core product lines together, positioning us as the customer company, the company our customers are choosing to go with to rapidly deploy these next-generation customer systems and get their absolute fastest time to money and the rapid return on investment that they're looking for.","Operator","Our next question is from Ross MacMillan with Jefferies & Company.","Ross MacMillan - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Marc, services being such a great growth driver for the company for some time now, do you think Service can ultimately be as big, or if not bigger, than Sales Cloud? And then secondarily, one for Graham, you talked about cash flow from operations this year being 20% growth. I think that was a change from the low 20% growth last quarter. If that is a change, can you just give us the puts and takes on that?","Marc Benioff","Well, it's hard to say at this point, because the Sales Cloud has been so successful. When will the -- when will Service Cloud pass it? I don't really know, and I'm not able to make that prediction. And if I was able to make that prediction, I would tell you. But there's no doubt that Service and Sales are 2 really -- 2 great foundational assets for the company, where we've done well and where our competitors have struggled. And that remains our focus, and we've got a great team on that. Graham, would you like to finish up on that?","Graham V. Smith","Sorry. Can you just repeat the question? Did we cut him off? Sorry, what was the question, Marc? I had some [indiscernible].","Ross MacMillan - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Sorry, Graham, I didn't mean to cut you off.","Graham V. Smith","Yes. I think we've got guidance for full year operating cash flow of around 20%. Obviously, we had a big $40 million boost in Q4 last year from the multiyear invoice. But we're comfortable with the 20% operating cash flow number for the full year.","Operator","Okay. And our final question for today will come from Rick Sherlund with Nomura.","Richard G. Sherlund - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","First, for Graham. Graham, was there any impact at all from the fiscal cliff we saw from a lot of the on-premise companies? We didn't see it from NetSuite, Cornerstone or apparently not from you guys, so if you could offer us any perspective there. And Marc, just for you, I don't know if you've had an opportunity to respond, if you care to, to Larry Ellison's comments at Oracle OpenWorld recently about multi-tenancy in the database. I wonder if you could just comment whether Oracle or SAP, given all their acquisitions, you're seeing any more of them in the market.","Graham V. Smith","Yes. So just to take your -- the first question. I think, clearly, we -- we're mindful of the environment we're operating in. I think in terms of our guidance, we weigh all the different factors that I outlined earlier. And so I think when you -- when we get through the fourth quarter, we'll, I think, have a much better sense as to whether there is any impact of a pullback in investments. Certainly, there have been in the articles in the press over the last few days about that. But we stated our guidance comfortably for this quarter. So I think it's really, to me, this is all about what's the fourth quarter hold for us. Clearly, it's a big new business and renewals quarter. So I think we'll have much better insight to that in February. Marc?","Marc Benioff","My analysis is that for SAP, they have repositioned themselves as a company that offers analytics through Business Objects and data warehousing with HANA, and that this is their major focus of their work going forward. And both of those technologies on-premise with a somewhat immaterial percentage of their revenue as in the cloud. With Oracle, I think that they repositioned themselves as a mainframe company and operating system provider and also depositioned themselves in our core space through their conference. And in terms of those 2 companies, it's not that we don't see them. Of course, you see them. You'll see customer flare-ups or places where they have especially strong customer relationships. But they have not provided the next-generation vision for customer-based systems, whether it is how to connect with your customers, your employees, your partners and your products in an entirely new way. I think that you saw at Dreamforce, we have future-forward positioning. We're trying to be extremely mindful and project the future for our customers. And it's a very different approach than how they have been marketing their products and the areas where they've been focused on in their bookings. And our focus has been fairly consistent over the last 36 months. It will continue to be very consistent in these areas. And while they have their positioning in their company, whether it's SAP as kind of the HANA company and Oracle as the Exadata company, we want to be the customer company.","David Havlek","All right, great. That wraps up our call for the day. Thanks, Marc and Graham. I want to apologize to everybody who we didn't get to. We have lots of you still in the queue. Please feel free to reach out to us. For those of you who we'll see in Tokyo, we look forward to that.","Marc Benioff","Yes. Oh, we're absolutely looking forward to seeing everybody in Japan.","David Havlek","Great. And have a fantastic holiday. And we look forward to catching up with you soon. Bye-bye now.","Marc Benioff","Happy Thanksgiving, everyone.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's salesforce.com Q3 2013 Earnings Call.

This quarter was a very important birthday for us, it gave us an opportunity to look back, and how we\u2019ve helped shape this new world of enterprise software. How we\u2019ve grown to be the world\u2019s largest CRM company and the world\u2019s largest provider of enterprise cloud computing and as you can see from these results the fastest growing top-10 software company in the world today.","All in just 15 short years. It\u2019s been an exceptional journey and we\u2019re very grateful to all of you who\u2019ve been with us through this incredible decade and a half. The new world of enterprise software the world is in the cloud it\u2019s a world of mobile, it\u2019s a world of social and it\u2019s a world that\u2019s connected. Our customers are connecting with their customers in entirely new ways. They\u2019re consistently turning the companies like salesforce to make this customer connection. And this has driven this incredible business for us.","Whether you are looking for solutions for sales, for service, for marketing, for engagement, or building custom apps, salesforce has consistently delivered the world\u2019s best customer platform. And I\u2019m proud of our employees, our customers and partners and what they\u2019ve accomplished over the last 15 years and I\u2019m looking forward to our very bright future.","We\u2019re delighted this quarter to be once again chosen by Fortune magazine as the world\u2019s most admired software company for the second year in a row. An incredible accomplishment, and earlier this year salesforce was recognized by Fortune as the world\u2019s seventh place to work, seventh best place to work and we were Forbes magazine most innovative company in the world three years in a row. And through our pioneering 111 model, we\u2019ve now delivered more than 700,000 hours of community service, a little bit more than $50 million in grants, and are running more than 20,000 non-profit organizations in our service-for-free.","Through all of this, through all of these accomplishments nothing is more important to us than the trust and success of our customers. This deep commitment to our customers and their success is why salesforce delivered these exceptional results especially now in this first quarter. Revenue grew by 37% from a year ago to more than 1.2 billion, pretty incredible. Deferred revenue grew by 34% year-over-year to more than 2.3 billion. Operating cash flow grew by 67% from year ago to more than 470 million. And the dollar value book business on and off the balance sheet grew by 34% from last year to 7.1 billion. And while we delivered world class growth we also grew operating margins sequentially this quarter which is why we\u2019re able to deliver non-GAAP EPS of $0.11 exceeding our guidance. And we\u2019ll deliver 125 to 150 basis points of operating margin improvement this year.","Given our strong financial results and pipeline of new business, we\u2019re once again raising our full fiscal year 2015 guidance by 40 million to reach 5.34 billion. With billions of users all over the world now using cloud services, mobile devices and software networks the technology world has deeply changed. And salesforce continues to lead this change in enterprise software. Today, I run my business from my phone. I could never have imagined that just a few years ago. I don\u2019t need a PC, a laptop, a desktop, to connect with my customers, employees or partners. I just need my phone. And that certainly isn\u2019t where software was a decade ago. ","At salesforce we go with flow of our services, under the new Salesforce1 Platform giving our customers the ability to use phones, tablet PCs or whatever they choose to manage and share all of their customer information. The Salesforce1 Platform has far exceeded our wildest dreams and has accelerated the success of our customers, our ISDs, our developers, our administrators, and their ability to be successful in this new world. And it\u2019s why our flagship Sales Cloud and Service Cloud, our ExactTarget Marketing Cloud and our platforms are all leaders in the categories and growing faster than their competition.","Our Sales Cloud is once again the undisputed leader in Gartner\u2019s Magic Quadrant for Salesforce Automation in fact we extended our lead this last year according to Gartner, our multichannel sales now larger than the three next competitors combined. Service Cloud is the clear leader in both vision and execution in Gartner\u2019s most recent Magic Quadrant for Customer Service and with Salesforce1 Platform we are bringing our world class customer service solutions to small businesses as well as to enterprises. ","The ExactTarget Marketing Cloud doubled its market share, according to the recent Gartner report adding more share than any other top-10 marketing vendor. And the Salesforce1 Platform is the only solution rated by Forrester as a leader in every single platform category and recognized leader in Gartner\u2019s first ever Magic Quadrant for Enterprise Platforms.","Now I am delighted to welcome our Vice Chairmen and President, Keith Block, to the earnings call and I would like to ask Keith to introduce himself, but also to give me a review of the quarter\u2019s results. We are very fortunate to bring in Keith over a year ago now. He is a member of our Board and runs our distribution organization which represents more than half of our inflows. Keith?","","Keith Block","Hi. Thanks Marc, it\u2019s great to be here and I have to say that salesforce is an absolutely incredible Company. Over the past year I have spent a great deal of time speaking with customers and partners all around the world, and the feedback has been overwhelmingly consistent, it\u2019s been about great vision, it\u2019s been about great products, and it\u2019s been about great people. And it\u2019s really rare to find a Company whose customers and partners, has such a high degree of respect and admiration on a consistent basis. And the great news is, our customers and our partners, they want more from us. They want us to go deeper with them, they want us to have a more strategic relationship, they want us to help them innovatively transform their business models, they want us to help them scale their business for the future, and ultimately at the end of the day they want us to be their trusted advisor on their journey to connect with customers in entirely new ways. And this applies to every customer, from the smallest to the largest enterprises in the world.","Now in the quarter we had some terrific success with companies of all sizes and across all industries, everywhere in the world, and I would like to just share a few thoughts with you. For example, we entered into a new relationship with Manulife, one of the world\u2019s largest insurance and financial services providers. They selected the Service Cloud to create a single customer engagement platform and delivered personalized service across all of their life insurance wealth management and investment products, just a terrific story.","Meiji Yasuda Life Insurance, one of the oldest and largest insurance in Japan, we\u2019re thrilled to have that brand as part of our family. They selected salesforce in the quarter and this will be the first enterprise-wide cloud implementation in Japan\u2019s life insurance industry, absolutely excited about this. They selected our Service Cloud that allow agents to close deals and service customers right from their phones and they are also building out their next generation apps on Salesforce1, very-very exciting.","And in communications and media, Sky Italia selected Service Cloud, the Salesforce1 Platform, Salesforce communities, all of which for an engine for the company\u2019s B2C communications business from call centers to self-service department channels. In healthcare, another great brand that fit us started sales transformation with our Sales Cloud and in the quarter they expanded with ExactTarget Marketing Cloud delivering to the power of social and connect directly with millions of people shopping for insurance. Many-many-many stories that we can go on to, but again some terrific brands and terrific story and I certainly want to congratulate the team for their outstanding accomplishments in Q1 and I also want to thank our customers and our partners for their continued commitment to our collective success and features, and I do want to say again that I\u2019m absolutely thrilled to be part of this just outstanding organization.","So with that I will turn the call over to Graham.","Graham Smith","","Thanks Keith. And we started fiscal 2015 as you have heard with a really strong first quarter, growing revenue, deferred revenue and operating cash flow at more than 30% and coming in ahead of our EPS guidance. We are well positioned to deliver another year of industry-leading growth. Let me take you through the financial highlights of our first quarter starting with the income statement.","First quarter revenue was $1.23 billion, that\u2019s an increase of 37% and which did include an FX benefit of approximately $6 million. Non-GAAP EPS for the first quarter was $0.11. On a regional basis revenue in the Americas grew 39% to $876 million, revenue in Europe grew 42% in dollars and 35% in constant currency to $231 million and revenue in Asia Pacific increased 21% in dollars and 26% in constant currency to $120 million, that\u2019s a nice uptick in growth after some of our recent quarters. In Asia-Pac dollar attrition continued its slow and steady decline for the 19th consecutive quarter and remains in the high single-digits percentage range.","Our non-GAAP growth and operating margins continued to reflect the acquisition of ExactTarget last year, gross margins was 79.5% in Q1 that\u2019s down 70 basis points from Q1 last year and non-GAAP operating margin was 9.7% which was down 80 basis points from Q1 last year, but actually up 280 basis points sequentially.","In the first quarter we added more than 900 people that\u2019s our most significant organic hiring quarter ever, and brings our total headcount at the end of the quarter to just over 14,200 that\u2019s up 38% over Q1 last year. Turning to balance sheet we ended the quarter with approximately $1.5 billion in cash and marketable securities. During the quarter we paid approximately $280 million in principle related to conversions of our senior notes that are due in January 2015. This amount was partially offset by an approximately $30 million deposit we received for the potential sale of four of our eight lots we owned in Mission Bay.","Deferred revenue ended the quarter up more than $2.3 billion up 34% over the last year; excluding approximately 13 million of year-over-year FX benefit deferred revenue increased 33%. On a sequential quarter basis deferred revenue also had an FX benefit of approximately $9 million. We expect Q2 deferred revenue to be approximately flat sequentially from Q1. Approximately 68% of the value of all subscription and support related invoices and that includes ExactTarget were issued with annual terms in Q1 compared with approximately 68% Q1 last year.","Keep in mind however that our billing frequency percentage last year did not include ExactTarget, if you exclude ExactTarget from this close calculation we saw a year-over-year increase in the proportion of invoices issued with annual terms but is consistent with the fiscal 2014 average that was around 5 percentage points improvement. Unbilled deferred revenue or revenue that is contracted but not yet invoiced and is off the balance sheet was approximately $4.8 billion in Q1, that\u2019s an increase of 33% over last year.","Turning to cash flow, we have an outstanding start for the year as we talked about for sometime Q4 has historically always been our largest new business quarter and as a result have also become our largest renewals quarter. The seasonality of our invoicing has become more pronounced each year because of the compounding effects of the new business seasonality. The Q4 is our largest invoicing quarter it follows the Q1 has become our largest collections and operation cash flow quarter.","So in the first quarter operating cash flow was $473 million that\u2019s up 67% over the last year. We anticipate our second quarter operating cash flow growth to be lower at approximately 10% year-over-year growth and continue to expect our full year operating cash flow to grow in the mid 20s percentage range year-over-year that we talked about on the call in February.","CapEx was $60 million in the first quarter up 11% year-on-year, CapEx as a percentage of revenue in the first quarter was 5% that\u2019s down from 6% in Q1 last year and we continue to expect our full year CapEx to be in the range of 5% to 7% of revenue. Free cash flow which we define as operating cash flow less CapEx was $413 million in the first quarter, that\u2019s up 80% from last year.","Turning to guidance with our solid results in the first quarter, we\u2019re delighted to be raising our full fiscal 2015 revenue outlook by $40 million that\u2019s new range of $5.3 billion to $5.34 billion for year-over-year revenue growth of 30% to 31%. We\u2019re raising our full year non-GAAP EPS guidance to reflect the Q1 beef and now expect it to be in the range of $0.49 to $0.51. And as Marc mentioned we are still committed to increasing our full year non-GAAP operating margins by 125 to 150 basis points. But clearly that assumes no significant M&A activity during the year.","FY15 non-GAAP EPS also assumes that other income expenses will continue to be a net expense and assumes a non-GAAP tax rate of 36.5%. For Q2 we anticipate revenue in the range of $1.285 billion to $1.29 billion representing year-over-year growth of approximately 34% to 35% and we expect non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.11 to $0.12. And as a reminder all of the underlying assumptions for our GAAP and non-GAAP guidance is on complete GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation can be found in our earnings press release issued earlier today.","So to close Q4 and a great start for the year to salesforce, a really good solid execution across the business sets us up well to deliver another year of amazing industry-leading growth.","So with that, we\u2019ll open the call up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) And your first question comes from the line of Jason Maynard.","Jason Maynard - Wells Fargo Securities","Good afternoon guys and congratulations on the quarter. I have a question that\u2019s probably for Marc and I would assume maybe for Keith as well. I\u2019d love to get your perspective when you look out over the next 12 months really kind of two parts here one is do you believe you are fully penetrated in sales automation and that the majority of the growth or the incremental growth is going to come from up-selling the Sales Cloud and Marketing Cloud and Platform? And then maybe Keith on the distribution side, what do you need to do to turn some of your accounts that maybe you\u2019re spending a couple of million dollars with you today into accounts that maybe can spend upwards of $10 million a year with you on a recurring basis? Thanks.","Marc Benioff","Well, I think you have to keep all this in perspective where -- obviously our namesake Sales Cloud product is just a huge part of our Company and it will continue to be a huge part of our Company for the foreseeable future. And we have a lot of other great growth drivers in the Company as well especially with our Service Cloud and our Marketing Cloud and our Platform and also our new engagement capabilities and community\u2019s capabilities. But the sales product remains to be such a dominate part of the Company\u2019s success that there is no doubt that future growth will also be driven significantly by it.","Keith Block","Yes Jason, [indiscernible] so a couple of things, I think there is still significant opportunity across all of our cloud certainly the Sales Cloud is our flagship, but as you know we have put in place multi-prong strategy to really change the relationship that we have with our customers and those are customers whether it\u2019s in the SMD space or whether it\u2019s in the enterprise space and it really starts with our focus on industries. One of the theses of feedback that I have heard over and over again from the customer base is how important it is to speak the language of industry and to build that trust based relationship and solve the business problems around an industry. So we have obviously launched our industry business unit to help assemble those solutions while ultimately will give us the opportunity to gain a lot more line share and having more strategic relationships with these customers.","We have also launched the strong initiative around our partners both our SI and the ISV ecosystem which is very-very important with our strategy and very important with our customers. We\u2019re getting incredible traction across all three of those of funds as well as focusing on international expansion. So when you really coupled the industry and partners together, it really raises our relevance within these accounts which will give the opportunity to continue drive momentum there.","Graham Smith","And Jason, this is Graham, just one more thing I have to add. I think one of the things we\u2019ve seen over the last few years is the continued underestimation of the market sizes I think directionally clearly we\u2019ve shown huge increase in share velocity use and consistent gains in shares, but I think the other exciting thing is then the trend all constant optimization of the market size. So I think that obviously gives us more confidence around continued growth with the Sales Cloud.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rick Sherlund.","Rick Sherlund - Nomura Securities","Yes, hi, thanks. Two questions first Keith, actually, both for Keith. Can you talk about the changes you\u2019ve made to the sales organization? And did it have any impact in Q1 so did you do well despite changes if you could kind of talk about that a bit? And also I think we\u2019re all waiting for nine figure deals is that realistic and is there -- are there deals of that magnitude in the pipeline we should look forward to over the balance of this year?","Keith Block","Hi, Rick. Thanks for the question. So a couple of things the question has before. There were no major reorganizations. We put strategy in place about six months ago around our industry growth plan and our partners and international stands and focus on continuation around the tracking retaining the best talent in the industry our most strategic accounts in specialized sales and really solving business problems as a person just necessarily selling products. And since those things have been in play for awhile, it really mitigated any sort of risk around reorganization that I think most people always are worried about when you start the fiscal year.","So these plans were put a little bit while ago and we continue to see traction. We actually saw traction in the second half of the year and we certainly saw that traction continue and the momentum continue Q1. Listen as far as large deal sizes go, I think the net-net of this thing as we continue to execute and we did a terrific job, and I am very proud of the team and the Company for how we executed in Q1 is only natural to assume that our relationships with these customers will become more meaningful and more strategic overtime and that will just translate into continue growth and we\u2019re excited about it.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Brent Thill.","Brent Thill - UBS","Thanks. For Marc, may be if you could just talk a little bit about Salesforce1 platform, it seems like there is a lot of really new interesting applications are being built that require the rest of the platform to be deployed to the helpers, if you will, on reinforcing the whole enterprise build out. Can you just give us a sense of what you are seeing from some of the larger commitments on the platform?","Marc Benioff","","Well, thanks for that question. We have made a huge investment on the Salesforce1 platform over the last couple of years and so many customers now have deployed it. And as a user myself, I can tell you how dramatically changed out how I work, as I mentioned I work in parallel with my phone but more than that I think it\u2019s, because we completely re-architected our product on a whole family of APIs and delivered a full range of services, it\u2019s really opened up the opportunity for our customers to build applications like that we have never really thought they were going to build before. One of the applications that I saw that got deployed this quarter was with Home Depot where they rolled out this amazing new, How-To application. And right on that, you got to right on homedepot.com, you will see our platform poking through where it gives them the ability to have deep engagement with all of their customers who are building and cloud sourcing and interacting with Home Depot employees and all in real-time and it\u2019s really all possible by the platform.","In addition to that we continue to see really strong support from the ISV community and if you go to the AppExchange, you will see more applications available for Salesforce1 than ever before and some of them are just incredibly well reviewed. I mean you will see hundreds or in some cases thousands of reviews around these apps and these are enterprise apps. I don\u2019t think there is another AppExchange or app store in the industry like that and so many new apps emerging for Salesforce1. The combination of this just gives us a tremendous competitive advantage with our customers and I will tell you why. A lot of our competitors, it\u2019s not that they haven\u2019t move to the phone, they have moved into cloud and here we are, we have a solution that\u2019s not only runs great as a service, as cloud service, running of billions of transactions every single day, two, that service is available in whatever device you are using. And three, it runs the way the any other cell-phone network would work like a Facebook or Twitter but it\u2019s your own private company network or with your partners or with customers.","And then finally, we are seeing now where companies can take all of this and build their own apps well that\u2019s really exceeded our, exceeded what could happen. So, we are very excited and we are feeling great about where Salesforce1 is and I really think it\u2019s given us this huge leg-up against the competition.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan from Merrill Lynch.","Kash Rangan - BofA\/Merrill Lynch","Hi, thank you very much. Marc, the off balance sheet backlog growth rate is just simply stunning. And I am curious if you could talk to which particular products the portfolio are driving that superb strength? And also with respect to Salesforce1, can you specifically talk about how the industry solution\u2019s strategy in the six verticals are going to be differentiated and facilitated with Salesforce1 in particular? Thank you very much.","Graham Smith","Hi, Kash, great to see you, so, let me just talk a little bit about the industry strategy and Salesforce1, I think Marc have touched on it. We are incredibly excited about the adoption of Salesforce 1 and how our ISV community is responding to it. And specific to industry, you may have seen a press release that we issued the other day with Deloitte and our partnership with Deloitte in financial services around financial services solutions, all built on our platform. And so there is enormous enthusiasm for the Salesforce1, our ISV community is rallying for the cause and that obviously is an integral part of our strategy. The other thing that I think is important to understand here is that as we continue our transformation, one of the things that we are trying to accomplish here is to solve business problems for our customers.","Whereas traditionally we will go to market by product and we will obviously continue to do that. I think the important thing is to listen to our customers and bring a point of view around an industry solution, again the example would be what we did, the press release that we did with Deloitte. And when you sale solution, you bring multiple clouds, so it\u2019s not necessarily one cloud or two cloud, it\u2019s a multi-cloud solution and that is certainly the momentum that we enjoyed over Q3 and Q4 and certainly saw that carry over in Q1 and that multi-cloud solution approach is really paying off for us and it looks very, very strong for us in the future. ","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with Piper Jaffray.","Mark Murphy - Piper Jaffray","Marc, your counselors and partners sound very excited about a product called Communities that for some reason it doesn\u2019t seem to be as widely recognized in the investment community. And we\u2019ve been told that it\u2019s capable of going wall to wall and really touching every employee in an organization. Could you walk us through what is happening under the radar with Communities and maybe any comment on how strategically significant the offering can be?","Marc Benioff","Yes, I\u2019d really be delighted to, and we announced this product at Dreamforce and we now have started rolling it out. I just mentioned it in my comments about Home Depot for example, which is a core part of the platform they\u2019ve rolled out which is Communities. But imagine if you will that I am using my phone, like I do, and I\u2019m using Salesforce1 and I'm going through my social network and I\u2019m reviewing what\u2019s happening with employees, what\u2019s happening on my deals, customer service issues, quotes, and my feed is going by and able to kind of roll between different apps that I am using. Maybe I\u2019m issuing a request, maybe I am giving an employee appraise. All of this is happening inside Salesforce1.","Now all of the sudden right inside the feed something appears and it says well, did you know that Frank Blake at Home Depot just commented on the product that you\u2019re working on. And what has happened is, is that externally on my website I\u2019m in a community of all of my customers. Now you could go -- you could see this right now if you go to I think success.salesforce.com is our community site. So if you go to success.salesforce.com, you will see what Communities looks like and you will see how we\u2019ve deployed Communities. ","So if there\u2019s customers that I\u2019m following, if there is a product I\u2019m following, events I\u2019m following, whatever I\u2019m working on and now I\u2019m a customer. I come in this site. I\u2019m automatically integrated to the Salesforce employees. And honestly I don\u2019t know a customer who doesn\u2019t need this, whether its partner communities, whether it\u2019s for customer service, whether and even this is for employee communities and so we\u2019re very excited and this is in the category of engagement.","So today it can also work this product the kind of tagline is Salesforce, sales service market to feed and you really see it evolve to be sales service market and engage. And the reason why is because of exactly we are saying -- it has been a tremendous success for us. We continue to see all customers to be very excited with this. This all started with Chatter if you remember that. That was kind of the brand. Now we\u2019ve kind of dropped the brand Chatter and it\u2019s all Salesforce1 now because it\u2019s also deeply integrated into our platform. You can\u2019t separate our core collaboration capabilities from our sales service or marketing platform applications and services.","So that\u2019s where we are right now. It\u2019s very exciting. You will see more Dreamforce and you\u2019re going to see us really continue to focus and expand this. I did want to make one key point, which is that this is not some separate app. This is really a core part of our platform and that we\u2019ve worked very, very hard to make sure that these are core platform services and the collaboration is at the very heart of who we are at Salesforce. Hope that answers your question.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs.","Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs","I had two questions, one for Marc and one for Keith. I guess Keith to start out with you, you mentioned the vertical solutions and this business problems that you are trying to solve as a result of your verticalization. How do we think about how long it takes for you to really take your stride to serve the customers in the way that you\u2019re thinking about it? And kind of back to Rick\u2019s question, how do we think about how deal sizes scale as you become that trusted solution provider if you use your past history as a guide?","And then the question I have for Marc just in regards to marketing cloud, a lot of the customers we talk to, talk about big desire to have one integrated dashboard for marketing so they could open app instead of opening multiple apps to kind of find out what they\u2019re doing, how they\u2019re doing with new products and with their customers. I\u2019m just wondering where you are as a company in terms of kind of pursuing that vision?","Keith Block","Yes. Hi Heather. So, I think it\u2019s very interesting; the industry focus for us is obviously very, very important and we saw, after only being organized around industries for I will say six months. We started to see that traction hit in Q4. I think you may remember that we pretty much had a run on retail banks in Q4, and that was all around our management solution that was put together by the industry business unit. That continued into Q1 where we -- to a certain extent we had a run on insurance companies.","So again part of that is because of our ability to speak the language of industry, which is all about solving customer business problems. So as we continue to roll those solutions out, I think you\u2019ll see us gain mind share again, build those strategic relationships, partner with the SI, partner with our ISVs and really being more meaningful and take on that trust advisor role. So it\u2019s only natural to assume and to expect that as all those things continue to gain momentum that there will be more mind share, there will be more [indiscernible] share, there will be more market share. So again very, very pleased with the kind of early returns in Q4 and Q1 but I think that we certainly have significant opportunity and I think that\u2019s how you\u2019ll see things scale overtime.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank.","Karl Keirstead - Deutsche Bank","","My question is for Graham. Graham, the operating cash flow growth 67%, pretty stellar. I think I understand the seasonality but I\u2019m just curious if there were any other kickers that made the quarter particularly strong on that front and if your confidence in your mid-20s operating cash flow growth for the full year has increased as a result of the good Q1 performance. Thank you.","Graham Smith","","Yes. I think it feels great to get a good start. So clearly confidence in mid-20 if I say is incrementally higher because of our strong start. So just to reiterate, this compounding effect just our large fourth quarter -- really has been going on over a long period of time? And then I think you layer on top of that. Clearly we\u2019ve also been expanding our annual billings. And then we saw some margin expansion sequentially from Q4 to Q1. Q4 was still affected by short-term cash flows from Dreamforce, those kind of things. And so you kind of roll that up and we saw really strong first quarter result. So as I said, I would expect this would be more of our trend in the future that we\u2019ll have this huge receivables number at the end of the fourth quarter and then a very large collections number in Q1. So very happy to get a strong start on the year here.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Pat Walravens with JMP Group.","Pat Walravens - JMP Group","","Two questions. I guess Graham can you tell us what the contribution was from ExactTarget in the quarter? And then Marc now that you have over 14,000 employees, it\u2019s got to be harder to maintain the same culture you had when you were smaller. How are you going about doing that?","Marc Benioff","","Well I\u2019ll take that one first, and also I didn\u2019t answer Heather\u2019s question. First, so why don\u2019t I hit that real quickly. Heather is absolutely right. Our plan is to build a comprehensive marketing cloud and to do that we\u2019ve acquired several different companies recruiting, Radian6, Buddy Media and ExactTarget and we\u2019re integrating those into one integrated application which our customers will have used to comprehensively manage their marketing and you\u2019ll see the evolution of that product at Dreamforce.","What I would say is that to really understand where we\u2019re going and how we\u2019re maintaining this culture, you have to look at our product. And I am sure that that must sound a little bit strange but I use Salesforce1 every day and I\u2019m communicating and collaborating with our employees. We have an environment that\u2019s filled with transparency and that transparency has created an environment of trust.","And that much communication or what I call over communication is kind of part of what we\u2019re doing all the time. We over communicate, we over align, we\u2019re constantly working on what we call V2MOM which is kind of our internal business process service, which lets us work on our visions, our values, our methods, obstacles and measurements. All of that is built into our application. And then at the core is our philanthropy model.","When we first started the company we put 1% of our equity and 1% of our profit and 1% of all of our employees\u2019 time into a 501(c)(3) charity. As I mentioned in the script, that produces amazing results, like the 700,000 hours of community service and more than 50 million in grants and 20,000 nonprofits. But one thing that\u2019s interesting is in your first day of employment at Salesforce we show you where your desk is, we show you where the kitchen is and then you go out and do something for other people. And you go to one of our soup kitchens here in San Francisco, you go to one of our homeless shelters, you go to one of our hospitals. And that really sets the tone of our culture. And it also provides the referential integrity for our culture.","And our culture is different than other technology companies. And when and as we\u2019ve grown our Company, we\u2019ve been able to maintain that culture by starting -- making sure that its philanthropy first and that has really set the values that are so important to us.","So when we look at values like trust, values like giving back, like service and then of course we have tremendous execution. That\u2019s also a key value that we do we say we\u2019re going to do. We delivered obviously a great quarter this quarter but this is not our first great quarter. We\u2019ve had a lot of great quarters. And those things are the things that have really cemented our culture and that\u2019s why it continues to be what it is today. So I hope that answers your question.","Keith Block","And just on your second question we don\u2019t intend to provide a breakout of the exact target going forward on either the P&L or the balance sheet.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Ashley with Robert W. Baird.","Steve Ashley - Robert W. Baird","My question is for Keith. Keith, you mentioned you\u2019ve been earlier talking to customers and what message is it that you wanted to convey to them? What did you want them to take away from your meetings?","Keith Block","Well, I think there are several messages that are important, not the least of which is our corporate messages around the Internet of customers and connected customers and how we sell and service in market and how we are a company of system engagement. So those are all very strong messages that certainly resonate with our customers and our partners. But the other set of conversations that take place are around a dialog around having a strategic relationship with those customers and what does that mean.","And that is all around predictability and transparency, some of the values that Marc talked about earlier. It\u2019s about trust, it\u2019s about being an advisor. It\u2019s about how do those contribute to how our customers unleash the power of social and cloud and mobile in our technologies to change their business models, to transform their businesses and really unshackle them from old technologies. Because if you really think about what\u2019s happened in the marketplace, companies have had business processes around selling and servicing and marketing to their customers that have really been hindered slash shackled by old technologies and we are providing them with a path forward here in that guidance. So these are messages that truly resonate with customers. They want these conversations. They want this impact that we can bring to the table and they\u2019re excited about our opportunity to partner with them.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley.","Keith Weiss - Morgan Stanley","Two questions from Graham. One related to headcount, definitely a big increase in headcount this quarter. Should we think about this in any extent in terms of sort of a pull forward of hiring, of getting a lot of the hiring done upfront or what kind of pace should we think about throughout the year? And question number two, if we look back seasonally, you typically see deferred revenues up 2 to 3 percentage point\u2019s quarter on quarter into Q2 and your guidance is approximately flat. Does that sort of hold with the normal seasonality or should we be thinking about a different seasonality this year versus prior years?","Graham Smith","Thanks Keith. So, on the headcount question, typically we\u2019ve often had slow starts to our hiring in the year and then we\u2019ve sort of built on organic hiring versus people we bring in through acquisitions through the year and we really have tried to focus hard this year on getting off to a fast start and have slightly more linear hiring and it actually seems to have worked really well. So we\u2019re just pleased that I don\u2019t view this necessarily as an intentional pull forward generally but I think we are -- we\u2019ve got a lot of fantastic news coming out of the Company, able to see some of our facilities announcements are super exciting in San Francisco and I think it\u2019s fair to say we\u2019re still very much as the destination employer and I think our reputation out there is great and our hiring in Q1 sort of reflects that profile.","On your second question, I think generally, clearly we\u2019ve said in the past, deferred revenues always got a little bit of -- it\u2019s a tough number to forecast super accurately. I think there is a sort of general scene that relates to what I talked about earlier around the compounding effect of our fourth quarter and because Q4 is largely a business quarter it becomes a large renewals quarter and it just becomes more and more dominant in terms of its invoicing. And as you know, invoicing drives deferred revenue.","So I think gradually over time that Q4 spike of deferred revenue and then a more flattish profile through the year is gradually going to change over the year. It\u2019s tough to know how quickly but we haven\u2019t changed anything in the methodology, the way we forecast deferred revenue, and clearly as I said it\u2019s tough to get super accurate on either a $2.3 billion number but I\u2019d say that that overall trend that I described is probably will play out over the next few years.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick with Macquarie.","Brad Zelnick - Macquarie","Dr. Benioff, congrats on a good quarter but I really also have to congratulate you on receiving your honorary Doctorate degree last week from USC in recognition of your great achievements, particularly your philanthropy. So congratulations. I really just wanted to -- I wanted to ask about the marketing cloud, Marc. When you acquired ExactTarget, you said we shouldn\u2019t expect any large deals for a while as you digested the acquisition. But I just wanted to check in and see how do you feel today about the completeness of the marketing cloud and what\u2019s your appetite to further build it out through acquisitions?","Marc Benioff","","Well, I think that we have done a fantastic job building our marketing cloud and it\u2019s a very important market. It\u2019s something our customers have pushed us to and you saw us start with the Region 6 where we moved in the social listening of Buddy Media with social publishing. But then with ExactTarget, which is really a comprehensive application and that is really go into a whole new level with our journey builder capabilities. And if you have seen some of the demonstrations that I\u2019ve done on the Salesforce1 tour, you will notice that ExactTarget marketing cloud has just gone leaps and bounds from when we really first started working on it. Now, as we kind of go forward, there is still gaps in terms of things that we want to fill-in. When we\u2019ll fill those in, what the right companies are? It\u2019s not as easy and not straight forward as it was. We honestly got the best company. I don\u2019t think we could have ended up with a better company than ExactTarget and they have so much product and capability that it\u2019s really kept us incredibly satiated.","And I don\u2019t really see that pace like you saw that we were really going through resuming. That said, we are always looking for great new companies and when we see a great entrepreneur or we see a great company or we see a great revenue stream or we see a great way to cement our position in our market, which is all customer facing applications, we\u2019re going to take that.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citigroup.","Walter Pritchard - Citigroup","","Hi Graham, I\u2019m wondering if you could talk a bit about -- you have talked for a few years about this matrix with growth and profits as sort of the two coordinates and it feels like you are sort of solidly into the growth part of your matrix here versus high growth or maturity and in that phase you were talking about 100 to 300 basis points of margin expansion. And you\u2019ve given guidance for the year I think of a 125 to 150 basis points of margin expansion. You still are absorbing some of the ExactTarget expenses that are on-board here. I\u2019m wondering if you could just talk to, do you feel like you are really within the high end of that range, if we were to consider ExactTarget? And any sort of commentary as we move throughout the year, with most of that solution behind us and then look at next year, how we should think about you on this matrix?","Graham Smith","","Thanks, Walter. I think my recollection of the model, I don\u2019t have it in front of me but basically we have said, if we are growing at 30% plus, so I think yes, people could reasonably expect, absent very significant M&A, they could reasonably expect a 100 basis points plus of margin improvement in a year. We\u2019ve sort of committed to a little higher than that this year and clearly we will get -- it\u2019s a little backend loaded because as you say, really the effects of all the purchase accounting related ExactTarget pulled away after the first half and then we get sort of the bulk of the revenue write-downs done and clearly we\u2019re sort of -- we're forecasting quite a strong second half EPS performance year and overall our EPS performance this year, we\u2019re forecasting at sort of 50% type increase in overall non-GAAP EPS.","So I think we feel that model works. I think as long as we are growing that top line more than 30%, I think, again absent major M&A, we feel good about delivering a 100 basis points plus a year and hopefully this year we\u2019ll do little better than that. We\u2019ll see.","Operator","","Your last question comes from the line of Richard Davis with Canaccord.","Richard Davis - Canaccord","","I realized it\u2019s somewhat small but what you kind of think about drawing the line on HR because I guess right now it\u2019s ripple social performance management but do you need to get deeper into HR to fully monetize that purchase? I am just wondering how your thoughts on that component are? Thanks.","Marc Benioff","","We\u2019re not an HR software company. We\u2019re the CRM, we\u2019re really a customer relationship management software company and all of our focus is customer facing applications, sales, service, marketing, engagement. And our -- any HR capabilities that we have inside our product are really just -- allow our employees to collaborate and share in the engagement world. So whether its employee profiles or the performance management that\u2019s built into the field, that\u2019s where our focus is then. But we\u2019re not really interested in the HR software market. We will let others worry about that one. ","John Cummings","All right. Hannah, thank you so much for hosting us today. Thanks everyone on the call for joining us.

(Operator Instructions) Thank you.","Mr. John Cummings, Senior Director of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.","John Cummings","Thanks so much, Christie. Good afternoon and thanks for joining us today to discuss our fiscal fourth quarter and full-year 2014 results. Our fourth quarter results press release, SEC filings and a webcast replay of today's call can be found on our Investor Relations website at www.salesforce.com\/investor. We will also be post the highlights of today's call on Twitter at the handle @Salesforce_IR.","With me today, are Marc Benioff, Chief Executive Officer and Graham Smith, Chief Financial Officer. Marc and Graham will open with a few remarks. Then we will open the call for questions. Our commentary today will primarily be in non-GAAP terms. Reconciliations between our GAAP and non-GAAP results and guidance can be found in our earnings press release issued earlier today.","During the call, we may offer additional metrics to provide further insight into our business or results. This detail may or may not be provided in the future. We may also reference certain unreleased services or features not yet available. We cannot guarantee the future timing or availability of these services or features and so recommend that customers make purchase decisions based on services and features currently available.","The purpose of today's call is to provide you with information regarding our fiscal fourth quarter 2014 results. Some of our comments may contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Should any of these risks or uncertainties materialize or should our assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual company results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements.","A description of risks, uncertainties, and assumptions and other risk factors that could affect our financial results are included in our SEC filings, included in our most recent report on Form 10-Q, particularly under the heading, Risk Factors.","With all that, I will turn it over to Marc.","Marc Benioff","All right, fantastic. Well, thank you so much. Really appreciate it and first of all, before we get started, John I just wanted to tell everyone that I am thrilled to announce that just this morning salesforce was named by Fortune magazine as the world's number one most admired software company. It's the second year in a row that we have received this tremendous recognition from Fortune magazine. I just want to thank them so much and we are delighted to have that honor. And I would also like to congratulate our team here at salesforce for just an outstanding performance for our fourth quarter and fiscal year. I just want to thank all of our employees, our customers, our partners, everyone, as I am sure everyone can see by our numbers we had a spectacular finish to yet what is absolutely another year of just exceptional growth.","Now, if you haven't had a chance to look at the numbers, you will see that revenue for the fourth quarter rose 37% from year ago to $1.15 billion, and our full fiscal year 2014 revenue grew 33% to more than $4 billion and we are about to push through this $5 billion milestone run rate and any minute you can see that.","No other software company of our size and scale is growing at this speed. Deferred revenue grew by 35% year-over-year to more than $2.5 billion and the dollar value of book business on and off the balance sheet is now $7 billion and I am sure everyone has seen that we have raised our guidance by $100 million, which is really unusual and just really speaks to the acceleration that we have had in our business to $5.3 billion. We are going to get into that detail in a moment.","Now, during the quarter, we significantly grew the number of seven and eight figure transactions compared to the fourth quarter of last year, we had more than 200 transactions in the quarter that were seven figures or more, including more than 10, 8 figure transactions and that is just really exceptional for a software company in the CRM space and CRM to do see more than 200 transactions that were seven figures or greater is just incredible and I know that none of our peers are seeing these large transaction volume like this.","In addition, I am also delighted to announce that we are raising our fiscal year 2015 revenue guidance by $100 million to $5.3 billion, which is the full year growth rate of 30% at the high-end of our range. We couldn't be more happy about that and we are committed to improving non-GAAP profitability by 125 to 150 basis points, which is a huge goal of mine for this year and increasing cash flow growth this year, while also continuing to deliver on this outstanding pace of top line growth.","Just a great job by the company, I just want to congratulate everybody. For 15 years, salesforce has been the catalyst and evangelist for innovation enterprise software and now we can really see the next-generation has occurred. Customers are really connecting with their customers in entirely new ways. We are benefiting from that.","We are absolutely entering this third wave of computing where everything is connected and customer relationship management really is the heart of all this, because behind every [tweet] [ph], behind every app, behind everything is a customer and this is our message as we get out on tour that everything that is happening is about the customer and this vision has opened the door for thousands of companies and empowered them to connect with their customers in a deeper way through this next-generation devices, and apps and products, and if you are at Dreamforce, more than 140,000 people registered to attend and experience the power of Dreamforce this year they saw Salesforce1.","Salesforce1, everyone has used it, for the 250 ISVs that are building on top of it, for all the custom codes that already been deployed on it by our customers, is just a radically new customer platform for the Internet of customers that is social, that is mobile, it is cloud, it connects everything and I use it every day myself and I will tell you the story, we are closing out our fiscal year, it was the end of January and I was invited by a friend of mine Walter Rob who was at Dreamforce [inaudible] to come down and be at a dinner in Arizona and you know everyone of course is enjoying their dinner and under the table I have my iPhone and I am able to see all my analytics and everything exactly how the quarter is closing; I don't think there is probably too many CEOs who have that power today, but it is something that everybody needs, because everybody wants to run their business on their phone and because Salesforce1 was built API first, because it can connect with anything and everything that runs on all these mobile devices completely transforms how you run your business, and I am thrilled to announce that we have more than 250 major ISVs who\u2019ve signed up to build Salesforce1 apps on our AppExchange and more than 30 Salesforce1 apps like Evernote and Dropbox, LinkedIn and HP are live on the AppExchange today that is really exciting.","Our focus on the customer success, the adoption of our technology, making this technology market transitions, the movement to things like mobile, the movement to cloud, the movement to the social, the movement to the world - connected world that really have defined salesforce over last 15 years and is why you see today, the service cloud is the world's number one platform for customer service and support, and in this new Forrester Wave, which I look at these Forrester Wave as my guide to where the industry is going. Forrester is a phenomenal research organization. They really just changed the game when it comes to research in the technology industry. And I was with their CEO at The World Economic Forum. He keynoted and lad the kickoff panel for The World Economic Forum this year. We have really seen this incredible shift.","In addition to our Service Cloud with Desk.com, we are bringing the small customer service concept to small business as well. That has been just an incredible addition to our momentum. The ExactTarget Marketing Cloud is the world's most powerful customer platform for one-to-one marketing, probably one of the really great accomplishments of the year, not just Salesforce1, but also the ExactTarget Marketing Cloud really defining that salesforce as the absolute leader in marketing today.","And I mentioned Forrester, according to them, spending on digital marketing is going to double in five years to represent 30% of total marketing spend by 2017 and I think you have heard me say that I really think that it's imminent that CMO's are going to be spending more on technology than CIOs. Our flagship Sales Cloud is the world's number one platform for sales. Undisputed leader in CRM according to IDC another phenomenal research organization. In addition, we are consistently ranked as well in that area by Forrester as well.","So really cool growth in sales, in service, in marketing which are huge growth areas for our industry and in our platform, the number one platform for developing next generation apps. Of course, we have got this incredible trifecta with force.com, Heroku and Fuel which is the ExactTarget platform, the ability to build these next-generation apps is why more than 1.5 million app developers are now in our platforms, up 50% from last year. Thousand ISVs developing on our platform, so much activity on the AppExchange, so many new mobile apps happening on Salesforce1, so many new marketing apps happening on Fuel, phenomenal productivity of developers with Heroku, especially these Ruby developers that love Heroku.","And now with our next generation of service, marketing, sales and platform technologies these companies have all the tools they need to connect with their customers in these new ways. For example, Humana, who is one of the largest healthcare providers in the U.S. selected our Service Cloud in the quarter. They will get a service button, right inside their apps. We saw that also at Dreamforce. We saw Philips embed a service button right on their ultrasound machine. That's obviously a huge trend and everybody needs a Service Cloud and everybody needs a help button on their product. A physical button or a virtual button.","In the quarter, we also strengthened our partnership with General Electric and their oil and gas group. They\u2019ve selected Service Cloud, ExactTarget Marketing Cloud and the platform to connect drilling and exploration equipment. Great, obviously. I am huge fan of General Electric and their CEO spoke at Dreamforce in the previous year. Maersk, one of the world's largest shipping and transportation companies selected our Service Cloud and Salesforce1 to bring all their customer product and supply chain together.","So the pace at which these companies are embracing our next generation customer platform is phenomenal. Our progress with Salesforce1 is phenomenal. Our progress with the Marketing Cloud is phenomenal. Of course, we also brought in an incredible new distribution leader this year with Keith Block who has completely transformed how we are going to market.","Taking those three things into consideration, I am absolutely thrilled to tell you that our service delivered more than 100 billion transactions in the quarter, up 49% from the year ago, an average of more than 1.7 billion transactions every single business day. Nothing speaks more to the value of salesforce than the actual usage of our products, their adoption, the speed, the reliability, the trust that our customers have come to expect and that customer success is also why I am also very pleased to announce that our attrition is down to the lowest level we have seen in the history of our company, so very exciting progress by our organization in that area.","Look, it has been a spectacular year for salesforce, for our customers, our partners, our employees. We are looking forward to being the first enterprise cloud computing to achieve more than $5 billion in revenue this year. Before I close, I do want to let you know we are out on tour again. We have our Salesforce1 world tour. You may have come to see me, already kick that off in New York, you can come to Philadelphia on March 6, Pennsylvania Convention Center, you could come to Melbourne on March 26, Boston on April 2nd Chicago on April 24th, London on May 22nd, Amsterdam on the 27th Washington DC on May 29th, Atlanta on June 12, Toronto on June 25th, Paris on June 26th, I am going to be really busy this year, but we have got a huge message to get out there that the world is going social, it is going mobile going clouds and it's getting connected. It's an Internet of customers and behind every app, behind every device, behind everything, behind the Internet of everything is the customer and you can connect with that customer in a whole new way.","You can have the same great success with your business that we are having with our business and that we wish that for all of our customers this has been a better year and I am absolutely thrilled to do that and I want to say Graham, your contribution with company success over past six years can't be overstated. It has been amazing and we are announcing your retirement on the call. You are going to be leaving the company a little bit more than a year from now in March of 2015 is something that you and I have talked about for some time, something that you wanted to do and I respect very much, because you just delivered phenomenal success for us and you are leaving our company in an incredibly great financial position and we are thrilled to have one more exciting year for you coming up.","We will be sorry to see go, of course, and we have a world-class set of the financial professionals who worked closely with Graham, but Graham you are a phenomenal CFO, so thank you.","Graham Smith","Okay. Thank you, Marc. Yes. We are all going to have 2015, so that is hopefully going to be just a fantastic year to finish my spell here at salesforce on. Before I get into that, let me just spend a little bit of time on the financial details.","As Marc described, we had just a great year at salesforce. We closed the largest acquisition in our history. We launched our Salesforce1 platform and we added a number of industry-leading executives and our financial results this year were just outstanding with strong growth in revenue, deferred revenue and operating cash flow.","We saw strength across both, our enterprise and commercial businesses and ExactTarget posted just a terrific finish to the year. In addition, we achieved a new milestone for customer success with the attrition dropping to record lows. I will give you little more detail on that in a second.","Let me take you through the highlights for the quarter and the year, starting with revenue and EPS, so fourth quarter revenue was $1.145 billion, that's up from 37% over Q4 last year. If you excluding the FX headwind of approximately $3 million, Q4 revenue is actually up 38%.","ExactTarget contributed approximately $96 million to revenue in the fourth quarter, which was higher than we expected. Non-GAAP EPS for the fourth quarter was $0.07. That was a $0.01 ahead of our expectations. Full year revenue was $4.071 billion. That is up 33% over fiscal '13, excluding an FX headwind of approximately $24 million, full year revenue was up 34% year-over-year.","ExactTarget contributed approximately $194 million for the full year. Full year non-EPS was $0.35. Looking to Q4, year-over-year growth on a regional basis, Americas revenue grew 41% to $821 million. Revenue in Europe grew, also, 41% dollars 35% in constant currency to $210 million and revenue in Asia increased 12% in dollars and 24% in constant currency to $115 million.","As mentioned dollar attrition in the fourth quarter, now that is excluding ExactTarget, it's all attritional, all of this is excluding ExactTarget get below 10%, so it's a high single-digit number of the post office in numerical low in our history company, so just a phasing result process finish the year.","Turning to margins, fourth quarter fourth quarter non-GAAP gross margin was 80% while our Q4 non-GAAP operating margin 6.9%. For the full year non-GAAP gross margin was also 80% and our non-GAAP operating margin was 89%. The reduction in our fully margins reflect the acquisition of ExactTarget, as well as the Oracle license agreements this time during the year. Our Q4 operating margin was further impacted by the occurrence of Dreamforce in November, whereas last year, Dreamforce was included in our Q3 results.","Turning to hiring. We added more than 500 people in the fourth quarter and more than 3,500 new employees in the full fiscal year bringing our total headcount to just over 13,300. That is up 36% over last year.","Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the year with approximately $1.3 billion in cash and marketable securities. That is down from approximately $1.8 billion last year. Accounts receivable was up 56% over last year to approximately $1.4 billion. Deferred revenue ended the year at $2.5 billion, up 35% over last year, including approximately $99 million related to ExactTarget. Excluding approximately $8 million of year-over-year FX headwind, deferred revenue increased 36%. On a sequential quarter basis, deferred revenue also had an FX headwind of approximately $8 million. Deferred revenue continued to benefit from the residual effects of multiyear invoices and from the continued shift toward annual billing. The combined benefit to deferred revenue in Q4 was approximately $75 million, up from $67 million sequentially, but down from $125 million in Q4 last year.","As we had mentioned in Q3, given the declining impact from the shift to annual invoicing we initiated actually over two years ago now, this will be the last time, we provide the specific dollar impact on deferred revenue. However, we do plan to continue to provide the proportion of annual invoices issued in the quarter, excluding ExactTarget or approximately 83% of the value of all subscription of support related invoices that were issued with annual terms in Q4. That is compared with approximately 80% in Q4 last year. For ExactTarget, we are really pleased to see improvements in their mix of annual billing in Q4, which increased approximately 10 points over Q4 last year. So great progress there. Unbilled deferred revenue or revenue that is contracted but not yet invoiced and is off the balance sheet was approximately $4.5 billion in Q4. That's an increase of approximately 29% over the last year.","Turning to cash flow. Q4 operating cash flow was $271 million, down 4% over Q4 last year but actually above our expectations. For the full fiscal year, operating cash flow was $875 million, up 19% over fiscal '13. So very strong result, when you consider that ExactTarget reduced our full year operating cash flow by more than $50 million during the year.","CapEx was $70 million in the fourth quarter, up 38% year-over-year and $299 million for the full year. That's up 70% over last year. The year-over-year increase in CapEx was principally related to new office build outs and to a lesser extent ExactTarget. CapEx as a percentage of revenue in the fourth quarter was 6% unchanged from Q4 of last year.","Free cash flow, which we define as operating cash flow less CapEx, was $201 million in the fourth quarter, down 13% from last year. For the full year, free cash flow was $576 million, up 3% over fiscal '13.","Turning to guidance. With our strong finish to fiscal 2014, we are expected to be raising our full year 2015 revenue outlook by $100 million to $5.25 billion to $5.3 billion. And that gives a year-over-year revenue growth range of 29% to 30%. As you have heard from Marc and me, we are committed to improving non-GAAP margins. We expect full year non-GAAP EPS in the range of the $0.48 to $0.50 which implies an increase in our non-GAAP operating margin of 125 to 150 basis points. That assumes no significant M&A activity during the year. Our FY15 non-GAAP EPS also assumes that other income expense will continue to be a net expense and we are also assuming a non-GAAP tax rate of 36.5%.","We have made some changes to our non-GAAP tax forecasting. So let me just spend a minute to provide some color on that. In an effort to provide more consistency for guidance and reporting purposes, we will be, or I should begin using a fixed long-term non-GAAP predicted tax rate. In this case, 36.5%. This non-GAAP tax rate eliminates the effects of nonrecurring and few specific items which can vary has varied in size and frequency. We will provide updates to this fixed rate annually or if a situation arises, of course, a significant change to our assumptions around the projected rate and continued by reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP tax rate in the detailed financials on the income tax effects and adjustments. For fiscal 2015, we expect operating cash flow to grow in mid-20s percent range and expect CapEx to be approximately 5% to 7%, in line with historical averages.","Turning to Q1, we anticipate revenue in the range of $1.205 billion, to $1.21 billion, representing year-over-year growth 35% to 36%, expect non-EPS in the range of $0.09 to $0.10 and we expect Q1 deferred revenue growth in the low 30% range.","During the first quarter, we are committed to retain in cash an aggregate principal balance of more than $280 million - conversions of our $575 million, 75 basis points senior notes, which we issued in January, just four-and-a-half year ago, due January 2015. We will likely see continued conversions during fiscal 2015, which will have an impact on our cash flow, as well as our financing cash flows and cash balance - financing cash flows throughout the year.","As a reminder, all of the underlying assumptions for our GAAP to non-GAAP guidance and a complete GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation can be found in our earnings press release issued today.","Just before moving onto Q&A, I want to briefly address my future retirement that Marc talked about and we announced today. I could not be more convinced of salesforce.com's long-term success this year. We will celebrate our 15 anniversary and also our 10th year as a public company and am sure the next decade we will see salesforce.com growth to be one all the very largest software companies in the world and I really enjoy being part of the salesforce team for the past six years and I want to thank everybody who I had worked pretty close within salesforce panel advisors for helping me and the company be so successful. I look forward toward helping executive team with the CFO search process and obviously ensuring at very smooth transition takes 13 months.","With that, we will open the call up for questions.","Marc Benioff","Okay. Before we do that, I just want to come back and just say, Graham, thank you so much contribution of our success for the last six years. I really cannot overstate what you have done to the company and when you are with this retirement, you are going to leave an unbelievable legacy and I could not be more grateful, so thank you very much.","Graham will be speaking next week at the Raymond James conference in Florida, so come and see Graham there and I will also be speaking at the Morgan Stanley conference here in San Francisco on Tuesday at 12:00 pm to 12:40 and I will be also joined by our Chief Accounting Officer. Joe Allanson, so please come and see me and Joe on Tuesday.","All right, so with that I will turn it over to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Kash Rangan with Merrill Lynch.","Kash Rangan - Merrill Lynch","Hi. Thank you very much. Graham, if you are looking for career advice on what to do next, I highly recommend sales side equity research, but Marc, for you, can you talk more about the platform? Obviously you launched Salesforce1 with a mobile-centric approach to the market.","Can you talk about some of the largest transactions that the company is pulling down, especially post Salesforce1 and how does the composition of your business (Inaudible) now vis-\u00e0-vis a healthy sales cloud and service cloud all relative to platform. Thank you very much. That's it from me.","Marc Benioff","Well, I really appreciate that question, because it is really the heart of our strategy and something where I will spend a huge amount of my personal time this year getting salesforce1 right.","You know Kash because you follow enterprise software so closely that I do not think there is any company whose enterprise software has moved as well as our has to the phone. Not only do we have a compelling mobile experience for our sales, service, and marketing clouds, but you can also build your own custom applications and deploy whatever you need to automate your company right onto the phone and as an ISV, you can also publish right into Salesforce1.","It looks a lot like Facebook or Twitter does on an iPhone or an Android, but you are running your business and we are the first ones there. It's a huge competitive advantage for salesforce. It's a critical part of every sales cycle and we are moving into a phone world. I have said this on the call before, I strongly believe in the future of phone. I think phones are getting larger, faster and that your software has to run really well on the phone and ours does and perhaps only ours does. I think that's certainly true today. I don't know for how long that will be true for but I haven't seen anyone else really deliver a vision of enterprise software on the phone.","On my phone, I can manage my feed, I manage all of my groups, all my employee information, my analytics and dashboards, my schedules and all the critical ISV apps as well that I use as well as custom apps and in the salesforce we have just some really great apps that we have deployed internally that are custom to us. Everything from managing our IT trouble, tickets, to even giving feedback on Salesforce1 to creating a task for our Customers For Life organization and it's the heart of everything we do.","Now we have got a lot of horses in the race here and we are not a single product company anymore. We are a multi product company and we have got many products. Sales Cloud is certainly a phenomenal success story. It's a multibillion dollar product line. Service Cloud is incredible. Marketing Cloud, you know what those numbers are and you see that growth rate. Platform is right there. So we have got four incredible product lines and that's our focus today, the Sales Cloud, the Service Cloud, the Marketing Cloud and the Platform and it is certainly our goal that each one of those are multibillion dollar products.","That's our strategic direction and we are very focused on the strategies, the communication, the branding, the acquisitions, necessary to make sure that those four things are all multibillion dollar products. And there aren't that many companies in our industry who have been able to deliver that kind of multi product success, but we have and we have a clear strategy. Those are the four legs of our stool and we going to continue to execute on that and we believe that the customer is the heart of that strategy that we have everything necessary to connect with the customers in a whole new way and for these customers who are signing huge deals with us, with Salesforce1 as the core platform, with this Sales, Service, Marketing, Platform strategy, we have got the right story and we have the right solution. You can go to the App Store or Google Play Store right now and download it and use it and try it and you can see it. It's phenomenal.","Operator","Your next question comes from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley.","Keith Weiss - Morgan Stanley","Excellent. Thank you guys. Graham, it has been a pleasure working with you over the past six years. I am going to direct the question your way. The reduction in the attrition rate to under 10% is a great accomplishment. I think it talks a lot about business stickiness up, (inaudible) solution and increasing [strategic initiatives] [ph] solutions. But I think it also talks to the operational controls that you guys have put in place. The question after that is, do you think there is room for further improvement in that? As your product offerings get more strategic, then maybe from an operational perspective to get that attrition rate even lower?","Graham Smith","Yes, thanks. We are obviously delighted to see that rate finally drop below 10%. It feels like I think it\u2019s 18 [inaudible]. It has been a long journey, but I think there is certainly still room for improvement. I think we\u2019ve talked in the past about the different programs we have, the early warning systems we have, the shift to enterprise and I think clearly bringing in the new leadership team with Keith Block and Tony Fernicola has certainly I think added to that just absolute credibility in the enterprise space. We frankly see very, very low attrition rates in enterprise. So for us, I think, it's a lot more about working on the big market and small business. I think you will see us continue to do that. I don't think you should expect \u2013 you\u2019ve seen the rate of decline has been slow and steady. And I think we will be working hard to basically keep that going over the next few years. It's impossible for me to give you a credible forecast, but I think it certainly can go lower over time if we keep working at it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Murphy with Piper Jaffray.","Mark Murphy - Piper Jaffray","Yes. Thank you very much, Marc. When you consider how the marketing battle is developing and in particular as it relates to Adobe, how are you thinking about some of Adobe's competencies including content management and website analytics and also how do you think that Adobe and maybe Oracle feel about trying to take on salesforce's dominant leadership position in some of the areas that are going to be so synergistic to marketing and in other words, the Sales Cloud and the Service Clouds, do you think it is really feasible to try to become a system of engagement, if you do not own those assets?","Marc Benioff","I love Adobe. I mean, I used their products since I was at Apple, when they created a postscript for the laser partners and those founders who still guide - that company are two of the most visionary people I think in the Industry and it is a great organization. They obviously participate in the marketing market and said do we and so do others because it is a big market.","As we said, CMOs are going to be spending more on technology than CIOs and I don't think that this is not a zero-sum game. I think there is plenty of room for everybody and I have been investing as you probably know for the last two or three years now, because we believe so strongly in this and we have bought quite a few assets and tried a lot of different things, because we had to kind of find our way through this opportunity and we certainly have done that, and you can see we have bought [the premier] [ph] asset in the market last year.","There is just no question we are number one in email marketing or number one in social listen in, we are number one in social publishing. We are number one in social advertising with social.com, which is the number one provider of services to advertisers on Facebook. I think it manages about 10% of Facebook's ad spend approximately and we just see a lot of potential going forward.","One of the most exciting things with ExactTarget is the complete reconceptualization of their product into Journey Builder, and for those of you who have seen us now, demonstrate that it is a whole new vision for the marketer that's getting great response.","As part of the ExactTarget acquisition, I think we also ended up with phenomenal asset called Pardot, which was actually a huge part of the quarter. It was one of the absolute fastest growing products we have ever seen. It's tightly integrated with our Sales Cloud and would be even more tightly integrated. It competes in that lead nurturing marketplace and that's another area. There's a lot of different places to play in marketing and I think that we are absolutely a player in marketing.","I think one of our key assets, of course, is our large and extremely well-run direct sales organization and also that customers want that marketing cloud to be tightly integrated with what they are doing with sales and service, but I want to make it clear. I really think that there is plenty of room here for everybody. There is a lot of great companies out there. Adobe is a great company and we are going to be the number one marketing cloud in the world.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays.","Raimo Lenschow - Barclays","Graham, it's great working with you and maybe don't listen to cash-only career type. Quick one, this quarter, we saw a big increase in large deals. Can you talk a little bit about the drivers there? How much of that was Keith Block already and how much can we expect more from him?","How much was the customers' buying into division of salesforce in terms of the day in force in terms of his employment the extent of product. so, just kind of had a discount at the beginning of the trend will continue. Thank you.","Graham Smith","Thank you. I think if you look at large deals for salesforce, they do tend to be quite seasonal. It's the end of our fiscal year, our sales reps and architect, you know, their own compensation plans to accommodate in a large transaction at the fiscal year of the fiscal year. It's kind of the nature of the enterprise software business, and if you go back and look at we tend to reported at the end of every year the number of the large transactions in the fourth quarter that occur, I think you will see that we have just had really good symmetrical growth of our large transactions, but also our small and medium transactions as well.","We run a full portfolio of business on full portfolio of geographies. There are large enterprises are important, the small business is important, the medium business is important. We have a complex distribution organization which is why we are so fortunate this year to attract a great leader, Keith Block, to run that for us. He is also a member of our Board of Directors and he has done a great job. He has hired a great management team and we know we couldn't be better positioned for continued excellence in distribution.","Graham Smith","And Raimo, just a reminder on the numbers. So we reported more than 200 seven and eight digit transactions this quarter. Q4 a year ago was over 150. So that more or less mirrors that growth irate of 30% plus range. So as Marc says, very symmetric growth.","Marc Benioff","And I think that that's really the most important thing because as the CEO, I want all aspects of the business to be growing with equanimity and that we don't leave any one segment or any one geography behind because the strength of the company and the reason why we see salesforce delivering a 37% growth opportunity here, is because we manage that full portfolio of revenue. We talked about that on a number of calls, but we have done that very well and that's a key part of our strategy. I don't like to overemphasize any one area, but in the enterprise, like I said, I don't know any other company that got close to more than 200 transactions in the seven and eight digit category in customer relationship management enterprise software this quarter or any quarter before this.","Operator","Your next question comes from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs.","Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs","Great. Thank you. Congratulations and yes, Graham I echo everyone's thoughts and you will definitely be missed. My question, Marc, is, I guess I have two questions, one for Marc and one for Graham. Marc, how do you think about the integration of your Marketing Cloud asset and how important will the ultimate integration of these assets be to further inflecting the growth that you are seeing in that cloud to get to the vision that you are talking about a few years down the road? Then I have got a follow-up for Graham.","Marc Benioff","Well, thanks, Heather. As usually, I think that your question is actually something that is very relevant for where we are right now and I will tell you exactly how I think about this. You know, the marketing area, some parts need to be very deeply integrated and some parts can be loosely coupled. In the deeply integrated area, lead nurturing for example, with Pardot, you go to pardot.com and you look at the website, you look at the integration, that we have done so far. I think between now and Dreamforce, you will see an extremely deep integration between salesforce and Pardot. We continue to scale that business and grow it and make sure that it's integrated extremely deep into our core.","With ExactTarget, that unit is a more loosely coupled because many of the key areas that it focuses on do not need to be as deeply integrated as the Pardot asset. Still we can have shared contacts. We can integrate our Service Cloud. We can bring in our consoles, but at the end of the day, I believe that those marketers are going to want a control panel to build and run their business, and I believe that that's going to look a lot like ExactTarget. You can see how we have already integrated salesforce core services and salesforce platform with Journey Builder. You are going to see more things like that. This is just a very, very exciting time for the marketers. You won't hear me say enough that I think we have the premier asset, premier platform and you are going to continue to see some real excellence out of ExactTarget.","Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs","Okay, great, and just a follow-up for Graham. Graham, I might have missed this but could you give what exact type of target you gave deferred for the quarter?","Graham Smith","Yes, it was $99 million. Right, $99 million.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ross MacMillan with Jefferies.","Ross MacMillan - Jefferies","Thanks a lot, and Graham congratulations on your private salesforce and all the very best for what you do ultimately leave the company. Marc, I had a question also on platform, which I guess is with the success you are seeing with Salesforce1, does that change your view on the timeframe in which the platform could get to $1 billion, where they are and does it change your view on the platform addressable market? Thanks.","Marc Benioff","Well, I think Salesforce1 is accelerator on platform, I also think that Heroku here was accelerator on the platform I think Fuel you from ExactTarget is accelerator platform that these three things together really make a phenomenal platform.","I could not be more excited with Salesforce1 out how it is going for customers. As I said, our own success with that inside the company speaks to what it can do for our customers, to our ability to compete in the market, differentiate ourselves, to make our customer successful in the phone environment.","We are all-in our iOS, we are all-in on android. It's great on phones, it's great on tablets and I know that it. It has got a lot of upside if you have not followed the success of Heroku in the Ruby's world, since we acquired assets, it has been a rocket ship and that continues to be a huge part of our message to developers, especially in building interaction applications.","We saw some great stories, especially in the enterprise this quarter with Heroku. One very large retailer, I don't want to get into the details, because I don't know if we have approval to use their name or not.","Mean it, in a crisis situation to rapidly deploy a very large application and they built and deployed it Heroku and it was a huge success for them. I can tell you with Fuel, that one of the real assets of ExactTarget, is that it is not just an app, but it's a platform and they very much have our strategies integrated with lot of key iOS apps and it is that trifecta Salesforce1, Fuel, and Heroku you just give us three tremendous platform assets to really go after any casting building the custom capability for customer.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brent Thill with UBS.","Brent Thill - UBS","Graham, congrats on a great run. Marc, Keith spoke at Dreamforce about the transition to vertical engagement with customers and I know earlier you had mentioned you didn't want to go more vertical product, but can you just talk about this progression and the potential change in strategy and how do you think this impacts your engagement in the field with customers?","Graham Smith","Well, I think it is a very important our strategy. It is actually strategy that we have executed in the company, but Keith is definitely emphasizing and customers by segment want more value from us and want us to be able to speak to them in their language to build a bring value to them to bring systems integrators and I think a great story is our tremendous success in the pharmaceutical area with Depot.","You could see that's been very much a one of our key focuses, making sure that we have dominant position in pharmaceutical, we have a key ISV that we work with their and it has been a great story talk to big pharmaceutical companies, well that's a model for us for other industries. We want to align ISVs, we won align marketing, branding, we want to bring in the other key resources so that we can the great success by vertical.","I think, Keith has a vision and clarity around that. That's even bigger than we had before he came here and we are letting him run that with all of his gusto.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brad Zelnick - Macquarie.","Brad Zelnick - Macquarie","Thank you very much. Graham, not only would I be an outlier if I didn't echo the sentiment of my peers, but I truly mean it and I wish you the best and congratulations on your achievements.","Marc, question is for you. Can you talk about what you are doing with Edge, Spring and specifically when it comes to Big Data and in-memory analytics, how much of an opportunity is there to embed these capabilities into your existing clouds versus a separate, distinct analytics cloud.","Marc Benioff","Well, thanks for that question because I am a huge believer in Big Data. I am a huge believer in analytics and reporting, dashboards. You will see with salesforce that probably is the most undercovered, underreported story at Dreamforce is what we delivered in analytics and reporting. A lot of that was some of these great new leaders that we acquired this year and if you go and take a look at what we to do for customers today with our new next-generation reporting engine, next-generation dashboards, I don't think there is a company that delivers more dashboards and more reports and more analytics to customers every day than salesforce.","I haven't seen it. I know that in my own cases, I have said in my story of January 31, I am in Arizona, I am at a dinner. It's a great dinner. But I wanted to know how the quarter is doing and I am just able to look down and glance at my phone and I got incredible real-time analytics happening and dashboards and reports and I know exactly what's happening with the quarter. I think every CEO, every head of sales, every head of service, every head of marketing, manager, mid- manager needs that same capability and we are delivering that. In a social world, it shows up in my feed. In a mobile world, it shows up in my phone. In a cloud world, it shows up deeply integrated with our services.","We are definitely evaluating and looking at all the places that we can put those analytics and dashboards and customers have come to us and said that there is more for us to do which is why we have made these investments, and I think that if you go and look at what you have already delivered, you would be hugely surprised and you will see the emergence of some great new capabilities.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brendan Barnicle with Pacific Crest Securities","Brendan Barnicle - Pacific Crest Securities","Thanks so much. Marc, I wanted to ask a follow-up to Brent Thill's question. As you move more into the verticals in the salesforce, how do you make sure that you not perceived as some sort of threat to the next generation of Veeva's in vertical specific ended that might want to build on the platform?","Marc Benioff","Well, I really appreciate that, when there is an ISV or there is someone building on our platform, we want to invest in them and partner with them. We have been a very partner friendly organization. We have a huge investment fund. I think it's probably one of the largest investment funds in the industry. We don't talk about it or brand it, but I can tell you that we invest and we have had great returns. I just reviewed our investment fund returns. We invest in some cloud computing companies that are building on salesforce and our platform. And we want to help these ISVs be successful. We want to give them the seed capital. We want to give them growth capital. We want to help them with distribution relationships. We want to help them with their marketing, with their branding. We want to partner closely with them. And we have got some great success stories. You mentioned Veeva. I am sure you know ServiceMax. I am sure you know Kenandy. I am sure you know FinancialForce. I mean you go to the AppExchange and look under native and look at all the native apps that are there and you will see that we are investing in those companies and one of the reasons they are getting growth is we are aligning to make them successful. We want those native app providers to be successful. And we want to partner with them. We want them to grow and be a core part of our vertical strategy, absolutely.","Operator","Your next question comes from Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse.","Phil Winslow - Credit Suisse","Hi. Congrats guys on another fabulous quarter. Again, Mark, just that you said behind any tweet there is customer, behind any great CEO there is a great CFO. So congrats on you guys' partnership, at least another year of it. But my question is, Marc, on the Service Cloud. A lot of time you have spent on marketing and platform. I wondered if you can touch on just what you are seeing there in terms of trends across both Service Cloud actually and Desk.com? And just what do you think competitively out there? Thanks.","Marc Benioff","I think customer service is absolutely one of the most exciting areas. I mean it has been a big investment area for us. We believe that there is huge opportunity in the enterprise, huge opportunity to mid-market, huge opportunity in the small-market. We have Desk.com, which if you have not seen the new version of Desk that we just released a few weeks ago, it's doing incredibly well and we are continuing to invest in the success of Desk.com, which was an acquisition that we made all over year ago and we also have our Service Cloud, which was an acquisition that we did about five years ago, the leader of that company called InStranet, that was the based in Paris is now the head of our product organization, Alex Dayon, and he has done a phenomenal job building that product.","I am very excited about service, but you know I love all of my children. I love the Sales Cloud, I love the Service Cloud, I love the marketing cloud, and I love the Platform, and I love all of our partners too, so all of ISVs, I would say, I guess that would be the fifth thing fifth thing I probably do not talk about that enough.","Graham Smith","Christie, we have time for one more question.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Samad Samana with FBR.","Samad Samana - FBR","Hi. Good afternoon. Marc, Japan had the best time constant currency quarter in a while after struggling in the prior three quarters. Were there any particular strategy changes that drove the improvement or was it just a better demand environment and in that region? Then as a follow-up to that, how penetrated is the core sales cloud outside of the United States?","Marc Benioff","Yes. Well, I think that, I will answer part of this and then I will turn it over to Graham. I really think international remains a huge upside opportunity for salesforce. We have invested very heavily in the United States market, which was a very good decision because it is the mega market for enterprise software.","We really only do business in a few countries, we do business in the United States, in Canada, in the United Kingdom, France, Germany, all which also performed really well this Europe, a great year, we do business in Japan. That has been a great story for us. We just moved into our new headquarters in Japan invited by the government to move into the JP tower the Japan Post our which is a brand new our Marunouchi district and we do business in Australia and that is basically it, so we have a lot more opportunity internationally, but so we have a lot of opportunity in a lot of areas, so every time a dollar comes up for investment, we debate it very closely here where are we going to put it, internationally, in a city, in the country, in a product, because in our industry there is a lot of opportunity for growth and we have been very fortunate to place those dollars correctly and you saw a great outcome here on this fiscal year delivering a 37% growth quarter and 33% a year.","Then the question is, okay, how much more are we going to put in all these various first pieces.","Graham Smith","Yes. Remind people that obviously Asia-Pac, not just Japan, it's Japan and Asia and Australia and New Zealand and certainly we saw a little better sort of executions in Japan and Australia in the fourth quarter, so I think that is really what's helped lift that constant currency growth really good in the fourth quarter.","Samad Samana - FBR","Great. Thanks.","Marc Benioff","Well, thank you very much. Again, I want to just come back before we do end this call. I want to just come back to Graham and thank you again for your great contribution with company for last six years. We are looking forward to working with you for the next 13 months, so, I know you are not going anywhere.","Graham Smith","I am not going anywhere.","Marc Benioff","We want to signal it now, so that we have an orderly transition of power. Many of you followed the salesforce, know that Graham was not our first few Chief Financial Officer. He is our third and he has absolutely done a phenomenal job and as we have gone through the CFO transitions before, we know that investors want to have a lot of heads up and transparency into the process, so that is why I am so thrilled to be able to talk about this today with Graham.","Graham Smith","Yes, Marc. It's obviously been amazing experiences as I stated. I would like to make sure everybody I am going to be working just as other over the next 13 months to make sure that everything goes right.","Marc Benioff","I will be making sure that as well, so don't worry about that. I want to thank everyone for all their support for this fiscal year. We will look forward to seeing you next week at the Raymond James conference or at the Morgan Stanley conference. And please come on the road with us. We have got a great tour coming up. And come and see us in Philly, come and see us in Melbourne of Boston, Chicago, London, Amsterdam and DC, Atlanta, Toronto and Paris. We have got many more that coming. Come and meet our customers, our partners. Come and see Salesforce1 in action and get ready for Dreamforce, because the Dreamforce is coming in October, only a few short months away, the world's largest and most important technology show in the world of cloud computing, social and mobile and enterprise software coming back to San Francisco and we are going to have another incredible Dreamforce this year as well. So thanks everybody, and I will see you next quarter.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."],"19362":["salesforce.com, inc.

I would now like to turn the call over to John Cummings, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","John Cummings - salesforce.com, inc.","Thanks so much, Victoria. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us for our fiscal fourth quarter and full year 2017 results conference call. Our fourth quarter results press release, SEC filings and a replay of today's call can be found in our Investor Relations website at www.salesforce.com\/investor. With me on the call today is Marc Benioff, Chairman and CEO; Keith Block, Vice Chairman, President and COO; and Mark Hawkins, CFO.","As a reminder, our commentary today will primarily be in non-GAAP terms.

A description of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions and other factors that could affect our financial results are included in our SEC filings, including our most recent report on Form 10-K.","With that, let me turn the call over to Marc.","Marc Russell Benioff - salesforce.com, inc.","Okay. Hey, thanks, John. And you know what, this is really an exciting call for us. I'm just going to tell you right now why we're so excited. This is our 50th quarter as a public company and we couldn't be more thrilled to be on the call with everybody today. You know, in 2004, when we went public, we had $46 million in quarterly revenue. And now in the fourth quarter alone, we delivered $2.3 billion in revenue and, for this fiscal year, we are guiding to more than $10 billion in revenue.","I just had the opportunity to review the financial numbers and details, as I'm sure all of you have, and when you look at operating cash flow up 50% year-over-year at these extraordinary rates to $706 million or that we now have $14.5 billion of book of business on and off the balance sheet, up 28%, I mean, is just beyond our expectations. We're absolutely thrilled with the performance of the company and these are clear financial indicators of how well we're doing and also how well we're going to do in the future.","Look, I'm incredibly grateful to our employees, our customers, our board members, our shareholders, the Salesforce community, all of our stakeholders over the last 18 years have been on this path together with us, thank you to each and every one of you for everything that you've done for us. We are absolutely grateful. And I am extremely proud as well with this amazing recognition that we received from Fortune Magazine which ranked Salesforce as the 20th most admired company in the world. That is something we could have never anticipated and the number one work place for giving back. So thank you very much for that.","Now, we've proven over last 18 years that a company can do good and also \u2013 do good in the world and also do well and I'm going to go through some of our fourth quarter financial highlights to get to some of these incredible numbers. Revenue for the quarter rose to nearly $2.3 billion, that's up 27% year-over-year. It's amazing and, of course, this has not been an easy foreign exchange environment this year, has it, Mark?","Mark J. Hawkins - salesforce.com, inc.","It's not, for sure.","Marc Russell Benioff - salesforce.com, inc.","So those numbers would be even higher if we did not see things that have happened in Brexit and pressure on the Great British Pound. So also just amazing how we saw revenue for the full fiscal year was nearly up $8.4 billion, up 26%. Incredible.","No other enterprise software company of our size and scale is growing at this rate and we've continued to balance this top line growth with improvement in non-GAAP operating margin, which I'm going to have Mark talk a little bit more about in just a second. Deferred revenue grew to more than $5.5 billion, up 29%. Pretty awesome. And dollar value of book business on and off the balance sheet now more than $14.5 billion. I just touched on that. I'm sure that you all realize that means that we've added more than $3 billion since last year.","So, now, looking ahead to fiscal year 2018, you can see why we are raising to $10.2 billion at the high end of our range and this incredible fast growth is a result of how we are uniquely addressing the needs of more than 150,000 of our customers from around the world, building a single view of their customers, and no company like this has ever been created before, company and enterprise software singularly focused on the customer. No other company has 25,000 employees solely focused on CRM and helping to build deeper and more intelligent relationships with their customers. We are so well positioned for the future.","We're the clear leader in the fastest-growing enterprise software segment, CRM, and here's something kind of amazing. CRM, I'm sure you saw this incredible report from Gartner. The enterprise software marketplace is really sliced into four key pieces: one, operating systems, which are in decline; two, ERP, which is slightly up; databases, slightly up; and CRM, which is now by 2020 will be the largest segment of the enterprise software market. That's incredible. We're the largest player in that market, and we're also the leaders in our core markets in that sector in sales, in service, in marketing, in commerce and platform.","We're exiting fiscal year 2017 with the strongest portfolio of products we have ever had, including some amazing technology and teams that we have also been able to bring under our wing over the last year, including these great organizations like Demandware and Krux and Quip.","Okay. I can tell you I've never been more excited about the future, and we are really well positioned to take advantage of this very, very fast growing CRM market as this quarter results indicate, and you're going to hear now Keith talk about some amazing customer wins.","Now, before we go down to Keith and the customer success stories, I want you all to mark down March 7. March 7, in only a week, we are going to have a worldwide webcast to 2 million of our customers and users, and it's going to come to you from our new building at Salesforce East in San Francisco. And that will be right next to Salesforce Tower that I'm sure a lot of you've seen. It's rising high in the sky here in the city. And if you can come to March 7, you're going to see some amazing customer announcements, product announcements, partnership announcements, and we have got some incredible stuff to talk to you about.","So we'll hopefully see you in one week here in San Francisco, and you're going to also see the latest in what we're talking about with Einstein, with our spring and summer 2017 product releases. And some of our largest customers are going to be there as well talking about some of their expansions, some that we're talking about on the call here and others that we're holding until March 7. So you can catch some news a week from now on Salesforce as well.","Okay, Keith. Go ahead.","Keith G. Block - salesforce.com, inc.","All right. Thanks, Marc. Obviously, this was an exceptional quarter. Salesforce is the fastest-growing top five enterprise software company in the world, and this year, we expect to deliver more than $10 billion in revenue. And that will reach the milestone that we've been talking about, about being faster than any other enterprise software company in history to that $10 billion mark.","In FY 2017, we drove tremendous execution, growth of scale and delivered unprecedented customer success. And we did this while integrating Demandware, our largest acquisition ever, launching innovative new products, including Einstein, and adding more than 5,000 employees.","When I joined Salesforce nearly four years ago, Marc and I put together a plan to become more strategic to our customers and to become more of an enterprise skilled company, and that plan really had three parts to it. Number one was the focus on industry. This is all about speaking the language of the customer and bringing industry expertise and launching industry products in the marketplace. The second was expanding our international reach to serve our global customers. Very, very important. And the last was building the world's strongest ecosystem in the cloud, and that was with our SI partners and our ever-expanding ISV community.","Well today, we have strategic relationships with the largest and most successful companies in the world. We're inspiring companies of all sizes, all industries and all geographies. We have clearly become the trusted advisor to our customers for their digital transformations. All of this is translating to our results, including a record number of big transactions. In fact, we hit a huge milestone this fiscal year which we're incredibly proud of, and that was achieving 100 $10 million-plus relationships on an annual basis and the number of $20 million-plus relationships has nearly doubled in just one year. Pretty incredible progress.","Now, let's talk about some of the highlights in the quarter, starting with our industry strategy, again one of our growth pillars. We had strong growth in Q4 in all of our target industries. In fact, the largest deal in the quarter was a massive expansion with one of the world's leading CPG brands based in Europe using Marketing Cloud, Sales Cloud and Service Cloud to deliver personalized consumer experiences. We expanded our relationships in Q4 with three of the five largest CPG companies in the world, all of them running on Salesforce.","And, as you recall from last quarter, our momentum is continuing in financial services. In Q4, we expanded relationships with U.S. Bank, SunTrust, TD Bank and many, many more. We're also building on a very strategic relationship with Farmers Insurance. Now that's from our early days in helping them modernize their customers' self-service to bringing more synergy across their customer, agent, employee and partner channels. Healthcare continues to be strong for us. In Q4, we expanded relationships with Anthem, athenahealth and one of the largest healthcare companies in the United States, Humana.","And just a quick update on Financial Services Cloud and Health Cloud. It's been less than a year since they've been GA and we've already seen great traction. In fact, more than 70% of customers who have purchased one of these industry solutions are net new logos to Salesforce in this fiscal year. So all of these are proof positive around the power of speaking the language of the customer.","Now on to international, our second growth strategy. Each of our regions grew more than 25% in constant currency for the full year. In fact, EMEA and Asia Pac both grew 29% year-over-year in constant currency. So today, nearly 30% of our revenue is outside of the Americas and this represents a huge, huge growth opportunity for us. And we'll continue to accelerate our international expansion to meet our customers' demand and I fully expect our revenue mix to be more balanced over time. And this is, again, something that we're very, very focused on and very excited about.","Now to that end, we expanded relationships in Q4 with some amazing brands like Shell, Michelin, Emirates and Maersk in Europe. We drove strong financial services momentum as well, again, in the industry with 5 of the top 15 banks in Europe this quarter including Banco Santander and BCC, again, all running their business on Salesforce.","We had other huge international wins in the quarter with BRF, Latin America's largest food company, also with the Japanese Cabinet Secretary for Social Security and Tax and Fujisoft, all in Japan. So great progress, again, on the international front.","As far as partner momentum, we continue to strengthen our partner ecosystem. In fact, we are seeing partners grow their Salesforce practices by more than 50%. Today, every single one of the top five SIs in the world run their business on Salesforce.","A great example of this is Deloitte. We have an incredible partnership with them. In the quarter, they expanded their relationship with us, rolling out sales, service, analytics and of course, the Salesforce platform.","We're also seeing strong momentum in our ISV community and the innovation around our platform in that community. In fact, today nearly 90% of the Fortune 100 are running apps from the AppExchange and these are apps that are being installed by customers at a rate of more than one per minute every single day, which is pretty incredible.","Now before I wrap up, I want to say how proud I am of the company and our ability to integrate more than a dozen acquisitions in FY 2017 while still delivering really record-breaking results. And look, this operational excellence, it's already paying off. We're driving incredible value and innovation for our customers. In fact, this quarter, we had a huge set of Commerce Cloud wins with Levi's and The Gap and YETI and many, many others. And Commerce Cloud grew customer gross merchandise value by 26% in constant currency from a year ago, again, an acceleration from Q3.","So look, in summary, I would tell you that no other technology company is building the relationships that we are. We are driving incredible innovation. We're bringing huge value to our customers. We continue to inspire our customers. We continue to paint a vision for their success, and as I said, we are executing at scale across every part of the company and delivering success for our customers better than anybody else in the world.","And with that, I'll hand it over to Mark.","Mark J. Hawkins - salesforce.com, inc.","Thanks, Keith. As you've heard, we delivered another year of strong financial performance in FY 2017 with outstanding top-line growth, continued operating margin expansion and excellent cash flow. And over the last three years, we've actually doubled our revenue, we've increased our non-GAAP operating margin by more than 400 basis points, which has translated into nearly a tripling of our free cash flow. And I'm especially pleased with our cash flow performance and operating margin improvement even as we've been making critical investments in our long-term growth.","Now let me discuss Q4 and FY 2017. Q4 revenue grew 27% in dollars and 28% in constant-currency excluding a year-over-year FX headwind of approximately $30 million. For the full year, the revenue grew 26% in dollars and 27% in constant currency, with the revenue from companies that we acquired in FY 2017 contributing approximately 2.5% to year-over-year top-line revenue growth.","Driving this strong top-line growth was the performance of our portfolio cloud throughout the year. A couple of highlights. Sales Cloud grew 13% for the full year, becoming the first $3 billion cloud. Service Cloud grew 20% for the full year. Platform and Other grew 39% for the full year and Marketing Cloud, excluding Demandware and Krux, grew 25% for the full year. Our Demandware performed strongly in the first six months, contributing approximately $63 million in revenue for the quarter and $120 million for the year. And note this was at the high end of our initial guidance despite adjustments due to purchase accounting. Dollar attrition for the fourth quarter, excluding Marketing Cloud and other acquired businesses, remained below 9%.","Before I turn to cash flow and balance sheet, let me spend some time on margins. Full-year non-GAAP gross margins were down 126 basis points over last year primarily due to revenue adjustments due to purchase accounting, increased investments in acquired companies and thirdly, a slightly higher mix of professional services revenue due to a large increase in our strategic transactions. Despite this, our full-year non-GAAP operating margin was up 78 basis points over last year and slightly ahead of our prior guidance of approximately 70 basis points. These results included a headwind of approximately 150 basis points related to FX and the acquisition of Demandware.","This operating margin improvement helped drive a record cash flow for Salesforce as we delivered more than $2.1 billion in operating cash flow, up 29% over last year. This translated into an operating cash flow yield of 25.8%, which was slightly higher than FY 2016. Given that cash flow is my number one priority, I'm very pleased with these results considering the headwinds from both FX and M&A activity. CapEx for the year was $464 million or approximately 5.5% of revenue. This was primarily driven by leasehold improvement and a continued investment in data centers globally.","For FY 2018, we anticipate CapEx to be between 4% to 6% of revenue, which was in the lower range than in prior years. Deferred revenue grew by 29% in dollars and in constant currency, ending the quarter at $5.54 billion. On a sequential basis, deferred revenue had an FX tailwind of approximately $23 million. Demandware contributed approximately $49 million to deferred revenue in Q4, up from $30 million in Q3.","Before I move on to the guidance, a quick reminder regarding seasonality and the impact on operating cash flow and deferred revenue. As we shared with you at the last few Analyst Days, invoicing seasonality continues to deepen. This Q4 was especially strong from an invoicing standpoint. In fact, the sequential change to deferred revenue in Q4 was 59%, up from 45% three years ago. This contributed to the outperformance in cash flow and deferred revenue in the quarter.","Moving on to guidance. Coming off a record portfolio, we are pleased to be raising our full year FY 2018 revenue guidance to $10.15 billion to $10.2 billion for 21% to 22% growth year-over-year. This includes approximately $125 million to $150 million of FX headwind. We're also initiating our FY 2018 non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance of $1.27 to $1.29. In context, we expect to deliver approximately 125 basis points to 150 basis points of non-GAAP operating margin improvement in FY 2018.","Keep in mind this continued integration of Demandware along with FX headwinds of approximately 50 basis points is expected to slightly pressure our operating margin in fiscal 2018. This margin improvement will help us drive another strong year of operating cash flow and we expect year-over-year growth of 20% to 21% and an operating cash flow yield similar to FY 2017.","Let me quickly touch on non-GAAP tax rates. We previously said we would reevaluate this rate annually and\/or if a significant event occurs that may materially affect this rate. As we become more profitable, which is a good thing, especially internationally, we expect our long-term tax rate to decrease. And as a result, we are lowering our fixed \u2013 our long-term projected non-GAAP tax rate to 34.5% for FY 2018. For Q1, we're expecting revenues of $2.34 billion to $2.35 million, year-over-year deferred revenue growth of 22% to 23% and non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.25 to $0.26.","A few quick notes on our Q1 guide. First, you will recall that in FY 2017 was a leap year. As a consequence, we have one fewer day of revenue in the first quarter of FY 2018. At our current scale, that one day of revenue represents approximately $25 million, which is reflected in our Q1 guidance. Bear in mind this is purely a timing issue and has no impact on the full year of revenue guidance.","Secondly, due to the acquisition-related margin pressures in the first half, we expect our FY 2018 profitability EPS to be a bit more of second half-weighted than in prior years.","And thirdly, as we discussed, due to continued deepening of our invoice seasonality, we expect the sequential change on deferred revenue from Q4 to Q1 to be a bit steeper than in prior years which is not unexpected.","So to wrap up, we had an outstanding quarter and that drove a strong finish to an outstanding 2017. We delivered our third consecutive year of non-GAAP operating margin improvement, even in the face of FX and M&A headwinds. We delivered our first-ever $2 billion operating cash flow and going forward, we will continue to focus on improving our GAAP \u2013 our non-GAAP operating margin cash flow while balancing our investments required to ensure growth, customer success and shareholder value.","On that, I'd like to thank our employees, customers, partners and shareholders for their continued support. And with that, I'd like to open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will pause for a moment to compile the Q&A roster. Your first question comes the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan.","Mark R. Murphy - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yes, thank you very much. Congrats on a spectacular finish to the year. My question is for Marc Benioff. I wanted to ask you about the acceleration that we're seeing in the Sales Cloud. It does seem rare to see a revenue stream that is so large accelerate like this. And so I'm wondering what you think might be breathing new life into the Sales Cloud, whether it's the Lightning UI upgrades or the layering on of artificial intelligence capabilities or perhaps the pricing environment and competitive environment is becoming less intense or something else? And if I may, I have a quick follow-up for Mark Hawkins.","Marc Russell Benioff - salesforce.com, inc.","Well, thanks so much. Sales Cloud has become one of the very largest software products in the entire industry. And of course all by itself, I think it's probably the largest cloud computing company. Is that right, Mark?","Mark J. Hawkins - salesforce.com, inc.","It is. It's over $3 billion, Marc.","Marc Russell Benioff - salesforce.com, inc.","Yeah. It's over $3 billion. So that's bigger than \u2013 Sales Cloud is bigger than what Workday, ServiceNow, NetSuite...","Mark J. Hawkins - salesforce.com, inc.","Correct.","Marc Russell Benioff - salesforce.com, inc.","Better than Oracle's entire cloud business, that type of thing. So \u2013 but anyway, yes, Sales Cloud is amazing, and it has reaccelerated, you're right, you've seen the numbers. And you're also right, it has to do with \u2013 we've completely rebuilt our Sales Cloud and not just a user interface with Lightning, not just an incredible new CPQ platform with SteelBrick. Of course you saw today, Salesforce1, which is the mobile extension of Sales Cloud, won the Mobile App for Businesses of the Year at Mobile World Congress that exceeds our expectation, but it really demonstrates that Sales Cloud works incredibly well in the mobile environment, the best business mobile app.","Pricing, as you know, last year, we enhanced our pricing and made changes based on customer feedback. That's been received incredibly well. And you saw that we introduced our Dreamforce Einstein, which is giving Salesforce artificial intelligence and giving Sales Cloud artificial intelligence. And that gives our customers the ability to take this incredible power of machine intelligence, machine learning, deep learning. And it's available now inside Sales Cloud; that's incredible for our customers.","So there's no other Salesforce automation solution in the world that's as successful as Sales Cloud, has the market share of Sales Cloud, has the growth of Sales Cloud, but also is as innovative and competitive as Sales Cloud. It has, after 18 years, remained number one in innovation and capability. That is incredible. And as I pointed out, with this acceleration that is going on in the CRM market, I think that that's part of it. So if you look at that Gartner Chart, they published dividing up operating systems, databases, ERP and CRM, you can see CRM has accelerated because Salesforce automation is an essential part of CRM that's also accelerating, and we have this incredibly innovative product. So we're all set up on Sales Cloud. I hope that answers your question.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ross MacMillan with RBC Capital Markets.","Ross MacMillan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks a lot. This is also for Marc Benioff and congrats for me as well. Just as you think about Einstein, it's now in-market on Sales Cloud. Maybe you could just touch on how we should expect to see the artificial intelligence get rolled out across sales and marketing and other parts of the platform? And what sort of timing should we expect to see that happen in? Thanks.","Marc Russell Benioff - salesforce.com, inc.","Well, we actually have already begun the rollout of Einstein into all of our clouds and we have made a number of announcements, but we've also released products. And our customers in our spring release have this capability embedded inside many of those clouds, including Sales Cloud, including Marketing Cloud, including Commerce Cloud. And you saw the announcement last week on Service Cloud and Service Cloud Einstein. That's so exciting to see this intelligence start to move across.","Einstein is an incredible AI capability and I mean I have to tell you one amazing story. We're going to talk about this more next week and to encourage all of you to come to the March 7 event or watch it on video. But we had a call from a major customer of ours. They're a CPG company and they have a big issue. And the issue that they have is in their stores, they have a lot of shift happening on inventory and they also have a competitive situation as well. They want to know what's going on. They want to know if competitive products are ending up in their shelves, which is supposed to be merchandised only with their own proprietary products.","So we showed them just by using a cell phone camera and using Einstein and our deep learning capabilities which have benchmarked, I think, as high as many of the other AI clouds. I'm sure many of you are following that work. Well, all of a sudden, what we showed them was with a simple camera, they're able to do real-time inventory analysis of their retailer shelves and they're able to, based on that analysis that's happening from those cameras, understand the competitive environment, number one. Number two, understand their own environment, and number three, when they are seeing a level of depletion on the shelves that they want to replace, they can just roll trucks automatically using Salesforce Einstein.","And of course that also can create customer service cases. It can create sales opportunities automatically, automatically with no one else involved. So all of a sudden, salespeople and service people and marketing people and even truck drivers are all alerted to changes that are happening in the retail environment, which up to this point haven't really been monitored very well and certainly not efficiently.","But that's kind of what AI and Einstein are giving us now in the current state of play. That is with a very low-cost camera, coupled with Einstein, gives us incredible intelligence into their customers' environment. Their customer is the retail store. So this vision of the future that AI is going to make our customers more successful, this is playing out now. It also helped us close a very large deal in the fourth quarter, as you'll hear about March 7.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs.","Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thank you. This is another one for Marc Benioff. Marc, you launched Analytics obviously a few years ago and at Dreamforce this past year, Alex sounded as if that product had found the right mix of capabilities at the right price points. Can you share with us how you see this opportunity being layered into your installed base? And what's your expectation of traction in this regard for the coming fiscal year?","Marc Russell Benioff - salesforce.com, inc.","Well thanks, Heather. Analytics had a great year. We're very excited about the Analytics offering. We have had this product now in the market for about two years and this is really \u2013 I'm speaking really about our Analytics Cloud sales and our Wave platform, which now you know that we've also augmented and extended with Einstein.","Now that really changed the game on Analytics. Now I'll just tell you that how I run my own business has dramatically changed based on this product and that is very simple that we have, like a lot of companies, every Monday we all sit together, about 20 of us, and we go through how the quarter is doing and what the major issues are in the company. It's our staff meeting.","And there's one extra seat left at the table and that's not for Elijah. The extra seat that we're leaving is for Einstein and that chair which has a little Einstein doll in it, I turn to in the meeting and I can say, Einstein, tell me how is the quarter doing? Usually I have to say that to Keith Block, okay, but now I have Einstein who goes back and looks at all of our fiscal year results over a long period of time, looks at all of our account executives, opportunities and deal flow, look at all of our global pipeline and then all of a sudden says, well yes, you're going to make the quarter, or no, you're going to exceed the quarter by $10 million or you're going to miss the quarter by $10 million.","And I can tell you, it's kind of a funny story because this quarter, which is the first quarter that we're using Einstein which is based on sales, this incredible Salesforce Analytics Cloud with Wave and Einstein and this guidance capability. Well all of a sudden, one of our sales managers who was actually doing fine in the quarter and was forecasting in the month, in the Monday meeting saying, oh, I'm going to have a fine quarter. I'm going to have a fine quarter. Well Einstein started to say, no, actually. This is actually, I'll tell you what it's kind of a funny story because he actually made his number and had a world-class quarter, which was our European business. It said to about our European business, well Einstein said, well very sorry, but you're not going to make your number this quarter. You're going to miss by $10 million, okay, approximately.","So this really got him upset actually. And I think that it kind of spurred him into action a little bit because it was said because of this variable is not right and this isn't right and this isn't right, you're going to have this result. And all of a sudden, he became kind of, I would say, inspired and went out there and he had a great quarter. Maybe he would have had a great quarter anyway, but this is a new player at the management, on the management team, Salesforce Einstein. This is really coming out of this AI Cloud. Now we could not have anticipated this three years ago when we built Wave.","Now Wave has had a huge secondary game because in our core platform and I have that first question on Sales Cloud, well, it's not just Lighting and AI and CPQ and Salesforce1 and pricing within Sales Cloud. Also we have this incredible analytics capability, our baseline analytics which is better than ever built into Sales Cloud. And our customers have never been as satisfied with our core capabilities and dashboards and reporting and now artificial intelligence. That's analytics. And then we of course have our Analytics Cloud which I believe is the most competitive and most exciting and most innovative analytics cloud in the CRM market.","So I'm very excited about it. I believe it will continue to be a good strong growth driver for the business and it's still an early product. It's hard because when you have a product like Sales Cloud doing $3 billion and a product like Service Cloud which is doing how much now, Mark?","Mark J. Hawkins - salesforce.com, inc.","$2.5 billion.","Marc Russell Benioff - salesforce.com, inc.","$2.5 billion and then you have Marketing Cloud doing...","Mark J. Hawkins - salesforce.com, inc.","Approaching $1 billion.","Marc Russell Benioff - salesforce.com, inc.","$1 billion, then you have a new product that you kind of built organically internally kind of coming up. It's hard to give it as much of the limelight with the technology and the customer acceptance and how we use it internally has been awesome.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Bank of America.","Kash Rangan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Thank you very much. Congratulations on the spectacular finish. One for Keith. If you could talk about the tweaks that you're contemplating on the go-to-market side given that we had an infusion of some fantastic technology in acquisitions in the past 12 months? And one for Benioff, how do you think, Marc, that AI would allow you to go upsell back in an install base? Can you just quantify how that might play out? And thirdly, for Mark Hawkins, not to leave you off, but as you execute Marc's plans to double the size of the company, how should we be thinking about the margin profile? Is there a nonlinear element of the margin growth in the next three to four years as you get scale? Thank you very much.","Keith G. Block - salesforce.com, inc.","Yeah. Kash, hi, it's Keith. So thank you for the complex multipart question. I'll lead off with this part. So as you know, we did a dozen plus acquisitions in FY 2017; the integration has gone incredibly well as we continue to operate the company at scale and growth. We have a standard template and process when we integrate these companies in all lines of business. So for example, in the go-to-market business aspect of the company, we try to keep these companies together because we want to incubate them. We want to grow them. We want to nurture them. We want to bring them into our culture, but we also want to make sure that we allow or we put them in a position where we can attach to the install base and the customer. So they can get the power of Salesforce when they come into the company.","We've seen some great success. A good example of that is the Demandware acquisition, now called Commerce Cloud. The GMV growth was excellent. We signed up some great business in the quarter. But it's \u2013 because we have a standard model from an operational perspective on how we bring these companies in so that we minimize disruption and we try to get them to hit the ground running as fast as we can.","Mark J. Hawkins - salesforce.com, inc.","Let me take the second one in terms of the operating margin as we go to take the company forward, Kash, happy to talk about that. One of the ways to think about the operating margin is number one, we'll be thinking about it consistent with our revenue, operating margin framework and that will guide us as we continue to absolutely propel forward the growth and also expand the operating margins and drive the cash flow at the same time.","One of the things that's interesting though, Kash, about your question then is \u2013 if that's the forward-looking kind of thought about it, let's look at this year. And this year, it's really effectively been in the middle of the framework when you take 78 basis points of year-on-year improvement, and if you think of 150 basis points of headwind that we took, those things we kind of think about a few of those together in 2017. But going forward, again, we'll be \u2013 we'll certainly be committed to the framework.","And you can certainly see what we've done in the last three years when you talk about doubling the company cash. The last time we did it, if you think about 2017 \u2013 2014 to 2017, we literally doubled the revenue of the company. We increased operating margins by approximately 430 basis points while nearly tripling the free cash flow. So you can see what we've done in the past. You can see what our most recent year is. And you can see the framework to guide us forward for the future.","Marc Russell Benioff - salesforce.com, inc.","Well, I really appreciate the other question about Einstein. And I thought we should bring Einstein on to the earnings call and we'll let Einstein answer that for you. No, we're not going to do that. But that would be a good part of it, wouldn't it? So yeah, Einstein is an upsell opportunity into the install base, but that's not our primary goal with it. For some of our customers, they will receive Einstein as part of their platform. For other of our customers, they will pay for Einstein. But I think the most important part of Einstein for us is its differentiation against other CRM products.","Now that Salesforce has shipped Einstein into its core platform and released it to its customers worldwide and now that so many customers are using Einstein and we have so many exciting stories about Einstein which is only going to accelerate through the year, Salesforce is the only CRM platform in sales, service, marketing and commerce and community and analytics, as I mentioned, that has this deep artificial intelligence capability available to it. And that is going to accelerate this year, not only in innovation, but also in customer use. And I know how much customers love this platform and how much they're going to use it going forward. Mark, do you want to add to that?","Mark J. Hawkins - salesforce.com, inc.","I think the Einstein is just for me personally super-interesting, Marc, because as you know, I use Wave all across the company. I instrument literally every aspect of finance that you can think with Wave. I probably legitimately have more than 50 dashboards. And I think about, Marc, some of the application of Einstein to each one of those dashboards. So as a big use case for a Fortune 500 company, I just see a really interesting opportunity going forward with Einstein.","Marc Russell Benioff - salesforce.com, inc.","Keith, do you want to add any thoughts about what you're seeing with customers in Einstein?","Keith G. Block - salesforce.com, inc.","Well, I think that the \u2013 I think it's pretty clear that customers \u2013 the company over the last 18 years has had an incredible vision and consistently has delivered new innovation to the marketplace. Obviously, pioneer in cloud, and bringing Sales Cloud to the market 18 years ago was a great start. It was a first act. Many companies never get beyond that first act. We've gotten beyond the first act, the second act, the third act, the fourth act, and we're well into our fifth act-plus around innovation and Einstein is certainly a great example of that.","If I looked at use cases for Einstein, overall, I would tell you that this is really bringing insight to action across sales and service and marketing and commerce, if you think about opportunity insights or account insights, predictability scoring, et cetera, et cetera. I mean, I can go through every one of the lines of business.","But at the end of the day, yet again, you're painting a vision for our customers and providing them with a very compelling technology to get insights about their customers and what sort of use cases that that technology can be applied to. So every customer that I've spoken with is hugely excited about the potential for Einstein and what it means to their business models and their business. And we're just starting to see the beginning of it.","Marc Russell Benioff - salesforce.com, inc.","And I think you're going to see that next week when we introduce you to several of these customers who completed extremely large transactions with us and increased their strategic relationship with us, and many of those are based on Einstein. And we want to hold back some of those demonstrations and review that \u2013 reveal some of those technologies and deals so that we can really emphasize them appropriately.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank.","Karl E. Keirstead - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks. This question is for Mark Hawkins. Mark, I had a question on the Q1 DR guide and hence the implied billings guide. Mark, this always happens when you post a big 4Q DR number. But the math means that the sequential DR decline is large and it obviously has the effect of making billings growth look perhaps less than what some investors wanted. Is that merely this sequential DR math dynamic at work maybe made a little bit worse by this steady increase in 4Q\/1Q seasonality, which you've been flagging for a while, or is there anything else that you could call out? Thank you.","Mark J. Hawkins - salesforce.com, inc.","I really appreciate the question, Karl, and I think you've absolutely nailed it. I think we \u2013 as you said, we've been calling this out for years, and you can see the mathematical symmetry of what's happening. And again, our thesis is that other companies that eventually get to the scale, as such, companies will see this similar kind of phenomena, Q4s get bigger and bigger for lots of reasons.","It's our biggest renewal quarter; it's our biggest new book of business quarter. People want to consolidate their deals as they continue to grow their strategic relationship with Salesforce, which is happening, as Keith had called out, and so you can see exactly what he talked about. Our DR was very strong. In Q4, we had very strong invoicing, very strong demand. And that, of course, has the effect of the sequential growth goes higher and higher and then in the next Q1, it goes lower and lower. Very mathematically symmetrical to what we would've expected.","But really the sound bite on this thing, separate from the leap year which we called out last year, just to make sure people have that reminder, is fundamentally our demand environment is exactly as Keith and Marc have described and I've described is very strong. We just finished a really strong year and, as a result, raised our guidance for the whole year. And that is really the point that we're trying to make, but I think you understand it perfectly, Karl.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alex Zukin with Piper Jaffray.","Alex J. Zukin - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Thanks, guys, for taking my question. Congratulations on the quarter. Marc or Keith, how would you categorize what percentage of your Salesforce is currently fully trained to sell Service Cloud? And given that this market has five to six times more seats than Sales Cloud, what kind of share do you think you can get over time in the market?","Keith G. Block - salesforce.com, inc.","Yeah. So, hi, it's Keith, let me take this. So, look, we put a premium on what we refer to as enablement, right? We bring a lot of people into the company, 5,000-plus people this year. And we spend an incredible amount of focus time making sure that our people \u2013 all of our people are brought up to speed on the features and functions of any of our cloud, take Service Cloud as an example since it's the one that you asked about. And we take advantage of some amazing technology; Trailhead is an example, so we're making sure that we can bring people up to speed and hit the ground running very quickly.","So this is an ongoing thing. We don't just train somebody once and then that's it. There's no end of job when it comes to the training and enablement. As I said, I think it's one of the reasons why we're so different than the rest of the marketplace in terms of the effectiveness of our go-to-market teams.","And specifically on Service Cloud, look, we're the market leader, okay? So we had amazing growth. The Magic Quadrant. We're the market leader of the Magic Quadrant with Gartner, if you take a look at that. This is a $2.5 billion run rate business. It is \u2013 after Sales Cloud, it is the largest cloud, I guess you could say, company in the world in terms of size and scale. And again, we're taking market share. We're number one in the marketplace. So we've got incredible capabilities. We continue to improve the product. We're enabling our sales teams and our customers' success teams, and I think it shows up in our results.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Phil Winslow with Wells Fargo.","Philip Winslow - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hey. Thanks guys, for taking my question. Just actually one question for Mark Hawkins, just a sort of a point of clarification. Unfortunately, the conference call I think broke up when you were giving the high end of your margin expectations for this year and it wasn't in the transcript, either. So wonder if you could reiterate that.","And then sort of a follow-on for both Keith and Marc off of that. Obviously, you've gotten questions about upsell, cross-sell and just the framework you've given for margin. But as you increasingly attach, as Keith, you were just talking about, Service Cloud or Marketing Cloud, which is one that I'd particularly like you all to double-click on. How are you thinking about that as far as just sort of where you are in that process in terms of just training up the sales force to do that? And then how is that contributing to leverage and the framework, just call it, more attach of clouds per customer?","Mark J. Hawkins - salesforce.com, inc.","Got it. Well let me, Keith has something, then I'll kind of tag team on this. Let me just address that. First of all, Phil, thank you for alerting me that it broke up during that. Our, pleased to report that in addition, our revenue, taking that up to $10.2 billion for the year. The operating margin, we've expanded it from 125 basis points to 150 basis points for fiscal year 2018. And that is despite the fact that we expect 50 basis points of pressure associated with FX. So we're still going to take it up between 125 and 150 irrespective of that additional 50 basis points of pressure, Phil. Point number one. Point number two, Keith, I think he's asking a little about cloud, cross-sell and opportunities from that standpoint, and if you want to address that, then I'll talk about the margin at the end.","Keith G. Block - salesforce.com, inc.","Yeah. Let me talk about that. So we're in an enviable position where we're a market leader in every cloud that we make and produce and bring to the market, and that drives incredible amounts of customer success into the marketplace for our customers. And that is where we are laser-focused.","And when we go to market, we go to market on a solution basis, which is typically a multi-cloud solution. So that could be by industry, that could be by line of business. But when I think about, for example, the top 10 deals in the quarter, I can tell you that 8 of the top 10 deals in our quarter in Q4 had multi-cloud solutions. So that means it wasn't just Sales Cloud. It was Sales Cloud and Service Cloud, or it was Marketing Cloud and communities, or it included Analytics, et cetera.","So again, customers are buying solutions. They buy solutions because they're looking to solve a business problem, and we are uniquely positioned to solve those business problems in the marketplace as it relates to customer engagement. So we're in a great product position. We have an excellent execution strategy which I outlined in the call earlier.","And yeah, just to give you an example, I talked a lot earlier about the level of relationships that we're establishing with these customers. When I talked about achieving this goal of 100 $10 million-plus relationships and doubling the number of $20 million-plus relationships, just to put that into perspective, if you go back to \u2013 I joined the company back in FY 2014 \u2013 and again, I had the privilege of working with an amazing team and an amazing company. But to put that in perspective, fast forward to where we are today. We have three times, three times the $10 million-plus relationships with customers than we had back in FY 2014. We have five times the $20 million-plus relationships that we had back in FY 2014.","Well, how did that happen? Well, it happened because we had a compelling vision. It happened because we had a multi-cloud portfolio that added a lot of value, incredible value, that allowed these customers to drive digital transformation and engage with their customers in entirely new ways, in unprecedented ways. So there is an incredible amount of opportunity on an attach basis across all of our clouds. We're seeing more and more demand for it, and we are uniquely positioned to provide that for our customer base.","Marc Russell Benioff - salesforce.com, inc.","And I think this is really kind of get back to the upsell comment before, which is in terms of upsell and cross-sell and kind of selling these CRM cocktails. When we're going in to a customer, I think it's important that we are talking to them about what are they trying to accomplish with their customers.","We're not there to sell them the Salesforce automation solution or a service solution or marketing or platform. I think our first question is, tell us about your customer strategy. How are you going to connect with your customers in a whole new way? How are you going to build a one-to-one relationship with your customer? How do you create more collaboration across your enterprise and with your partners and with your customers? How do you build communities with your customers?","And I think through these probing and question answering and really asking these questions in the customer's language, specific by vertical, that is, we're trying to speak to the customer these questions in their own language. And that's an incredible transformation that Keith has led over the last four years.","And you can see that now when we talked about we've got five of the top five banks, five of the top five systems integrators. When we talked about Deloitte, you know who all the other systems integrators are, and they're all using Salesforce. You look at the top tech companies who aren't our specific head-to-head competitors, they are using our products. You look at the media companies.","And that's very exciting what has happened, this transformation of Salesforce. And we're not just selling them SFA. We're selling them a broad set of solutions. Einstein is a huge differentiator. Mobility is a huge differentiator. Platform is a huge differentiator, because our competitors just don't offer these capabilities. They just don't have it. And I think that that has really become an incredible thing in this cross cloud vision which is a vision we've had for a long time, but I think we're executing it now better than ever.","And when we look at these very large customers getting much, much larger with us, it's because they're embracing all of our clouds. They trust us. They know we're going to make them successful. We're there for them. We're deeply committed to our customers and we're going to deliver success for them, which means, for them, growth. They want customer growth and that's what we're going to deliver and I think you say that's really what we're talking about.","Keith G. Block - salesforce.com, inc.","Absolutely. I think it's listening. Listening is very, very important, but also it's bringing a point of view, whether it's an industry perspective or a line of business perspective, as I said before. At the end of the day, let's use consumer packaged goods, in a quarter, three out of the top five consumer packaged goods companies in the world, and these are massive companies. These are brands that we all know and we'll talk a little bit about that next week. They are expanding their relationships. They are betting their business on Salesforce. That's pretty compelling.","Marc Russell Benioff - salesforce.com, inc.","Very exciting. And then Mark, how are you seeing this play out in the financials?","Mark J. Hawkins - salesforce.com, inc.","Well, I think on the financial side, one of the things I spend a lot of time, Marc, as you know, with a lot of the top banks all over the world and, obviously, we see people, customers who respond very favorably to that. And we've announced big bank after big bank after big bank, who I think this whole vertical side, Keith and I talked, we spent time in Davos with a number of the absolute top banks in the world, and Marc, this whole language of what do they need? What do they need for wealth management? What do they need for other applications and then we're able to actually meet that need and build a long trusting relationship with them. So that is happening...","Marc Russell Benioff - salesforce.com, inc.","I think that really gets down to why \u2013 I mean, you talk to me, you talk to Keith, Mark, we've never been more excited about Salesforce and our opportunity, our relationship with our customers, the potential with our customers and also we've never been more excited about the CRM market, to see the CRM market itself accelerate has become larger than the operating system and ERP and database market is because it has these really important critical growth drivers of our industry, not just Salesforce Automation. Not just customer services work. Not just marketing cloud and like, messaging and email marketing. Not just commerce, but all of these things and so much more and we still feel, even though we're forecasting $10.2 billion for the year and even though we doubled the company in the last three years, tripled the cash flow, increased operating margin every year, like Mark has said, we've just never been more excited about the future and what the opportunity holds for Salesforce and for our customers, specifically. And you're going to see that on March 7 as well. Okay, John. One more question.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Derrick Wood with Cowen & Company.","Derrick Wood - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks and congrats on the quarter. I wanted to go back to the billings guidance and I know we're going to be getting a lot of questions on this tomorrow. So maybe just to diffuse concerns on pipeline and, obviously, how you guys are talking today about your customer opportunities and everything, it sounds like things are great, but Keith or Marc, would love to just get your view on the macro right now and how you see overall IT spending environment trending as we enter 2017.","Keith G. Block - salesforce.com, inc.","Yeah. So this is Keith. Look, we talked about this earlier. CRM is the fastest-growing enterprise market and we're the market leader. We're taking shares in the marketplace. We continue to separate from the rest of the marketplace. There's a number of reasons for that. Obviously, it starts with a compelling vision, an incredible execution and operations of scale.","But we started off the year with a fantastic quarter. We're certainly very, very proud of the entire company and are very thankful to our employees, and all of our \u2013 really all of our stakeholders. But we have some momentum carrying into the quarter. And I think that's reflected in our forward guide, which I think Marc and Mark talked about. So there's a lot of momentum. We're very excited. We've got a great story, a compelling vision for our customers and we continue to execute in an unprecedented way, better than anybody else in the marketplace. Marc, I don't know if you want to add...","Marc Russell Benioff - salesforce.com, inc.","No, I just would add, I think that's exactly right, Derrick. And just fundamentally, the point is that we've raised our revenue for the year. We've actually, because of what we saw in Q4, we've raised the entire guide for the year. So we, obviously, feel very good about the demand outlook.","Derrick Wood - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great, thank you.","Marc Russell Benioff - salesforce.com, inc.","All right.

We are having an outstanding year of growth and I am absolutely delighted to share our second quarter results right now.","Revenue for the second quarter rose 31% from a year ago to $957 million, In constant currency, revenue grew even faster at 32%. No other software company, there is no other enterprise software company of our size is growing faster. Deferred revenue rose by more than 30% year-over-year, finishing the quarter at nearly $1.8 billion.

Based on these fantastic results, I am thrilled to announce that just four years after delivering our first $1 billion year, we expect to breakthrough our first ever $1 billion quarter in the third quarter of fiscal 2014, our next quarter, an amazing milestone for Salesforce.com and for the entire cloud computing industry.","In addition, we are once again raising our full fiscal year 2014 revenue guidance, the high end of our guidance puts us on pace to deliver fiscal year 2014 revenue of $4.025 billion with a full year growth rate of 32%, just spectacular growth. Salesforce has always been a catalyst and evangelist for innovation enterprise software. We pioneered the shift to the cloud, to social, to mobile and we have been recognized for innovation by Forbes Magazine, who just ranks Salesforce.com as the most innovative company in the world for a third year in a row. Congratulations to the entire team at Salesforce.com for this incredible achievement.","Now, more than ever, companies are turning to Salesforce.com as their platform for innovation. With our social and mobile and cloud technologies, our customers are connected with their customers in entirely new ways and they are becoming customer companies. Customer companies have a deeper connection with their customers. They can market on any channels, sell as a team, service customers everywhere. And, with the next generation customer platform, customer companies can connect everything on the internet of things.","With our four product lines, sales cloud, service cloud, marketing cloud and the Salesforce platform, our customers have the tools to become customers companies, unlock greater levels of growth, innovation and success. They can build faster. That's why our customers have made Salesforce.com, the world's number one CRM platform and then clear leader in each of our core four markets, our flagship Sales Cloud is now the number one app in the world for sales and it's helping customers drive phenomenal sales performance and top-line growth that's why Gartner once again named us as the undisputed leader in its Magic Quadrant for Sales Force Automation for the seventh year in a row.","In addition to the incredible capabilities from Work.com and Data.com, the Sales Cloud now delivers a complete lead to close solution with Pardot fully integrated into the Sales Cloud giving our customers one of the leading apps in B2B marketing automation and a unique asset from our acquisition of ExactTarget, we couldn't be more thrilled with Pardot and how it brings a full range of marketing, campaign management and solutions deeply embedded into our Sales Cloud.","The Service Cloud is now the world's number app for customer service and support and the only platform that ties customer service with sales and social and that's why Gartner declared Salesforce.com as the clear leader in both vision and execution in its most recent Magic Quadrant for Customer Service making us again the number one solution for customer service.","And I am excited to announce that we doubled down on the Marketing Cloud this quarter with the acquisition of ExactTarget, the largest acquisition in our history. We believe that ExactTarget, Marketing Cloud will define the future of marketing. It is a powerful one-to-one customer platform that makes it possible for companies to bring in customer data from any source and deliver highly personalized digital marketing to any customer across any channel.","With the combination of ExactTarget, Radian6, Buddy Media and social.com, we have the platform of choice for CMOs with powerful and are power house in marketing across email, social, web, and mobile. And the Salesforce platform is the world's number one platform for developing enterprise cloud apps and the only platform with built-in social and mobile capabilities right at the core.","Companies who want to build the next generation of apps that work instantly on any mobile device, that's why we doubled the number of developer mobile packs this quarter, giving them more freedom to choose the tools and frameworks they need to build apps back and the Salesforce platform continues to be our fastest growing product line and as the only solution rated by Forrester as the leader at every single public cloud platform category.","The combination of our customer company vision and our clear leadership in each of these core markets is what's driving our success with customers today and that's why we continue to close some of the most exciting and strategic transactions in the industry and let me just touch on a few of them right now.","We had an amazing win in the quarter with Sysco, not CISCO, but SYSCO one of the world's largest food service distributors. In over last two years, Sysco has been standardizing on Salesforce as it CRM platform across sales service and marketing wrapping its SAP implementation. An incredible relationship, where Salesforce is the front-end and SAP is the back-end and delighted amounts that in the quarter Sysco decided to bring the Salesforce platform into the core of its company-wide Sysco 360 initiative and we are looking forward to helping Sysco deliver on its vision of enriching their customers experience and driving growth.","Sysco is one of the most exciting companies in the world in its industry and we are delighted to be partnered with Sysco and delighted to be partnered with the SAP and delivering this incredible capability. This is a great undertaking from Sysco and one of the largest platform transactions in our history. I want to congratulate our entire team on the incredible success with Sysco","We closed an exciting transaction in luxury retail this quarter with one of the world's most iconic brands Louis Vuitton. Retailers going through a incredible transformation with every major retailer having to decide how they will connect their customers in a whole new way. Louis Vuitton is revolutionizing their experience for customers in more than 460 stores around the world with a new mobile client telling app powered by our Sales, Service and Platform clouds. More than 3,000 sales associates will soon have relevant customer insights right at their finger tips allowing to deliver personalized experience with a high standard of luxury and innovation that Louis Vuitton is known for.","Louis Vuitton is a fantastic company with an amazing product line and an incredible distribution strategy and we are delighted to be powering Louis Vuitton and Pearson, the world's leading learning company has selected the sales cloud, the service cloud and the Salesforce Platform to completely change the way they sell, service and market to students and educators online in the classroom and on their mobile devices and we continue to see amazing momentum in Europe with the Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates the entire financial services industry in the United Kingdom selected Salesforce in the quarter to develop an agile platform that will enable and quickly respond the changing requirements to managing their interactions with more than 27,000 financial services firms in the United Kingdom. In every one of these examples, and there are thousands more, companies are transforming their business with Salesforce.com social and mobile cloud technologies.","Our ability to deeply integrate our next-generation customer platform with legacy back office systems, like I mentioned with SAP, or Microsoft, or even Oracle is helping many of our customers transform into customer companies and other new are at on transactions in the second quarter included incredible new relationships with AIG, Bristol-Myers, Fiat, Hitachi, Home Depot, Johnson & Johnson, Juniper, Mercedes-Benz, National Australia Bank, [Novartis], Pfizer, Procter & Gamble, [JHM], Sony, Western Union and Yahoo!. The pace at which these technologies are being consumed and the pace at, which these companies are embracing our social and mobile cloud technologies is phenomenal.","Our service continues to support and deliver transactions for customers at an unprecedented scale as these companies transform to these new paradigms and I am thrilled to announce that we delivered 86 billion transactions in the quarter, up 46% from a year ago, 86 billion customer transactions in the quarter. Just compare that with any other enterprise software company or any other enterprise cloud company. Salesforce.com is once again leading the industry with this incredible breakthrough number of 86 billion completed transactions of the quarter. That's an average of more than 1.3 billion customer transaction each and every business day with the security, reliability and availability that Salesforce.com has been known for.","Nothing speaks more to the value of Salesforce than the usage of our products with the speed, reliability and trust that we are known for. We work hard to get our customer success, we work hard for our customers trust and we work hard for our customers' adoption each and every day.","Now, before I close I would like to remind you that we are just two weeks away for one of the most exciting market and events of the year, ExactTarget connections and all these meetings with all of you in Indianapolis, where we expect that more than 6,000 customers to experience the future of marketing.

So, please register now while there is still availability. Go to dreamforce.com.","Now with that, I want to hand it over to Graham Smith, to touch on the incredible financial results of Salesforce.com's second quarter. Graham?","Graham Smith","All right. Thanks, Marc. We delivered another strong quarter in Q2, driven by solid business fundamentals and we showed great results across key financial metrics, including revenue, deferred revenue, and operating cash flow. In fact, we exceeded the high-end of our revenue guidance even when we exclude the revenue contribution from ExactTarget. Let me provide you with the detail on our second quarter results, starting with revenue.","Second quarter revenue was $957 million, up 31% over Q2 last year. Excluding an approximate $7 million FX headwind, second quarter revenue was up 32% year-over-year. ExactTarget contributed $16 million dollars of revenue in the second quarter, which was higher than we had forecast as a result of the transaction closing earlier than we had anticipated.","Looking at year-over-year growth, on a regional basis, revenue in the Americas grew 34% to $679 million. Revenue in Europe grew 39% in dollars and 34% in constant currency to $174 million. Revenue in Asia increased 6% in dollars and 19% in constant currency to $105 million. That's a slight improvement for the region.","Dollar attrition continued its slow and steady decline in the second quarter marking it the 16th consecutive quarter of sequential decline and remained very solidly in the low double-digit percentage range.","Turning to margins. Our Q2 non-GAAP gross margin was 80.7%. That's about 60 basis points lower than Q2 last year. Our second quarter non-GAAP operating margin was 10.2% or about 240 basis points lower than last year. The decline in both the gross and operating margin was due to the acquisition of ExactTarget, as well as increased costs related to the agreement we signed with Oracle during Q2. While the two transactions are impacting near-term profitability, we are working hard to find synergies in cost savings which will mitigate their impact this year and into the future.","From a headcount perspective, we added more than 2,200 new employees in the second quarter including approximately 1,900 from ExactTarget bringing our total headcount to more than 12,500. That's up 43% over Q2 last year and double where we were in Q2 of fiscal 2012.","Turning to EPS. Second quarter GAAP EPS was $0.12. Our Q2 GAAP EPS reflects a non-cash benefit of approximately $129 million related to a partial release of the tax valuation allowance we established in Q3 last year. Our consolidated deferred tax balances changed primarily due to the acquisition of ExactTarget's intangible assets.","These acquired intangibles result in future book amortization expense, but no equivalent tax deduction, which gives rise to future tax liability. We were able to reverse the valuation allowance to the extent that our deferred tax assets will be offset by the ExactTarget deferred tax liability.","On a non-GAAP basis, second quarter EPS was $0.09. Non-GAAP EPS was better than we expected due to the higher than anticipated ExactTarget revenue and a slightly lower share count and forecast offset by a higher non-GAAP tax rate.","Turning to cash flow. Second quarter operating cash flow was $183 million, up 34% over Q2 of last year. Operating cash flow in the second quarter benefited from higher than anticipated collections, offset by about $30 million in transaction fees and other acquisition costs. CapEx in the second quarter was $102 million, up from approximately $30 million in Q2 last year. The year-over-year increase in CapEx was principally related to new office build outs and the IP licensing agreement that we discussed on our call last quarter.","As a result CapEx, as a percentage of revenue, in the second quarter was 11%. That's up from just 4% in Q2 last year. For the full year though, we expect CapEx, as a percent of revenue, to be around 8%, slightly higher than in previous years. Free cash flow which we define as operating cash flow less CapEx was $81 million in the second quarter. That's down from $107 million in Q2 last year.","Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with approximately $930 million in cash and marketable securities, including proceeds from a $300 million term loan utilized in connection with the ExactTarget acquisition. Accounts receivable was up 34% over last year to just around $600 million.","Deferred revenue in the second quarter was $1.79 billion, up 34% over Q2 last year. Deferred revenue in the second quarter benefited from approximately $44 million related to our acquisition of ExactTarget, and from a year-over-year FX tailwind of approximately $1 million. On a sequential quarter basis, deferred revenue benefited from an FX tailwind to the tune of around $4 million.","Deferred revenue also continued to benefit from the residual effects of the multiyear invoices and from the continued shift toward annual billing. The combined benefit to deferred revenue in Q2 was approximately $85 million, down from approximately $100 million, sequentially, and from a $120 million in Q2 last year.","ExactTarget will undoubtedly add an even greater level of complexity to our billing frequency metrics as we seek to move ExactTarget customers to annual billing over time. Excluding ExactTarget, approximately 70% of all Salesforce invoices were issued with annual terms in Q2, compared with approximately 65% of invoices in Q2 last year. This five-point improvement to annual invoicing in the second quarter compares with an eight-point improvement in Q2 last year. That's the headwind to year-over-year deferred revenue growth.","Unbilled deferred revenue, or revenue that is contracted but not yet invoiced and that's off the balance sheet was approximately $3.8 billion in Q2. That's an increase of 36% over last year. This unbilled deferred revenue balance excludes the fair value of ExactTarget's unbilled deferred revenue which totaled approximately $137 million.","Even though this amount is unbilled because of purchase accounting rules, it has to be recorded on our balance sheet under accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities as both current and non-current customer liability. The invoices related to this balance are issued and now should roll into a regular deferred revenue balance.","Before I turn to guidance, I want to give you a brief update on ExactTarget, combining ExactTarget with our existing marketing cloud, is providing greater level of synergies. And as a result, we are reducing our total headcount by approximately 200 people. We anticipate that the cost of this reduction will reduce fiscal 2014 non-GAAP EPS by about $0.01. Scott Dorsey, ExactTarget's CEO will lead the newly combined organization.","Turning to guidance, we are pleased to be raising our full year 2014 revenue outlook range to $4.025 billion as Marc mentioned the year-over-year growth of 31% to 32%. This guidance includes approximately $140 million to $145 million revenue contribution from ExactTarget, and that's up from prior guidance of $120 million to $125 million as a result of a $16 million revenue contribution we got in Q2.","For Q3, we anticipate revenue in the range of $1.05 billion to $1.055 billion. Inclusive of ExactTarget, that represents year-over-year growth of approximately 33% to 34%. We are raising our full year non-GAAP EPS estimate to $0.32 to $0.34, and we expect Q3 non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.08 to $0.09.","As a reminder, our biggest Dreamforce ever that Marc just talked about will be held in our fiscal fourth quarter which has a significant impact on our Q4 EPS, and is reflected in our guidance. These EPS ranges imply a full year non-GAAP tax rate of 38% and a Q3 non-GAAP tax rate of 39%. On higher net interest expense, which we anticipate will trend at similar levels to the second quarter throughout the second half of the year.","We continue to expect FY'14 operating cash flow to grow in the low-teens percentage range year-over-year as we discussed when we announced the ExactTarget transaction in June. For Q3, we also expect year-over-year deferred revenue growth in the high 20% range, excluding ExactTarget. At our forecast exchange rates, we will also face a roughly two-percentage point FX headwind to year-over-year deferred revenue growth. We anticipate the deferred revenue from ExactTarget in the third quarter will be flat to slightly up from the Q2 number of $44 million.","As a reminder, all of the underlying assumptions for our GAAP and non-GAAP guidance and the complete GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation can be found in our earnings press release issued today.","To conclude, Q2 was a very exciting and transformational quarter for Salesforce. In addition to solid financial results, we closed the largest acquisition on history and added proven leader to Salesforce including Keith Black to lead salseforce's Global Sales Service and the Alliance Organization and Scott Dorsey, of course, to lead the market in cloud.","We have never been in a better position to capture new market and penetrate deeper into the enterprise than we are today. We look forward to seeing many of you during our analyst sessions at the ExactTarget Connections Conference in Indianapolis on September 17.","With that, we will open the call up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Kash Rangan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","One question for you, Marc. As you have begun to integrate ExactTarget, you have also brought on board two high profile executives from Oracle, Keith Block and Tony Fernicola. I guess my question is, what are the changes that you foresee in the sales organization, go-to-market, as a result of a lot of important developments that have happened this quarter.","A question for you, Graham. The ExactTarget, the program, the contribution is a lot higher than we would have expected. I am just wondering if the invoicing terms also change in particular that side of the business and how you foresee that impacting your billings? Thanks very much. That's it from me.","Marc Benioff","Well, thanks so much for that question, Kash. I want to tell you that as the CEO of Salesforce, I have really got three priorities that are extremely important to me. The first is, the continued development of our flagship products, Salesforce.com, our sales service platform. All I am focused on right now is delivering an incredible new version of Salesforce.com at Dreamforce. An incredible new version that is anchored to the cloud, to mobile and social capabilities.","Number two, I am extremely focused on the success of ExactTarget. I couldn't be more excited about this acquisition, about Scott Dorsey, about the leadership team in Indianapolis and also the speed at which the acquisition and the integration is going and how it's going to impact our company and provide our customers the ability to connect with their customers in a whole new way.","Number three, I am extremely excited about Keith Block. We are able to bring in a fantastic new executive to help lead our global customer facing operations. Keith, as you know, runs all sales and service and vertical solutions, anything that we are going to market with Keith is responsible for. He has done a phenomenal job and he is completely rebuilding his management team.","As you have already seen, he has brought in perhaps the most successful sales executive from Oracle of all time, Tony Fernicola, somebody who we have had a relationship with since we started the company, but never had the motivation to join the company before Keith came in. We are so excited that we are able to say that we are taking what was a world class sales and service organization and taking it to a whole new level under the leadership of Keith and he has put in an incredible new management team.","So those are the three things that I am really excited about and I will turn over to Graham for the second part of the question.","Graham Smith","Yes, Kash. So obviously there is a haircut on deferred revenue that calculates at around 30%. We haven't yet, I think Scott and the team at ExactTarget are really just at the beginning of implementing some of our annual billing policy. So right now, there is clearly no effect from that. It's very difficult for me to estimate at this point just over a month into this how quickly that will go. We will give you an update on that as things progress.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with UBS.","Brent Thill - UBS","Just a quick follow-up on the go-to market. You have unveiled numerous offerings and I am just curious if you could give us your view of how you are simplifying the packaging in that go-to-market? Whether through the use of social ELAs or it looks like even then the new performance edition coming in November that package is more for a higher price? Can you give us a sense of how you are thinking strategically about that? Thanks.","Marc Benioff","Sure, that's a great question, Brent. I really appreciate it. Number one, we have simplified our product line into really four critical products which is our sales cloud and it's highly differentiated offering that gets the competition especially with our human performance capabilities at work.com, with our integrated data capabilities with data.com and with the integrated campaign and marketing capabilities of Pardot and of course it is uniquely position as being mobile, social and cloud.","Number two, we have really redacted that to not just the sales cloud, but also the service cloud, the marketing cloud and the platform and those four core offerings give us the ability to then package those in a variety of additions ranging from products that are uniquely created for small businesses all the way up to the enterprise. And as we tune those packages, we found opportunities to bundle in a lot of these new features and functions that we have built, but perhaps have not been able to sell or fully delivered to our customers either because they didn't know about it or there wasn't something that was available at their time of purchase, so we have a tremendous upgrade opportunity and that's how we look at the performance addition. It's a phenomenal product, it's an incredible new capability for existing customers to take their capabilities to a new level and it's a tremendous level of optimization on our existing pricing structure.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with BMO Capital.","Karl Keirstead - BMO Capital","Yes. Quick question for Graham. Graham, you mentioned that the ExactTarget revenue [contribution] for year would be [140 to 145]. At the time of the deal, you mentioned 128. I'm just wondering what the cause of that delta is versus our performance or anything else? Thanks for any color.","Marc Benioff","Sure, Karl. It was the $16 million that we recognized in Q2 that related to ExactTarget. When we built the deal model it was tough to know exactly which day the transaction would close on, so we clearly planned conservatively and we got transaction closed much earlier than we anticipated and so picked up about $16 million in Q2. So you add that to the 120 and 125 and a little extra and you get to the 140 to 145.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with Piper Jaffray.","Mark Murphy - Piper Jaffray","Thank you very much. Marc, regarding Keith Block and the concept of trying to take enterprise sales to the next level, it seems to be challenging to name an enterprise software company that's been more successful than Salesforce.com with enterprise sales. Because in the last 18 months you have closed several transactions that were roughly $100 million each and they have been transformational and Fortune 100 companies and on a scale that seems to be unparallel in this industry, so just wondering how can it be the case that something can be improved there. Also, do you think the Keith Block's impact on ELAs and other large transactions would be positive or neutral or negative in the second half of the fiscal or will the changes happen more in Q1?","Marc Benioff","Well, thanks for that set of compliments. I really appreciate it. And Salesforce.com has done incredibly well. One of the ways that Salesforce.com has done so well is, that we have a full portfolio of transactions for small, medium and large business. One thing Salesforce.com has never fully optimized for is, enterprise distribution and the ability to reach the largest customers in the world with highly customized solutions for their industries and their verticals.","To do that, we have to bring in a team and a leader who is able to speak to the executives the largest and most important companies in the world to show them that it's not just a one-off solution in this industry or with this company, but they can do it for their whole industry and for all the companies of that industry. You saw how Keith executed that strategy extremely well at Oracle over the last 26 years and we look forward to seeing him execute a very similar strategy enhanced for Salesforce and our unique capabilities and we have already seen him make major changes and we are very excited about his strategy. Of course, this is a time of extreme growth for Salesforce we are always doing, which has been so exciting.","Here is a quarter, 31% growth quarter, and at the same time, we are bringing in phenomenal new distribution leaders to take the company to a whole new level. And not just at Keith's level or at his direct report level, but in every layer of our distribution team, we have found opportunities for optimization, for change, for growth, for evolution to bring in real enterprise leadership to make this a world class effort, and Keith has all of my support.","We have also added him to our Board of Directors and given him the title of Vice Chairman to make it crystal clear to our organization that he is the leader of our distribution organization going forward, and is responsible for all customer facing operations. He is helping us to lead this incredible transformation that's been unbelievably positive so far and we couldn't be more thrilled with having him on board.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore.","Kirk Materne - Evercore","Marc, I was just wondering if you could comment really quickly on what we are seeing more broadly around the marketing cloud with the Omnicom and Publicis deal earlier this quarter. I guess what does that say about some of the trends we are seeing in terms of bigger organizations trying to shift to this customer competent paradigm. I guess, how should we view these bigger advertising agencies in relation to CRM, in terms of partnering and\/or potentially competing overtime? Thanks.","Marc Benioff","Well, those are two great organizations. You look at them, these leading marketing agencies, both as the leaders in those field and I have relationships with both of those CEOs. They are phenomenal executives, phenomenal companies. They have a phenomenal presence with these very large customers helping to articulate their strategy. They have grown really dramatically through acquisition. It's a strategy that both companies very much have deployed. I think they are probably at the end of that at this point.","I don't know what other companies are going to get combined into those organizations. What our hope is, is that we are going to be able to partner with these marketing agencies to provide them with the technology necessary to enable their customers to connect with their customers in a whole new way. It doesn't take a very big leap to see that these agencies are phenomenal in so many areas.","Coupled with our capabilities of delivering world class cloud, social, and mobile solutions, we can really take their customers' capabilities to new level. I view marketing as a huge growth area for Salesforce. By 2017, Gartner says, CMOs will spend more than CIOs on technology.","It's one of the reasons we bought ExactTarget and many other companies as we positioned to be the number one player in marketing and you will continue to see us to focus on that effort. As I said, one of my top three priorities is making ExactTarget a major success for Salesforce.com.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rick Sherlund with Nomura.","Rick Sherlund - Nomura","First congratulations on Keith and Tony. Marc, your comments on SAP seemed a little more muted this quarter. You mentioned partnership with Sysco. I am wondering, if perhaps, there is an opportunity for you to do greater product integration with SAP as we just heard about from Oracle.","For Graham, you mentioned the billing terms for ExactTarget being different. I wonder if you could share with us what those are?","Marc Benioff","Well, Rick, I really appreciate that. I will tell you that I think that companies like Oracle and SAP who have not been able to bring their product lines to the cloud, who have not been able to make the movement to social, who have not been able to make the movement to mobile can benefit from alliances with Salesforce.com, with our brand luster, with our innovation and you heard in the quarter a phenomenal call between myself and Larry Ellison, where Oracle has announced that they are going to be using Salesforce.com as their CRM. That was incredible to hear Larry talk about that. Certainly it's my hope and I believe that we will be able to develop and trade a similar alliance with SAP.","I believe it's in the interest of their customers and our customers that Salesforce works well with Oracle. It works well with SAP and even works well with Microsoft because our customers have these existing investments that we want to leverage. That SAP relationship is a great relationship with, as I mentioned this quarter, the huge success with Sysco where we were able to take their huge investment in SAP back office and put on a customer facing capability that they badly needed but SAP was not able to deliver for them.","I believe there is a lot of SAP customers that are in a similar position, who can use highly customized applications maybe with our force.com platform or even with our primary capabilities of our sales and service cloud and will have the ability to both, those on to these existing SAP infrastructures or even put those on top of these emerging HANA implementations, where we can really bring more value and applications to these data stores.","Graham Smith","I was just going to answer Rick's question on the billing terms for ExactTarget. At the moment, a little over half of their billings are done monthly. Then there's around about a quarter of their billing are done quarterly and then the rest is and at least so it looks very different to salesforce and clearly as I mentioned earlier, Scott and his team will be working on transitioning their customers towards annual over time. They have a slightly different revenue make up. They obviously have more services than we do for example and services is typically always build monthly, so I am not sure we will get to exactly the same ratios as the salesforce has, but clearly big opportunity over the next few years to generate strong cash flow and to reduce administration costs by moving them to more to annual billing.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Terry Tillman with Raymond James.","Terry Tillman - Raymond James","Good afternoon and thanks for taking my question. Marc, the question for you in terms of post-closing of the ExactTarget transaction. Will your salesforce have pre-range to sell ET products and when do we think about maybe potentially starting to see some revenue synergies from such activity? Thanks.","Marc Benioff","Well, that's just a fabulous question and I will tell you it's something that we already are seeing revenue synergies. It's something that we are already focused on and our core salesforce which is, as multi-thousand person sales organizations, something that ExactTarget did not have, is getting the key aspects of having that relationship where we are giving our core salesforce the ability to have a sale with ExactTarget is like a sales of any other of our other clouds.","I believe that's extremely important for us to be able to truly get the value out of ExactTarget, but there is no difference between selling the salesforce ExactTarget marketing cloud, the sales cloud, the service cloud or the platform if you are a core salesforce.com sales professional and to that extent, we are partnering them very closely with the existing ExactTarget sales organization.","We are also working very hard to expand the existing ExactTarget sales organization which is something that's been rather boutique and I believe it has the opportunity to be expanded as well and give us the ability to have that tremendous core confidence and we are doing that by combining our existing marketing cloud sales team with the ExactTarget sales team and having one unified marketing cloud sales team.","Now that process will take a period of time to come to a complete fruition, where we have a total synergy, but we've made tremendous gains in the short period of time. And, as I said, it's one of the important things that I work on every day and I expect us to make continued gains this quarter and the following quarter and be able to give some very good updates on that as we start our next fiscal year.","Certainly, ExactTarget is a critical part of salesforce.com's growth engine. It's something that every salesforce.com customer wants to know about and we have a huge vision for ExactTarget, where we can really show our customers how they are able to connect with customers not just through their sales force, not just through their customer service organization, but through email, but through text. Through social, through all these other customer touch points that are so critical to them and ExactTarget is a critical part of that and a huge part of our message and we will be tightening that message. By the time, we get to Dreamforce, you will see it fully delivered. You will also see the beginning of that message at the Connections Conference in September with ExactTarget in Indianapolis.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of with Nandan Amladi with Deutsche Bank.","Jobin Mathew - Deutsche Bank","This is actually Jobin sitting in on behalf of Nandan Amladi. Two questions. So you mentioned ExactTarget billings comes from, that a part that comes from your business comes from services. So what portion of ExactTarget's billings comes from services?","Marc Benioff","It's about 20% Jobin, just over 20%, and obviously just compare with that, it's less than 10%. So what I pointed it now.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nathan Schneiderman with Roth Capital.","Nathan Schneiderman - Roth Capital","Marc, it seems like Facebook is enjoying accelerating momentum as an advertising platform and that would seem to be positive for your Buddy Media business. I was curious what metrics you are tracking for Buddy that you can share with us to help us understand the progress with that business line?","Marc Benioff","Well, we continue to focus on Buddy Media and also another really exciting offering that we have which I am sure you have seen which is social.com, where you can actually buy Facebook apps directly online and help us to deliver that distribution capacity. It is part of and becoming part of, what I call, our complete Salesforce.com ExactTarget marketing cloud.","The Salesforce.com ExactTarget Marketing Cloud has to include not just all the capabilities of ExactTarget, which so many folks have become known for their tremendous capabilities with the email, their tremendous capabilities with mobile, their tremendous capabilities in social but also with our ready and fixed asset, with our Buddy Media asset and also with our social.com asset. What you will see emerge is a comprehensive application that allows our customers to manage all aspects of those customer touchpoints.","That is going to continue to expand our work with Facebook and you didn't mention it but Twitter is extremely important to us and other social graphs that are providing advertising support. We want our customers to be able to connect with all of these and have a comprehensive solution that manages all of their customer capability.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ross MacMillan will Jefferies.","Ross MacMillan - Jefferies","Marc, I am just curious about timing. As you bring ET into the fold, you have obviously had success with Pardot on the Sales Cloud. Is it premature to assume that you would have ET fully integrated into the product lineup by the time your reinforce or should we be really thinking about it being integrated for the next fiscal year? Any color on that would be great. Thanks.","Marc Benioff","Well, there is different levels of integration. I think you have got to look at integration as a spectrum because today, of course, we have AppExchange integration where we have already done some integration with these products but we can do more. Because we own these assets now, we can do native integration. The first area where we were doing tremendous work and really want to have deeply integrated native capability and this is one that is certainly by Dreamforce, we want to able to show our customers how Pardot is deeply integrated into our Sales Cloud, not just at user interface level, but deeply integrated in to our core as well.","Our Chief Technology Officer, this is a major goal for him, for this quarter as to make sure that Pardot is well integrated into our Sales Cloud and that our Sales Cloud customers have the ability to start using that capability as fast as possible and with outstanding integration.","Number two, with ExactTarget, this very much is something that not only we see ExactTarget integrated into our core clouds, but we will integrate our core clouds and reverse into ExactTarget. If you have seen ExactTarget capabilities with its Fuel user interface, we have the opportunity to bring in our services from our core clouds. into ExactTarget, a great area where today they don't do a lot of work, for example might be in customer service or maybe in another core area we are able to start to leverage our core services back to ExactTarget and that's something that we are going to want to do overtime as well.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse. Mr. Winslow, your line is open.","Marc Benioff","We will take the next question, operator. Thanks.","Operator","Yes, sir. Your next question comes from the line of Steve Ashley with Robert W. Baird.","Steven Ashley - Robert W. Baird","The marketing cloud. In terms of capability to support corporate website marketing, I know ET recently acquired iGoDigital, giving them some capability there. Is that a capability that you would look or want to build out further in the future?","Marc Benioff","Well, there is no doubt that mobile is a critical part of what we are doing. And, whether it's, iGoDigital or some of the other capabilities in those areas as well as our investments in some of these great MDM companies, we are going to find some really great leverage and the ability to deliver a world-class offering through ExactTarget.","I think a lot of folks didn't really understand ExactTarget's capabilities. Their technology in this area is probably as deep as anyone or anything that I've ever seen and what we really need to do now is, we need to help them to communicate. It's a tremendous asset that they have and we need to do that through product marketing as well through development of a world-class sales organization.","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of David Hilal with FBR.","David Hilal - FBR","Marc, regarding the upcoming release of winter 2014, are there a few new features functionality that you think are more than incremental that will help maybe catalyze prospective customers who are on the fence to get on the right side of the fence. Anything you might offer up or maybe have a little more interest with that platform? Thank you.","Marc Benioff","Well, I think that there is more than a few a few, but you are going to have to wait until June for us to articulate the full value proposition of what we are doing and our exciting new vision for the future and the changes that we have made to our core platform that is going to enable a whole new generation of capabilities in sales and service, in marketing and building custom mobile applications as well. Thanks so much.","It's been a great quarter at salesforce. We couldn't be more excited about everything that's going on. We are looking forward to seeing you at Connections, we are looking forward to seeing you at Dreamforce. So I will be on Mad Money tonight with the Jim Cramer and I look forward to seeing you all in Indianapolis.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded for reply purposes.","It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to John Cummings, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","John Cummings","Thanks so much, Brian. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us for our fiscal third quarter 2019 results conference call. Our results press release, SEC filings, and a replay of today\u2019s call can be found on our IR website at www.salesforce.com\/investor. With me on the call today is Keith Block, Co-CEO; Marc Benioff, Chairman and Co-CEO; Mark Hawkins, President and CFO; and Bret Taylor, President and Chief Product Officer.","As a reminder, our commentary today will primarily be in non-GAAP terms. Reconciliations between our GAAP and non-GAAP results and guidance can be found in our earnings press release. Some of our comments today may contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Should any of these materialize or should our assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual Company results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements. A description of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions and other factors that could affect our financial results are included in our SEC filings, including our most recent report on Form 10-K.","With that, let me hand the call over to you, Keith.","Keith Block","Thank you, John, and thanks everyone for joining us today.","As you can see from our results, we had another great quarter as we continue to deliver strong growth, customer success and execution at scale. Revenue in Q3 was up 26%. And given the strength of the quarter and our outlook for Q4, we are raising our FY19 full year revenue guidance to $13.24 billion at the high-end of the range. This represents 26% growth this year. Obviously, we are very, very proud of the quarter and momentum in our business and our leadership position in the market.","We\u2019re also initiating revenue guidance for FY20 at $16 billion, at the high end of the range, representing 21% growth for year and demonstrating the incredible demand for the solutions only Salesforce can deliver. We are clearly executing on our vision of transformation and success for our customers, and we are doing it at scale.","Every company in the world has a mandate to digitally transform its business. We continue to see this in Q3 with strong performances across every industry, every market segment and every geography. We grew 25% in the Americas, 26% in APAC and 31% in EMEA in constant currency.","Now, since Dreamforce at the end of September, I've traveled around the world meeting with more than a 100 CEOs and world leaders. The conversation is consistent everywhere I go. It's about digital transformation, it's about leveraging our technology, it\u2019s about our culture, and it's about our values. This sea level engagement is translating into more strategic relationships than ever. In fact, in Q3, the number of deals generating more than $1 was up 46% over last year and the number of $20 million plus relationships we have continues to grow significantly. In fact, in the quarter, we renewed and expanded a nine-figure relationship with one of the largest financial services institutions in the world, very, very excited about this. As you know, an overwhelming majority of our revenue is multi-cloud. Customers like DuPont, Citi, Uber, many others are all driving more meaningful relationships with our customers across sales, service, marketing, commerce, integration and more.","I was recently in Australia where I met with dozens of government officials and CEOs across several industries, many are being challenged by disruption and all agree that being closer to their customers and citizens is critical to their growth and their success. And this is not unique to Australia. Digital transformation is a global phenomenon. Now, we had a great quarter in EMEA where we strengthened our relationships with Deutsche Telekom, NG, Dyson, Galois [ph]. In APAC, we expanded with [indiscernible] and Bajaj Finserv and formed a new relationship with MLC Life Insurance. In Japan, we expanded with heavy industrial manufacturer IHI as one of the world's leading manufacturers -- auto manufacturers. ","Our industry strategy, which is all about speaking the language of the customer, continues to drive exceptional growth. Our strong momentum with Financial Services Cloud continued in Q3. And as I mentioned before, one of the largest financial services institutions in the world selected Financial Services Cloud as well as Einstein. Mutual of America Life Insurance also selected Financial Services Cloud and they're leveraging Salesforce Einstein to improve their go-to-market strategy and customer engagement.","Heading on, Federal Credit Union, with nearly 2 million members is also going all the way with Financial Services Cloud as well as Community Cloud, Einstein and MuleSoft to deliver a best in class member experience. And the Salesforce platform now powers mission critical applications across the Department of Veterans Affairs while Service Cloud helps ensure veterans can reach a life support agent 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, very, very important for those folks.","We also expanded with a branch of the United States Armed Forces to transform how they engage with the service members from recruitment to retirement. And with Health Cloud, we formed a new relationship with WorkSafe Victoria in Australia and we expanded our existing relationship with Alcon, one of the world\u2019s leading eye care and medical device companies.","Now partners, which is so critical to our growth, they continue to expand our ecosystem, which extends the power of our core offerings. At Dreamforce, we added Apple to our roster of strategic partners, which we're very excited about. And that roster includes Amazon, Google, IBM and others. In this quarter, our SI partners were engaged in 64% of our new business globally and continue to invest in their Salesforce practices. Global partner certifications are up 26% year-over-year. That's the 19th consecutive quarter that our partner certifications have grown by double digits.","Now finally, we continue to execute again and again with our proven integration model. As a result, we're already seeing great returns from our acquisitions of MuleSoft and Datorama and CloudCraze. And speaking of MuleSoft, integration has become a strategic imperative for all of our customers, it has captured the attention of C level executives in virtually every conversation I have. And in the quarter, companies like Ahold Delhaize, WeWork, Michael Kors [ph] and contingents just love MuleSoft because MuleSoft is able to unlock data from legacy systems and accelerate their digital transformation.","In closing, we\u2019re thrilled with our results and our strong momentum heading into Q4 and FY20. It's been an outstanding year-to-date and we're well on our way to achieving our goal of $21 billion to $23 billion in revenue in FY22, faster than any enterprise software company in history. I want to thank our customers, our partners and employees for their trust and continued support. I also want to take a moment to thank the firefighters and first responders who courageously battled wildfires here in California. Our thoughts remain with them and all of those who have been affected by these terrible events.","With that, I will turn the call over to Marc.","Marc Benioff","All right. Well, thank you so much, Keith. And, before I start, I do want just come back to that and thank all of the first responders and everyone who\u2019s worked so hard over the last two weeks. We've had terrible tragedy here in Northern California and also one in Southern California and certainly here during the holidays, 14,000 families that lost their home, 500 businesses, half of all first responders lost their home in the fires and it's been a terrible disaster here to serve. Obviously, we had a terrible fire last year; this one is even worse, worse ever in Northern California. And all of our hearts are with the victims and their families. And also, all of our gratitude is with first responders. We had a city here filled with smoke for a couple weeks and that smoke just reminded us how connected we are, not only to each other here in San Francisco but all the way up to Butte County. And our hearts remain with them during the season. And we really want to thank our -- not only our employees but also customers, many of whom came to our lobbies here where we filled supplies up and brought them up to Butte County and distributed gift cards. Many of our customers who are retailers helped us prepare gift cards for first responders as well as for the families in Butte County, I want to thank them. And we're going to continue to work on that. It is still in our mind. And we're also giving $2 million initially to these relief efforts. And all of us at Salesforce are going to continue to stand with our neighbors and communities across California as we're rebuilding.","Thank you for letting me just talk about that for just a moment, because it's been something that we've all gone through here over the last two weeks, several weeks.","Okay. Now, with respect to the numbers. Keith said it, this was absolutely a fabulous third quarter. It was incredible. Obviously, we\u2019ve given guidance for an incredible fourth quarter coming. And I'm hoping that Keith is going to improve on that even though the fourth quarter guidance is incredible. And here we are $16 billion for next year and only two years from our goal of $22 billion to $23 billion, which is amazing that in fiscal year \u201822 we have this vision. So, thank you to our team and our ohana, who are delivering these incredible results. It\u2019s just amazing and incredible moment in history.","We are all in this midst [ph] here. And I just was talking to Jim Cramer, and he was like what is happening? [Ph] This is all about the Fourth Industrial Revolution. This is about the cloud, it\u2019s about artificial intelligence, machine learning, deep learning. I mean, there\u2019s so many technologies that are happening. I mean, I read this morning in the newspaper about CRISPR being used to genetic editing of twins in China. I mean, we are in a lot of uncharted territory here. And we\u2019re going to continue to see incredible expansion. But, when it gets right down to a digital transformations, well, every digital transformation starts and ends for all of our customers with their customer.","And CRM has never been more strategic. You could see that in the growth rates for the CRM marketplace. [Ph] It remains the fastest growing market segment in enterprise software. That\u2019s a big change from when Keith and I started in the enterprise software industry, started [ph] in 1986. And it was all about other types of technologies that have been downplayed. Now, it\u2019s all about the customer, it\u2019s about CRM. And this is a big and exciting market. We\u2019re obviously largest player, we have these incredible growth rates that we\u2019re putting up. When we look at other companies in the CRM marketplace, a lot of companies are doing very well, because this is what it\u2019s all about; it\u2019s all about the customer. And Salesforce remains this global CRM leader. We\u2019re the number one CRM. We continue to take share and outpace the market. You can see that in our results as we\u2019re moving to $16 billion. This is because we\u2019re the only company that is dedicated 100% to CRM at this size and scale. And we\u2019re the only company with a complete Customer Success Platform for both these B2B customers and their B2C companies as well.","For those of you who joined us at Dreamforce, I always look at that as the ultimate manifestation of our Company and how we\u2019re doing. You saw the huge turnout, especially compared to some of our competitors. I\u2019m not going to name any names, because they\u2019re very sensitive, they get upset. But some of our competitors also had conferences recently, they didn\u2019t have a big, huge turnout like this, 171,000 registered attendees, 10 million watched us online, largest Dreamforce ever. Probably everyone at the call was at Dreamforce, it was incredible. And we saw these amazing companies where Marriott, and Brunello Cucinelli was here from Italy and Unilever was here from the United Kingdom. And everyone connected with their customers in a whole new way. We also saw -- my friends that are right [ph] here did incredible new product. Bret Taylor launched his Customer 360, customers blow away, [ph] connecting all of our clouds together, giving our customers a single 360 degree view of their customers across every touch-point, across sales, across service marketing commerce, but really thinking now special of MuleSoft, how do we give those customers that 360 degree view they so badly want. And that\u2019s why this is one of the biggest [indiscernible] we\u2019ve ever made, and Bret will talk about it later on the call. And of course, you can see the acceleration in our business, and also in our positioning, our relationship with our customers, the MuleSoft, the number one integration cloud, giving customers extraordinary power of integration, bringing together vast amounts of data across all kinds of systems in this incredible API architecture. I always loved this company and I love it more now as part of Salesforce. They\u2019re right here with us now in Salesforce Tower. Greg and Steve just did incredible job. And we saw that not just at Dreamforce but through the whole quarter. And I think both companies are just hugely surprised that how well it\u2019s come together but also their execution dynamite. And then, you also saw the release again Bret came up with this with Parker, Einstein Voice, amazing. And you saw these amazing demonstrations of the voice, not just interactive voice response, but now Salesforce can actually parse the data and actually inset it correctly in the customer database automatically. So, anyone can talk to Salesforce, makes every employee and customer more productive, amazing. And Einstein, talking to Siri. Einstein and Siri are now friends. Hopefully they become friends, because we had Apple for the first time, strategic relationship, something we've always wanted, at Dreamforce, amazing to have this great relationship with Tim Cook, probably the best executive in our whole industry. Thank you Tim for your leadership and what you've done, the relationship with Salesforce, very grateful to you. And as we roll out these new mobile apps, our customers are expecting more innovation to come.","Now, you also saw that we're strengthening our relationships with amazing companies in the cloud world including Amazon, and Google, IBM delivering these incredible innovations. And our customers are just loving what the amount of innovation that's happening in our industry, especially as the cloud becomes mainstream. And at Dreamforce, we were thrilled to announce on these strategic partnership, again expanding that capability and giving that -- giving us that that capability to have it not only with Amazon and Google but Apple as well and other companies.","Okay. Let's talk about Einstein for a second. I told you Einstein was delivering 3 billion predictions and insights everyday in the last quarter. Well, now, few months later, we are doing 4 billion Einstein predictions every single day, exceeding our expectation. The transformation of all of our products, artificial intelligence, all of our products getting smarter, all of our products having Einstein built in that Einstein is at heart of the Customer Success Platform, making it more powerful, more capable every day. They look at the many layers of our Customer Success Platform. The center is the customer, then of course everything is going in and out of Einstein with Einstein making the customer smarter. Being our partner every day, I know I used that that's incredibly important to me, surrounded by this whole range of capabilities, whether it's sales or service or marketing or commerce or a platform, or integration or a community or enablement or engagement, I mean all levels of the Customer Success Platform has been made better by Einstein and then wrapped by this amazing trailblazer community, so awesome. ","Now, we really saw this weekend, I'll tell you during Black Friday and Cyber Monday of course our customers have deployed this Customer Success Platform. So, you're like wondering what's going on; I discussed it\u2019s amazing, report I can't talk about it because it's a public company and working very closely who had this massive success over the weekend. And they are retail industry. But, I look at all these companies and we are powering more than $20 million orders on the Customer Success Platform, double digit growth, amazing. But one thing that really stood out for us was 50% of the orders are placed on the phone, wow! Mobile traffic to retail sites reaches 67%. So obviously that's a huge transformation that we've gone through with our customers, especially retail customers are going through that. ","I\u2019d just like to touch base briefly now on our trailblazers. The outer ring of our platform. Our ohana is so important but especially our trailblazers, and we've got a million of these trailblazers who are empowered and enabled with all of this capability, and they're doing that on Trailhead. For those of you who\u2019ve not been on trailhead.com. Please get on trailhead.com. This is our free online marketing platform. It's letting everybody go through the workforce development they need to get into the Fourth Industrial Revolution to have their place in the digital economy. This is center to our strategy. And you can see that because a quarter of these customers are on trailhead, it\u2019s self reported that they have changed jobs because of skills they have gotten on the platform and the jobs they're getting are these phenomenal six-figure jobs and so excited for all of our trailblazers and our goals are to get to millions and millions of these trailblazers. So, we are really excited.","We also saw that we have received -- continue to get some great recognition. And of course paramount to Salesforce as our culture, Keith and I work on that the end every day. That's reflected in our core values of trust and customer success and innovation and of equality. But, our culture is very important for those of you\u2019ve been to any of our towers around the world, whether it\u2019s in San Francisco or Indianapolis, or London, or Tokyo, or New York. I can tell you, you can feel it when you walk in, the culture is so important to us and we're trying to cultivate a great culture. But thank you Fortune magazine ranking Salesforce, again the number one best place to work in the world and that is not just true globally but in so many of the cities also that we have -- do business and we've been called out by Fortune magazine. So thank you for that, that\u2019s so important to us. And also I also want to thank Harvard Business Review called out Salesforce, and obviously top CEOs but really calling to us number six top company in the world Harvard Business Review and number one American company for best performance for 2018. So, thank you Harvard Business Review, we're very, very grateful as well to you. ","We saw this quarter how the two parts of our vision at Salesforce changing the way the world does business and improving the state of the world go hand-in-hand. At the Global Climate summit in San Francisco, many of you were with us. Salesforce united with 21 other tech companies in the Step Up Declaration decarbonize [ph] companies. We realized it\u2019s more important. World Economic Forum says that by 2015 we're going to have more plastic in the ocean than fish. Who wants a plastic ocean? I don't. We're deforestation, losing 1 acre of forest every single second. Who wants a planet without forests? I don't. We need the forests right now more than ever, and this was evangelized by Jane Goodall at the conference because of the carbon situation. So, we've got to improve our situation with our climate. So, we've continued to focus with others in our industry to decarbonize and to improve our relationship with the climate.","Onward to public education. With the end of the Fourth Industrial Evolution, we've got to bring the kids with us. That's why we've now put more than $50 million in our local San Francisco and Oakland public schools. This is halfway to our short term target of $100 million. And everyone knows that we are thrilled that San Francisco passed Proposition C, amazing and record turnout, incredible turnout. San Francisco is coming to the polls realizing that we could do something together, which is passing Proposition C. Spoke to the Mayor this morning, and we are very excited moving forward with Proposition C, the city will begin collecting the tax January 1st and looking forward to getting that into the hands of amazing NGOs that we have here in San Francisco, like Hamilton families, like Larkin Street, like Glide, like Catholic Charities, so many people hero helping our terrible, horrible, homeless situation, and we experience it every day being here. I know many people who live in cities in the United States are experiencing that homelessness and there's so many things that we can do. We learned so much during Prop C, and saw so many great insights. But the number one thing that every homeless person needs is a home. And at this time of the year during the holidays, all those homeless people are on our minds more than ever.","And thank you for your strong support here in San Francisco. And the largest and most successful businesses are coming out for the good of the homeless. And thank you to Twilio now for giving $1 million and thank you to Airbnb for giving $5 million to homelessness since Prop C. Others are now able to -- coming in to support the homeless situation and we plan for another major announcement this week regarding the homeless. So, be on the lookout for that.","It's another reminder, business does not exist in a bubble, we\u2019re part of the city, we\u2019re part of the community, we\u2019re part of the ohana, we\u2019re part of the planet, and we realize we're all connected, we're all one that our companies are only as strong as these connections and our communities, and that's something Keith and I are talking about all the time how Salesforce can be a light unto the nations and be a beacon for others and show what's possible when business becomes one of the greatest platforms for change.","And with that let me turn it over to Chief Financial Officer to talk about how the company did during the quarter. Mark?","Mark Hawkins","Thank you very much, Marc.","As you\u2019ve heard, we delivered strong third quarter results as we continue to execute at scale. Third quarter revenue was 26% in dollars and in constant currency, despite experiencing a year-over-year FX headwind to revenue of $15 million and a sequential FX headwind to revenue of $19 million. And MuleSoft contributed $128 million to total revenue net of purchase accounting adjustments.","Looking at the year-over-year subscription and support revenue by cloud. Sales Cloud grew 11%, Service Cloud grew 24%, Platform and Other grew 51%, including approximately $105 million in MuleSoft, and Marketing and Commerce grew 37%.","Our attrition exited the quarter below 10%. Operating cash flow was $143 million, up 14% over last year. Third quarter OCF included our first bond coupon payment of approximately $44 million on the MuleSoft acquisition debt.","Unearned revenue ended the quarter at nearly $5.4 billion, up 25% in dollars and 26% in constant currency with MuleSoft contributing approximately $103 million. Unearned revenue was impacted by year-over-year FX headwind of $34 million and a sequential headwind of $39 million in the third quarter.","We've already said that unearned revenue can be lumpy due to invoice timing or renewal timing, duration changes, et cetera. And we saw that in the third quarter, where unearned revenue came in a bit better than our guidance, just had the effect of reducing the quarter-on-quarter sequential decline in unearned revenue from Q2 to Q3 we have historically seen. This also has an impact on the sequential change from Q3 to Q4, which I\u2019ll discuss in a moment.","Total remaining performance obligation, which represents all future revenues under contract, ended Q3 at $21.2 billion, up 34% over last year. MuleSoft contributed approximately $300 million to the balance in the quarter, the current portion of the remaining performance obligation, business that\u2019s both billed and unbilled expected to be recognized as revenue in the next 12 months was $10 billion, up 27% year-over-year.","Moving on to guidance, we came off a strong third quarter results. We are now once again raising our full fiscal year 2019 revenue guidance to $13.23 billion to $13.24 billion or 26% year-over-year growth. This guidance includes approximately $375 million from MuleSoft. We expect to deliver non-GAAP operating margin improvements of approximately 50 basis points at the high-end of our prior guidance range, even while the demand environment gives us the confidence to continue investing in MuleSoft and other growth initiatives.","We are raising our FY19 GAAP diluted EPS guidance to $1.06 to $1.07, our non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance to $2.60 to $2.61. And keep in mind, this guidance does not take into account the possible future impact related to ASU 2016-01. We are maintaining our full year fiscal 2019 operating cash flow growth guidance of 15% to 16% year-over-year. And as we discussed previously, this guidance includes a headwind of approximately $150 million related to our acquisition of MuleSoft. For Q4, we\u2019re expecting revenue of $3.551 billion to $3.561 million; GAAP diluted EPS of $0.89; and non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.54 to $0.55.","Turning to unearned revenue. We expect fourth quarter year-over-year unearned revenue growth of approximately 17%. This implies a sequential growth rate of approximately 52%. And let me take a moment to provide some additional context to this UR guidance. First, the FX environment has changed significantly over last year. And we now anticipate a year-over-year FX headwind to UR of approximately $200 million in Q4 versus an FX tailwind of approximately $130 million in Q4 of last year for $330 million FX swing year-over-year. Now, that represents about 5 percentage points of growth.","Secondly, as you may recall, in Q4 of last year, we had an extremely strong renewal quarter, including some of the largest renewals in history. This drove outsized growth in our billed and unbilled deferred revenue in Q4 of last year.","And thirdly and finally, as we discussed at the most recent Investor Day, the timing of invoices and renewals can impact the UR balance in any given quarter. Third quarter UR came in ahead of our guidance. And as a result of this dynamic, which has a direct impact on UR balance of successive quarters, and the related sequential changes.","As a reminder, this is the last quarter we\u2019ll provide unearned revenue guidance. That\u2019s said, when we report our fourth quarter results, you will have two full years of data on the current remaining performance obligation, which we think is a more complete metric because it\u2019s contract based versus invoice based.","Now moving on to FY20 guidance. As you\u2019ve heard from Keith, our demand environment remains very strong. And as a result, we\u2019re initiating fiscal 2020 revenue guidance of $15.9 billion to $16 billion for year-over-year growth of 20% to 21%, keeping us on track to deliver our target of $21 billion to $23 billion in revenue in FY22, now only little bit more than two years away. We will provide our cash flow, EPS and Non-GAAP operating margin guidance for FY20 when we report our fourth quarter and full year results in February 2019.","To close, we delivered another strong quarter of results and we have great momentum as we look to close out the year. I want to thank our employees, our customers our partners and our shareholders for your continued support. And I wish you all a wonderful holiday season.","And with that let's open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Karl Keirstead","Thank you very much. Maybe a question for Keith and Marc. Keith, you did mention you've been in front of a lot of customers of late. I'm just wondering, whether the tone of those conversations have changed much in the last few months, just not so much in terms of the Salesforce projected spend; that sounds like it's very strong, but just your broader view of the economy and the macro. I don\u2019t want to force you into being an economic forecaster, but just wondering if the tone has shifted at all. And then maybe a follow-up for Mark Hawkins. Mark, given that the performance on operating cash flow through the first nine months, you only need about 5% operating cash flow growth in 4Q to hit your 16% growth target. You were obviously much higher than that last fourth quarter. I know it's hard to predict and it's based on timing in of invoice payments. But just curious if there is anything you\u2019d provide for us. Thanks so much.","Keith Block","Yes. Hi, Carl; it's Keith. So, I have been on the road quite a bit actually in the quarter. So, I had the opportunity to spend a lot of time on the front lines with the troops and our customers. And here is the message I'm hearing. It is all about digital transformation. I am not going to make any comment about the macro environment; from what we see, it's all good. And this is a CEO level agenda; this transformation is important. The scent [ph] I get regardless of any speculation around the economy is that this has really become a mandate. And this wave of innovation, this wave of technology that is sweeping the globe is an imperative for these CEOs to be those Chief Transformation Officers. And that's what's going on in the market, that's why you see the results with us.","Marc Benioff","And let me just add to that that I think -- I said this a little bit already at Dreamforce as well, which is and I said this recently on TV. When I speak to CEOs and that happens probably every single day, especially some of these tax cuts that have happened, CEOs have been investing aggressively and the economy has really been ripping. I think that a lot of the forecast that I've seen in the 4% level in the United States, we felt that before that happened and we were talking about the economy was ripping before those aggressive growth estimates. When we look out for next year, I'm not sure I can see it going faster than it is now because I'm not sure that we -- where we would get all the people to hire that we need to hire. This is amazing what's happening and not just for us but for all -- for everybody. But maybe there is a modest -- a modest production [ph] growth, if it's 2% to 3% next year of the GDP, I wouldn't be hugely surprised, but I don't see some huge sea change in the economy, I consider to see strong growth because ","the strong growth because I've seen so much investment this year, it's going to pay out for these companies going forward. So, I see still several years ahead of good solid growth for the economy. And where that gets tampered, I think I've mentioned this before is when I talk to European CEOs, they tend to be more conservative. And some of those CEOs, they maybe specifically in their region are not as optimistic potentially as I would say American or Asian or CEOs based in Asia. So, that's how I still look at it that we are still in the economy right now and look at these numbers that are ripping and we still see very much a huge investment focus going on.","Mark Hawkins","Yes. Let me just jump on to second part of the question, Karl, thank you for that. Yes. We are obviously pleased with our operating cash flow performance year-to-date as you've called out. We're very much tracking the fiscal year number that we have been driving toward ever since we acquired MuleSoft, which we -- as we called $150 million impact that would be negative in the first year of the acquisition, mainly due to debt expense and some lost interest income. But, when you -- the other factor to look at that besides the fact that we're absolutely tracking our fiscal year, it\u2019s Q4 is one of the biggest quarters of the year for us. And obviously, we'll know more as we get to the end of that. We feel that this is appropriate to stay with the fiscal number, especially in light of the fact that Q4 there is clearly an FX headwind if you just look at the FX rates year-on-year that's another factor to be considered. We're staying on track for the year. We'll know more at the end of the quarter. But given the FX headwind, I think this is totally appropriate.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Phil Winslow with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Phil Winslow","Thanks guys for taking my question and congrats on a great quarter. I just really want to focus on the concept of front office suite. Obviously, you guys have talked about that for several years now and we're obviously believers. If you think about this year, we've seen probably north of $15 billion of M&A from some of your competitors trying to build out the different pillars of a suite. What are you hearing from your customers in terms of the competitive landscape, especially sort of post this M&A and even beyond the M&A some of the data sharing initiatives out there between frenemies, what are you hearing from customers, how do you think about how the landscape changed?","Marc Benioff","Well, I think that we should ask our President of Products, Bret Taylor to share kind of his vision of where we're going with our Customer Success Platform.","Bret Taylor","Yes. I think our strategy as it relates to competition is really reflected in our Dreamforce announcements, particularly Customer 360. When you talk to our customers, they're not looking to buy a piece of technology looking to transform their business. Our strategic advantage is that we\u2019re the number one in sales, the number one in service, the number one in platform, and the number one in marketing. As you look at Black Friday, I think you can really see where our customers are using every single one of those technologies to transform their customer experience. You might send out a promotion for your Black Friday sales, via a text message or via email in our marketing product. You transact in our Commerce Cloud, you provide service via our Service Cloud. We're the only company that can provide all the solutions in a integrated way. And now with Customer 360, you have a single view of your customer through all the touch points. And so, our strategic advantage relative to competitors trying to catch up by acquiring the second place product in each of the spaces is that we are an integrated solution. And keep an eye and I have talked a lot about this. Our customers are looking for an integrated solution to their business problems, not just pieces of technologies and that\u2019s our strategic advantage in our product portfolio.","Marc Benioff","So, Bret, you've done a great job. I mean when we look at that product portfolio, we look at you've built out with the Customer Success Platform, you've got, of course, sales; you've got service and field service; you've got marketing; you've got B2C and B2B e-commerce; you've got engagement with Heroku, which still remains on its air; you've got platform and this incredible ecosystem; you've got integration, matches with Customer 360, this work with MuleSoft; you've got advanced analytics, the word in industries; you saw what Financial Services Cloud did this quarter, got partners and communities enablement collaboration, and on top of all of that you have that whole trailblazer community. I don't think there's any company that has built out a comprehensive Customer Success Platform like that. Now, when you've got to Dreamforce and saw it tied together with Customer 360, what was your biggest surprise? ","Bret Taylor","My biggest takeaway was the importance of Trailhead and that trailblazer community. In addition, when one of our customers decides to deploy our technology, we're not the only person there helping them. Our partner ecosystem is there with them. And then partner ecosystem is fueled by trailhead. One of the things that you mentioned Marc in your opening, I think it\u2019s really powerful, there's over 1 million people learning for free on Trailhead and one in four have gotten a new job on the other side of that, because they're developing new skills. And ways to think about it from our customers\u2019 perspective and the thing you see in the Dreamforce is, when someone use -- decides to deploy Salesforce, they have the best ecosystem of support of partners around them. That's really what\u2019s driving the success of our customers with the technology which is the thing that we are exclusively focused on.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Derrick Wood with Cowen and Company. Your line is now open. ","Derrick Wood","Great. Thanks. Keith, one of the things that we commonly heard at Dreamforce is that partners are finding it harder to hire and build up Salesforce, certified resources to meet the demand, which is I guess, especially saying that demand is outstripping supply from a consulting and implementation standpoint. Do you hear this as a trend in the field from your partners? And do you ever see it weighing on pipeline conversion cycles? And then, you were just talking about Trailhead. I know it\u2019s been in the market for a little bit. How effective do you view Trailhead in helping to virally cultivate resources? And can it help maybe populate talent in a quicker fashion that you\u2019ve historically seen?","Keith Block","Thanks for the question. So, as you know, the relationship that we have with our partners is very strategic to our business. You've heard me talk about in the call that they're involved in about 64% of our go-to-market efforts. And the certifications, 19 consecutive quarters of double-digit certification growth. I mean, there -- you have got talk to any of these firms, whether it's PwC or Deloitte or Accenture or IBM, and ask them what their fastest growing practices and scale Salesforce. And this is great news for our customers, because we wake up every day, as you know as a Company and we think about what's important for our customers. And the partner ecosystem is certainly a big part of that.","We are very, very focused on our partners, and we have plans with them to not only increase their capacity, but also to enhance their capabilities. And the centerpiece for that is Trailhead. And offering and extending Trailhead for them to make sure that they get the right skills at the right time so that they can convert and cannibalize their practices from their legacy providers. And that's been a part of their strategy.","We also encourage the growth of boutiques but it\u2019s not just the enterprise based business; it's also in the mid market and the SMB. And we invest as part of our funds with Salesforce ventures to provide startup the opportunity to build and cultivate these practices to help with the SMB. So we\u2019ve got a pretty comprehensive strategy to build out these SMB, SMB boutique consulting firms, these Accentures of the world et cetera. And in my entire career, I\u2019ve never seen a closer relationship with the SI ecosystem like the one that we have in Salesforce.","We do a lot of joint planning, there is a lot of collaboration, they\u2019re very integrated and everything that we do inside the company. And again, they are a big part of our future and we\u2019re very optimistic that they will continue to expand and convert the resources they need to drive success for our customers.","Marc Benioff","So, Keith, let me ask you a question. Let\u2019s say, there\u2019s entrepreneurs listening on the call today and they\u2019re hearing what you\u2019re saying. Are you saying that, if I\u2019m an entrepreneur, I want to starting a new company, starting a company providing these kind of boutique services in the Salesforce ecosystem, that\u2019s a good business opportunity and is Salesforce investing in those companies, so you\u2019re going to invest?","Keith Block","That is a fantastic business opportunity. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve got the consulting firms setup in Salesforce ventures around the world. ","Marc Benioff","And then, we\u2019ve seen so many of those boutiques get acquired by the mainstream SIs motivate to grow their practices\u2026.","Keith Block","Absolutely. And the important thing for us to continue to do is to keep cultivating and growing those practices into new marketplace. ","Marc Benioff","I mean, you look at some of these companies that we that were strong independent companies like Google is a great example or some of the other. But, they\u2019ve been acquired now by this very largest and most important systems integrator. And so, this remains a great opportunity for everybody.","Keith Block","Absolutely","Marc Benioff","Terrific. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question will come from the line of Kash Rangan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. ","Kash Rangan","Congratulations to the Salesforce team. I have a bit of a philosophical question. You\u2019re sitting on some markets, massive TAM, 145 billion. But only one of your cloud is really dominant in terms of market share and it\u2019s industry which is Sales Cloud. I\u2019m curious at what point, like some of the commanding technology companies, the SGAs, that\u2019s Oracle and database market or Microsoft, the operating system market, where they\u2019ve defined the market. So, at what point are we -- how close are we to a tipping point where service, marketing, commerce, platform all these markets start to tip in your way that it\u2019s not really so much of outbound -- of course, there\u2019s always going to be outbound selling motion. But the market really starts to come to you, you start to get these dominant shares and the other markets, so you can start to realize you TAM 144 billion TYAM in a more significant way. That\u2019s it for me. Thank you and happy holidays in advance.","Marc Benioff","Kash, I think you normally see this in the growth rate that we\u2019re reporting on all the clouds. So, this is not anything that we\u2019re trying to keep from you. You can see in the numbers that we are --it\u2019s an abundance of riches in Salesforce. And yes, we have a great product for Sales Cloud, it\u2019s doing just fine, but we also have a phenomenal service business, field service business and service add-on business that\u2019s also growing extremely well. We also have an amazing marketing cloud business, that\u2019s growing extremely well and an commerce. And I\u2019ve mentioned Heroku, it doesn\u2019t get reported, but it\u2019s part of our platform obviously, very important part of our platform integrated, which is also great business. And now, we have an integration business which is also -- it\u2019s an unbelievable business. And we have an analytics cloud that\u2019s an unbelievable business. And we have industries that Keith has cooked up with financial services and health cloud, which is also an unbelievable business. And by the way, we acquired Bret Taylor\u2019s company Quip, which is an unbelievable business. And that just has a huge deal with Citibank for the quarter. I mean that was awesome to see what the Citi with Quip, enabling all of their employees around the world. Congratulations to Bret and Kevin helping city work together faster in this incredible productivity environment. It's a product I use every day. If you haven\u2019t downloaded, it's worth, it\u2019s what Amazon uses, it's what Apple uses, the Citibank uses to manage their productivity and you saw it at Dreamforce we announce Quip Slides which is incredible. But it\u2019s abundance of riches. And key organizing principle though for us is customer. So, yes, we're in all these areas, but there is other companies in service and there is other companies in marketing, there is other companies in a lot of these areas but our organizing principle is that we're here to tie it all together to give you 360 view of your customer and that's what unique for Salesforce. Every company has organizing principle has its own organizing principle as you know, because you cover all these companies. And you know what ours is and you know what our answer is going to be that everything begins and ends with customer. Bret, do you want to add to that?","Bret Taylor","Yes. I think Marc put it exactly right. And the backdrop that I\u2019m really excited about and the reason why I think you see a such amazing growth and Service Cloud for our marketing cloud and continued growth in our Sales Cloud is. , these product aren\u2019t staying still. The Fourth Industrial Revolution is transforming each of these markets. Take Service Cloud, which is just an amazing product with amazing growth rate. Right now, artificial intelligence is completely transforming our industry and it's driving every CEO to Salesforce to say hey, how can you help me transform my customer service experience, which is really the tip of the spear that relates to customer experience. And that's why Service Cloud is growing 24% year-over-year, one of our largest and fastest growing businesses. We assume that's in every single cloud. So, as a technologist here, what's exciting for me is not just really TAM but also just seeing the motion of change in each of these businesses and how we can help our customers navigate these technology changes happening around them. ","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Pat Walravens from JMP Securities. Your line is now open. ","Pat Walravens","Great. Thank you. And let me add my congratulations. So, MuleSoft is clearly proving to been a great decision for you. What sorts of things might make sense for Salesforce to buy next? And then, Marc, I'd love to hear your thoughts if it fits in there on SAP's acquisition of Qualtrics. ","Marc Benioff","Well, I can just tell you that there is a lot of things that Salesforce can do, because customer opportunity is much bigger and more exciting I think than anybody really ever realized. But for MuleSoft, it\u2019s the company that I loved for years, it's the company that I helped lead our early investing in and then helped go public and so forth. And while I wanted to buy them for years, unfortunately I have a very strong and sovereign management team that's sitting around the table and they're not that easy to deal with. And they make it hard for me to do what I want to do, but I did get that one over the line. So thanks a lot for that. But, there is a lot of others that I love to see that I think that our customers would love to have more tightly integrated, more part of our product, really important. And what other companies -- I don't know if you\u2019ve seen the front of the Wall Street Journal lately, but with sort of market share graph, CRM on the cover of the Wall Street Journal, have you seen it? I think we also put it in our slide deck here for you, hopefully we did. Because it's our number one marketing graphic. And not everyone is doing as well as we are in CRM. So, not everyone is doing as well as we are in cloud. And you know that. So, every year, I've got some new thing, whatever and I can't follow them all because they're also difficult and they buy companies I've never heard of. So, I can't really comment on them. But, God bless them. And I hope that they're successful in CRM because it's good for us.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Alex Zukin with Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open.","Alex Zukin","Hey, guys. Let me add my congratulations for the quarter. I want to ask the question about verticals maybe for Keith, you talked about the amazing success in financial services. The big deal with the financial institution with the success being driven by Financial Service Cloud, which we also picked up in our field work. I guess, I wanted to understand could you talk about what is the incremental kind of value prop and features that are available to customers that go from generic Service Cloud to Financial Service Cloud and any commentary on the financial uplift that Salesforce sees through those migrations would be appreciated.","Keith Block","Hi, Alex. I'm happy to do a feature function conversation with you if you like. But here's the way I\u2019d think of our Financial Services Cloud. So, first in the beginning of time there was the Service Cloud. Right. And then, on the seventh day, God created something else and said it was Financial Services Cloud and then Financial Services Cloud started on a wealth management and then it went from wealth management to retail banking, then it went to consumer banking and then it would go to commercial banking, and the list will go on and on. By the way, Financial Services Cloud has made great integration points with partners like Guardwire and Velocity as well. So, those are compelling solutions for our customers.","At the end of the day, this is a capability that customers want to buy off the shelf software. They don't want to be customizing and building their own capabilities, because in a sense, it\u2019s just repainting [indiscernible] you're just doing in tech refresh but really you're not retiring your legacy debt. And that's why customers want these capabilities embedded in our technology and that's exactly what we're doing. We're responding to our customers in these industries by providing very rich functionality that is specific to what those customers are looking for. And that's been the strategy.","Now, we can do that two ways. One is that we can enhance our product so that these customers get the commercially available off the shelf software or we can go partner with an ISV, like an [indiscernible]. So that has been our strategy. You can see the results. If you think about the pace of Financial Services Cloud, arguably it's the most successful cloud that we've ever launched. It has established very deep and meaningful relationships with our customers. The roster of financial services companies that we're doing business with now, they all want Financial Services Cloud and we just continue to win and win and win, and that's faith. So, it's very, very exciting for us.","Marc Benioff","And for the previous question where there was a question about how we're doing with our competitors, I put on my Twitter feed for you the market share information. So, you just get that directly.","Keith Block","I do want to make a comment about the competitors because listening to Marc and Bret talk about this, just a lot of these companies have been in the business for a very, very long time. They've been in the legacy business. They have not been in the cloud business. They claim that they could be cloud companies because maybe they have an architecture that\u2019s suggested for the cloud but it's not just about the architecture, it's also about the business model. Most importantly, it's about the culture of the company and the focus on customer. And since the day this Company was started, everything that we do is focus on the customer. If you look at some of these legacy companies that are trying to get in the game in the front office and say that they're now CRM companies, it's not in their DNA. So, as Marc said, we wish them luck. And, we'll see you in the marketplace. But please don't underestimate the importance of having the customer is part of the culture.","Marc Benioff","And I have really had to start to curtail my comments. And I'd love to talk about specific companies and other CEOs, every time I do, I get a phone call, they\u2019re very sensitive. And I don't want to heart anybody\u2019s feeling during the holidays. So, I'm really holding back on the call. So, I'm just going to do that once at least.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Tom Roderick with Stifel. Your line is now open.","Tom Roderick","Hey, gentlemen. Thank you for taking my questions. So, question for Marc Benioff. Marc, you're constantly in touch with global tech leaders, partners. And going back to Dreamforce, you certainly had some nice updates relative to Google as a partner, some of the things you're working on there. They of course had some changes at the leadership at the top. I'd love to hear a little bit more if you could talk about how that partnership has progressed? And now that they are sort of going through some new leadership changes at the top, what sort of opportunities exist to further extend that partnership? AWS has been fantastic. This one has a nice so start off the ground with the analytic side where can you take it from here?","Marc Benioff","Well, you just mentioned two great companies, Amazon and Google. They both have phenomenal cloud offerings, they both have very strong CEOs. Jeff is amazing and also Sundar is amazing. And they're both doing extremely well in our customer base. We see lots of action with both of those customers and partners. And specific to Google, I mean Bret obviously is the creator of Google Maps and worked at Google for while. So, So, I don\u2019t know if you want to touch, how do you -- unique perspective and all of those.","Bret Taylor","Yes. I just had such a great privilege to have such amazing partners. And we really worked at customer success and what our customers need to be successful. And I look at Amazon Web Services, Apple, Google, we\u2019re really saying who are companies that our customers want to partner with, and who do they want us to partner with, to drive success. And when I look at Google, every single one of our marketing cloud customers, Commerce Cloud customers has a deep relationship with Google, because of the providence of Google Search, their ad network marketing analytics. And so, I really view this is an amazing opportunity to bring the best of both companies to bear when we're trying to provide the solutions to our customers. And our customer response has just been fantastic. And we -- I hope to deepen that relationship in the future and just make sure that when we provide these to our customers, the products work together across, the companies work together and our customers have an amazing experience.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from the Jennifer Lowe with UBS. Your line is now open.","Jennifer Lowe","Great. Thank you. As you start to talk with CEOs and senior decision makers about these big strategic digital transformation projects, and you mentioned many of them are multiyear in scope, it strikes me that these touch a lot of systems, a lot of processes, and it's a challenge to sort of figure out what comes first. But, as you sort of start through that prioritization process, how often are you going in and creating a new application that didn't exist before, versus replacing legacy off the shelf software versus custom app development or replacing legacy custom applications? And how has that evolved as you increased your strategic value to those customers?","Keith Block","Hi. This is Keith. So, that's a great question. The way I would think about this is that the whole environment is just right for innovation, okay. The innovation could be something that's custom developed with our technology or it could be something that's just using our standard product. Obviously, customers like to take advantage of flexibility that our products provide. And they want to model their processes aligned to our technology, rather than building custom apps themselves, comma. The power of the technology is such n nowadays that you can do amazing things that you couldn\u2019t have done before. So, it\u2019s kind of hard to give you an apples-to-apples comparison, but it\u2019s really an interesting phenomenon, because the wave of innovation is just so impressive in what we\u2019re seeing in the marketplace. And that innovation is supported by our platform, it\u2019s supported by our Service Cloud or host and Customer Success Platform. So, it\u2019s hard to give you the exact number. But, it\u2019s all about innovation and creating.","Marc Benioff","All right. Well, as we bring our call to a close, I want to thank everybody for participating on today\u2019s call. As I opened the call, I also mentioned our hearts remain everyone, who suffered during the horrible fires. And I\u2019d like to bring your attention to our local organization who is doing so much and has done so much support already, which is our North Valley Community Foundation, which is providing tremendous support for the campfire relief.","And if you could support them, we would appreciate it. It\u2019s nvcf.org as Nanacy, Victor, Charlie, Frank.org, North Valley Community Foundation and our hearts or looking entire community of Paradise and the surrounding areas affected by the campfire. We love for you to please consider a tax deductible donation to the campfire relief fund. And to assist to the many community organizations who are serving evacuees, and especially our tremendous first responders. So, thank you, everybody, and we look forward to talking again next quarter.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation on today\u2019s conference.

And so, we know there's a lot of interest in the quarter and we made a decision, we're going to put aside the vast majority of our script so that we can get into Q&A as fast as possible with you.","Look, my number one thing I want to tell you is, this is the absolute best quarter we have ever had. It's been just an incredible quarter, way beyond our expectations. It caps an incredible fiscal year for us. I'm sure that you saw that revenue for the quarter rose to $1.8 billion, and that's up 27%, which is really just amazing. Revenue for the full fiscal year was also up 27%, $6.7 billion. So you look at those things and you go, wow, I mean, that's a very fast growth rate for a company of our size and scale. For a top-10 enterprise software company, you all know the growth rates of Microsoft, Oracle, SAP are shrinking; negative growth rates in many cases, and here we are at a 27% growth rate in this enterprise applications market. And as Keith gets into it, you're going to hear that we believe that we're selling more enterprise apps than Oracle or SAP.","Deferred revenue grew to nearly $4.3 billion, which was up 31%. Quarterly operating cash flow was nearly $460 million, up 38%. That number, of course, exceeded everyone's expectation and took us by surprise as well. And we are really proud of that number, $460 million quarterly operating cash flow in the quarter.","Full-year operating cash flow was $1.6 billion, up 37%. And the dollar value of booked business on and off the balance sheet, $11 billion. That is obviously a huge number for us, something that we've never had before, and it's really a huge reflection of the amount of business that has been achieved in the fiscal year and specifically, in the quarter as well.","We've got great momentum going into our first quarter. We're guiding to an incredible number here, and $1.895 billion at the high end of our range. And for the full-year, we're increasing our revenue guidance to $8.12 billion. So, we are really excited and aggressive in our guidance. And, look, it was an amazing quarter. It was an amazing year. We are confident it's going to be an amazing first quarter. And no other enterprise software company of our size and scale is delivering at this level or as excited as we are, and no one else is as well positioned for this age of the customer that we are all moving into in this fourth industrial revolution.","Before I hand the call now over to Keith, I just want to thank all of our customers, and I want to thank all of our partners, and I also want to congratulate all 20,000 of our employees on an amazing year. We are deeply, deeply, deeply grateful for everything that you do for us every day, and we don't forget that. For one moment, every single day with us at salesforce starts with gratitude, and we know that this is a special time and we're grateful for all the hard work that everyone has put in.","Also, I know you're going to want to catch us on our World Tour that's coming up, and big events are starting next month. You'll see us at CeBIT in Germany, and then Chicago, Boston, Melbourne, Amsterdam. We'll be in Washington, D.C. as well, so come to one of our events, and we've got a great new COO here at salesforce as well.","So, Keith, congratulations on your promotion. Well done.","Keith G. Block - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Operating Officer","Thank you very much, Marc.","Marc Russell Benioff - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And why don't you tell us about the quarter?","Keith G. Block - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Operating Officer","Thanks, Marc. Listen, this was an amazing quarter. Our team, really the whole company, delivered the best quarter in my two years here at salesforce. It was a breakthrough quarter. It certainly was a breakthrough year for us, and it translated into some amazing results in every region, every industry and really accounted across companies of all sizes. We signed two of the largest deals that I've seen in my career. I mean absolutely fantastic.","I mean, first we signed an exciting new nine-figure transaction with one of the world's most respected companies; and second, we signed the largest renewal in the history of the company; and, listen, they didn't just renew. They also significantly expanded their nine-figure relationship with us in Q4, and we are now their company-wide platform for innovation. I mean it's really amazing what the team has done, and how these customers have embraced us.","We also drove an all-time high in the number of large transactions this year, which is incredible \u2013 more than 600, seven-figure plus transactions in the quarter. And I'll tell you, Marc said it, I'll say it again, no one in enterprise software \u2013 no one in enterprise software is developing more strategic relationships right now than salesforce.","And, you know what, there's no better example of this than Unilever, which is one of the world's greatest consumer packaged goods companies. It's a great digital transformation story and a significant \u2013 significant expansion for us here in Q4. We've been delivering great levels of success with their consumer and marketing teams. We're now working across all business functions and Unilever plans to bring 95,000 of their employees onto the salesforce platform. So, that means they are empowering their digital employee strategy to new levels of engagement.","Now, Charles Schwab and other great brand is an exciting new relationship in the quarter. They'll be using salesforce for their entire CRM platform. This is a great example of how Ignite, an industry team, have played a pivotal role with an important customer; as you all know, Ignite is part of our go-to-market motion.","Also I think we had mentioned in Q1, if you remember, we had told you about our largest Marketing Cloud win ever then we signed an even bigger one in Q3 and in Q4 we did it again. We talked ourselves and we entered into our largest Marketing Cloud relationship ever with a large social network. In fact, Marketing Cloud continues its success and increased the number of large Marketing Cloud transactions by more than 60% in the past year.","Also one of the largest retailers in the world expanded with us in the quarter and selected salesforce as their company-wide collaboration platform. And you know what, there are many, many, many more stories. These are some of the world's greatest brands, some of the greatest stories and we continue to deepen our strategic relationships with all of them.","I mean, this is great momentum, it's incredible momentum and growth across all of our key industries, in all of our key markets. And I will say again, as Marc did, I'm very, very proud of the entire company for all of these accomplishments, all our outstanding results are just proof positive that our strategy is absolutely more than taking hold. I'd also like to thank our customers and our partners, because they are helping us set the standard for this industry.","So with that, I'll hand it over to Mark Hawkins.","Mark J. Hawkins - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Keith. We had an incredible financial quarter, so let me start off with some highlights. In addition to the operating cash flow results, Marc mentioned, we continue to drive increased operating leverage. For the full-year, we increased our non-GAAP operating margin by 177 basis points, this is a great result as we continue to grow our top line.","Our year-over-year growth was balanced across all of our clouds and all of our regions. Sales Cloud accelerated in the quarter with 12% growth. Service Cloud grew 35%. Marketing Cloud grew 31%. And Apps Cloud and Others grew 43%.","In the regions, EMEA grew 33% and APAC continues to accelerate at 26% growth, both in constant currency. We also got up to a great start in Q4. And that early quarter strength translated into strong billings and collections in the quarter and helped drive our cash flow in Q4. It also helped us drive our top line performance in Q4 and when you exclude the FX effect of $32 million, revenue was up 27% in constant currency.","Supporting this great top line growth was our declining attrition rate, which remained below 9%. Our deferred revenue in the quarter reached an all-time high of $4.3 billion, this was up 31% in constant currency, when excluding an FX effect of $48 million. We also continue to drive an increase in annual billings in the quarter with 88% of all our subscription and support related invoices issued with annual terms. This benefited year-over-year deferred revenue growth in the quarter by approximately three percentage points.","Moving on to guidance, coming off of strong Q4 and with our proven business model, we are raising our FY 2017 revenue guidance to $8.12 billion at the high end of the range. We're also initiating FY 2017 non-GAAP EPS guidance of $0.99 to $1.01.","In context, we expect to deliver 125 basis points to 150 basis points of non-GAAP operating margin improvement in FY 2017. And this is just coming off a year where we exceeded the high end of our FY 2016 operating margin guidance. As a result of this, we continued margin expansion, we expect to drive another full-year of strong operating cash flow with year-over-year growth of 23% to 24%.","For Q1, we're expecting revenue of $1.885 billion to $1.895 billion, non-GAAP EPS of $0.23 to $0.24, and year-over-year deferred revenue growth of 24% to 25%.","A quick note on our Q1 guide; as all of you know, FY 2017 is a leap year. And given we recognize our revenue on a daily basis, there's an extra day of subscription revenue in the first quarter. This will benefit our first quarter revenue by approximately $20 million and will drive a slightly higher non-GAAP EPS and will reduce our deferred revenue by the corresponding amount. This is simply a timing item, that has no impact on the full FY 2017 fiscal year results, but this will have an impact on your quarterly and full-year compares in FY 2018.","To close, we had an outstanding quarter and year, and we are well positioned for yet another great year in FY 2017. And at this time, I'd like to add my thanks to the entire salesforce team for these great results.","With that, I'd like to open up the call for questions.","John Cummings - Vice President-Investor Relations","Ashley, we'll take calls when you're ready.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We'll pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster. Your first question comes from the line of Keith Weiss of Morgan Stanley.","Keith Eric Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Excellent. Thank you guys for taking the question, and very strong, very nice quarter. I guess the question I wanted to ask was the why \u2013 to Mr. Benioff, like you're saying not many companies at this scale actually see accelerating growth. Anything you can point just to, in terms of why you guys are seeing this now? What's really clicking on in the business that will let you guys accelerate?","And then maybe if I could squeeze in one for Mr. Hawkins, just in terms of as we're thinking about FY 2017, the business is getting increasingly seasonal, so in Q1 growth would be a little bit lower and more growth in the back half of the year. Given the current sort of economic environment, how do you garner confidence in the ability to sustain this 20%-plus growth for the full-year of FY 2017?","Marc Russell Benioff - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, our growth strategy is really built on having a full portfolio of products. I think you know about that in Sales, in Service, in Marketing, Community and Analytics, in Apps, in IoT, and as well as a full portfolio of geographies as well, doing business around the world like in the United States, in Japan, Europe, Australia, Canada; and in addition to doing business with enterprises and as well as small and medium businesses.","And when that full portfolio accelerates, that is they all come in, in the quarter, which we really never expect, every product and every geography in both enterprise and SMB to come in, then you get this kind of accelerated revenue growth, which is what you see at this 27% number on both the year and the quarter.","As I said in my opening remarks, it's the best quarter we've ever seen. We would never expect to see every product group and every geography and every sector of our business exceed our expectations. But that's what we saw in the fourth quarter and that creates this phenomenal momentum that we have now. And look at that number on and off the balance sheet, $11 billion, there's no greater predictor of our future success than this deferred revenue that we now have in place.","Mark J. Hawkins - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Great. Let me pick up the second half of that question that you directed. Just building on Marc's comments, I think you'd asked a little bit about the seasonality in FY 2017 starting with Q1.","Back at our Analyst Day, Keith, I was referring to, we looked at this compounding effect and more and more of our renewals and business happening and showing up in Q4, showing up in the impact in DR and then having a quarter-on-quarter effect throughout the year. That compounding effect, in fact, is happening. We see that, and I affirm that, and you can see just a terrific Q4 result and a terrific DR performance.","On the macro side, to Marc's point, when you have $11 billion of booked and billed and unbilled deferred revenue, that gives you a lot of confidence. When you see our big deals coming in, like Keith referenced, it gives you the confidence. When you see the business performing across geos, across clouds, that gives you the confidence that our book of business and what we're hearing from the customer had basically caused us to raise our guidance, and that's what we're seeing.","Now we read the same newspapers as everybody else. We're not seeing an economic impact. We're seeing customers doing the kinds of things that we talked about earlier on the call. So, hopefully that helps.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Kash Rangan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, guys. Thank you for taking my question, and apologize for the background noise here. Marc, I've not heard of nine-figure deals in technology. Can you talk about what exactly, Marc Benioff, that is, or Keith, can you talk about the dynamics here? Who did you displace? What is the scope of this implementation? What is this customer looking to do with salesforce's portfolio of products, and could this be a \u2013 hopefully a leading forward indicator of what other customers could also adopt from the salesforce product family? Thanks. Congrats.","Marc Russell Benioff - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, Kash, you make a very good point, which is, these are very unusual transactions and we never like to over-emphasize these transactions, because they tend to be few and far between, because they are just exceptional in size, quality and depth. But we had an incredible renewal with one of the world's largest insurance companies, and we had an incredible new transaction with one of the world's largest professional services companies. And it really, I think, is a testament to some of the processes that Keith has put into place in regards to the enterprise and I'm going to let him speak to that.","And I want to also make the comment that it's not just those two large transactions, but you heard what Keith had to say about the broad range of large transactions that were seven-digit and eight-digit deals as well. And, I'll just get back to my first comment, it was across all sectors of the business in product, in geography, and in enterprise and SMB. And, Keith, will you just address Kash's question specifically, in terms of what we're seeing and how we're able to create such large transactions?","Keith G. Block - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Operating Officer","Yeah. Thanks, Marc. So look, first of all, I would say that this has absolutely been an outstanding set of execution across the board, in all market segments. The broader market and the enterprise space has obviously been a focus and emphasis area for us over the past few years.","If I were to characterize these two transactions in particular, I would tell you that they are CEO-level sales. We are in the boardroom. And we find ourselves in a position where customers, as Marc had indicated earlier, are looking for our help bring them into the age of the customer. They're looking to embrace the concept and notion of digital transformation. They view us as the market leader, and really the only company that is uniquely positioned to provide them with that transformation, or that level of transformation. And this is what's happening in these very large deals, it's happening in every deal, where these customers are viewing us as a trusted advisor. And that is becoming the norm. And this is something that has been happening for some period of time, and we continue to see it as we move forward.","Marc Russell Benioff - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We're very excited about what's happening here in terms of the market dynamics.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs.","Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thank you. I was wondering, Marc Benioff, if you could talk to us a little bit about your vision for Analytics, I know the product is relatively new. I guess I'm just wondering, out of Dreamforce, if you could give us an update on the types of customer conversations you're having in regards to Analytics? And if you were to look out kind of three years to five years, how do you think about \u2013 there's obviously multiple different vendors right now that can do Analytics on top of the salesforce platform. How do you think of your own offering kind of replacing those people that are piggybacking on top of CRM deployments today? Thank you.","Marc Russell Benioff - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, Heather, I think it's a great question and really a huge focus here at salesforce. Of course, Analytics applications have been an incredible part of the CRM market for a long time, and there are many vendors who offer Analytics applications on our platform.","When we first introduced our Wave capability, which was just a little over a year ago, we didn't introduce applications. We introduced a platform. We introduced the ability to build Analytics applications using our Wave platform.","And we said that this strategy was going be quite differentiated from others, because we were going to be platform first, we were going to build an ecosystem, and then we would later build these applications and then we would later build all of these capabilities from the platform into all of our products and into all of our ISV capabilities as well. And that's where we are today.","I think that there isn't a customer or demonstration or new sale that's happening, where this Analytics capability is not a huge part of what we offer the customer. This is analytics-as-a-service. This is scalability, this runs on your phone, on your tablet. This runs on your desktop. This runs on your watch. This is a multi-tenant, fully scalable system. It has all the characteristics of every other salesforce product that you know and love. It's deeply integrated into our core platform, which is Lightning.","And Wave is amazing. The growth is terrific. We're going to \u2013 I believe start to see incredible breakout this fiscal year that we're starting now. And we're just finishing our fiscal year kickoff the last two days here in San Francisco. And Wave was a huge part of the emphasis of what we're going to do this year.","So, you're going to see a lot of that product. We're very excited about its capabilities. It's an incredible platform. And I will tell \u2013 yes, I'll tip my hand here that we have been demonstrating, internally here, a number of core Wave applications, including our new sales wave capability, which is our sales applications, built on Wave, Service Wave, service capabilities; Marketing Wave, marketing capabilities. And even Mark Hawkins here has built a full set of applications that help him run his entire financial business. So, it's an exciting new product. And we couldn't be more excited to be in the Analytics business.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Ashley with Robert W. Baird.","Steve M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Great. I have a couple quick ones. First, these nine-figure deals, how many years are these contracts over? And then secondly, with you becoming a strategic vendor, is your relationship with the IT department within these companies change? Thanks.","Keith G. Block - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Operating Officer","Okay. So hi. This is Keith. So, obviously, we don't get into the term and length of these contracts, but you can imagine that if you're going to make a significant investment of nine-figures, that's probably a long-term relationship that you're talking about.","And that again has been a focus area, I mentioned earlier, these are CEO-level conversations. We're in the boardroom, presenting to their boards and we're talking about transformation, which I think is something that is top of mind for all of these customers.","As far as IT is concerned, you always have to talk about, and with IT, but these are transformational sales. These are conversations around growth, which is the top of mind for all Senior Executives and CEOs for sure; but, listen, in these large enterprises, the CIO is important. And by the way, we are a great platform. And CIOs and technologies are always interested in great platforms. And, again, that message certainly resonates.","Marc Russell Benioff - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And I'll tell you that there's definitely a transformation going on at salesforce and Keith and I've had a lot of conversations about this. We've talked about it on previous calls. I would say this transformation has accelerated. And, then Keith, how many sales calls, you were at Oracle for how long?","Keith G. Block - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Operating Officer","26 years.","Marc Russell Benioff - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","26 years. I was at Oracle, 13 years. I never made a sales call on a CEO, while I was at Oracle. I mean, there were some business development things, but never CEO buying products and being that kind of Chief Digital Officer himself or herself. Was that your experience as well?","Keith G. Block - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Operating Officer","Yeah, absolutely, the world just turned. And certainly as we talked about earlier, CEOs are all about transformation. And in many ways they had become the Chief Transformation Officers for these companies, so they are personally involved. They are personally engaged and they want to talk to us. And they're very interested again in us playing the role of the trusted advisor, they're interested in our thought leadership, as you know. And listen, in the last three weeks, I've had more conversations with CEOs around transformation than in my entire career over 30-plus years.","Marc Russell Benioff - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, and I look at the large transactions we did with the largest banks in the world, largest insurance companies in the world, largest media companies in the world, the largest technology companies in the world, which was marked throughout this whole quarter, every single transaction was done with the Chief Executive Officer.","And those happened at the World Economic Forum, those happened in their offices, those happened in our offices, those happened at trade shows, but I'll tell you that Keith and I just can probably rattle off dozens of CEOs that we are having to constantly interact with and collaborate with in creating these transactions. And I think it's really unusual and I think that's why we are really selling more enterprise software than Oracle or SAP in the applications area, wouldn't you say, Keith at this point?","Keith G. Block - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Operating Officer","There's no question that we are outpacing the competition in terms of enterprise application sales; there is no question. We continue to take share, and that's both market share and mind share. You and I were having a conversation just the other day about one of the world's largest financial services institution and kind of in the old world, what level we would be able to call on.","And in this new world, because we were with them at the World Economic Forum, we're talking to the CEO. And their CIO and Head of Operations, that person would never have met with us before and all of a sudden they're with us all the time. In fact, we have a quote from our kickoff \u2013 we just finished our kickoff from the CEO, this particular institution saying that they view salesforce as one of their most critical strategic partners.","Marc Russell Benioff - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And, Keith, wouldn't you say that that's really about our company being able to transform our role to becoming a trusted advisor especially in regards to these customer relationships with these companies? Isn't that's what's going on?","Keith G. Block - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Operating Officer","Absolutely. And we're bringing a point of view around the industry. And one of the things, as you know that we focused on is these specific industry messages and the points of view and that resonates. When you're talking to the CEO, of course, I'm sitting next to one right now, Mr. Marc Benioff, and he wants to know the point of view in a particular industry. And those messages are absolutely resonating. And they want to make quick decisions, they want to solve business problems and they want to transform. And this is all about transformation.","Marc Russell Benioff - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Keith, there seems like there's another level of it, which a lot of them really grill us on own business, because they're moving to subscription-based services themselves, they want to be a cloud company. They want to have Internet of Things capabilities, they want to be more connected to their customers, they want to understand how we're achieving this growth, because many of these companies want to achieve these same growth levels. How does it impact conversations?","Keith G. Block - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Operating Officer","Well, it's interesting, you brought it up. There are two types of conversations that we typically find ourselves involved with. And again, this is at the C-level. And in the boardroom, number one is, you can always ask these companies, why aren't you thinking about yourself as a cloud company? Why aren't you thinking about changing your business model? And you can see the expression on their faces, because they're embracing that notion of transformation.","Marc Russell Benioff - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah.","Keith G. Block - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Operating Officer","So, that is certainly one.","Marc Russell Benioff - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Nobody wants to be Uber-ized out of the world. That's on the mind of every person out there who is a CEO.","Keith G. Block - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Operating Officer","Absolutely. If you think about what's going on with the marketplace about this perfect storm of convergence of cloud and mobile and social and data science and IoT, all coming together, that creates incredible opportunities. It's a different world. And no CEO wants to be Uber-ized just like 15 years, 20 years ago, nobody wanted to be Amazon, if you were in the retail space.","Marc Russell Benioff - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Right. And that's all about customer experience.","Keith G. Block - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Operating Officer","Absolutely, which is where we're at.","Marc Russell Benioff - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Anyway, next question?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI.","Kirk Materne - Evercore","Thanks very much. Just two really quick ones and congratulations on a great fiscal year and fourth quarter. Keith, just to put a fine point on your last comment, there's a lot of discussions about IT budgets right now, what's going on with financial services. Is it fair to say, when we're thinking about salesforce, we should be thinking that you guys tap into budgets well beyond just the IT budget? That's our first question. And then second question would be, Europe is accelerating nicely right now. Can you just talk a little bit about whether or not that's sustainable? Thanks a lot.","Keith G. Block - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Operating Officer","I'm sorry, but for some reason there was a garbled communication, so I'm going to have to ask you to repeat the second part of that one, okay?","John Cummings - Vice President-Investor Relations","Can you repeat the question again?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with UBS.","Keith G. Block - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Operating Officer","We'll come back to that. Okay. Go ahead, Brent.","Brent Thill - UBS Securities LLC","Hey, Marc. The App Cloud is your fastest growing cloud and it's showing really nice acceleration. Can you just give a sense of what you're seeing in some of these deals with the App Cloud? And I guess just a follow-on with Keith to the prior question, the fear of the macro has been weighing on a lot of investors, some of the comments from others, your tech brethren, and can you just give a signal \u2013 it doesn't sound like you've seen any type of slowdown, based on the result, but just give us a sense at kind of what you're seeing among some of the customer conversations as you look out the next couple quarters?","Marc Russell Benioff - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. I think number one is customers are looking to build applications faster than ever before. And customers want to build applications once and deploy them on every modern platform, which includes a watch, a phone, a tablet, a PC, and many different types of tablets and many different types of PCs, many different types of phones.","And we have delivered the most modern, most incredible application development and deployment platform, I believe, in the enterprise today, which is Lightning. And you heard Accenture talked about on our February 2 launch, how it's accelerating their own ability to build applications not only internally but for their customers using our Lightning platform, because there's nothing else like it.","Companies in the software industry have kind of doubled down and gone back and focused on building apps and kind of getting their apps to be kind of sexier and looking better on all these new devices. And that's a huge mistake. Because what these software companies should be focused on is building platforms that can deliver these apps.","And that's what salesforce has done. We've delivered this incredible Lightning platform. I mean it is amazing. What it can do? I mean you even saw in the February 2 launch, we delivered our Lightning platform running on Microsoft Continuum before Microsoft has been able to deliver their own applications running on Microsoft Continuum, because of the kind of flexibility and the capabilities of Lightning.","And also I would point out that's our strategy as to my comment with Heather on Wave that is, we have this incredible platform with Wave to build these Analytics apps. And I think you know that we have the most \u2013 the number one platform on Amazon Web Services for building applications there, called Heroku. And between Heroku, between Wave, between Lightning and other capabilities that we have, this really gives developers a fast, easy and very low cost way to build and deploy enterprise apps.","And I would probably give you this great example of this company called SteelBrick, who came with a lot of momentum out of our Dreamforce Conference with this incredible application that they had built using Lightning and they ended up in my office in November and it was awesome. And I'm, like, how did you build this? And they were like, well this, we just built all this on Lightning. I mean, I saw this app was running. It's my dream that this incredible app running on the watch and the phone and the tablet and everything and making sales people more productive and more successful and customer service professionals more successful and more productive.","And I said how did you build that? Lightning, Lightning, Lightning. And I'm, like, wow. And of course, I liked it so much I bought the company. And I think that \u2013 and I hope that I get to buy more Lightning companies, because within 30 days, I've already fully integrated that into my product, launched a new product, Sales Cloud Lightning, which includes the SteelBrick CPQ capability. And in addition to that, I've got a fully expanded and extended capabilities across my whole product line.","So, I hope there's more Lightning ISVs that are teeing up, to come into our family, because, I mean, this is like auto integration once they get on to our Lightning platform, and then our ability to distribute that through this multi-thousand person distribution organization, with all this momentum is really an awesome thing.","So, it is all about the platform. It's a key differentiator for us. Of course, we've got a great company. That's a key differentiator for us. Of course, we have our ecosystem; that's a key differentiator for us. And it's also about this robust platform, that's a key differentiator for us. And that's how we're winning all these deals. I think you're kind of figured out our secret sauce.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore.","Kirk Materne - Evercore","Thanks very much. I'll try this again. Just my question earlier was \u2013 is for Keith. Obviously, the European business is accelerating nicely over the last year. You guys put a lot of investments into that region. I was wondering if you could just talk about the momentum in that area, and the ability for that to continue into fiscal 2017?","And then just a really quick follow-up to your earlier point around transformational deals. There's going to be a lot of discussion about IT budgets fluctuating in this kind of macro environment. When it comes to CRM, I think we should be thinking that you guys tap into budgets well beyond just IT now. Is that a fair comment? I think you were alluding to it earlier, but I just want to sort of clarify that as well. Thanks a lot.","Keith G. Block - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Operating Officer","Yep. Let me talk to both. So, this time we can hear you loud and clear. So thanks for the question. So first of all, just on EMEA, I mean, one of our growth strategies has been international expansion, and that has certainly proven out in terms of the numbers. And that takes many forms. It's customer-facing, it's support resources, it's our data centers, it's all those sort of things that have really expanded our footprint internationally. And certainly in EMEA, that has paid out very, very well for us.","Let me just give you an example. Two customers with incredible unsolicited CEO-level remarks at the World Economic Forum. We have entered into a relationship that we talked about on this call before with ABB. And at the World Economic Forum, often there are many sessions where the CEOs of these companies will host a transformational meeting that talks a little bit with other CEOs about what they're doing, what they see in the industry; and certainly, ABB was doing that.","And at the end of the meeting, the CEO of ABB stood up, unsolicited, and said, listen, I am completely transforming the way that I sell and service to my customers and engage with them, because I have chosen salesforce as my trusted partner. And that, of course, is a very significant company in Europe.","Schneider Electric is another \u2013 the CEO of Schneider Electric was on a panel with Marc talking about digital transformation. Unsolicited comment about Schneider Electric is transforming its service model because of the capabilities of salesforce.","So, we have some of the most incredible, global companies in the world, who happen to be headquartered in EMEA, who are actually evangelizing our message in the marketplace around transformation and connecting to customers in entirely new ways. So, when you see market leaders coming out there and at the CEO-level and evangelizing our story, that certainly sends a great message to other companies, whether they're in that industry or not. So again, those are two proof points on EMEA.","On the line of business question in terms of budget, look, IT organizations always have budgets. They typically range between 1% and 2% of the company revenues. But what we've been able to tap into beyond those budgets are the line of business executive's budgets and also, as we've discussed on this call, the CEO agenda. It's an amazing phenomenon when you see the CEO, who has the growth priority realign the budgets in a corporation to take on these growth initiatives, and that's what we're seeing. So, it goes well beyond IT. Certainly IT budgets are a particular component, but when the priority of a company is all about growth, you find the money to make that happen. You find the money to make those investments, and that's what we're seeing in the marketplace.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line Walter Pritchard with Citi.","Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi. Thanks. A question for Mark Hawkins. Your guidance for the year in terms of operating margins is towards the lower end of your range of I think 100 basis points to 300 basis points of margin expansion, with your revenue growth at the lower end of that as well, can you talk about sort of how you are thinking about that prior framework for margins? And is there anything going on this year that we should think about impacting how you are adhering to that grid?","Mark J. Hawkins - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure, Walter. First, thanks for the question and I'm happy to address that question. We're really pleased, coming off of a great year and a great finish where we beat our operating margin guidance. We delivered 177 basis points this last year.","And on top of that, to then, consistent with our revenue margin framework, go ahead and do that 125 basis points to 150 basis points for FY 2017. We feel that's really appropriate in light of our framework, it's very consistent with it. We think it's appropriate and good guide and it also allows us to propel this growth to really help our customers solve the needs that they have and invest in the future to perpetuate this performance over the long-term. So that's what I would say, Walter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan.","Mark R. Murphy - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yes. Thank you. I'll add my congratulations on the strong finish. Question for Marc Benioff, so we are hearing more discussion of transformational types of projects, where salesforce is displacing many legacy systems and is being used wall-to-wall. And so, there's also a view that the company has evolved from being a single engine to a three or four engine aircraft. So, I'm curious, when you look at the larger transactions, how commonly is a large deal just for a single cloud, because I think in the prior cycle \u2013 in the past, some of them were. Versus, how commonly is it viewed as really a single customer success platform and, just from the beginning, it's going to be spanning Sales, Service, Marketing platform and everything else?","Marc Russell Benioff - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think that's a great question. And I'll tell you I believe that that's a huge growth driver for us going forward, because still, only, I think the number is, 72% of customers still use us for only one cloud. So, that is 72% of customers still only use either the Sales Cloud or the Service Cloud or the Marketing Cloud or the Platform or Analytics, or whatever.","And the opportunity is to do exactly what you said, which is, to deliver a customer success platform. And we do want to go wall-to-wall with these companies, they do see that opportunity more and more. With some premium customers, we have had that opportunity. And I believe that is a huge opportunity for this company as it continues to grow and expand, that we have a rich portfolio of products to offer these customers. Even though the vast majority of the customers have only chosen one of those products, so far.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank.","Karl E. Keirstead - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. Question for Mark Hawkins. Mark, I wouldn't mind going back to the Q1 DR guide, which I think implies billings growth in the mid-teens level. And your seasonality question. You definitely told us before that deal activity especially renewals are skewing to 4Q, which obviously makes the sequential DR and billings growth comparison tough in 1Q. I'm just curious is this expected to be a greater than normal impact in this Q1? And are there any other issues worth flagging that are impacting Q1 DR? Thank you.","Mark J. Hawkins - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. Absolutely, Karl. Thank you for the question. I think you're hitting it right on, which is when you described it exactly right the compounding effect that we described at Dreamforce is a reality. More and more of our DR is showing up in Q4. It impacts all of the sequential growth rates more and more as we showed in that amplified set of data that we referenced.","But to kind of build on your point, there is one other thing that we're trying to make sure that everyone sees and to call out. Also I appreciate your question there, and that's regarding leap year. And it seems like a simple enough point, but when you take a look at our revenue and you divide it up by day, when there's one extra day that has the effect of having $20 million of extra revenue recognition in Q1, even though it all washes out in the year, right?","But, when you have one extra day of revenue, it means you have one less day of deferred revenue, effectively. And so, that's the other thing you take a look at. So, if you take a look at the compounding effect and you adjust for the leap year, which washes all out in a year, but not in the quarter. I think you'll see just a kind of an appropriate pattern there for a guide. Okay?","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Tom Roderick with Stifel.","Tom Roderick - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi, guys. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Let me direct this question to Marc Benioff and to Keith as well. You both talked about the role of systems integrators both as partners and customers during the quarter. I'd love to hear the role that those SIs are playing in bigger enterprise deals?","And I'd be even more interested to hear to the extent that you do have some systems integrators, partners that are consuming a lot of salesforce.com. How are they doing so internally and how that's shaping their practice?","Marc Russell Benioff - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think there hasn't been a conversation this quarter that has not evolved around the incredible success that we've had with Accenture. We're not only Accenture's fastest growing business unit, but also they've now deployed already 25,000 users of salesforce inside Accenture.","You've heard their CIO and their CEO come to our launch on February 2 and give personal testimonial to the success that they've had, that their only regret is they didn't go faster with salesforce, that they're transforming their customer relationships at unheard of rates and this is having a broad ripple effect through the SI community, where I think that honestly they're all asking themselves why are they not all using salesforce, building apps on salesforce and selling salesforce and having the same great success that Accenture has had.","Some of these SIs are kind of prima donnas, who have held on to the path too long and has affected their growth rates and their ability to work with customers, and in some cases, dislodged them from strategic customer situations because they were not able to move fast enough to understand these customers' needs and got displaced by Accenture, and we're seeing that as in mass.","And for sure, it's a shot across the bow of the SI community that they better go faster or there's going be a broad shakeup in regard to the transformations that are happening underway in regards to these next generation implementations specifically those regarding salesforce and our product line. Keith?","Keith G. Block - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Operating Officer","Yeah, great question. So first and foremost, I think we all recognize that these SIs, many of them, certainly the upper tier of the SIs are very strategic influencers in the boardroom and at the CEO-level and speaking transformation for these lines of business executives.","Part of our strategy has been to really strengthen these relationships over time, because we know that they bring expertise and access. And they can also drive most importantly the customer success. The observation I would give you is that the most successful SIs are the ones who are very focused on salesforce and the ones who actually run their business on salesforce. Marc has just given that example. And we are establishing what I would call a 360-degree relationship with these SIs.","So, we go to market with these SIs. They run their business on salesforce. And in the case of Accenture, they're actually building product, they become an ISV and those are the strategic sort of relationships that we're trying to build here. And we've been very, very successful and the ones who get it are growing.","I had a conversation last week with a CEO of a pretty major consulting organization, who was lamenting about their lack of growth, generally speaking. And my comment to this person was quite candidly, you're not focused enough on salesforce, because if you were focused on salesforce your business would be growing. And I got this look of acknowledgment and it's absolutely true. The success stories in these consulting practices is about their salesforce practice.","So, they've been a big part of our growth strategy. They're starting to \u2013 virtually all the large ones are running their business on salesforce. They've made their commitments and they're a big part of our future and our ecosystem strategy.","Operator","And your final question comes from the line of Alex Zukin with Stephens.","Alex Zukin - Stephens, Inc.","Hey, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. Marc, there's been some investor and customer dialog lately touching on the theme that salesforce is becoming a little bit more like Oracle. As you continue your drive to be the largest software company in the world, how does salesforce aspire to be different from them and others going forward, while balancing your various constituencies?","Marc Russell Benioff - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think that's a great question, and something that we think about every day at salesforce and something that we talk about every day at salesforce, which is what kind of a company is this? And what is our culture? Who are we? And what is it that we do? And we've talked a lot about that on the call already that is, we have a radically different technology model than the technology model that has been in place at Oracle or SAP or even Microsoft.","We have a \u2013 which is our multi-tenancy system built on our metadata model. We have a radically different customer model, which is a model built on customer success. And we have a radically different philanthropic model that we talked about, which is our focus on 1% of our equity, our profit, and our employees' time go into our salesforce.org. So, we've, of course, done about 1.3 million hours of community service. I believe we'll do even more community service this year than Microsoft, which is a company 10 times our size, because we're just very committed to volunteerism. We run over 25,000 non-profits and NGOs for free, which have been a gift of over $250 million in services to the non-profit community. And we've given away over $100 million in grants as well.","I think also we're out there fighting for equality where we can. You saw that with our focus on equal pay for women. We were just at the White House speaking about that, adjustments that we've made to our own financials, so that we can pay women the same that we pay men here at salesforce.","You saw us fight in Indiana against discrimination of our employees and we're looking squarely at what's going on in Georgia with House Bill 757, which means that we may have to reduce our investments in the State of Georgia based on what we're seeing with the state government there as well. And I hope that they see the light the way that the State of Indiana did.","And in addition, I think that you see salesforce trying to create a culture in an environment, where we reflect what we think the future of the world is, a world where there needs to be more equality, a world where there needs to be more focus on sustainability and where there needs to be a world focused on companies that are becoming platforms for change. And that the business is improving the state of the world. Those are the things that are really important to us.","I think also you probably noticed that we opened up this call saying thank you. It's really important to us that we have a sense of gratitude, when we address our employees and our customers and our partners. That's a huge part of our culture. And at the end of the day, it's deeply a part of customer success as well that is because of our business model we're only successful if our customers are successful.","So, these are the things that I think that are actually somewhat different than when we were at Oracle, the narrative there and the actions, the behavior was rewarded differently, the things that we were encouraged to do and compensated for and what we told our employees to do and what we were directing to do is different than what we do at salesforce. And I hope that we can be an example of a benevolent company that does well and does good.","Operator","I would now like to turn the call back to John Cummings for closing remarks.","John Cummings - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks so much, Ashley.

Thank you.","I would now like to turn the call over to John Cummings, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","John Cummings","Thanks so much, Victoria, and good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us for our fiscal first quarter 2017 results conference call. Our first quarter results press release, SEC filings, and a replay of today's call can be found on our IR website at www.salesforce.com\/investor.","And with me today on the call is Marc Benioff, Chairman and CEO; Keith Block, Vice Chairman, President, and COO; and Mark Hawkins, CFO.","As a reminder, our commentary today will primarily be in non-GAAP terms. Reconciliations between our GAAP and non-GAAP results and guidance can be found in our earnings press release.","Also some of our comments today may contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. Should any of these materialize or should our assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual company results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements. A description of these risks, uncertainties, and assumptions and other factors that could affect our financial results are included in our SEC filings, including our most recent report on Forms 10-Q and 10-K.","With that, let me turn the call over to Marc.","Marc Benioff","Well, thanks, John. And really excited to be here, really excited for the first quarter and we\u2019ve got some great people here for the call, we\u2019ve got Keith Block here, our new Chief Operating Officer really excited to have Keith here, we have Mark Hawkins here, our Chief Financial Officer and you\u2019ve all seen the press release, we\u2019ve just had an awesome Q1.","It\u2019s the best Q1, we\u2019ve ever seen. There is some incredible numbers you\u2019re going to see including the cash flow number. Revenue for the first quarter as you saw grew nearly to $2 billion that was up 28% in constant currency that was just above our expectations. Deferred revenue also grew more than $4 billion up 32% in constant currency that was also above our expectations to see deferred revenue grow with a three in front of it at this size and scale. Dollar value of booked business on and off the balance sheet at $11.6 billion, up 28% from a year ago. We improved our non-GAAP operating margin which Mark is going to talk about and it drove $1 billion in operating cash flow as I mentioned but that\u2019s 43% from a year ago, pretty great.","I\u2019m also thrilled to announce we\u2019re raising full-year revenue guidance $80 million raising the guidance we feel really excited about that, $8.2 billion is the high-end of our range and our current outlook puts us on its square path, look we are going to see now that we\u2019re going to realize very shortly our $10 billion dream.","We\u2019re well positioned for another great year. This is amazing I think that one of the reasons that we are doing so well is because Oracle and SAP are doing so poorly in the cloud, they just have not been able to make that transformation that we\u2019ve made, that other companies have made, and we just continue to take market share from them and gain customers at a record levels and you can see that their growth numbers are nothing like we\u2019re putting up here as we deliver our first quarter and it\u2019s happened because Salesforce is really the only company totally focused on companies helping to connect with their customers in a whole new way.","We\u2019re in the midst of a massive generational shift; a new generation of customers and consumers is clearly emerging. We have been calling them here at Salesforce C generation customers. Customer generation, consumer generation that these are people who want it now, they want it fast, they want it easy, and they\u2019re mobile, they\u2019re social, they\u2019re always on, and our customers are working to connect with the C generation in new ways, very exciting. I mean this is really part of a huge shift that\u2019s happening in computing. We\u2019ve gone from the first generation of computing which was very much about systems of record to the second generation which was systems of engagement we talked about that on these calls many times over the last 10 years. And we are clearly moving into this incredible world that the system of intelligence that\u2019s all yielding these incredible systems of customers or C generation customers that are -- that our customers are connecting to. And that\u2019s we\u2019re so excited about.","I know you all hear more about those shifts that are going on. Well I\u2019m encourage you to come to our World Tour Event in London tomorrow we\u2019ll have 15,000 people in person bigger than most companies user conferences for us it\u2019s just another visit to a great city in the world.","And then next week we are going to be in New York for World Tour New York which is already sold out. So we\u2019ll be excited to see you there. And in San Francisco on June 7 and 8, we\u2019re going to be hosting Trailhead DX which is our brand new developer conference. It also I believe is already sold out, but it\u2019s going to be an amazing event we are going to have plenty of opportunities to watch it online. Hard to find venues around the world to host these large events, Trailhead DX you\u2019re going to see the next generation of software\u2019s, Salesforce\u2019s software development capability including our new lightening systems, component based development as well as the ability to build one-on-one journey\u2019s with customers and a huge focus, a huge focus at Trailhead DX on how to rapidly and easily build mobile applications.","And really excited to visit with all the Salesforce customers and developers who are coming Trailhead DX.","Okay. Well finally let me tell you, we\u2019ve got Dreamforce coming October 4 through 7 in the details. I know the bands that are playing. I know what\u2019s going on and I\u2019m going to give you too much of that yet I can just tell you it\u2019s going to be the biggest and most exciting Dreamforce ever and its synergy also just a great year and Keith, you\u2019re a huge part of making it such a great year I think we\u2019re getting ready to celebrate your third anniversary at Salesforce is that right.","Keith Block","That\u2019s right; it\u2019s coming up, absolutely.","Marc Benioff","When is that going to be so I can have the cupcakes ready?","Keith Block","That will be June 2, Marc.","Marc Benioff","June 2, all right, well we\u2019re going to get those cupcakes ready, but Keith before we do let me just congratulate you on a great quarter. Congratulate on your promotion, your excellent leadership in the company, and why don\u2019t you to tell us, what happened with customers this quarter.","Keith Block","All right. Thanks Marc, and thanks everyone for joining us on this call. I think as you heard from Marc we had an extremely fast start to the year and that is terrific on to itself but it is on the heels of a fantastic Q4. So we saw great execution across the board. We fine tuned our go-to-market approach. We\u2019ve aligned our operations to bring our resources closely to our customers because at the end of the day it is all about driving success for those customers.","And all these investments that we\u2019ve made over the last three years, innovation in our industries, building out our partner ecosystem, expanding internationally, all this is really paying off in our results.","So we began fiscal 2017 with a record number of large transactions more than any other first quarter in our history as a company. The value of these large transactions across our clouds continue to increase. We have built on our tremendous momentum from Q4 and in fact we closed yet again another nine figure transaction in the first quarter. So we\u2019re very, very proud of that.","All this is proof positive the scale and depth of relationships that we\u2019re building and continue to build with our customers worldwide everywhere, all shapes and sizes, geographies, industries. An example, in Q1 we signed a significant and strategic agreement with Amazon. We are now their company-wide customer platform and this is a huge expansion of our relationship with them and we plan to use more Amazon services in the future.","Uber one of the world\u2019s great innovative companies, another expansion in the quarter, they\u2019re an incredible innovator with off-the-chart growth. They selected Salesforce to be their global customer success platform, so they can build one-to-one journeys at scale for millions of Uber riders worldwide. This is one of the most innovative companies as I said and they are driving their innovation by leveraging our customer success platform.","Samsung another great brand decided to standardize their B2B business on Salesforce in Q1, so they can engage with their customers anytime from any place and run their businesses right from their Galaxy phones.","Another great brand is New York Life. They have selected Salesforce to power the digital transformation and they are planning to mobilize their field agents with Salesforce and enhance the service they deliver to their customers.","In Europe, one of the world\u2019s leaders and pioneers in robotics decided to go wall-to-wall with Salesforce to advance the digital transformation of their business. Now Marc alluded to this, but this is a strategic partnership where we completely replaced SAP with every cloud in our portfolio to drive at their customer success with our product suite. So not only are we their customer success platform but Salesforce will be their IoT platform connecting all their robotic devices to open up new services and apps and create new experiences to their customers.","There are many, many more examples and in every one of these each companies are turning to Salesforce as their trusted advisors for redefining their customer strategy and take their businesses into the future and we are delivering this level of customer success at scale and across the entire portfolio.","I want to thank our customers for their continued trust, their commitment, and always their inspiration, and our partner ecosystem which is second to none for their ongoing investment in our customer success, and last but not least, I want to thank everybody at Salesforce for again another outstanding performance in the quarter.","So I would like to hand this over to Mark to talk a little bit more about our financial execution in the quarter. Mark?","Mark Hawkins","Great, thanks Keith. As you\u2019ve heard, we had a great start to the fiscal year with very strong results across the board. Our total revenue was up 28% in constant currency when excluding year-over-year FX headwind of 29%. Sequentially, we saw $4 million FX headwind.","Sales Cloud accelerated in the quarter with 15% year-over-year growth. Service Cloud grew 32%. Marketing Cloud grew 29%. Apps Cloud and other grew 45%.","In the region, EMEA grew 33% and APAC continued to accelerate a 29% growth, both on a constant currency basis year-over-year. Dollar attrition for the first quarter remained below 9%.","While we continue to deliver this outstanding top-line performance, we also continued to improve our bottom-line as well. In the quarter, we delivered 283 basis points of year-over-year non-GAAP operating margin improvement, our eighth consecutive quarter of expansion. This help drive record operating cash flow this quarter as we delivered more than $1 billion of operating cash flow, up 43% over last year. I\u2019m very pleased with these outstanding results, our first $1 billion of cash flow quarter, very exciting.","These outstanding results reflect continued compounding of our invoicing in Q4 and to a lesser extent the early adoption of ASU 2016-09 which benefited operating cash flow by approximately $25 million in Q1.","Deferred revenue ended the quarter at more than $4 billion. This was up 32% in constant currency when excluding our year-over-year FX headwind of $10 million. Sequentially deferred revenue had an FX tailwind of $51 million. We also continued to drive an increase in annual billings in the quarter with 79% of all subscription and support related invoices issued with annual terms. This benefited year-over-year deferred revenue growth by approximately one percentage point.","Moving on to guidance. With our strong start in Q1, we are raising our FY 2017 revenue guidance to $8.16 billion to $8.2 billion. We\u2019re also raising our FY 2017 non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance to $1 to $1.02. We now expect year-over-year operating cash flow growth of 25% to 26%.","For Q2, we\u2019re expecting revenues of $2.005 billion to $2.015 billion. Non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.24 to $0.25, and our year-over-year deferred revenue growth of 26% to 28%.","To close, we had an outstanding quarter and we\u2019re off to a great start for FY 2017. I\u2019d like to thank the entire Salesforce team for these great results.","With that I\u2019d like to open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions].","Your first question comes from the line of Brent Thill with UBS.","Brent Thill","Good afternoon. Marc, your largest Revenue Cloud to Sales Cloud accelerated the best growth in over five quarters. Can you just highlight what\u2019s driving that outperformance and you did have a small price increase there has been questions among investors is that price hike having any impact in the short-term?","Marc Benioff","Yes, I think that we have really been focused on how do we accelerate the Sales Cloud. I mean it\u2019s a huge number of revenue numbers incredible and the growth rate is also incredible. And the areas where the Sales Cloud is really accelerated are, number one we\u2019ve done a huge amount of innovation with the Sales Cloud starting with Lightning probably you know we\u2019ve completely rebuilt our core platform of Salesforce which we now call Lightning and we have rebuilt how the Sales Cloud is manifested to our customers especially in regards to mobile technologies, you can see that, if you go on the app store and download our Salesforce1 app which is now millions of users, millions are using that to access Salesforce.","Two, we\u2019ve also created some amazing new capabilities for us the Sales Cloud probably the most popular is our Pardot capability which is a part of a Sales Cloud very exciting accelerator for us as well as SteelBrick. And these things and others really have led us to kind of what I\u2019d say the most reboot the Sales Cloud, recreate the Sales Cloud, reenergize it, and this kind of accelerated revenue growth for to something that we\u2019re very, very excited about.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bhavan Suri with William Blair.","Bhavan Suri","Hey, guys thanks for taking my questions. Just two quick ones for me. First when we look at the Force platform again it posted really, really healthy growth, the fastest growth again over five quarters. And if I also look at that growth just some color on the mix of how much is coming from sort of existing ISCs and customers expanding on the platform or net new customers that are choosing force.com for speed for whatever versus any other platform. Just some sense of how that\u2019s playing out. And then you touched a little bit on the IoT cloud, just a little more color in terms of adoption obviously that\u2019s a huge market but just how you\u2019re thinking about the growth trajectory for that business. Thank you.","Marc Benioff","Well, I think that when you look at our platform and you want to understand its growth you just have to look at the recent Gartner Magic Quadrant for mobile application development and deployment. I mean we\u2019re ranked as the leader and in so many other of course analysis by these independent analyst agencies they have marked our platform as the leader and I\u2019ll tell you why that is because there is a full segment of the developer population that we are speaking to who want to rapidly build and deploy applications especially, and I said this in the previous answer, in the mobile environment. And only Salesforce -- only Salesforce has let you rapidly build and expand and create these applications using Lightning and deploy them on all these different devices.","And for those of you who have tried it or seeing the traffic around it on social networks like the Twitter and others know we have hit a huge home run in regards to Lightning; we have our customers\u2019 imagination. For those of you who attended the February 2 event with -- at the St. Regis, you heard Accenture, who is deploying this technology not just for its customers but internally to tens of thousands of users almost 100,000 users and how they have accelerated their application development capability internally by turning to Lightning. And so that is what is driving the power, we\u2019ve rebooted our core platforms and you\u2019re seeing that reflected in our Sales Cloud, in our Service Cloud, in our platform, in our community, in our core applications that are running currently on that Lightning platform, that\u2019s been a huge growth driver and I believe that because Lightning is so unique and so special in the industry that it lets our customers build these applications quickly at a very low cost and deploy them across so many different platforms that we\u2019re going to see a continued growth in core clouds.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Kash Rangan","Hey, guys. Congrats on the quarter. One question for Benioff, and one for Hawkins. One for you, Mark Benioff. The platform business, again, it feels like even the Sales Cloud at this size, at when it was, it was roughly the size of the platform business, did not grow this fast. So are we finally at the point where we're getting that inflection? This is poised to be firmly a business potentially larger, could be longer -- could it be the largest cloud? And if so, how does it help your vertical strategy? One for you, Mr. Hawkins. You signed three deals in the nine-figure range. When will you start to bill and when will it start to actually show up in deferred revenues? Because I suspect given how large these deals are you're not yet invoicing these customers. Thank you very much.","Marc Benioff","Well in regards to the Sales Cloud, number one you know already this is one of the largest software product by revenue in the industry period. Not just CRM, not just Salesforce automation where it\u2019s number one but in the industry and to see this acceleration, this is something that we have been working on. And I said and I believe this is true for innovation, reasons of innovation, and it\u2019s also reasons of specialization as you know Keith Block has been working on this vertical strategy. And Keith, do you want to speak to that and also kind of some of the exciting things that have happened with the vertical strategy in the Sales Cloud and how you\u2019ve been able to address some of these new markets which is part of this acceleration. Keith?","Keith Block","Yes, so a couple of things, first of all the acceleration in Sales Cloud this is what is Marc said, this is one of the most successful products in the history of technology. And one of the great things about this company is it continues to innovate and this has been a refocus point for us to continue to innovate and accelerate innovation around Sales Cloud and you see that in the results and we\u2019ve leveraged that great innovation and that base to drive vertical specialization. As you know we announced and made for GA available the Financial Services Cloud and the Health Cloud in Q1 and we had several customers sign up in the quarter.","So we\u2019re starting to get a lot of momentum. So we\u2019ve been talking about it for a while part of our industry strategy has been around messaging and then releasing these first vertical products focus on financial services industry and healthcare industry and life sciences industry. And again you do that with amazing technology with Force you do it with amazing technology leveraging the underlying cloud and you add industry specialization to it and that\u2019s why we\u2019re getting to see these results and this reacceleration.","Mark Hawkins","So let me jump in also catch with the second question around three nine-figure deals which obviously we\u2019re very pleased with all the reasons that Keith and Marc talked about and you\u2019re absolutely right in the sense that these big deals are multiyear deals and so what happens is the first year gets billed and that will show up in our deferred revenue and then ratably recognize over time. But the multiyear aspect to that does not show up in our DR, it shows up in our unbilled DR. And what\u2019s amazing about that is when you put our billed and unbilled book of business together, we have $11.6 billion now growing at 27% year-on-year. So you\u2019re picking up some of that that really, really good business that\u2019s going to show up it hasn\u2019t been billed yet but it will over time. Great question, Kash.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs.","Heather Bellini","Hi, great. I had a question for Marc Benioff and then a question for Keith. I guess Marc; you've had this $10 billion goal for quite some time. It now is looks like you'll trip over it very soon and obviously a great accomplishment. As you look ahead and rally the company into the future, can you share with us what's the next big rallying point or what's the next big goal you have for the company? And then the follow-up for Keith would be how do you size the potential for these nine-figure deals as you look into your customer base? Thank you.","Marc Benioff","Well you\u2019re right, Heather, and I know that you have created and keep a comprehensive financial model on Salesforce and have for a number of years as well as many of the financial analyst on the call. And I\u2019m sure that all of you can figure out exactly or approximately based on our deferred revenue numbers and adjusting our models around when you think we\u2019re going to have $10 billion. That is an exciting moment, it\u2019s an exciting moment because for the software industry and specifically in enterprise applications there is really only been two other companies that have really hit back kind of a number.","So I would say that we are already looking forward to lasting rate through that and getting to the next level and I\u2019m excited that Salesforce doesn\u2019t show any signs of slowing down as we kind of get to these levels.","We\u2019re moving rapidly into a world that when we talk about of course many transformations in our industry which is a world as a cloud of course that drove the Salesforce\u2019s growth for many years, a world of social that drove the Salesforce\u2019s growth for many years, and also mobility and that\u2019s also currently driving Salesforce\u2019s growth.","When I look at kind of the next major trend for Salesforce and our industry that will drive tremendous growth is got to be artificial intelligence. And as we look out into the future and we start to look at extreme improvement and advances in artificial intelligence whether it\u2019s machine learning, whether it\u2019s deep learning, whether it\u2019s machine intelligence itself, I think that those kind of capabilities appearing inside our applications that is going to be a major growth capability going forward.","And one other areas that I think will advance that is that we can bring this type of new technology very much to everyone and that\u2019s going to be the power of Salesforce that\u2019s certainly what we are doing and with mobility today that\u2019s what we will do in AI as we shift Salesforce to be in an AI first company.","You can see the beginning of this in one of our most exciting new products of the quarter and also part of the Sales Cloud growth for sure because it\u2019s in there is not just SalesforceIQ which you can get on the -- on the app store but also our new product Salesforce Inbox. And Salesforce Inbox is very exciting because it uses artificial intelligence and machine intelligence to work with our users, to work with our emails, to work with their calendars, and work with their CRM data to give them perspective ideas on exactly how do be more efficient in the sales, service, and marketing processes of their companies. And when you look at technologies like SalesforceIQ and like Salesforce Inbox, well and I\u2019m sure you know those came out of an incredible acquisition, we did approximately two years ago RelateIQ which was just a world class team that we\u2019re able to pick up that\u2019s based in Palo Alto.","Well then you can see that this is another major growth factor because it will appear in sales, it will appear in service, it will appear in marketing when you saw it actually last week if you attended our Connections Conference, you saw our new predicted journeys capability and this kind of predicted capability that appeared in our marketing cloud that was driven out of our new SalesforceIQ services.","You also see it of course in communities, you see it in our platforms, you\u2019re going to see it in mobility, you\u2019re going to see it in our analytics of course at the core. This is a very powerful next generation technology.","So Heather, when I look forward, what I see is an AI first world and for every customer is going to be able to get whole another generation of productivity out of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning. Yes, so Heather, do you want to add to that?","Keith Block","Yes, Heather, just to your second question well large deals is certainly an indication of how deep these relationships are becoming with these customers but they are not the only indication I mean certainly in Q4 we had two of the largest nine-figure deals that we had in the history of the company. In Q1, we signed up again another very strategic long-term relationship. Right our business is based on a balanced portfolio across all market segments whether it\u2019s SMB or midmarket or the enterprise space.","And there is a lot of room there. So there is an expectation from our customers to play a more significant role across the board and certainly in the enterprise in fact Marc and I met with a couple of CEOs yesterday who were talking to us about how they bring their companies into kind of this age of the customer and drive digital transformation and that\u2019s becoming a regular dialogue but this is both a mind share and a market share gain and we strive for balance in our execution and a balance in our portfolio of business and customers. Again, it\u2019s not from top to bottom, SMB all the way up to enterprise. So we got great momentum, we expect that to continue and I think we\u2019ve got a terrific playbook with an incredible portfolio of products that satisfy our customers\u2019 needs.","Operator","Your next question comes from the Sarah Hindlian with Macquarie.","Sarah Hindlian","Hi. Thank you, guys, so much for taking my question and congratulations on a really extraordinary quarter. I had a couple for you. I'm wondering where will you be expanding your usage of AWS beyond Heroku and the components of IoT that are built on that. And I was wondering what's really driving that decision. And then secondly, how do you think about the size of the Sales Cloud market given the number of clunky sort of custom-built in-house solutions that still exist out there? Where are we in terms of hitting that runway for you guys? And then I'll try to sneak in a third here. But if you could talk a little about wave analytics and what we're seeing there that would be fantastic as well.","Keith Block","Well thanks for that question. Number one I\u2019d say we love Amazon, we\u2019ve got a great relationship with Amazon, they are a huge user of Salesforce and that certainly has been a huge part this quarter as well. We did a very significant and very large transaction with Amazon and Jeff Bezos, and I have a great meaning of the minds, the future of the cloud. I think that it\u2019s been a great relationship and partnership for us.","We want to continue to grow that and expand that strategically. We are definitely exploring ways so we can use AWS more aggressively with Salesforce. Of course we know that we run one of the largest application development capabilities in the world on AWS which is Heroku. We also are building our new IoT cloud on AWS. We also introduced new capabilities for our marketing cloud last week on AWS. And we have a lot of research and development capabilities in AWS.","When you look at Amazon today, there is no public cloud that is more sophisticated, more well used by enterprises ad one that has more robust capabilities than Amazon. They have done a spectacular job in defining this kind of infrastructure as a service market. They of course dominated. I think you know they are doing themselves more than $10 billion a year in it. And we\u2019re very happy to be so tightly aligned with Amazon and AWS.","In regards to kind of future capabilities that you\u2019re going to see with other parts of Salesforce while as we head towards our Developer Conference and as you head towards Dreamforce, I think you continue to see more announcements between Salesforce and Amazon and you will see our partnership and strategic alliance with them continue to grow and develop. And Jeff and I have a lot of very exciting ideas on what the next steps are. Okay, Alexa, would you take the next question.","Marc Benioff","Let me -- may be I could jump in here. One of the things that you touched on was the have a little fun here. The Wave, you had asked a little bit about that, sir, and we\u2019re seeing nice growth with The Wave, it\u2019s again we are very pleased with the way that\u2019s progressing. And by the way, the big deals that Keith had just called out in terms of AWS is using Wave, Live Nation is using Wave, we can get big customer after big customer using Wave. By the way I use Wave as we run a Fortune 500 company and I absolutely love it.","So I love the growth rate, I love the large deal penetration with it, I love the momentum. Keep in mind its version one. But the thing I call out and may be Mark or Keith want to talk about this, but Bob Stutz, we are just super happy to have Bob here and he is thinking beyond Version 1 and that\u2019s just really exciting to me. And that\u2019s the Wave comment from my standpoint.","I guess the last point was around you had asked around the sales cost market, market size and I don\u2019t know if there is any other additional thoughts there.","Keith Block","I will just say it again; I mean this is one of the most exceptional products in the history of technology. And we, a product company as you all know when they come out with a great first product if you will, they leave it behind and they don\u2019t continue to innovate but this is a company that is keeping innovation as part of its DNA and we have reinvigorated this product set, and we are very pleased with the results and our customers are loving it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Ashley with Robert W. Baird & Company.","Steve Ashley","Great. I would just like to drill down on the Sales Cloud question again. You saw the accelerated growth, 14.9%. But if we were to peel and kind of parse that out, look at it from enterprise, may be medium, small businesses, look at it at layers, if we peel back that enterprise layer where I'm sure large deals are really helping, are you seeing improved growth at some of the lower layers in the mid-market and smaller business market for the Sales Cloud? Thanks.","Marc Benioff","Yes, we are and I\u2019ll tell you why that is I\u2019ve touched on it a number of times but I will circle back one more time because I think it is important. I think it\u2019s important because I think for a lot of companies to get to this level of a product they kind of put it on maintenance they abandon that. They look another way and they hope to kind of bring in the next horizon.","They look to kind of Jeff Moore\u2019s more commentary on what is the next wave or whatever and they move to that next product. For us we\u2019re not, we have that of course we have multiple -- successful multibillion dollar product in the company everybody knows that. But we have not give it up on Sales Cloud because there is so much more that we can do and you saw that this quarter in that, we have rebuild this quarter with Lightning so that it works better on mobility.","We have Salesforce1 which now has millions of users on it, I use it every day it\u2019s never been faster, easier it\u2019s level of acuity with Salesforce1 is phenomenal. We have SteelBrick, which our customers love this kind of CPQ kind of capability to be able to do court, quotes, and orders and all this incredible new stuff that SteelBrick does for us that\u2019s built natively on our Lightning platform. We have SalesforceIQ which is a artificial intelligence front end, machine learning front end to Sales Cloud which is incredible.","We have Sales Cloud; we have a Salesforce Inbox which is an email front end of Sales Cloud that is incredible. And we have many, many other things coming, many that you will see Trailhead DX, many more you are going to see at Dreamforce, we have not abandoned Sales Cloud we have doubled, we have tripled down on Sales Cloud, and because of that we have accelerated our growth rate and it\u2019s exciting and our vision for Sales Cloud have not yet been fully realized. I mean we know that there is not just a cloud, there is not just a incredible Cloud vision for Sales Cloud, not just incredible, social vision you all know it has been built on this incredible engagement platform built on our chatter core and then extended into Salesforce1.","Of course it has incredible mobility, the best of any enterprise application in the world with more mobile users gone up than any other application that I\u2019m aware of. And we are now introducing this new AI wrapper that you can see that artificial intelligence is becoming part of Sales Cloud, you can see that already in SalesforceIQ, Salesforce Inbox you can see that in predicted journeys, you\u2019re going to start to see that more aggressively and because we are innovating so aggressively on Sales Cloud you are going to continue to see great results because what customer does not want or need this ability to grow their top-line and that\u2019s was Sales Cloud is giving them in this tough environment.","And by the way all of those same things that I just mentioned work with Service Cloud, they work with our platform, they work with our community. We are have one very solid core platform that is extended through this work that we\u2019re doing, jazzed about the capabilities in the company and what our developers are doing, what our innovators are doing I mean it\u2019s still exciting.","Mark Hawkins","Hi, Marc, I agree. And the thing I would add in Steve is that not only as it accelerated this quarter, this is the fourth consecutive quarter of Sales Cloud accelerating in terms of the year-on-year growth, and so all this stuff that Marc is talking about is taking hold. And the other thing keep in mind and I know you know this Steve, this is U.S. dollar growth that we are talking about not foreign exchange because you alluded to like where is the growth coming from and in fact that\u2019s another point to be aware of.","But the third thing I would say is when you look at all the innovation Marc is talking about and you look at market share and you probably extend we took market share again in Sales Cloud but even more importantly we took market share at the CRM level. Number one again, I took a 150 basis point and our key competitors are falling behind and actually losing market share and so that\u2019s exciting to but this is a continuing trend, it is not just one acceleration quarter, Steve.","Keith Block","Just a final comment on the acceleration of Sales Cloud, if you think about the agenda of every CEO and certainly the most progressive CEOs, it is about growth, it is about shareholder value, it is about stakeholder value and this is why we align so well with our customers and this is why they are interested in our Sales Cloud, because they want to grow, they want to engage with our customers and this is the market leading platform and that\u2019s why we are seeing a reacceleration and we are aligned beautifully with the agenda of the CEOs of the best companies in the world and that they are looking for solutions and this is the best solution in the marketplace.","Marc Benioff","Yes and I would just get back to my competitive comments which is you look at these other vendors and what they\u2019ve done with their technology in this category, it\u2019s been pretty poor and that\u2019s why when you saw that Magic Quadrant from Gartner, we are way high up into the right because everyone also kind of abandoned their technology in this area and they are trying to -- they give it a lot of lip service but the reality is there is just no comparison between what we have and what the other vendors have at this point, it\u2019s incredible and it comes through in our demos, it comes through in our wins, and it comes through in the core customer success.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays.","Raimo Lenschow","Hey, thanks for taking my question and congrats on the great quarter. Two quick questions. First one is Keith can you talk a little bit about the linearity in the quarter? We saw Q1, obviously, a very terrible earnings season for a lot of the old-time software companies. I just wanted to see if that's timing or the market share comments that you kind of laid out in the first questions. The second one is since we talk about London and the event there tomorrow. And I saw like, the European growth accelerate again. Could you talk a little bit about where you see the maturity of that market versus the U.S. market? Thank you.","Keith Block","Yes thanks for the question. So let me just start with the international markets into the second part of the question. This has been a big focus area for us over the last three years as part of our one of the three growth levers again extending our partner ecosystems, speaking the language of industries and focusing our resources internationally obviously we\u2019ve made investments with data centers in Europe which we\u2019re very, very excited about, our customers are obviously excited about that, we\u2019re just responding to our customers in that regard.","But we\u2019ve also invested more in terms of customer phasing assets internationally because our customers want to engage with us more deeply, they want to have more strategic relationships. So we\u2019re just seeing the results of this investment that we\u2019ve made over the last three years. As part of kind of the market trends, there is a lot of legacy on premise providers out there quite frankly that are still trying to figure out if and how they can possibly transition to the cloud which is very difficult, a lot of companies will claim that they are a cloud company. But the reality is being a cloud company is about technology, it is about a business model and it\u2019s about a culture of driving customer success.","And these companies that had poor results or soft results, they represent the past and they do not have these three pillars that really were the foundation for Salesforce 17 years ago and that\u2019s why we continue to drive success for our customers, we see great results in the marketplace, we are taking share quite frankly these other companies are losing share as we gain share.","So we\u2019re creating separation with them in the market. And we have the right vision, we have the right story, we have the right product, we have the right execution, we have great partners and we have great customers and that\u2019s why you\u2019re seeing these results.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Philip Winslow with Credit Suisse.","Philip Winslow","Hi, guys, just want to echo my congrats on what was a huge quarter. We've talked a lot about Sales Cloud and platform, and those are phenomenal too, but we haven't touched on the Marketing Cloud yet. Our checks are picked up that you guys continue to increasingly good job in cross-selling that into that big Sales Cloud base, and obviously just the product itself has evolved pretty rapidly over the past 12, 18 months. Wonder if you could give us some color there. As you think about the rest of fiscal \u201817 how do you think about the outlook for the Marketing Cloud in particular? And then just one quick follow-up to that.","Keith Block","Well we just came off with Connections. We had this incredible event last week in Atlanta where we had a record number of customers throughout for this event and a lot of great CMOs, lot of great C level executives, they love our messaging, they love our vision and we\u2019ve done a very, very nice job of integrating not only integrating, I would say that acquisition that we made almost three years ago in June of ExactTarget but we continue to strengthen the product. So it is a natural adjacency to customer engagement along with Sales Cloud and Service Cloud. We continue to invest in the product, we continue to invest in the marketing assets as well as our field assets and we\u2019re driving the results and the message continues to resonate.","Marc Benioff","Yes I would add in on that one too, Keith. I think you guys have landed some amazing big deals in the Marketing Cloud that\u2019s been really, really productive in that way as well, so it\u2019s really nice to see those attributes Marketing Cloud I think coming along really nicely.","Philip Winslow","Great. And then just a follow-up for Marc B. Service Cloud has obviously been a phenomenal success. It's a big dollar number and continues to grow rapidly. It seems like the customer service market as a whole is pretty hot right now. We've heard some new players start to talk about coming into this space even just this week. When you think about your positioning and sort of what you bring to market here first to some of the existing fetters, but also these new ones trying to get into the market, just how do you think about your positioning? What advantages do you have and how do you think about especially the new entrants?","Marc Benioff","Well, service is a huge focus of Salesforce and we -- I immediately kind of default to again my comment on innovation and as evidenced the innovation Gartner\u2019s lead analyst just published Magic Quadrant on customer engagement if you haven\u2019t seen it, you should get it and contact Gartner and you will see when you get it that Salesforce has moved farther up into the right of any product that I\u2019ve ever seen in the history of Gartner Magic Quadrants.","So you will have to look at that and we\u2019re not done because where we platform in service completely on the Lightning which would be done by Dreamforce, we are continuing to add and extend service. It remains one of our most exciting fastest growing product, its going; it is chasing Sales Cloud to be our largest cloud I mean it\u2019s an exciting market. Now service is a huge and exciting market there will be many players in service, just as there are many players in sales, just as there\u2019s many players in platform. We are in mega markets and I like there\u2019s innovation in service and competition and service it makes the markets bigger but it doesn\u2019t change our position as being the number one, most important provider of service solutions in the world with largest market share that is what we want to be and continue and where we will continue to be.","Mark Hawkins","And just add to that, just in case you haven\u2019t seen the report yet so, we gained 330 basis points and the report that just came out I mean it\u2019s pretty major share shift it\u2019s to add on to our already number one position.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan.","Mark Murphy","Thank you. I'll add my congrats. Question for Marc Benioff. In recent months, we have seen a lot of evidence of the major consulting firms, such as Accenture and Deloitte and PWC, moving pretty aggressively to build out their Salesforce practices. They've been doing it both organically and through acquisitions, and they seem to be centering their entire digital transformation strategy around Salesforce. And we've seen them converging their services with apps from multiple of your app exchange partners and they're kind of wrapping that around Salesforce. And it seems to be resulting, in part, in this growth trajectory that you've got. So I am curious, does the path even beyond $10 billion and may be to $15 billion or $20 billion in revenue seem any clearer to you as you have these consulting firms coalescing around Salesforce for their digital transformation strategies?","Marc Benioff","Okay, well this is a great question and I\u2019m going to go to Keith pretty quickly on this but you saw it in my February 2 presentation where we highlighted Accenture and where we\u2019ve also now toured them around the world. You\u2019ve seen the videos on YouTube between Salesforce and Accenture you haven\u2019t, it\u2019s a great opportunity go and check that out as well as the demos, you heard from their CIO, from their CEO, from their President that Salesforce is their fastest and more strategic growing practice. And it is their transformation practice; it is their key cloud practice. You also see that with the some of the other major SIs as well. I\u2019m especially proud of our work with Deloitte. I\u2019m especially proud of our work with Capgemini. And you know from the fourth quarter PWC was just an awesome, awesome relationship that is emerging. And we are delighted with that as well. All of these players have our full attention.","Now for all of them they are kind of competing the growth to be the fastest grower with Salesforce\u2019s ecosystem because all of our customers want service capabilities because Salesforce itself provides actually only strategic services. We don\u2019t really provide these kind of core implementation services. So these large players have acquired many of the key parts of our ecosystem and you just saw that with IBM, they just bought Bluewolf. And they are very good company but they\u2019ve all made strategic bets and they are trying to acquire our ecosystem as fast as possible. We\u2019re continuing to invest in these companies, into these ecosystem companies, we want to start more companies that provides service capabilities, regionally in United States, in Europe, in Japan, and Australia, and other places in the world and these companies grow up and they get acquired by these large companies, that\u2019s a great model for us of course our venture firm who has made a incredible return on that strategy over the last 10 years, now on top of that, I will tell you that I don\u2019t think that there is a strategic systems integrator who isn\u2019t making massive investments in Salesforce right now.","And a lot of that has been led by Keith; I\u2019m going to turn it over to him. He has really given us a partner focus that we did not have before and Keith can you kind of tell us how you doubled down on that and how you provided such great leadership around the systems integrators.","Keith Block","Yes so again this has been one of our growth strategies to really drive this partner ecosystem in many fronts. And Marc mentioned a lot of the large and significant players and these are firms that have deep relationships in the board room, companies of all shapes and sizes all over the world, I mean Deloitte has been rebranded to Deloitte Digital and really when you look at the centre piece of everything that Deloitte brings to the table in terms of digital transformation, it starts with Salesforce. They have done a terrific job there.","I just last week I addressed the Global Partners Forum at Accenture in Munich and talked about digital transformation and how Accenture and Salesforce are doing so well together. And just to give you an example of Accenture, we just don\u2019t have a go-to-market relationship with them which is terrific and they continue to build their practice, they\u2019re also a very large customer of us, so they are leveraging the Lightning platform, they are rolling it out very aggressively, they are getting all the benefits of it and they are building products on top of our platforms. So with a beautiful 360 degree relationship with Accenture that has really served as a model for all of these great systems integrators.","I\u2019m going to be with Capgemini in a few weeks to explore how we accelerate going to market with Capgemini. We collaborate with them very regularly about how to drive the market together.","I was with the Vice Chairman of PWC, a couple of weeks ago talking about our growth strategies together and our job is really to work very closely with these very trusted advisors to listen to them, to help feed and drive the ecosystem because it\u2019s just a huge part of our strategy.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John DiFucci from Jefferies. ","John DiFucci","Thanks for taking my question. I think this question is for Keith, this has been two quarters, I mean Salesforce has been putting up numbers that are good numbers for a while. But these last two quarters look to us be really strong and strong primarily it looks on the enterprise, I mean the SMB seems to have been pretty consistent for quite some time. But something seem to have changed with the enterprise, the enterprise customers. So Keith can you talk about what\u2019s driving this, what\u2019s happening or enterprise is just more willing to engage with SaaS vendors in specifically Salesforce or some of the processes have you came in Marc said it\u2019s your third year anniversary coming up, you obviously made some changes and put some things in place, are they just starting to really thinking right now and I guess how sustainable is this, we\u2019ve seen it now for a couple of quarters?","Keith Block","Yes, John thanks for the question. So I think a couple of things. Number one just honestly this has been 17 years in the making. I mean, this is an incredible company with incredible people and incredible set of products and customers that I alluded to earlier and we\u2019ve been able to gain in several markets share and momentum. Starting with Marc\u2019s vision for cloud computing 17 years ago. So we\u2019ve been able to capitalize on that, so that\u2019s kind of point number one.","Point number two is that, we find ourselves in a world where this convergence of cloud and mobile and social and data science and IoT all coming together and we kind of lit the match again with Marc\u2019s vision 17 years ago and we\u2019ve been able to reinforce that vision by driving success with our customers.","And then over the last there is a third point, is over the last three years and successful as a company has always been, we have put a particular emphasis on the enterprise and a focus on expansion in our international markets becoming trusted advisors by speaking the language of the customer around the industries and building out our ecosystem kind of probably answer the question about our SI partners before, so all of these things are coming together. We are built for last that\u2019s been part of the strategy from 17 years back. And I think in the last three years as I said all these key parts are just augmenting but it\u2019s always been a great company with great products and great leadership and incredible employees and customers.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ed Maguire with CLSA.","Ed Maguire","Hi, good afternoon. I\u2019d like to just ask a question about the source of demand that\u2019s driving acceleration in the platform. Would you characterize that more as a push to find demand where that you\u2019re building a developer ecosystem and with all of the new features and Lightning etcetera or it are you actually starting to see more pull demand as this broad ecosystem of all the clouds works together and attracts more business to the platform.","Keith Block","Yes, so this is Keith. So like this is really a multifaceted thing number one our job is to think a vision for our customers around driving success and customer engagement. And then we have to back it up by driving that success and one of the ways we do it is with industry leading products and that starts with our platform. So that platform is really the secret sauce that allows us to engage drive this customer engagement level for all of our customer base in the market.","So we do create a vision, if you will, we do create demand but there also is timing in the market as I talk about early between this convergence as part of the mobile, social data science and IoT all coming together. So customers are seeing a need because the market is right for disruption with all these technologies, our platform is amazing. So we\u2019re able to deliver on that product and then we have build out this incredible ecosystem or ISDs who are building on our platform and they are driving success with our customers by building unique solutions, they love the vision of Lightning and the reality of Lightning and so all those things are coming together. So it\u2019s kind of a push pull effect, the market has been created and we feel that and it\u2019s very cyclical and as a result, you see the results in our platform.","Marc Benioff","All right, I think that\u2019s all that time we have for questions for today. So I want to thank everyone for joining us on our call for the first quarter. Look forward to updating you on our Q2 results in August and remember you register for Trailhead DX event here in San Francisco June 7 and 8 and of course Europe for Dreamforce October 4 through 7. So look forward to talking to you all in a few months. Thanks so much.","Operator","This does conclude today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. David Havlek, Head of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin your conference.","David Havlek","Thanks, David, and welcome, everyone, to today's call.

Our fourth quarter was a really gorgeous finish to an amazing year of growth for Salesforce.com, and the first quarter is already off to a spectacular start. I'm going to get to that in just one moment. ","Revenue for the fourth quarter rose 38% from a year ago to $632 million. For the full year, we delivered approximately $2.27 billion in revenue, with an annual revenue run rate that now exceeds $2.5 billion, and our full year revenue grew 37% from fiscal year '11. Look, David, no other enterprise software company of our size is growing faster. ","Deferred revenue increased by 48% year-over-year, propelling deferred revenue past the $1 billion milestone for the first time ever, and we now have more than $3.5 billion of booked business on and off the balance sheet. We also set a company record for cash flow in the quarter exceeding $200 million operating cash, that's an increase of 45% year-over-year. For the full year, operating cash flow rose 29% to nearly $600 million. ","And finally, we added approximately 2,500 employees around the world in fiscal year '12, including nearly 2,000 of them right here in the United States of America. ","Now during the quarter, we closed more than 4x the number of 7 bigger transactions than Q4 of last year, including the largest transaction in our history, which was quickly usurped by another transaction that I'll soon mention. In all, we signed more than 100 7-figure transactions and 9 8-figure transactions in the quarter. And as I've been foreshadowing, I'm thrilled to announce that since closing the fourth quarter, we've already topped ourselves by signing our first ever 9-figure transaction in the opening days of Q1. ","Now, I want to be really clear with everyone before I continue. This 9-figure transaction is not reflected in any of these numbers that we're talking about today and is not currently reflected in our income sheet, our balance sheet that were -- income statement or balance sheet that we're publishing today, and we're going to be discussing the details of this 9-figure transaction on our first quarter call. I just want to let everyone know how excited we are about the transaction and it's with an insurance -- a very large insurance company, and we couldn't be more excited about this. ","Now given our customer momentum and our strong pipeline of new business, I'm delighted to announce that we are raising our full year fiscal year '13 revenue guidance, which we now project at $2.92 billion to $2.95 billion, and our guidance puts us on pace to reach a $3 billion annual revenue run rate during this fiscal year, finishing the year with a growth rate of approximately 30%. ","Now, our outstanding financial success this quarter was powered by the momentum of our social enterprise strategy, which has differentiated us in the market and is driving our ability to become a more strategic partner to our customers. And as a result, we now see a growing number of companies standardizing their entire front office on Salesforce.com. ","A great example is Hewlett-Packard, who embarked on a transformation with Salesforce.com to become a social enterprise, connecting employees, customers and partners using our Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, Chatter and Force.com to become our largest deal in the fourth quarter. And Time Warner Cable is creating a social enterprise for its B2B business using Radian6, the Sales Cloud, the Service Cloud, the Social Cloud, Data.com and Heroku, and their vision is to build an employee social network for sales and support reps that provides real-time customer insights on mobile devices, fueling a new level of collaboration with customers. ","Now many of you know of the company Nvidia, which is another great win for us in the quarter, they are swapping out .NET, an old client service software product as part of its Cloud First strategy with an enterprise-wide deployment of Force.com and by linking Force.com with its SAP back office, Nvidia, like so many other SAP customers all over the world, will be able to now power it's social enterprise workforce with next-generation social and mobile apps. ","And finally, Activision, the creator of the very popular video games, World of Warcraft and Call of Duty, is on a mission to revolutionize the gamer experience and is live with Salesforce.com at the heart of its transformation. It's got Radian6, Chatter, Sales Cloud and Service Cloud, and they are building an employee social network, they are building a customer social network, and they are building a product social network entirely based on Force.com and Chatter that will help the company delight its 40 million avid gamers in completely new ways. ","Now for those of you who've been following us in the last few calls, you'll realize something amazing with this win. We now have all 3 big gaming companies: Activision, Electronic Arts and Zynga, who have all unplugged and turned off Oracle RightNow in favor of Salesforce.com. Each and every one of them found that Oracle RightNow could not serve them with the scale and the reliability and the availability of these large gaming companies and their need for big data. ","In each case, they chose Salesforce for our ability to deliver big data for customer service on a flexible, multi-tenant, shared, innovative platform that allow them to create new games and new customer experiences at the scale and speed of gaming itself. ","Other transactions from the fourth quarter included Chevron and BMW, AT&T and McKesson, Sprint, Motorola and in Japan NTT, Symantec and in Europe Philips, Sony, Gannett, VMware, LinkedIn and Coach, Foster's, Heineken, Wiley and the list goes on and on and on. With the social enterprise, we are now closing our largest most exciting strategic deals in this enterprise software industry. ","Customers are buying multiple servers from us, and as a result, delivering our most diverse quarter ever. In fact, more than 40% of our new business in the quarter came from services other than our namesake, Sales Cloud. This has created amazing momentum for each of our clouds, and I'd like to highlight a few milestones. ","First, A, our flagship Sales Cloud delivered strong growth this year as we continued to take share from Oracle and SAP. In fact, according to the latest IDC report, Salesforce.com now has the second largest market share in CRM. We displaced SAP. We did it for the very first time. Salesforce according to IDC is now #2 CRM provider in the world, cloud or software of any type. Of course, we're already #1 in cloud. That wasn't the point. We're now #2 overall. ","Service Cloud momentum also continued to rise as more and more companies look for ways to connect with their customers in traditional and social media channels. In the fourth quarter alone, we added nearly 100 million in new annual business for the Service Cloud. And Chatter, well Chatter has become the most widely adopted enterprise social network ever with more than 150,000 active networks. ","Radian6 grew at a triple-digit pace in Q4 compared to last year and closed its largest deal ever this quarter with Sony. ","Momentum for our platform business continued to build as companies demand more social, mobile and cloud apps to serve their customers and employees. In fiscal year '12, our platforms achieved truly impressive milestones. The Salesforce platform, which includes products like Force.com and Heroku and Siteforce, new business for standalone, Force.com, roughly doubled from last year. Force.com now has more than 480,000 developers who have built more than 275,000 cloud apps. That's an incredible growth of 43% year-on-year. ","We have more than 2 billion lines of Apex code that we're managing for our customers in Force.com. And developers on Heroku, which is the incredible multi-language application development and deployment environment that we purchased last year, well now, developers on Heroku have now built more than 1 million apps, that's 10x growth since we bought them. ","And our ISV ecosystem is also growing at an incredible pace. We doubled the number of ISVs on the app exchange and have more than 2,000 partners offering our customers outstanding social and mobile business apps. ","Finally, nothing speaks more of the value of our services than usage. Just take a look at trust.salesforce.com. I'm thrilled to announce that we delivered another record number of transactions in the fourth quarter, nearly 45 billion transactions during the quarter, 45 billion. All you have to do is ask Microsoft, Oracle or SAP how many billion transactions do they deliver in the cloud this quarter. Well, we delivered 45 billion transactions. That's an increase of 68% from a year ago. That's nearly 700 million transactions every business day. That's a core competency of Salesforce.com that no other company in the world has. ","It's been an amazing year of growth. We're looking forward to being the first enterprise cloud computing company to surpass a $3 billion annual revenue run rate this year. ","Now before I close, I want to remind you that we're just 3 weeks away from our largest Cloudforce ever. And if you want to see all of these come to life, then come to San Francisco. Because I'm telling you, on March 15, there's going to be 14,000 people here, and we're kicking off our Cloudforce Social Enterprise Tour, and we're including our new Cloudstock Conference for developers. It's going to bring thousands of developers together. We're all going to be coding the social enterprise. With hundreds of social enterprise solutions under one roof at our expo, it's going to be an amazing start to the year, and I look forward to seeing you all there at Mosconi Center in San Francisco on March 15 at 8 a.m. ","Okay, with that, I'd like to turn this over to Graham, and let's get into the financial details of our fourth quarter. Graham?","Graham V. Smith","Thanks, Marc. We capped off a great fiscal 2012 with an outstanding fourth quarter. The strong new business pipeline, we discussed in Q3, enabled us to deliver results that exceeded our expectations in Q4, including revenue, cash flow and EPS. ","Let me cover a few highlights starting with revenue. Q4 revenue increased to $632 million, up 38% over Q4 last year. Fourth quarter revenue benefited from a small FX tailwind of just $2 million. In addition to the strong new business Marc discussed, we continue to benefit from a sustained decline in dollar attrition, which fell for the 10th consecutive quarter, to end the year still in the mid-teens percentage range. ","For the full fiscal year, revenue increased to $2.27 billion, that's up 37% over last year. Excluding an FX benefit of approximately $37 million. Full year revenue, on a constant currency basis, grew 35% over last year. ","Each of our regions posted solid fourth quarter revenue growth. Revenue in the Americas grew 41% to $436 million. In Europe, revenue was $108 million, that's up 30% in dollars and 32% in constant currency, helped by strong renewals, and in Asia, revenue was $88 million, that's an increase of 34% in dollars and 28% in constant currency. Japan continues to improve when compared with the first half of the year. ","Overall, we were pleased with the balance of regional revenue growth in the fourth quarter and the full year, particularly, let me take into account that the Americas growth rate gets an additional benefit from recent acquisitions. ","On the subject of acquisitions, let me take a moment to briefly discuss the impact of our acquired businesses. Over the past 2 years, we've made 11 acquisitions with Jigsaw, Heroku and Radian6 being the most significant from a financial point of view. Excluding the revenue effect of these 11 acquisitions, organic revenue growth of fiscal 2012 was still in excess of 30%. While the contribution from our acquisitions represented less than 5% of total revenue in fiscal 2012, we expect these fast-growing businesses to contribute a greater proportion of revenue over time. ","As Marc mentioned, our business mix is more diverse than ever. We're pleased to see Service Cloud and Platform deliver very strong growth alongside solid Sales Cloud growth. 3 years ago, our non-Sales Cloud new business was just 25% of total. Today, non-Sales Cloud new business represents more than 40% of the total, and we expect this to continue to diversify. ","Turning to the income statement. Q4 and full year non-GAAP gross margins were 82%, essentially unchanged from last year. Non-GAAP subscription and support gross margin was down slightly from Q4 last year. For the full year, subscription support gross margin was 86%, down 2 points compared with FY '11. This decline was primarily the result of the acquisitions I just mentioned as well as data center investments. ","Non-GAAP professional services gross margins were 10% in the quarter and approximately 14% for the full year, a significant improvement over last year, primarily as a result of our mandatory compliance with the EITF 08-01 accounting standards. ","Moving on to the non-GAAP operating expenses. Operating expense as a percentage of revenue was 69% in Q4, that's down 2 points from last year. For the full year, operating expenses as a percent of revenue was 70% compared with 68% last year. This 2-point increase was primarily due to an increase in sales and marketing expense, the result of adding significant distribution capacity during the year, while R&D and G&A expenses, as a percent of revenue, remained flat. ","We continue to hire aggressively in Q4, adding more than 800 people to finish the year with approximately 7,700 employees. That's up 47% from last year. 550 of those additions came from acquisitions. ","Fourth quarter non-GAAP operating margins rose by 2 points year-over-year to 13%. For the full year, non-GAAP operating margins fell 2 points to 12% from last year. ","Non-GAAP EPS was $0.43 for the fourth quarter and $1.36 for the full year. Our share count and tax rate both finished a bit lower than our projections entering the quarter. Together, those benefits contributed roughly $0.02 to fourth quarter EPS. ","Turning to cash flow. Operating cash flow for the fourth quarter, as Marc already mentioned, was well over $200 million, at $240 million. That's an increase of 45% over last year. For the full year, operating cash flow was up 29% over last year. Our cash performance was higher than we projected at the start of the quarter for a couple of reasons: ","First, invoicing. On prior earnings calls, we've discussed the fact that year-over-year changes in invoicing cycles have generally been insignificant. However, when we analyze the trend over a longer period, 5 years, it became clear that these relatively insignificant year-over-year changes, combined with a huge increase in invoicing dollars, were causing a cumulative drag on our invoicing and cash flow that was becoming more meaningful. As a result, during Q4, we were much more deliberate about requesting annual invoicing for both new business and renewals. Our customers responded well, and as a result, invoicing and cash flow benefited sooner than we expected.  The percentage of annual invoices in Q4 was higher than in recent fourth quarters but only slightly higher than in Q4 of fiscal 2008. Our full year annual invoice percentage was just under 65%, and that compares with the 2\/3 proportion that we've discussed as a rule of thumb in the past. ","Second, one of the large transactions Marc mentioned earlier included a multiyear invoice that was partially collected during the quarter, which increased operating cash flow by approximately $25 million in Q4. ","Looking to FY '13, we expect operational excellence around annual invoicing to benefit cash flow when we approach -- and we project FY '13 operating cash flow will grow in the low 20% range. If we continue to increase the percentage of annual invoicing, cash generation is obviously going to benefit. ","CapEx spending for the quarter was approximately $45 million, that's up 46% over Q4 last year. The increase was primarily related to our leasehold improvement spend, which tracks fairly closely to headcount growth, and to a lesser extent, capitalized software development costs. ","Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less CapEx, was approximately $196 million. That's up 45% over last year. For the full year, free cash flow was approximately $440 million. That's up 19% from fiscal 2011. ","Looking ahead, we expect hiring and related leasehold improvement costs to increase CapEx slightly faster than operating cash flow next year. As a result, we expect free cash flow to grow a little slower than operating cash flow in fiscal 2013. ","Turning to the balance sheet. Our strong cash generation in fiscal 2012 was mostly offset by M&A activity during the year. As a result, cash and cash equivalents including marketable securities, finished the year just over $1.4 billion, up about $40 million from last year. ","Accounts receivable at year end was up 60% to $684 million, primarily as a result of the 2 factors I just discussed that benefited invoicing and cash flow. As a result, DSO for Q4 was 100 days, that's up from 86 days last year. But if you exclude the impact of the 2 factors I mentioned, DSO would have been at a similar level to last year. ","Now turning to deferred revenue. We exited the year with approximately $1.38 billion of deferred revenue on the balance sheet, up 48% from last year, including an approximate $3 million currency headwind over last year. Off-balance sheet backlog, which represents business that is booked but not yet invoiced, grew from approximately $1.5 billion to approximately $2.2 billion this year. As a result, our total booked business, including both the on-balance sheet deferred and off-balance sheet backlog, now exceeds $3.5 billion. That's more than double where we were just 2 years ago. Going forward, we've planned to provide this off-balance sheet backlog each quarter in order to provide you with a greater level of visibility. ","With the operational excellence around the annual invoicing contributing to our strong growth in current deferred revenue, the multiyear invoice caused the increase in long-term deferred revenue. If you exclude these 2 factors, we estimate that the total revenue on the balance sheet increased approximately 31% year-over-year. ","Looking ahead, because of the seasonal nature of invoicing and with Q4 being, by far, our largest invoicing quarter, we expect to see a sequential drop as we have in several previous years in deferred revenue in Q1 of approximately $40 million to $50 million on a constant currency basis. ","Turning to FY '13 guidance. As Marc mentioned, we're delighted to raise our revenue outlook range by $30 million. We now project FY '13 revenue in the range of $2.92 billion to $2.95 billion. That's an increase of 29% to 30% over last year. ","In addition to delivering solid top line growth in FY '13, we're also targeting an increase in non-GAAP operating margins of 75 to 100 basis points. We estimate full year non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.58 to $1.62. This implies a non-GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 38%. For Q1, we anticipate revenue in the range of $673 million to $678 million for a year-over-year growth of approximately 34%. We expect non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.33 to $0.34. All of the underlying assumptions for our non-GAAP guidance as well as our GAAP guidance and a complete GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation can be found in our earnings press release issued today. ","To conclude, we had a great year with some huge wins. Clearly, our social enterprise vision is resonating with customers and prospects. Our pipeline is strong, our value proposition is increasingly strategic and our deals are becoming larger and more diverse. We exit the year in a very strong competitive position, and we couldn't be happier about our prospects for continued strong revenue growth and improving profitability. We look forward to discussing progress in 90 days. ","And with that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Brent Thill of UBS.","Brent Thill - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Marc, just on the large deal front, obviously, you saw an incredible pickup. Can you just help us understand now that you're passing to the 9-figure mark, what you're starting to see in the pipeline. I had one quick follow-up for Graham.","Marc Benioff","Well honestly, we've just never seen a pipeline like this. And we talked about this all through the year. It's been building through the year, every quarter this year has been a great quarter. You know I feel that way. We had a great first quarter, we had a great second quarter, we had a great third quarter, and that completely built the pipeline up for the fourth quarter, and we did not clean the pipeline out in the fourth quarter by any means. There is plenty of -- plenty more in the fourth quarter to the evidence of that. Already in the first quarter, we've closed our first 9-digit transaction ever, which was with a large Illinois-based insurance company. And I -- this social enterprise strategy, Brent, the thing about this is, is that we are now coming into companies and our message is we want to listen to you, and we want to understand what -- where you're trying to go strategically, because as the world is moving to social, as the world is moving to mobile, as the world is moving to cloud, our customers are saying how do they build their employee social networks, their customer social networks and their product social networks, and we are becoming a trusted advisor. And through our thousands of salespeople all over the world, we want to have that trusted interactive relationship with them, where we could sit down. And in that process, the deals are getting bigger because we're not just selling an FFA solution anymore and we're not just in the service solution anymore or just a platform decision or just a social monitoring decision or just a collaboration. We put it all together because as you know, because you followed us a long time, this is one integrated service. This is not a bunch of acquired software stacks like other vendors roll in with, that all look different and act different and architected different. This is one platform. And that gives customers the ability to do some pretty exciting, and as you can see from this quarter, large-scale implementations with us. And when you look at a great company like Hewlett-Packard, I mean, when Meg Whitman announced that she had gone to Salesforce.com at her sales kicked off, she got a standing ovation. They could not wait to get off the Seibel. And that's how it is, when we roll in to these prospects and these customers, they applaud us as we're coming in to take out these old software products that aren't mobile, aren't social and are not cloud. That's what's happening.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Jason Maynard of Wells Fargo.","Jason Maynard - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Marc, can you maybe talk a little bit more about social in terms of where you're seeing the initial uptake? Is it collaboration for internal workers? Are you starting to see some traction beyond Radian6 for external customer engagement? What's the path, if you will, that companies are taking on the social enterprise journey? And how is it driving then, if you will, standardization around you as the front office system of record?","Marc Benioff","Well, what I can tell you is really, it aligns with what I have been saying now for about 2 years, which is, it starts with Chatter. I mean, the phenomenon that has happened in the world is the creation of this unbelievable company called Facebook. And behind it, Twitter. And you've got 1 billion users who have conditioned themselves on their iPhones and on their iPads and on their BlackBerrys and on their Android phones that they're on these social networks all day long, and then they roll in to their SAP system or their Oracle system or their Microsoft system, and they're like, \"What is this?\" They want to rebuild and re-architect their enterprises through this same metaphor. They wanted Facebook for the enterprise, they wanted Twitter for the enterprise, and that's what we're working on delivering. And it started with Chatter. But Chatter is not some tack-on or add-on to Salesforce. As you know, we rebuilt our architecture and it was difficult and it was painful for us, but we rebuilt Salesforce and deep within all of our system and our APIs and deep inside our databases, we added status updates and feeds, and we added profiles and we added real-time capabilities, and we added all the things that you need to basically create social networks. And then we're able to apply it, as I said before, to the employee social network or the customer social network or the product social network, and it's evolving into these incredible systems and applications. And it's not one system with all your data that runs outside the firewall and one data with all your system running inside the firewall. It is a perfect symbiotic system that the customer data and the employee data is all in one database, and it provides an incredible application. But I could tell you that when we roll in to do these demonstrations, that it's highly differentiated against our competitors who are still mostly pitching this stuff that was built a decade ago. And they haven't -- they still don't get it. And I think customers want change, and they're demanding change and Salesforce.com is the change that they can believe in.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini of Goldman Sachs.","Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Marc, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about Heroku and what's driving the ramp in that business, kind of what are you seeing from people, given some of the growth that you talked about in your prepared remarks. And also, I just wanted to know, if you had to look out for this year or even the next 2 years, and you look at the Service Cloud business, is that kind of the next big pillar of growth that can surprise to the upside given all those old call center deployments that were out there from the last decade?","Marc Benioff","Well let's start there first. It is an awesome product. There's no doubt that Service Cloud has a huge amount of momentum to become our next multibillion-dollar product line at Salesforce. We all feel that way. It had another unbelievable year that were -- more than doubled this year. And we've done a great job with Service Cloud. And not just enterprise Service Cloud but now we have our new SMB Service Cloud called Desk.com, and I don't know if you've seen Desk.com but that's another huge area that we're just starting, which is based on the acquisition we made with Assistly. We were able to take Desk.com and say, \"Okay, now we can bring Service Cloud down for the rest of us.\" So, yes, I agree that Service Cloud is a great level of momentum, but I have to tell you, we have a lot of different product lines that are on fire, and it's kind of hard for one of them to beat out another because the sales product is still doing great, service is doing great, collaboration is doing great, marketing in Radian6 and the work that we're doing there with Marcel and his team, they're doing unbelievable, and the platform is doing unbelievable. So that's where it's hard to say, \"Oh well, the next one is going to be this.\" When the reality is the next one is all of them working together and the next big one, if you want me to pick one, is social enterprise. The social enterprise and the social enterprise license agreement, which is what we introduced at Dreamforce, that is the big one. And that's what customers really want. They want to come in and say, \"Give us the social enterprise.\" And yes, service, Heather, is a key part of that but sales is part of it and all our employee social -- all of these things are part of it. And to your first question, what's getting Heroku going? There's 2 answers: One, of course, this is the only thing out in the market that has Java as a service. So if you want Java as a service and Ruby as a service and Clojure as a service, you go to Heroku, you could immediately deploy your apps. And we're just at the beginning of the revenue story with Heroku, because we still have Heroku Enterprise coming. And then we've got this deep Facebook integration. So if you're at the F8 conference -- if you're in Facebook, inside Facebook, and you go to build an application, it says, do you want to build it with Heroku, inside the Facebook app. I don't think a lot of analysts and other people were following that announcement at the F8 Conference because there are millions of developers who are inside the Facebook APIs and who are going to find out about Heroku, which has been integrated by Facebook into their architecture. I mean, Facebook has been an incredible story for Salesforce.com because, of course, they're running so many aspects of their business on the back end with us and now we have been integrated into their platform as well but that was a huge catalyst for Heroku.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Mark Murphy of Piper Jaffray.","Mark R. Murphy - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","I wanted to ask you a question on the Radian6 social monitoring product. How is it changing the game when you can walk through the door and meet with a prospect and demonstrate that you know more about certain aspects of their business than they do? I can't imagine there's really any other company in the world that can do that. And if you can open a company's eyes to what is being said about them on the social web, is that in turn accelerating adoption of all your other products so that the customer can engage and respond?","Marc Benioff","Well, when I look at Radian6, I mean, the power of Radian6. This is big data social analytics. We're building this massive data warehouse of all these real-time social interactions, this huge service, and customers can come in and plug into that and say, \"Okay, what's going on with my brand, my company, my executives, my competitors, my employees and you get this incredible analysis.\" But if you were in our New York event, you saw us roll out something new which is the really, truly awesome thing which is still coming is Social Hub, which is we have this incredible CEO, leader of Radian6, Marcel LeBrun, who has designed this social hub, where you basically put in all of these various triggers and queries and reports, and you can move and say, everyone who is unhappy with my product, okay? Or who's complaining about this price increase or who has this issue with this brand, who's on these social networks move them and create cases into the Service Cloud, which is this perfect integration between CRM and Radian6. When you get these 2 things working together, that reinforces the social enterprise story. And that's where, again, we differentiate against the competition. It's not that we're coming in and say we're the only ones with social monitoring. It's we're the only ones who have the social enterprise story and can make it real, and it's not coming in, as I said, with a bunch of siloed legacy client server stacks. We're coming in with this integrated service, and that integrated service is a key component, as you're mentioning, in social monitoring but the key is the social monitoring is part of the total story. And you're going to see more of that. I'll give you a great example. You could be -- put your employee database into Radian6, and you could be monitoring, here's all my former employees, here's all my current employees. I don't think it's that far away, where all of a sudden, you're doing social monitoring and you'll see that your former employee, who is maybe at one of your competitors, is talking on Facebook or talking on Twitter to one of your current employees about a job in this company. And I think it's not a huge leap that you could see a phone call coming from corporate retention saying, \"Hey, it's corporate retention. We just want to find out how you're doing and are you happy here at this company?\" Radian6 gives you that kind of social intelligence and gives you a level of performance and capability that you're just not going to have in any other way.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Adam Holt of Morgan Stanley.","Adam H. Holt - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","My question, I guess, Marc, is to you. You've been pretty steadfast in your commitment to investing in the growth opportunities in front of you, and obviously, that's bearing out with terrific numbers this quarter. You did, however, guide to margins going up next year for the first time in several years. Can you give us your latest thoughts in terms of how you're thinking about the balance between growth and margin expansion?","Marc Benioff","I'm very committed to increasing our margins. I mean, I'm trying to push as much as I absolutely can do it. And I feel it's very important for the future of our business that we continue to expand our margins. And what I do is I just play that against -- I just delivered a 37% growth year and a 38% growth quarter, and I've done that because we are spending. And if we brought margins way, way, way up and slowed spending then, are we going to be satisfied like with a lot of other cloud companies at 25% growth or 26% growth. I think it's a mistake to be delivering 25% or 26% or 27% growth today because this is the heyday of the cloud. This is the Renaissance. We are in the great time. This is the time to create all this amazing new technology. We've all changed the devices we've used. We're all changing how we use computers. There needs to be an enterprise company that's going to come in and deliver this at scale with the number of salespeople and the service organization, the products and that's why we've spent. But at the same time, I'm committed to raising margins because I think it's important for the company. I'm also committed to delivering very strong cash performance. As you can see, the cash performance for the year is awesome and for the quarter. So we're trying to do it all, and doing it all is a hard, okay? But we're doing it, I think, as well as anyone and we have been doing it. You know how I feel. I feel even like, last quarter we were doing it. And I feel that this quarter we're doing -- I feel we've had consistent execution all year, and I feel the end of this year was just a solid ending, and then we have the spectacular beginning to the new year with this 9-digit transaction, we're going, whoa, let's open a door even for our own employees, going, yes, the social enterprise strategy, we can see how this can become seminal in these companies.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Brad Zelnick of Macquarie.","Brad A. Zelnick - Macquarie Research","Marc, the large deal of your metrics are unbelievable. Obviously, a 9-figure deal doesn't happen overnight, and it refutes all of the bears in thinking that Salesforce is really only a mid-market company and really can't penetrate the large enterprise. With that said, clearly, something has changed. Something's changed in the willingness for large enterprises to make enterprise-wide, not just department-level commitments, to Salesforce as a platform. But can you maybe speak -- what is the pipeline of those large deals look like? How do you think about the mix of your business looking 1, 2 years out in terms of large enterprise, mid-market and SMB?","Marc Benioff","Here's the beautiful thing about this business. These big deals don't matter to us. We don't really care about the big deals. It's just icing on the cake. And if you've been following our business for a while, that's not the business we've built. We're all about -- basically, we're all about transactions and we're all about throughput, and we serve a wide portfolio of customers, small, medium and large. These big deals which we roll out, we have 8-figure transactions, 9-figure transactions, it's immaterial, it is. The most important thing is that we have a broad book of business, and that we're not dependent on any one transaction or any one customer as part of who we are as a company. I don't think any -- I don't think even our largest customer even represents 1% of our revenue. That's very unusual. And I think that the power of the company is that it is a balanced portfolio of business, small, medium and large; it's a balanced geography of business and we've talked about Asia, the U.S. and Europe; and it's a balanced product line. It's kind of to Heather's point. It's sales, service, it's collaboration, it's platform, it's marketing. So that's what I've been focusing on as CEO for a number of years is to make sure that our customers, okay? And our company, basically, give this kind of level of equanimity. We're not all about the enterprise and the high end, we're not all about the small business and the low end. We're about including everyone. We want to get everyone in the social enterprise boat. That's really our goal.","Brad A. Zelnick - Macquarie Research","And just one quick follow-up to a point that you've made. Salesforce up until now has a very focused geographic approach only operating, if I'm not mistaken, or really selling into 10 or 12 countries. So there are obviously many more markets globally that you can go after. What is this year's plan have in store in terms of international?","Marc Benioff","This year's plan really looks a lot like last year's plan. I mean, let me tell you -- I mean, I address this issue all the time with our own employees. The software market in the world, it's not the same as selling PCs or servers for example. Technology industry is very, very different by sector. And one thing that I can tell you is -- I'll give you an example. You probably saw Steve Ballmer did this huge rant in Beijing about 3 or 6 months ago where he was saying, \"Our Chinese revenues are less than our revenues in the Netherlands,\" I think it was. And he said, \"But I have spent billions in China, and I have got tens of thousands of Chinese employees, and my revenue -- I just can't get my revenues going.\" And the reason why that is, is because, really, the most important software markets of the world, the top 7 or 8 markets, no more than 10 markets really represent 85% to 90% of the total market. And you need to be focused when you're in a new category like cloud because the U.S. is obviously tipped to cloud. But Europe has not quite tipped. I would say Japan is getting there. The U.S. and the U.K. and Japan, these are the 3 biggest software markets in the world. You've got to dominate these markets if you're in software. Then you can move on to other markets like, for example, France and Germany, Australia, Canada. But a lot of these smaller markets, that has not been a focus for us. And I think -- I get questions all the time from our Board, whatever, well, what are you doing about this emerging country or that emerging country? We really look at an emerging country like Minneapolis. To us, that's an emerging country because the Minneapolis software market is bigger than Brazil. And we're asking ourselves, What are we doing in Minneapolis? That's why I just was in Minneapolis. That's why I just did a seminar in Minneapolis. That's why I'm working so closely with the customers in Minneapolis because that is actually a major software market: Detroit, Atlanta, Washington D.C. and we still don't have enough coverage. You look at a great customer of ours, General Electric, it's an incredible company, and we have great relationships with GE Health and GE Energy and GE Capital and NBC Universal and on and on and on. But the thing about GE, GE as a company is bigger than the software market of Brazil or India. So you better be focused on selling to General Electric. And that's where we are today. We're still working on doubling down on the core of the software industry. And until we're really done with that, we won't be ready to move into kind of the more discrete smaller markets. I hope that explains the international strategy.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan of Merrill Lynch.","Kash G. Rangan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Marc, for you, when I look at the broader CRM market, it's $17 billion, $18 billion market. The SaaS portion it is about 1\/4. And although you guys continue to put a very, very impressive results, there's nevertheless some doubt in some corner of the market that CRMs are tapped out and that sales automation is only as good as it gets with these kinds of numbers. Can you help us understand, given that SaaS is only 1\/4 of your core CRM market, what does it take for you to start gaining share in the broader CRM market, granted that you have been doing so, but when I look at the rest of the market, it's much, much bigger than SaaS. So when does that on-premise market really become cloud, if it does, obviously, you're maybe poised for a pretty significant growth. And so that's one thing I'd love to get your thoughts on. And also platform, if you look at your days at Oracle, databases became the standard that other ISPs and application started writing too. So could there be a platform type effect for your Force product? And are you seeing traction for Force outside of your core sales and marketing areas?","Marc Benioff","Well, I think that number one, to your point, cloud is a very small emerging part of the total software industry. And multi-tenant shared systems like the ones that offer, that Salesforce.com offers, is still one of the smallest, most discrete parts of the software industry. We are by no means mainstream, right? I mean, you still see the huge intellectual debates out on the Internet about multi-tenancy and shared systems. eBay and Amazon or Google are decades old, and still people are arguing about the future of software. So that has to be upside for us. It has to be that the vast majority of companies still are not using this model. But they're going to be. And as devices change and as new features and capabilities are required by customers, it's going to come through this model. So we're still at the very, very beginning. We are in the first innings of cloud computing. This is still the Renaissance. This is -- we're just see -- I had this great dinner last night with a dozen CEOs of young companies, and all these guys are in their 20s and 30s, and they're amazing, and these companies are just incredible, and of course, all these companies are social, mobile and cloud. No one is starting a new software company today. It's not like you go to dinner here with someone in San Francisco, \"Gee, yes, I'm building my SQL Server application. I'm building my .NET application. Oh, I'm so excited I just bought an Oracle database.\" That is not what people are saying. What people say is, \"I'm building this great new shared service. It's great.\" Everybody has got multi-tenant, everybody's mobile first, everybody's cloud first, everybody is social first. And it's yielding these incredible new companies. And I know you know that because you use these things. And that is what really gives me this kind of passion around that we're at the beginning of cloud. And I think the cool thing about Force.com, to answer your second question, is no one has built a multi-tenant platform that is social and mobile and cloud. Force.com is the only social, mobile and cloud platform. There is nobody else. When we go into our customers and they're like looking at platforms, we're it. It's not like we're in a heavy competition against other cloud providers who have built this incredible thing. And by the time that we get to Dreamforce, and you see the work that we've done and we announced it in the last Dreamforce with Touch, that all of our apps and all of our platform, everything will be mobile and running on tablets and that all of our customers' apps will instantly change over. It won't be like moving from like R3 to myASP or whatever they call it or like, \"Oh my gosh, I'm going through this Oracle upgrade here of our general ledger to like release 12 and it's taking like 2 years and it's like Accenture and it's like gobs of money to kind of get it done.\" That's not how it is at all. All of our customers will just transform into mobile on that moment. And that's the power of the platform, and that's why I'm a huge bull on our platform because it lets our customers innovate more rapidly. So I hope that answers your question, Kash.","Operator","Your next question is from Ed Maguire of CLSA.","Edward Maguire - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","There's been quite a lot of activity on M&A around some of your competitors. And I was just wondering how this has changed the conversations you have with your customers.","Marc Benioff","Well, I don't really get what the competitors are doing, honestly. Well, I kind of do. There's 2 people I don't really understand. I don't really understand why these CEOs of these relatively little companies are selling out at these high growth rates to -- like I don't understand the SuccessFactors SAP deal. At some level, I understand that SAP's HR product kind of sucks and they have no market share and they're losing deals to Workday and so they need to shore up and they don't know what to do, so they need to buy Lars' company. But why does Lars want to sell his company to SAP? Did he not see what happened with Shai Agasi? Did he not see what happened with John Chen? He's going to be controlled by this German Union. I didn't get it. I don't understand why you would sell your company. He had a great company and now it's gone. And it's into this German borg kind of thing. It's like gone. And Taleo, I kind of understand because it's kind of a piece of junk, and they were trying to sell it for a couple of years. But okay, Oracle felt like they had to respond but then what is Oracle's message around Fusion? Didn't they already have HR? Like when Oracle buys right now, like didn't they already have CRM? What is the message now? Which app am I supposed to buy from Oracle? Do I buy Oracle Fusion HR? Do I buy Taleo? Do I -- When we've seen this thing and I think that it's mostly a, A, reaction to these larger software companies with Oracle and SAP, their organic license growth rates are pretty pathetic. And our organic license growth rate before our acquisitions for this quarter were over 30%. Oracle and SAP's license growth rates are single digits. It's not pretty and that's why I think they have to buy these things. It's certainly not giving them a cloud platform, you know that. Taleo and SuccessFactors and RightNow. They're not cloud platforms. They're not giving them a strategy going forward. I view this as very tactical acquisitions and in many cases grabbing -- grasping for straws. I don't see how it's going to turn into something more than that, and I think for these entrepreneurs who sold their company at a $200 million, $300 million revenue level, I think they mostly, especially Lars, made a mistake.","Operator","Your next question is from Tom Ernst of Deutsche Bank.","Thomas Ernst - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Calling here from the emerging market Minneapolis today. So Marc, just to follow-up on that question. Do you change anything strategically because we're seeing M&A start to pick up in the SaaS industry? And maybe specific with the competition, because I think the change, directionally, for SAP is the most aggressive. Does this change the way perhaps you might compete or cooperate with them in the market, do you think, looking forward?","Marc Benioff","Well, I think that at the end of the day, we actually have very good relationships with Oracle and SAP. You have to, in our industry, be able to partner and compete at the same time. And in our industry, you can't take these things personally, you can't get angry about these things because customers demand that you work together. We look at our big SAP customers. Many of the ones that I mentioned and others -- we're probably in, now, every major SAP customer in the world. And as we look at these big SAP customers, whether we're in there in a big way or a little way or an emerging way, they want us to be able to work with SAP. So I mean, I have a very good working relationship with Bill McDermott. My job is to make my customers successful. So on one side, I'm happy like give you my direct and unedited feedback on how I view their strategy and how screwed up I think that they are in cloud computing. On the other side, when the call ends, I have to go make sure that Coke is successful and Burberry is successful and Sony is successful, and that requires me to work with them very closely. And we get that. And of course, when they say something crazy about the cloud, I don't get upset about it or... it's like rhetoric, so I move back into, okay, how are we going to make these customers successful? Because at the end of the day, these customers are becoming social enterprises. We are becoming their front office, and SAP is kind of their legacy back office, and we need to hook those 2 things together. That's a critical thing for us to be able to do. So we can roll in with the sales and service and collaboration and marketing. We've got to be ready to hook that into SAP's general ledger, payables and receivables, and we've demonstrated that ability continuously and we'll continue to focus on that.","Operator","The next question will come from Laura Lederman of William Blair.","Laura Lederman - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Can you talk a little bit about how customers are accepting Database.com and also the acquisition of Rypple. And maybe on the subject of Rypple, give us a sense of sort of your broader high-level thinking on your kind of HR strategy in general?","Marc Benioff","Well, Database.com has been a fantastic strategy, and all you have to do is go to the Database.com website to see the huge customer success, the amount of transactions that are being executed, the number of databases that are getting spun up. With Rypple, we are at the beginning of a very exciting story with HR. I was just on Rypple actually about an hour ago. And with Rypple, you have the ability to go in and to basically start working with your people in a whole new way. And it's all about performance management, it's about being able to do reviews, it's about being able to do -- get feedback, it's about being able to do praise and that will all evolve into native HRMS and other key features. We will also have some great relationships with some terrific HRMS vendors like Workday where we'll tightly integrate Rypple in with their systems and with other providers and you're going to find a perfect balance between what our ISVs are doing and what technologies are available from Rypple. You also probably know we hired incredible executive, John Wookey, who was at SAP for several years, building kind of their next-generation technology and before that was 15 years at Oracle building the e-business suite, and he's leading this HRMS effort, and you'll be seeing on our March 15 date, and I hope you'll be there, Laura, here at Cloudforce in San Francisco, where we're going to have 15,000 people and we're going to be showing that some of that integration for the very first time. And why that's so important is because it is the social enterprise. We want to be able to show our customers that social profile, the employee social profile, the customer social profile. We want to show them the ability to collaborate, the ability to sell, to service and the ability to work together through praise and through recognition and through this whole concept of reinforcement and then build in the custom applications and the social monitoring, the social marketing, the analytics, the data warehousing. And then getting the products onto the social network like the way Activision has done so beautifully with our products to build and deliver that social enterprise, that transformational piece that accelerates the revenue for our customers and their profitability using these new tools that are really dominating our industry. And this is our vision, and I think we are really different from everybody else, and we continue to execute it, and we couldn't be happier with how this year has turned out. We feel every quarter has been great. We're working harder than ever, and we're coming into an exciting new year this year, and hey, we only expect the world to go more social this year with the Facebook IPO, more mobile with the iPhone 5 and iPad 3 and more cloud with all these great new companies that are emerging that I'm seeing. So we're doubled down on our strategy, and we're working to go faster than ever.","Operator","And your next question comes from Rick Sherlund of Nomura.","Richard G. Sherlund - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Just to follow-up on Laura's question, Marc, to further leverage the momentum of social enterprise outside of the front office, just how aggressive should we think that you would be over the next couple of years in expanding perhaps more broadly into talent management or other segments of the market? And I just wanted to hear from Graham, I was kind of curious on what the -- if you could quantify the impact of this change in the billing terms to annual invoicing? What's the impact on the deferred from that? Is it a big number, a small number?","Graham V. Smith","I would like to go first, Rick. The total impact during the quarter of the change to annual bill frequency, I mean, it depends how you -- what you view as your starting point. What we did was we compared the percentage of annual invoicing with last year's fourth quarter, which was low. We estimate the impact was roughly $80 million in the fourth quarter, somewhere around there. As I said earlier, if you compare it with where we were 4, 5 years ago, it's actually not that different. So we've seen this steady, very slow degradation in annual invoicing over the last few years, and we're really just -- we've got a real program now to obviously reverse that trend.","Operator","And your final question comes from Brendan Barnicle of Pacific Crest Securities.","Graham V. Smith","That's not in our current plans. We executed really well in the fourth quarter around this initiative, and I think given the response we got from our customers, I don't see a need to involve a third party. I think the response was good regardless of whether they were small, medium or large customers.","David Havlek","All right. That wraps up my call for today. Unfortunately, we don't have any more time. I see there's more than 15 of you still in the queue, so I apologize for not being able to get to everybody. Before we close, I'd like to remind everyone about our upcoming Cloudforce event scheduled for March 15 at Mosconi West, here in San Francisco.

That's why for the sixth year in a row, Salesforce is the number one CRM.","Provider by market share according to the latest IDC worldwide semi-annual software tracker, we're the leading trusted solution in sales, service, marketing, and model driven application platforms. And at MuleSoft and Tableau, we have the leading solutions and data integration and now analytics, two extremely valuable components of every digital transformation and two very valuable components at every one of our customers\u2019 strategic information technology architecture. Every company needs an intelligent 360-degree view of their customer and that's the power of Customer 360.","Our vision for bringing companies and their customers together, you saw this at Dreamforce with companies like State Farm and MG and Louis Vuitton. Now they can personalize every customer experience, they can predict customer behavior and anticipate their needs. They can build modern mobile apps fast on any device. The magic in Customer 360 is now Customer 360 Truth, which we unveiled at Dreamforce. It connects all the data from across sales, service, marketing, commerce, our entire Customer 360 to build an integrated, single source of truth.","We're giving companies a complete view of every customer making it possible to deliver highly personalized, highly intelligent, and highly connected experiences across every customer touch point, and it's built right into the Salesforce platform. This is what our customers have been asking for and we're making it available to every one of them. No other company could do this. And by bringing all of this data together at Salesforce, we can apply our powerful analytics solutions, Tableau, Einstein, Datorama and others that allow anyone inside a company to see and understand their data to make smarter decisions.","We know this data is not just in Salesforce, we know our customers have many platforms. That's why we're open and why we work with all of our strategic partners; IBM, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Apple, HP, Dell, and many others. Because it's critical for us to work with these strategic partners to deliver a working, incredible solution for our customers. That\u2019s what our customers want. These partnerships continue to deliver incredible innovation and success.","We're doing all of this at tremendous scale. Just look at how Customer 360 fueled our customers\u2019 growth during Cyber Week. Commerce Cloud processed more than 30 million orders, up 27% year-over-year, amazing. It also powered more than 614 million retail site visits, up 17% year-over-year also incredible. Digital sales on Commerce Cloud were up 13%, Marketing Cloud delivered more than 24 billion emails during Cyber Week up 18% and Service Cloud processed more than 428 million agent interactions during this critical time for our customers.","We also saw 9% of digital orders during Cyber Week, driven by our Einstein product recommendations that is incredible to see the velocity of Einstein and with the new Einstein voice skills, any company can build their custom voice powered Salesforce apps giving employee a personalized CRM guide. At Dreamforce, we showed you an Einstein speaker, demonstrating how Einstein can work on any smart speaker, and now you can ask your speaker, Hey Einstein, what's my forecast, and Einstein will tell you whether or not you're going to make your numbers for the quarter.","At the heart of the Customer 360 is our incredible community of trailblazers. We now have 1.8 million learners changing their careers and lives on Trailhead, and free online learning platform. That's because Salesforce ecosystem will contribute 4.2 million jobs, and $1.2 trillion in new business revenues worldwide from 2019 through 2024. We continue to invest in Trailhead to enable more people to participate in the digital economy.","Before handing off to Keith, I want to take a moment and remember our loving friend and Board member Bernard Tyson. We dedicated Dreamforce to Bernard\u2019s memories. Bernard did so much for others and for the world. He was one of the greatest CEOs, but he was a very close friend of mine, and it's very sad to see him leave us. We have incredible gratitude for Bernard's incredible contributions to the Salesforce Board, as well as to the World Economic Forum, to the healthcare industry, and the Kaiser, we will miss him dearly. ","Now over to Keith.","Keith Block ","Thanks, Mark. Hello, everybody. I want to echo Mark's comments on Bernard. He was an incredible CEO, a great community leader and as Mark said, a close friend of many of us at Salesforce. So we're all going to miss him and our heart certainly go out to his family. ","Now, as you just heard from Mark, we had another great quarter, and really an amazing Dreamforce last month, and is really just a few short weeks ago. You saw that we continue to innovate harnessing the power of cloud and social and mobile and AI and voice and other amazing technologies to fuel customer growth and success.","During the quarter in at Dreamforce Mark and I met with hundreds of CEOs and they clearly understand that the speed of innovation is increasing and that digital transformation is absolutely an imperative. All companies want to become more customer centric, they want to deliver experiences that exceed expectations. And that's why more and more companies across every industry and geography are making major sustained in the Salesforce.","But they're turning to Salesforce for more than just our technology, they're also coming to us as their trusted advisor. And together, we are absolutely reorienting their businesses around the customer. We're working with them on all three pillars of digital transformation, technology, business model, and culture. And we're helping them break down silos, liberate their data and remove legacy obstacles. These three pillars are absolutely essential to achieving a 360 degree view of each customer, every customer and that is the holy grail of digital transformation.","And as you saw this quarter, we continue to build and expand relationships with leading brands across industries, and geographies. We expanded with nationwide. Now historically, most touch points with nationwide customers and wealth managers happen on the phone. Now they're expanding with Salesforce to take advantage of the digital channels to provide a more consistent, personalized experience for customers.","Carmax the largest dealer of pre-owned vehicles in the United States expanded with us in the quarter as well, with Salesforce reps will have a 360 degree view of the customer, whether they're shopping online or in dealerships, and they ensure a seamless buying experience, Excel Energy, now Excel powers millions of homes and businesses across the United States. They expanded their use of Salesforce to deliver a unified experience for customers across all channels.","And then there's Corteva, a global agriculture company focused on seed and crop production. They also expanded with us in the quarter to continue to modernize its business and better serve the farming community.","As we discussed during our Analysts Day at Dreamforce the international expansion is one of our key growth levers and we continue to make investments across the world and see great results. In Q3, we grew 33% in the Americas, 28% in APAC and 42% in EMEA, all in constant currency. And that, of course, is with our recent acquisition of Tableau benefiting year-over-year growth in the Americas and EMEA.","At EMEA expanded with Algae, a global provider of low carbon energy in services headquartered in France, that deliver a 360 degree view of customers\u2019 energy consumption, so they can provide a personalized set of recommendations and define these solutions to reduce carbon footprints.","Siemens, one of the world's great brands, one of the largest industrial manufacturing companies in Europe also expanded with Salesforce in the quarter and we've been a strategic partner to Siemens as the 170 year old company addresses the digital revolution transformation in its industry.","We also expand it with British Airways and food services company Sodexo, in an APAC, there was ANZ Bank, funding some super retail group. They also chose Salesforce in the quarter and we have wins with a Life Solutions Company, Panasonic Corporation, and EON in Japan. ","And finally in Latin America, we had a win with Cera [ph] in Columbia, a leading insurance company. Speaking of the language of our customer that continues to propel our industry momentum and our success, and our customer success in the quarter we introduced two new industry clouds very proud of that innovation, manufacturing cloud and the consumer goods cloud. We also rolled out new insurance capabilities for our financial services cloud one of our most extensible clouds.","We also had a number of strategic wins around the industries in Q3, Ameriprise Financial which manages more than $875 billion worth of assets. They expanded with FSC, financial services cloud, we also formed a new relationship with Farm Credit Services of America, which also chose financial services cloud. In healthcare, Children's Health, one of the largest pediatric providers in the nation chose Salesforce, including health cloud to help them reach more patients and provide even better care experiences.","We continue to see significant opportunity in the public sector. In fact, two of our largest customers are U.S. government agencies. In the quarter we expanded our relationship with the United States Department of Veteran Affairs, enabling the agency to provide the highest level of service to 20 million veterans for a variety of programs. And this isn't just the business opportunity. ","It's a moral obligation to better serve those who have served us. At Dreamforce we heard incredible and powerful and inspirational stories from our veterans and these are people who are transitioning from serving their nation to new careers in the Salesforce ecosystem. I truly believe that all of us should be focusing on hiring veterans.","We also expanded our relationship with the state of Colorado, which is implementing MuleSoft to integrate Seven Health and human services agencies to give country -- excuse me, county workers a single view into key aspects of all these agencies to better engage and serve citizens.","Our partners, they continue to help drive our growth as well. We have 20% more partner certified individuals year-over-year, our ISDN consulting partners have contributed more than 5,000 listings to the app exchange and that is with a 20% increase year-over-year in customer installs.","Turning to integration, MuleSoft has been an incredibly successful acquisition, allowing our customers to unlock and unified data across their enterprises. A strategic to every conversation we've been having and adoption continues to accelerate. I see a very similar opportunity with Tableau. I spent some time with Adam, who is excellent, his management team is excellent and their entire team at the Tableau conference in Dreamforce last month, and I will tell you, I could see the tremendous impact Tableau is having on customers like Nissan and Morgan Stanley and Home Depot, and many, many others.","We are just beginning this integration process, but we have clear synergies from a distribution, product development and cultural standpoint, and our customers are very, very excited and so are away. So in closing, I want to thank our customers, our partners, our employees for their trust and continued support.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mark.","Mark Hawkins","Well, thanks, Keith. We delivered another great quarter in Q3 with strong top line revenue growth on both the reported and organic basis, as well as strong operating cash flow growth.","Here are a few highlights. Total revenue grew 33% in dollars and 34% in constant currency. Total revenue grew 21% in dollars and 22% in constant currency, excluding acquired revenue from Tableau and Salesforce.org. CRPO over 28% in dollars and 28% in constant currency. CRPO over 22% in dollars and 22% in constant currency, excluding the impact of acquired CRPO from Tableau and Salesforce.org.","Let me take you through some of the details in the quarter starting with revenue. Total revenue for the third quarter was $4.513 billion, including approximately $327 million from Tableau, and $80 million from Salesforce.org. Just as we saw in Q1 and Q2, we continue to experience FX headwinds in revenue and in the third quarter of approximately $29 million year-over-year, and approximately $19 million sequentially.","Looking at the drivers of growth by cloud, we continue to see strong subscription and support revenue growth, with year-over-year growth for sales cloud at 15%. Service cloud growth of 24%, marketing and cloud -- commerce cloud growth at 32% and platform and other at 73%. And as a reminder, our acquisition of Tableau added approximately $308 million to platform and other, while MuleSoft grew 77% year-over-year, contributing approximately $185 million to platforms and other.","Lower attrition continue to support our growth in the third quarter with dollar attrition down modestly year-over-year, remaining below 10% and continuing the downward trend we have seen in the last several quarters.","Turning to operating margins, Q3 non-GAAP operating margin was 19.4% up 250 basis points year-over-year. Our Q3 non-GAAP operating margin reflects the timing of Dreamforce in Q3 last year versus Q4 this year, as well as the variations in the timing of sales and marketing other investments in the quarter.","Q3 GAAP loss per share was $0.12 and non-GAAP diluted EPS was $0.75. In Q3 below the line mark-to-market adjustments benefited the GAAP loss per share and the non-GAAP diluted EPS by approximately $0.01. In addition, business performance in the quarter including better than anticipated results from Tableau, as well as better than expected shares outstanding benefit GAAP loss per share and non-GAAP diluted EPS by approximately $0.08.","Now turning to cash flow, third quarter operating cash flow was $298 million, up 108% year-over-year. Operating cash flow in the quarter was driven by one, the timing of collections due to a number of renewals, which occurred earlier than planned. And number two, cash contributions from Tableau in terms of operating cash. On a trailing 12-month basis, we were pleased to deliver operating cash flow growth of approximately 30%.","CapEx for the quarter was 170 million, leading to a free cash flow which is defined as operating cash flow less CapEx of $128 million. On a trailing 12 month basis, we were pleased to deliver free cash flow growth of approximately 31%.","Now remaining performance obligation ended the third quarter at approximately $25.9 billion, up 22% versus last year. Current RPO was approximately $12.8 billion, up 28% year-over-year. On a constant current basis, CRPO growth was up 28% year-over-year, Tableau and Salesforce.org contributed approximately $600 million to this amount.","Now turning to guidance, as we discussed at our Analyst Day on November 20th, we're pleased to be raising our full-year FY20 to $16.99 billion to $17 billion for a full year revenue growth of approximately 28%, excluding top line and revenue contributions from Tableau of approximately $650 million and Salesforce.org of approximately $220 million we expect top line growth of approximately 21% year-over-year. This outlook reflects approximately $160 million in FX headwinds for the full year.","Turning to our outlook for operating margins, we continue to expect non-GAAP operating margins to be approximately 16.6%, down roughly 50 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the impact of acquisitions this year, we continue to expect our FY20 non-GAAP operating margin improvement year-over-year to be more than 150 basis points. ","For EPS, we're updating our FY20 GAAP diluted EPS to $0.44 to $0.45 and our non-GAAP diluted EPS to $2.89 to $2.90. For operating cash flow we are pleased to be raising our FY20 operating cash flow growth guidance to 22% to 23% year-over-year.","For Q4, we expect revenue in the range of $4.743 billion to $4.753 billion or 32% growth year-over-year. This guidance assumes approximately $320 million from Tableau and approximately $80 million Salesforce.org. We also expect Q4 GAAP loss per share of $0.04 to $0.03 and non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.54 to $0.55. We expect CRPO growth of approximately 21% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. This guidance assumes approximately 5 points of growth of recent acquisitions.","Before I close, I'd like to provide some additional insight into our guidance for FY21. As you will have seen in our press release, we are also providing revenue guidance for Q1 of FY21 of $4.800 billion to $4.835 billion, up 28% to 29% year-over-year. We are providing this one-time guidance for Q1 of FY21 given the newly acquired businesses especially Tableau, which have more seasonal revenue profiles in the first quarter.","To wrap-up, we delivered another quarter of strong top line organic and reported revenue growth, with continued organic margin progression and strong cash flow growth. I'd like to thank our employees, customers, partners and shareholders for your continued support, and to wish you a wonderful holiday season and a Happy New Year.","And with that, we will open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Brent Bracelin from Piper Jaffray.","Brent Bracelin","Great and thank you for taking my question. I guess the first one here, you're coming out of hundreds of customer conversations at Dreamforce. I was hoping you could just maybe rank order the top two or three Salesforce products where the customer appetite seems to be the highest to invest next year. Any color you could provide us on where customers are most excited from a product perspective would be very helpful. Thanks.","Marc Benioff","Sure, I'm happy to take that, and then I\u2019d love to pass that on to Bret also. So, number one, I would say that, for me, Dreamforce is an amazing process. It's not the event that is the most impactful for me, I'm sure that is for everybody else, it's the conference that's extremely impactful. For me, it's the process coming up to it. Before Dreamforce, I had the opportunity to get on the road with my team. And we take the keynote out, and we meet with hundreds of customers.","And in my case, I personally have the opportunity to have one-on-one conversations; and in this case I had conversations with almost 100 customers directly about Salesforce, their experience, what they're using in technology, where they're going with their business over and over again. This is the most important thing I do every single year is this deep work. And I have many of my key executives with me.","What I was most focused on this year is of course, being able to present these incredible strategic changes that we've made to our business, especially MuleSoft, especially Tableau, but also to be able to communicate what our core strategy is in terms of Customer 360.","And what I took away with it was that customers today view us at Salesforce as their trusted digital advisors and also look to us to help them have a clear vision of connecting with their customers. That's what Customer 360 is all about. It's really bifurcated. They're looking for a trusted advisor relationship in many times, as Keith mentioned, at the CEO level, but it's also at other parts of the organization, where there's been so much change in the industry they're looking for companies that they can rely on and bet on.","On the second side, it was really Customer 360 that just was so amazing to me, that customers are really implementing Customer 360, but every customer can start at a different place. Sales, service, marketing, you probably noticed that one of the things that we focused on is the new Salesforce 360 Truth profile. This is the Holy Grail for me in computing the single source of truth. When customers saw this, the comments were, I'll paraphrase what a large financial service company in New York said to me. This is for us the single most important thing in our company, we need a single source of truth of our customer information that all of these apps can come together in a powerful way and deliver that single source of Truth. That is what customers were just amazed by. ","And I have to take my hat off to my engineering team, because I didn't think it was really possible to see it all come together. Some of these products are organic, some of them are inorganic, but now that they are integrated and have a clear architecture and that they have the ability for the customer to have extreme value, that was incredible. ","And then I have to add to that, and I think Keith touched on this. I definitely agree Tableau far exceeded my expectations from a customer reception, so many of our customers have Tableau, I could not believe it. And in many cases, because Tableau has been a much smaller company than we are, for example, they don't have a direct relationship with Tableau. ","They don't have an executive relationship. The number of Chief Executive Officers, CIOs, who have directly come to me and my management team and ask us to go wall to wall with Tableau has far exceeded any expectation that we could have had.","That combination of those three things; one, our trusted relationship with the customer; two, Customer 360 resolving in the Truth profile; and three, Tableau as a huge catalyst for growth. That to me is what I tried to then get on stage and present in the keynote. But I can tell you, that after talking to these hundreds of customers, now, both before Dreamforce and after this is a highly differentiated position in the industry. ","No one else is working on this. Nobody has this vision. No one else is trying to help these customers solve this problem. We are in a very unique position with a highly stratified position of customers globally and by industry.","So that's really my takeaway. I hope I answered it for you. I mean, it's been a very powerful several weeks for me, and it's also been an extremely emotional moment because I'm sure you know, the day before the keynote, I was at my -- one of my very closest friends Memorial. And then I came into that keynote, and I just felt all of those customers there and I went, Wow, this is just incredible what was happening. And I really tried to open myself up to really express what I had heard over those preceding few weeks that we are just in an unprecedented moment and in Salesforce\u2019s ability to execute for our customers' needs.","And Bret, do you want to fill in the details? I'd love for you to talk about how you practice. ","Bret Taylor","Yeah. As Marc said, it's really transitioning from being about clouds to being around this Customer 360, the single source of truth. And it's really about not just selling a product to our customers, but really helping them digitally transform their business around their customers. And the single source of truth means that\u2019s easier than ever for our customers to go from being a sales customer to be in sales and service or being a service customer to be in service and commerce and marketing. And you're seeing this I think particularly in the Cyber Monday statistics, which we're really proud of.","I also want to highlight though really our main differentiator, which is Einstein our AI capabilities are coming through stronger than ever. I heard that from every single customer that Marc and I talked to and Keith and I talked to on that road show before Dreamforce. There was 24 billion messages we sent over Cyber Week, there was 32 million orders. They're all being personalized. ","As Marc mentioned, over 10% of those orders are being driven by Einstein recommendation. We're doing over 10 billion predictions per day to personalize every single one of those email engagements that are personal to the person receiving them.","And in the innovation that we highlighted in the keynote, really Einstein came through really strongly across this Customer 360 I think in a really differentiated way. With our Sales Cloud, we introduced Einstein Call Coaching to help telesales teams through the power of Einstein automatically coach every sales representative to become like the best sales representative. In marketing, we introduced interactive email. I think bringing one of the most tried to digital marketing mechanisms, really into the next century with some amazing new capabilities.","Even in our industry's portfolio that consumer goods cloud that Keith talked about really proud of that. Einstein Vision is a key part of it enable every consumer goods company in the retail execution to use Einstein Vision to make sure their products are placed in the right place on the shelves with all the retail partners.","So I really want to highlight I think we have transitioned Einstein from being this vision to every customer adopting it really being a key differentiated part of this Customer 360 vision.","Marc Benioff","Now Bret before your narrative, I just have to ask you the same question that I got asked which was before Dreamforce, you were also on the road with me and you did even -- I think, you did even additional two or three major focus groups. So you've been in front of hundreds of customers as well. What was your biggest surprise talking to them and rolling all of this technology and vision out and demonstration over the last month?","Bret Taylor","I think the biggest prize for me was just how much of this Customer 360 single source of truth resonated. In fact, that phrase single source of truth came from our customers. They were describing their challenges and their digital transformation, as breaking down the silos of their company. Their silos come in the form of technology, their data is siloed across a number of different systems. They're also organizational silos. ","So different departments that previously operated with autonomy now need to come together to produce this single, seamless customer experience. It's why I think our strategy is really focused on that singular vision. We want to bring all that data together technically, with the power of MuleSoft, we want to enable people to see and understand that data with Tableau and we want to enable people to personalize every aspect of their customers experience with the Customer 360 we really feel like all these components are coming together to really match that appetite from our customers.","Marc Benioff","Well, Bret, I haven't seen you work harder than you have in the last month. So I want to thank you for everything that you're doing.","Operator","The next question is from Brent Thrill from Jefferies.","Brent Thrill ","Thanks for Mr. Hawkins. The renewals you mentioned came in earlier than planned. Can you just talk to how given that anomaly that was and to stay intact for that pull forward?","Mark Hawkins","Yes, for sure. Thank you, Brent. And basically what happened is when we have an early renewal from a customer, that's a really good event, as you can imagine, but they were ahead of plan and you can see that when they happen, because our cRPO in Q3 was even higher and so it has an effect. It's kind of a timing effect between Q3 and Q4 for cRPO but we really like what happened. ","It's a good customer sign when people come in there and they do early renewals and so that had a bearing on that and, but we're glad to see it, it shows up in our cash flow and it shows up in cRPO in one quarter and a little bit of time in between the two quarters. But, yes, that's how it works out there Brent. And thank you for the question.","Operator","The next question is from Karl Keirstead from Deutsche Bank.","Karl Keirstead","Hi. Mark, why don't I just pick up on that question a little bit more? So, relative to the 22%, organic cRPO performance you put up in 3Q, which was terrific. The 16% to guide for 4Q feels a little bit light. So you just touched on perhaps one explanation, is it possible to quantify how big that impact was and if there are other factors may be driving your guidance for that 16% number and maybe being a little extra careful given macro or maybe there was some contract duration changes? Thank you.","Mark Hawkins","Yes, sure. Let me just address a couple things here Karl for sure, glad to do it. I think the first thing I would say is the early renewals impacted the growth rate by let's say approximately a point or so, and that type of measurement in terms of quantification, number one. Number two, I want to call out that this is the first time we've actually ever guided cRPO for Q4, it's kind of a new event for us. And we're doing it for the first time by adding in Tableau and so our business compositions also evolving.","And so when we looked at that, and we looked at the fact that when you look at what actually happened in Q3 and the guide in Q4, it works out it just you can see kind of the timing issue if at all we feel like it's a good and reasonable guidance. It's appropriately conservative given that this is the biggest quarter for both new business and renewals. We look forward to putting up the result and talking about the actuals in Q4, but we think that's appropriate.","Operator","Next question is from Sarah Hindlian from Macquarie.","Sarah Hindlian","Okay, thank you. One question for Marc B, Marc, we've noticed over the past 18 months or so maybe a little longer a growing importance of customers\u2019 first party data versus third party data, that maybe in the past that you've been purchasing to augment gaps from platforms that are increasingly being regulated or commoditized. ","So we believe customers are putting their most valuable data into CRM, and we'd like to know how you're going to help customers realize the value of their own first party data. Are we going to be able to track this with multi cloud adoption or Customer 360? And just sort of a little bit of a follow on with this data mosaic you've been building between MuleSoft, Einstein, Customer 360 and Tableau do you feel you have the right data mosaic in place today to help customers realize that value?","Marc Benioff","All right, this is a great question and I'm going to address part of it, but I'm also going to have Bret who is right here address part of it and also Amy Weaver also speak to it, who's our President and our Chief Legal Officer, because she's so involved with so many customer conversations exactly like this.","So, you're right, companies have more customer information than ever before. It's a critical part of their trusted relationship with their customers. Every company is building a one-on-one relationship with their consumer, it has moved from being anonymous to known. This is critical for them to then build a journey that then allows them to take those customers to understand their products or to buy those products or get their service from those products upgrade those products. ","That could even include renewing the customer, retaining the customer or even getting the customer back. All of this is going to be driven much more effectively, much more efficiently and in a much more dynamic way by using a Customer 360 platform like Salesforce.","This is why we built Customer 360 Truth because at that moment, those customers have to be able to rely on a single source of Truth to be able to maximize their relationship with their customers, where regardless of where the customer touch point is. This is a phenomenon that has occurred over the last, I would say, five years and Salesforce is really the company that companies are coming to and saying help us to provide that unique Customer 360.","So Bret, give us your take on exactly where are we in terms of the move from third party to first party data? How customers are implementing this platform, I didn't address the Tableau part of her question. I think that's important.","And then I think we'll have Amy address the components around we've seen here in California, the California Privacy Act, GDPR as well, because these are all related to the importance of having authenticated and basically, data that your customer is authorized to use. Go ahead Bret.","Bret Taylor","Yes, it's a wonderful question. I really agree with the trend that you mentioned. And I would say, Salesforce started as being a system of record for sales. But not every single aspect of CRM has been served equally to help handle this first party customer data. And with the Customer 360 we really feel like we can bring it to every aspect of this Customer 360, from sales to service to commerce to marketing. ","As an example with Customer 360 audiences, which we announced at Dreamforce we're bringing a single source of truth to marketers as well. Those customer data platform that so many marketers are clamoring for, we really recognize that every one of our constituents in every department of every company needs a single source of truth, to do their jobs.","And we really feel like the power is unlocked when that known customer data is accessible across all those different departments. So you create a seamless experience instead of a fragmented experience. And we feel like what I'm hearing from our customers is that's really what differentiates Salesforce. We're not just doing this for one department we're doing this for an entire company. So you can have a single view of all of your known customer data.","And I think one of the interesting things is, by bringing this together, it's enabling our customers to navigate all this amazingly complex regulatory landscape that Amy will speak to you about. But the first step to complying with CCPA, with GDPR is really having a map of where your customer data live. And we feel privileged to partner with our customers to help them navigate this landscape and we feel like one of the best ways to comply with the changing landscape of consumer privacy legislation is to be on the Salesforce Customer 360. And we really think that's one of the value propositions of our platform. And I'll pass it over to Amy to speak more about it.","Amy Weaver","Great. Thanks, Bret. Thanks, Marc. I think it's a really interesting question; we're looking forward to all of this personalization, because consumers\u2019 expectations about privacy and how their data is used is at an all-time high. But same time, consumers have high expectations about personalization. They don't want to see information that's not relevant to them. And they want their experiences with companies that they trust to be seamless. And I think the key is that we really believe that the personalization and building and maintain trust are not mutually exclusive. In fact, they're part of the same virtuous cycle.","The customer success platform is a good example it's designed with features to help our customers build trusted and personalized relationships with their customers and consumers. For example, its built in robust features that help our customers determine how they want their data used and will really had to partner with our customers on their compliance journey as well.","Now, Marc, briefly mentioned, the CCPA, which is the California Consumer Privacy Act, and that's going into effect in January 1st, that is really important step forward in the U.S. privacy landscape. But as I said before, we really believe that all Americans and not just those in California, because there is strong privacy protections, and that is why we are continuing to advocate for comprehensive federal privacy law. Okay, thank you.","Marc Benioff","Yes. And to add to Amy that's also why I've called for a U.S. national privacy law we do not want a patchwork of like what we've seen in California. This personally involved, I think it's extremely important. What has happened in California. I have worked with the team to get that done, as did Amy, but we don't want to patchwork across the United States. We badly need a national privacy law. That's why it's great that we have GDPR, it gives us the ability to help our customers comply. So anyway, thank you, Amy for your leadership. I really appreciate it.","Operator","The next question is from Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley.","Keith Weiss","Excellent. Thank you guys for taking the question. I wanted to touch a little bit on the European business, EMEA up 43% was a really impressive result, given the kind of macro uncertainty and you guys are closing the quarter in October, which you had a lot of Brexit uncertainty. Is it -- just a better environment than we're thinking about over in Europe? Or is the sort of the priority from the CIO just over -- sort of overtaking any uncertainty people have about that spending environment?","Marc Benioff","Well, I think that there's a couple different ways that you have to look at it. Number one is that for all customers, we really believe that digital transformation is the last thing they would stop investing in. I mean, I look at all your own companies look at our company, digital transformation is number one on everybody's list and everybody wants a trusted digital advisor at the beginning and end of every digital transformation is the customer. So that's why we're especially well positioned and why you're seeing the strong results.","On the macro side, I said this also at the Analyst Day, which is, we look strong with the macro environment. And you see what [indiscernible] said at the OECD that global growth is dropping from 4% to 3% this year. That's a 25% reduction year-over-year, of course, that's going to impact different geographic environments differently. ","And for us our job is to manage a full portfolio of countries across the world. We are in the major technology buying centers whether it is in the United States or in Asia or Japan, we have also implemented a new structure in Europe. We had our own Brexit, if you will, you know that we have hired Jayne-Anne Gadhia to be the Chief Executive Officer of Salesforce, UK and Ireland. I believe that's a very critical change for us. And we're continuing to invest aggressively in Europe and in the UK and Ireland through their own transition and transformation, so that we can align with our customers because they all need to invest to be able to take advantage of what's happening in the European environment. ","Let me turn it over to Mark he is going to have more detail. ","Mark Hawkins","No, thank you, Marc. And I agree with your comment that the digital transformation is mission one, and people are asking more and more from us Marc in terms of how we can help them obviously, as described by you and Bret. But the thing that I would say is, I was really pleased to put up the 42% growth rate in aggregate. But even if you're backing out\u2026","Marc Benioff","And did that surprise you, when you look at these numbers, I mean some of them are just incredible.","Mark Hawkins","That number, it was a really big number, Marc. So I clicked in it, and I wanted to share with people even if you back out all the Tableau effect, it's up 31%. So that's the number that really hit me that, we're hitting strong across the different geos in the world, as you said, in Asia Pac and Americas and in Europe, with or without Tableau, and then also the cloud, our growth, what I really like is to see the sales cloud grew 15% is material for me, it catches my eye that when our foundational cloud is growing at that level, I was glad to see that.","Marc Benioff","Incredible growth, especially by cloud, I just went through all the numbers. But let me ask you what is your biggest surprise; A, of the quarter, but the forum Dreamforce we've heard that question a couple of times. And I think you should have the ability to turn it on?","Mark Hawkins","No, I get a chance as you know to spend a lot of time with customers in addition to investors. And I think the thing that I like, is just the constant focus on digital transformation they ask for us to do more is probably the biggest thing that surprised me is that people when they see progress, they want more progress. And Bret, I think your point on single source of truth. And when you spoke in a couple of times people pick up on that. And so I think we do more is the thing that really caught my attention. In terms of the quarter what I liked was the balance across clouds and across geos the most.","Marc Benioff","Thank you.","Operator","Your final question is from Kash Rangan from Bank of America.","Kash Rangan ","Congratulations yet again on a spectacular Dreamforce team. One for Benioff and one for Keith. Marc, when you look at Customer 360 the industry has tried to do this execute this concept going back to the days of Siebel 20 years back or so. How do we think of 360? Does that allow Salesforce to participate in bigger opportunities that can be executed faster or just allow you to stay in the game because it's something that customer sort of expects Salesforce you to proactive versus reactive is, I guess, the spectrum that I'm hoping for you to fill in.","And for Keith, congratulations on MuleSoft, I mean, it's been accelerating in its growth under Salesforce. How would you apply this model to Tableau and what's right way to think about how Tableau could end up being as successful or maybe even more successful of an acquisition as MuleSoft? Thank you so much.","Marc Benioff","So Mark, why don\u2019t you take the first part of that. ","Mark Hawkins","Well, I pursue you\u2019re 100% right, which is that for Customer 360, we really entered a unique position with our customers. Our customers today, they're looking to us as their provider of that platform that's really a critical and unique position. You mentioned Siebel, of course, there's been many companies have been in the CRM market, maybe in service, maybe in sales. I don't think there has ever been a vendor who has tried to execute this vision before and tie it all together with a single source of truth for their customers.","And I was going to ask Keith to take this next. But you mentioned MuleSoft, you mentioned Tableau, this is critical for our customers to move forward. We needed MuleSoft as the next step to be able to help us bring all of this together. Tableau is critical as our customers want to be able to go wall-to-wall to understand all of this data and that has really shifted our position with our customers, and I love for Keith to talk about his experience as well, Keith?","Keith Block","Yes, thanks, Marc. So -- and Kash for the question. I mean, a couple things, just some commentary and Marc\u2019s comment. And of course, I'll try to address the other question. So like in my entire career, the industry has been yearning for the 360 degree view of the of the customer.","And as time has gone on, the companies have recognized the importance of this and the power of it. Few weeks back, I was with a CEO of one of the largest insurance companies in the world and we were having a conversation about how overtime that company has grown up in silos, and Bret alluded to this earlier. There are organizational silos, process silos, builds business model silos, data silos, and those companies grew up with a product out to the market view of the world instead of a customer in view of the world and so every company has to go through that huge digital transformation.","And to be able to make that journey work, they have to embrace the platform, the notion, the promise of the 360 degree view of the customer. I mean, that is an imperative. So, people have been talking about this, it hasn't become a reality. That's why we're excited about it. Because for the very first time in this industry, a company that's us at Salesforce has been able to provide the technology to give the customers what they've been looking for, for so long.","So it's very, very exciting. And when you think about how these companies grow up with data all over the place, and all the inconsistency and no single source of the truth, they just want the truth. Like we all want the truth. Our customers expect the truth, their customers expect the truth. So it is a very, very powerful thing that we're able to provide them with.","As it relates to Tableau we're super excited about Tableau being part of the Salesforce family. And again, if you think about the evolution of where the technology is going, you think about the systems of record. Well, the systems of record are nothing without data. And the systems of engagement are nothing without data. And the systems of intelligence are nothing about data. And the power of visualization with analytics, and intelligence is an incredibly unique opportunity.","And we've run a playbook in all of our acquisitions, which have been very, very successful. Certainly MuleSoft has been the most successful that we've run so far where customers are looking for that holistic view, they're looking for a solution, they're not looking for piece parts. And if you can bring together the best of breed solutions in an integrated way that is what customers want.","So the playbook that we ran with Mule, we will run the exact same playbook. I would echo both Marc and Bret's comments earlier, the enthusiasm for Tableau alone was great. I mean, it was a great company, is a great company, great management team, great community. But when you combine that with all of the promise of the 360 degree view of the customer, and being able to serve that up in an intelligent way, in a visualized way so we can process it and digest it. It's just a very compelling offering. So -- and that's why the combination of Salesforce and Tableau, we think will be very, very successful.","Marc Benioff","Well, thank you, Keith. I just wanted to thank you so much for that. And I completely agree. And I think that you could see it really from the lines at Dreamforce around the Tableau Booze and on analytics calls and other parts of Dreamforce. I know it surprised many of us and many of you to see the huge activity was not a surprise to me. Because of what was happening in the focus groups before Dreamforce.","While we wrap up the call now, I just want to thank all of you for coming to Dreamforce. Today is Giving Tuesday we're coming into the holiday season. I want to especially thank all of our Ohana. Thank all of you for your support. Thank you for everything that you do for us every single day. I also especially want to thank our .org at this time of the year, who has run over 45,000 non-profit and higher education customers for free. We've now done over 4.5 million hours of volunteerism into our local communities and given away more than $310 million in direct grants.","So thank you to all of you. Thank you to our Ohana and we'll look forward to seeing you on the 19th in the New York City World Tour in New York. Thank you very much.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. And have a wonderful day."]}}
