I would like to turn the call over to Bob Marshall, Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer. Mr. Marshall, you may begin your call.","Bob Marshall","Thank you, Ben. Good morning, and welcome to Zimmer Biomet's Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference call. I'm here with our CEO, David Dvorak; our CFO, Dan Florin; and Jim Crines, Retiring Executive Vice President and CFO. This morning we'll be discussing the recently announced closure of our combination with Biomet. We will also briefly cover Zimmer's second quarter 2015 financial results.","Additionally, the company has posted a slide presentation highlighting reported changes and selected combined historical financials on our Investor Relations website.","Before we start, I\u2019d like to remind you that our discussions during this call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by forward-looking statements, due to variety of risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings for a detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties.","Also, the discussion on this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, are included within the earnings release, or found on our website at investor.zimmerbiomet.com.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Jim.","Jim Crines","Thank you, Bob. I will make some brief remarks on second quarter results, and then turn the call over to David and Dan.","With respect to our sales commentary for the Zimmer legacy product categories, I will provide quarter over prior year quarter changes, absent acquired Biomet revenue and adjusted to reflect fewer selling days for certain international markets in the current year quarter. Pro forma comparisons to the prior year quarter can be found on the Investor Relations section of our corporate website.","Turning now to our results. Zimmer experienced a price decline of 2% in the quarter, which is consistent with our expectations coming into the year. Total revenues for the second quarter were $1.168 billion, a 5.7% constant currency increase, compared to the second quarter of 2014.","Net currency impact for the quarter decreased revenues by 7% or $83 million. Acquired revenue from the Biomet transaction contributed 5% or $60 million in the quarter. Therefore Zimmer standalone sales increased 0.7% or 1.2% on a like-billing day basis in the quarter.","During the quarter, excluding acquired revenue and on a billing day adjusted basis, the company grew Knees at 2.7%; Hips and Extremities each decreased 0.6%; Dental revenues grew 0.7%; Trauma as well as Surgical and other sales were flat; and Spine sales increased 5%.","Geographic sales also absent acquired Biomet revenue and on a billing day adjusted basis were as follows. Americas, plus 0.5%; Europe, Middle East and Africa grew 1% and Asia-Pacific increased 3.7%.","Our adjusted gross profit margin was 76.4% for the quarter. A favorable geographic segment mix of revenues, together with foreign currency hedge gains and favorable year-over-year comparisons with regard to manufacturing variances, were partially offset by the impact of negative price.","The company's R&D expense compared to the prior year increased 7.1% or $3.4 million on a reported basis to 4.4% of net sales. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $445.1 million in the second quarter, and at 38.1% of sales were 120 basis points above the prior year.","During the quarter, the company reported certain non-recurring pre-tax expenses, including $465 million of charges relating to the Biomet merger and $90 million of special items and certain claims.","Additionally, pre-tax amortization expense in the quarter was $34.9 million. Adjusted second quarter 2015 figures in the earnings release exclude the impact of these charges. Adjusted operating profit in the quarter amounted to $395.3 million. At 33.8%, our adjusted operating profit-to-sales ratio was 160 basis points higher than the prior year second quarter. This marks the eighth quarter in a row with operating margin improvement.","Adjusted net interest expense for the quarter amounted to $18.7 million, which was unfavorable when compared to the prior year quarter due to the inclusion of acquisition-related debt and adjusted earnings, following the Biomet merger. Our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 25.9% and was 20 basis points favorable, when compared to prior year.","Adjusted net earnings were $278.7 million for the second quarter, an increase of 2.8% compared to the prior year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 0.6% to $1.59 on a 175.6 million average outstanding diluted shares.","The company recorded a loss per share of $0.91 on a GAAP or reported-basis for the quarter. The loss is due principally to expenses incurred during the quarter in connection with the Biomet merger. This compares to the prior year second quarter reported EPS of $1.03.","Operating cash flow for the quarter amounted to $186.8 million, a decrease of 26.5% from $254.1 million in the second quarter of 2014. Cash outflows in the second quarter related to the merger transaction amounted to $108 million. Depreciation and amortization expense for the second quarter amounted to $99.6 million.","Free cash flow in the second quarter was $114.8 million; $44.7 million lower than the second quarter of 2014. We define free cash flow as operating cash flow less cash outlays for instruments and property, plant and equipments. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $72 million, including $41.6 million for instruments and $30.4 million for property, plant and equipment.","As expected, as of June 30, our gross debt was $12.05 billion or 4.1x our trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA and our net leverage ratio including cash on hand and short-term investments was 3.5x adjusted trailing 12-month EBITDA.","As this is my final investor call, I just want to say that it has been a pleasure to work with all of you, and be part of the dedicated and highly talented team of people here at the company for the last 15 years. As I step out of this role, I look forward with excitement at the value creation opportunities this new team will be pursuing with the same tenacity that drove past accomplishments at both companies.","David, I'll now turn the call over to you.","David Dvorak","Well, thanks for your many contributions to the company over the years, Jim. This morning, I'll focus my comments on some of the key value creation opportunities presented by our landmark combination with Biomet.","In short, the synergies inherent in this merger will accelerate the execution of our primary commercial and innovation growth strategies, while at the same time enabling the company to generate extremely attractive financial results.","By virtue of possessing a significantly broadened and truly comprehensive portfolio of innovative musculoskeletal solutions, Zimmer Biomet is in an excellent position to accelerate top line growth over the course of our global integration, principally through a host of cross selling opportunities between our two legacy portfolios. Our integration teams have already achieved key milestones in support of these commercial opportunities, including the implementation of critical sales infrastructure and the completion of initial product trainings, which have supported our ability to begin deploying specialized commercial teams in key product categories and geographies.","We expect to substantially complete our commercial integration by the end of this year, including the appointment of just over 2,000 specialized sales representatives concentrating in non-large joint sales opportunities, a number that we aim to further expand significantly throughout this decade.","Our vision is to build the most highly specialized and effective musculoskeletal commercial team in the industry. Consistent with that goal, we selected sales leaders with proven track records and designed compensation plans that reward growth. We expect to begin realizing the benefits of our integrated sales channel, as well as these commercial opportunities in the form of sequentially accelerating revenue growth, as we exit 2015 and progress through 2016.","As a leader in the nearly $50 billion musculoskeletal industry, Zimmer Biomet's portfolio of solutions offers unparalleled anatomical coverage, as well as reach across the full continuum of care from minimally-invasive and biologic joint preservation technologies, to partial, total, revision and salvage arthroplasty systems.","I\u2019d like to take this opportunity to highlight a number of the complementary portfolio offerings that our sales organization will be aggressively leveraging. Our market-leading Knee business continues to be led by Persona, the personalized knee system, and our clinically trusted Vanguard and NexGen knee systems. In addition, our impressive knee lineup includes the Vanguard Select and Vanguard 360 revision system.","Finally, our portfolio is further differentiated by our bicruciate preserving arthroplasty options, including the clinically-proven Oxford Partial Knee, and our new Vanguard XP Total Knee System.","In Hips, our offerings address the full-range of patient anatomy and surgical philosophies. Our Taperloc Complete Microplasty stem and Avenir Hip System for example, meet the rising demand for minimally invasive techniques that incorporate the anterior supine surgical approach.","Our portfolio is also complemented by the Arcos Femoral Revision System, and our multi-bearing premium cup options featuring the G7 and Continuum Acetabular Systems.","Within our newly formed SET product category, we see our Sports Medicine business as a particularly attractive source of quick wins across our sales channel. Joining our early intervention Gel-One and Subchondroplasty treatments, the JuggerKnot Soft Anchor System marks our expansion into this fast growing market.","We're bullish on the union of our complementary extremities portfolios, highlighted by the cross-selling opportunities represented by the comprehensive Total Shoulder System, which commands a wide clinical audience in a rapidly growing market and the Nexel Total Elbow.","Our growth prospects in the Foot and Ankle category are also extremely promising, including the Trabecular Metal Total Ankle, the Phoenix Ankle Arthrodesis Nail system, and the A.L.P.S. Total Foot Plating System. Backed by a broad portfolio of solutions, we'll bring heightened focus to this attractive market.","For our focused trauma sales teams, immediate opportunities include the ePAK Single-Use Delivery System, featuring the DVR Crosslock Distal Radius Plate, as well as the Cable-Ready Cable Grip System.","Our Surgical business also stands to benefit from the enhanced focus and sales force specialization we're leveraging to drive our broadened clinical portfolio. Zimmer Biomet also positions a diversified dental business offering critical scale to address the faster growing value-market segment with our line of PI branded offerings, in addition to our range of Encode custom abutments and a market-leading regenerative portfolio.","Turning to our Spine category. As a combined company, we're building on a successful cadence of commercial releases from 2014. This global business offers a differentiated pipeline and a comprehensive portfolio that address minimally invasive procedures with our PathFinder NXT Pedicle Screw System, as well as lateral access surgeries with the Timberline Lateral Fusion System.","Finally, we're very excited about our innovative and rapidly expanding craniomaxillofacial and thoracic businesses, as well as our opportunities to benefit from sales channel and expertise within the bone healing business. In support of our longer term growth targets, we\u2019ll use our scale to enhance the differentiation of our innovation pipeline and to accelerate the pace of our future commercial introductions.","With research and development resources that are nearly 80% greater than our standalone capability, we will aggressively pursue innovations to address unmet needs and create new market adjacencies to expand our leadership in musculoskeletal healthcare.","With that, I'll turn it over to Dan, who will this continue this discussion in greater detail, as well as review our guidance. Dan?","Dan Florin","Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone. It's a pleasure to be here with you today. I'm looking forward to serving our new company in the role of Chief Financial Officer and building upon the successes achieved by my predecessor, Jim Crines. First of all, I want to thank Jim for all of his support during this transition period, and I wish him the very best in his future endeavors.","Today, I'm going to walk you through a brief summary of the synergies and accretions associated with our merger, followed by my comments on the prevailing market and pricing conditions and our 2015 guidance.","As incoming CFO, I'm fully committed to maintaining the value creation principles, which have made Zimmer and Biomet leaders in musculoskeletal healthcare and which have formed the pillars to this deal namely, growth through innovation and outstanding service, operational excellence and prudent capital deployment.","Accelerating our top line growth, as David has outlined, in combination with execution on our cost synergies and operational excellence plans will result in leveraged earnings growth and increase cash flows to both reinvest in growth initiatives and return capital to stockholders.","Our fully staffed integration management teams are now hard at work, driving a disciplined global plan encompassing over 400 distinct projects across our commercial, functional and business units, with more than 7,000 relevant process milestones. Our new management team has significant merger integration experience, and we are leveraging many of the operating disciplines, playbooks and governance structures from Zimmer's successful acquisition of Centerpulse.","Turning now to deal synergies. We continue to project net annual pre-tax operating earnings synergies of $135 million in the first year and $350 million by year three, post close. Recall that these net synergies are comprised of cost savings, somewhat offset by the EBIT impact of the product line divestitures and estimated revenue dis-synergies net of cross-selling benefits.","We expect to realize the bulk of the cost synergies through the elimination of SG&A redundancies, as well as strategic sourcing and shared services initiatives, optimization of our manufacturing and distribution network and deployment of lean principles across the enterprise. Initial savings will be heavily weighted to the SG&A line on the P&L.","We continue to expect adjusted earnings per share accretion in the range of $0.95 to $1.05 over the first 12 months post-closing, with approximately one-third of this number to be realized in 2015.","As Bob noted at the beginning of the call, we have posted a presentation on our Investor Relations website that provides an explanation of our reporting changes, as well as selected combined pro forma historical sales results and financials. Within those schedules, we\u2019ve provided a view of the past six quarters of constant currency revenue growth, based on our new product categories and geographic segments, which will be utilized beginning with our third quarter 2015 results.","We've also included a reconciliation of Zimmer Biomet combined net sales to combined net sales to divestitures that were completed in order to finalize our merger.","Lastly, we\u2019ve provided a combined historical earnings statement from net sales to adjusted EBIT, including the adjusted margin analysis through the first quarter of 2015. We hope you find the pro forma information useful for your modeling.","As you update your models, you'll note that there is a new sales category called SET, comprised of Surgical, Sports Medicine, Extremities, Foot & Ankle and Trauma with joint preservation technologies included in Sports Medicine.","This product category comprises approximately $12 billion of the nearly $50 billion musculoskeletal market and is estimated to grow in the mid-single-digit range over the next few years.","With the combination, the SET category now represents approximately 20% of our revenue base, and we're investing in growth drivers such as specialized sales forces and innovative products that compete aggressively in this space.","As you'll see in the pro forma revenue schedules, for the first three quarters of 2014, Zimmer Biomet's combined quarterly revenue growth within the 3% to nearly 5% range, which we believe reflects at-or-above market performance during this period.","Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2014 and continuing into 2015, combined growth rates began to decelerate to the 2% to 3% range, and eventually flat performance in Q2. We believe this reflects an absence of investment and offensive measures by our sales channels during the pendency period of the merger closing.","With the merger now closed and our channel integration plans being executed, coupled with the strong portfolio and cross-sell opportunities that David outlined, we are optimistic that we will get back to at-or-above market growth rates as we progress through 2016.","Turning to market and pricing conditions. We have seen ongoing but stable price pressure for the last several quarters. We believe the growth outlook for the global Knee and Hip markets will remain consistent throughout 2015 in the low-single-digit range. Procedural demand in our view, continues to be driven primarily by favorable demographics and growing utilization of musculoskeletal healthcare in emerging markets and under-penetrated developed markets.","Moving now to our guidance. We are reaffirming our full-year 2015 pro forma revenue guidance of a constant currency growth rate of between 1.5% and 2%. As noted, the pro forma adjustments reflect the inclusion of Biomet revenues and the removal of revenue from the divested product lines for the comparable post-merger closing period in 2014. The impact from currency for the full-year is projected to decrease revenues by approximately 6%. Therefore reported revenue should be in a range of minus 4% to minus 4.5%, which in dollar terms is between $6.015 billion and $6.05 billion.","We are also updating our full-year 2015 adjusted diluted earnings per share to be in a range of $6.65 to $6.80. Previously we had estimated full-year adjusted diluted earnings per share to be in a range of $6.60 and $6.80.","It is important to note that the fully diluted average share count that should be used for the full-year diluted EPS calculation is estimated at 190.5 million shares, which includes shares issued to complete the transaction and does not assume any share repurchases.","I'll now provide some details on guidance for the second half of 2015. We expect constant currency pro forma revenue growth on a day-rate basis to be between 1% and 2%.","On an adjusted basis for the second half of 2015, we expect our gross margin to be in the range of 75% to 75.5%. We intend for our research and development expense to be in a range of 4.5% to 5% of sales. SG&A expense should be in a range of 38.5% to 39%. And adjusted net interest expense is expected to be $185 million.","The adjusted effective tax rate is estimated to be between 26.5% and 27%. The fully diluted share count for the second half is approximately 206.5 million shares. Adjusted diluted earnings per share would be in a range of $3.45 and $3.60. Combining this range with the first half performance and applying the full-year diluted share-count of 190.5 million shares, you arrive at our full-year guidance of $6.65 to $6.80.","For modeling purposes, please remember to reflect the expense to sales ratios and corresponding margins to account for the seasonality that occurs between the third and fourth quarters. Third quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share are projected to be in a range of $1.52 and $1.57.","Finally, I want to provide a few comments on full-year cash flow. Cash flow from operations for the year is expected to be between $650 million and $700 million, which includes $430 million of costs related to the merger transaction and approximately $250 million of costs to realized synergies. We expect to spend approximately $500 million on instruments and property, plant and equipment in 2015, inclusive of approximately $60 million of integration-related items.","Free cash flow, which we define as operating cash flow less cash outlays for instruments and PP&E is estimated to be between $150 million and $200 million.","Please note that our guidance does not include any impact from potential business development activities or other unforeseen events.","David, I'll now turn the call back over to you.","David Dvorak","Thanks Dan. Zimmer Biomet now stands as one global leader. And with our increased scale in musculoskeletal diversification, we're able to anticipate and address the needs of the evolving global healthcare landscape. Our strategic vision continues to focus on delivering a compelling value proposition for patients, healthcare providers and our stockholders.","And now, I'd like to ask Vince to begin the Q&A portion of our call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Analysts are allowed to ask one question and one follow-up question. One moment please for our first question. And our first question is from the line of Joanne Wuensch with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Joanne Wuensch","Thank you very much for taking my question. Since you're in the early stages of the integration, could you please walk us through a little bit of what you're experiencing that will help you or give you confidence that your growth rate will reaccelerate as we enter 2016?","David Dvorak","Sure, Joanne. I think that the advantage that we\u2019ve had of the long pendency period was we were able to develop extremely detailed methodical plans. And so when day one rolled around, our teams were extraordinarily well prepared, and that includes the plans that Dan outlined with respect to the different work streams and milestones that we're tracking. So we have a lot of details and capability to track and respond to anything that was not embedded in the plans. But with respect to the acceleration opportunities, the cross-sell is one of our primary areas of focus, and that opportunity starts with putting the right sales talent in place.","I would tell you that that was a very pleasant surprise as we went through the experiencing of drawing out the best from both organizations. We have extraordinarily talented commercial leaders that had been appointed. And those individuals are putting their management teams and then sales rep appointments together. All of that work is expected to be substantially complete by the end of this year, and we're well on our way.","Also we\u2019ve been able to put in place all of the infrastructure necessary to facilitate the cross-sell opportunities. We had some opportunities to pre-build inventory in key product categories, to pre-train sales reps in key product categories, and so this offense is starting to ramp up. Clearly, that takes some time for that pipeline to rebuild and the momentum will be restored. And we're expecting to see terrific progress through the balance of the year that's going to set us up nicely for 2016 to get after those opportunities.","Joanne Wuensch","And as my follow-up before I get to that, first I wanted to say thank you, Jim. It's been a pleasure to work with you. But the second question is, your guidance you called out, it does not include any potential business development. Should we think of you now that the deal has closed, as still looking or in a pause mode until you fully incorporate it? Thank you.","Jim Crines","Let me just say thanks, Joanne. As I said, I very much appreciate working with you and the rest of the analyst community, but I'll let Dan respond to the question on capital deployment.","Dan Florin","Great. Thanks Joanne for the question. Certainly we continued to be very active evaluating business development activities. We have a terrific business development organization, always looking for opportunities to drive growth. And we feel having leverage of about 4x that Jim described is not an impediment to that. We'll continue to be disciplined in terms of capital allocation. Zimmer has an excellent track record of being disciplined, and will continue to do so as we progress.","But we'll continue to look for tuck-in opportunities, M& A activities. We believe strongly the cash flow generation of the combined enterprise, provides us the opportunity to do that, while we look to delever the balance sheet, grow EBITDA and reinvest in growth initiatives organically as well.","Joanne Wuensch","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch.","Bob Hopkins","Thanks, and good morning, and also good luck to Jim in your future endeavors. So thanks for taking the questions. I've got just two. I want to focus on revenues. Obviously one of the reasons why the stock has lagged a little bit is concern about revenue growth. So my first question is, can you talk a little bit about why you had to lower revenue growth guidance at the time of the deal close? And do you think that the level of dis-synergies that you originally thought about and talked about might now be higher than you originally thought? That's my first question. Thank you.","David Dvorak","Sure. Bob, I think that it was clear that the pendency period was more extended than we originally anticipated. And naturally with the lack of clarity during that prolonged period of 14 months, you're going to lose some of that offensive momentum. All of that is very addressable. And the plans that we have in place with the appointments of the leadership, as I said, the infrastructural implementation and cascading that through the field organization puts us in a great place to restore that momentum as we work through the balance of the year.","So I think it's more just the extended pendency period rather than anything at all fundamental changing. That's very temporary in the scheme of the underlying strategy for this combination, and we're quite confident that that's going to get addressed, so nothing fundamental whatsoever has changed by virtue of that.","Bob Hopkins","So your thoughts on dis-synergies are not different than they were originally?","David Dvorak","Not at all.","Bob Hopkins","Okay. And then secondly, I just wanted to ask you to try to be very clear. I want to be clear about what you\u2019re saying about 2016. So I think you said that you expect accelerating growth over the course of the year, but when do you think you can get back to market levels of revenue growth? And what specifically will drive the improved growth outlook as you look into 2016, especially when you consider things like U.S, knees right now still struggling in the negative 3% to 4% territories? I just want to be as specific as we can about what the drivers are in 2016 that will improve growth?","David Dvorak","Well, just to clarify, to start with Knees are at-or-slightly above market on the legacy Zimmer side. I think that holds true for the legacy Biomet side also. The Hip category requires some attention, but I think with the complementary aspects of the portfolios, we\u2019re going to be able to bring that attention to it and put that on a better course, Bob. But if you think about the dynamics that are going to go into what we generate by way of top line growth, you have the circumstances that you described coming into the closing, the opportunities that I'm outlining this morning to reaccelerate the top line growth and these are businesses that going back just to the point of announcement through the majority of 2014 together were generating 3% to 5% growth. And so that quite clearly is an opportunity for these businesses.","And that's on a standalone basis. So you put these portfolios together, pick the best of the best in sales leaders, train up the sales reps for those opportunities, leverage the relationships that exist at the surgeon level for cross-selling and that's going to be extraordinarily powerful. And that's not a temporary synergy by virtue of the combination. That's going to be a sustainable synergy.","And we'll talk a little bit more I suspect, before we're done with the Q&A about the product portfolio and the go-forward pipeline opportunities. So if you look at the restoration of that momentum, as I said, speed is important but getting it right in the field integration, the plans that we have allow us to do both.","By the end of this year, we're going to have the right sales team set up and at a full clip going into 2016. And so then what has to happen is that momentum has to be restored and the cross-sell opportunities have to be ramping up to a point where they're offsetting any of the natural fallout as far as dis-synergies go on the top line. That's going to occur sequentially. We\u2019re going to see improvement throughout 2016.","And so the comment that I would make to you by a way of answer is, tough at this point to pinpoint the particular month, but you\u2019re going to see sequential improvement throughout 2016. And we're confident that we're going to get back to or even above market growth rates as the year progresses.","Bob Hopkins","Great. Thank you.","David Dvorak","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Mike Weinstein","Good morning, and thanks for taking the question guys. And Jim, obviously we've known each other a long time, so it's been fantastic working with you. I do want to start just on the combination of the sales organizations. And David, we had talked prior to the close about getting some better visibility on your plans for combining the distributors and sales reps and what that might start to look like. So can you, A, start to maybe talk a bit about that today in terms of where you are in that process? And B, can you talk about retention. Have you lost any notable distributors in the U.S. or what your rep retention looks like? And then C, what you're doing financially to try and get people to stay? Thanks.","David Dvorak","Sure, Mike. To start with an overview of the structure, this is an organization that will be led by the best of the best. If one looks at the legacy leaders across the globe, I think a lot of times these discussions end up becoming focused immediately on United States market, but across the globe, we're selecting the best territory managers, the best country managers, the best sales managers supporting those level leaders.","And then as we said from the beginning retaining the sales rep positions. This is a really powerful organization in the thousands of numbers, and numbers at the sales rep level and it provides us with an extraordinary opportunity to develop more specialized sales forces in the non-large joint areas, which is something that we'll begin implementing through this integration process and continue to grow in the years to come. So we\u2019re well on our way, Mike.","Those leadership positions obviously at the executive level and the next couple of levels down within the organization were all appointed pre-close and well before pre-close. So they were able to put their plans together next level down. And all of those execution plans are cascading down to the rep level as we speak. As I said, for the amount of work to be done and the size of that channel to do that in the coming several months and be locked down going in 2016 is a big task, but it's the right priority for the organization.","And with those appointments is going to come certainty and clarity, so that people are going to be very offensive minded and began to start to take advantage of the cross-sell opportunities that exists, both at the product and at the surgeon level.","The compensation opportunities are terrific. There isn't a better bag in the industry. And irrespective of product category area of focus, these sales reps are going to have wonderful opportunities, not only with the product category bag that exists at this point, but the pipeline that exists, and then the opportunities for greater differentiation on the R&D side, because the scale that we have across the entire portfolio. So people are excited about it. The tone is very positive.","I would also tell you that these are leaders that have, in many cases, 10, 20, 30 years of experience. So these transitions are not new to them. They have a lot of experience in just managing the channel.","I'd also tell you, Mike, that when you look at these leaders that are chosen on average in the United States for example, the selected leaders have a compounded annual growth rate that's hundreds of basis points above those that are not selected at that level of the organization. And so this is the best of the best. They know how to put these organizations together and run that offense, and we're going to be hitting our stride in short order.","Mike Weinstein","So let me circle back to David. So can you just tell us the picture you're setting first off, is one where you\u2019re consolidating sales management and then leaving the reps and distributors in place. Can you talk about retention at this point and what that looks like, and what you expect that to look like, and how long you're financial incentivizing people to stick around, so we can get a sense of kind of what the window of risk looks like?","David Dvorak","Yes, I think that the retention has been excellent. These attrition rates have been quite consistent with historic levels. It may tick up single-digit percentage points as we go through this process, and this is what we would expect to continue to see, but I don't it going beyond that. And the leadership appointments down to the management level in the field will be taking place very early on, and in many instances, have already been accomplished in different territories and will be done at the sales rep level as these months progress. So I don't anticipate any significant uptick in attrition rates, Mike.","Mike Weinstein","Okay. Thank you, David. I'll let some others jump in.","David Dvorak","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Taylor with Barclays Capital. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, this is actually Young Li [ph] in for Matt Taylor. Thanks for taking our questions. The first question is, I guess, actually maybe on M&A. It's a question on robotics.","So one of your competitors reported pretty good robot sales this quarter and there is interest in medical robots among other companies in med tech. Just wondering if you can talk about your level of interest in this area?","David Dvorak","Well, we're very interested in the underlying premise to those technologies and we\u2019ve been added for a long time with both internal\/external development efforts in that regard.","Our portfolio of patient-specific instruments including legacy Biomet Signature technology, preoperative planning systems and templating systems, our iASSIST technology, our eLIBRA technology are all consistent with the goal of making these procedures as reproducible and heightening the outcomes in a very cost effective way. That's been the mission that we've been on for many years and we've made terrific progress and feel good about where our programs are going to take us in that regard.","To the extent that technologies can achieve those same objectives, preferably that are smaller, faster, cheaper, preferably ones that integrate into the natural workflow for the surgeon and drive OR efficiencies as opposed to affecting some of those key areas in a negative way, then we'd be interested in any other technologies. And so, we're going to continue to be very open-minded, but we like the portfolio of technologies that we've been developing, and what we have underway to continue to progress in that area.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, thanks. And regarding the CMS proposal to bundle hip and knee reimbursements, it's been talked about a lot before, but can you just remind us what your expectations are in terms of impact on price and if you're working with payors to maybe mitigate some of that impact?","David Dvorak","I don't see that is having any significant impact on price. I think that the pricing environment that we\u2019ve been operating in has all of the drivers embedded in it that are the underlying reasons for that proposal. I think that the proposal in many ways, as well as the delivery modifications that are embedded within the ACA in general are consistent with what we all have to be mindful of.","Again, we're trying to develop deeper partnerships with our customers, the surgeons and providers to bring about a better patient outcome in a cost efficient way, and that more expansive end-to-end definition that's embedded within that proposal is the right concept. There are elements of that proposal that should be modified.","We ought to make sure that we're not stinting healthcare, especially when the delivery of healthcare and access, especially when you look at the measurement period on the back end of 90 days. These are procedures that are often times appropriately measured in years as far as success rates. And so we should be careful about how we set those proof [ph] programs up, but the concept of ensuring that the cure is coordinated in a patient-centric way and is mindful of the overall cost is an appropriate one from our perspectives.","The innovations that we have underway and the opportunities that we have with our field service organizations to contribute positively to that endeavor are immense, and it's a big part of our strategy going forward. So I think it's in alignment with how we ought to be thinking about improving patient care in general, and I don't see it having any impact of significance on the pricing environment","Unidentified Analyst","Very great. That's very helpful. Thank you.","David Dvorak","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","David Lewis","Good morning. Just one historical question for Dave or Dan. I guess, the stated objective when you did the deal for the balance sheet was debt repayment, and now we have a situation where what I'm hearing is your conviction in long-term deal accretion is actually higher post-initial announcement. Dave, you mentioned this morning that the dis-synergy investments were unchanged, yet obviously as you know, the stock is lower. So I guess the question is for Dan or for David. Why does aggressive share repurchase now not make more sense than aggressive debt repayment?","Dan Florin","David, this is Dan. As we progress through the rest of 2015 and continue to gain traction on integration and confidence in the execution of that integration, which we do have full confidence in, we'll continue to evaluate capital deployment. So certainly to drive the integration and the synergies, we need to spend some cash to do that. There is a nice return on that investment.","As per my earlier comments, you look back at a track record of Zimmer in terms of capital allocation. It's a terrific track record, returning nearly 70% of free cash flow to stockholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases.","So going forward, we're focused on executing the synergy program, accelerating the top line growth, driving improvements in our free cash flow yields back to historical levels. We see that type of opportunity.","With that enhanced cash flow generation, we'll continue to look at what makes sense on a go-forward basis. So we'll go through a detailed operating plan for 2016, look at cash needs and weigh those trade-offs. So it's certainly something that we'll continue to evaluate. We'll also over time look at a deliberate attempt to delever the balance sheet.","We have been able through this inter-company loan transaction that the tax team executed has opened up that pipeline to OUS cash, so that's been a critical initiative that's behind us. The access to that cash begins late this year. So at that point in time, we'll have cash available to make those decisions.","And then out over time, as we build free cash flow, have access to that OUS cash, I think that gives us a lot of flexibility to look at both organic growth capital, if you will, external opportunities and then return of capital to stockholders.","David Lewis","Okay. That's very helpful, Dan. I guess the other second question I have is just revenue trend as you described have obviously lagged, but margins have trended much better. So where are you seeing primary success that's driving that underlying performance? And as you go through the integration, how confident are you that we see a continuation of these up margin trends? Thank you.","Dan Florin","Sure. Certainly as we\u2019ve progressed through the integration plans and we start to realize those synergies, keep in mind there will be a ramp up of those synergies over time. As you see in our second quarter performance, the gross margin rate is benefiting from the gains on the foreign exchange contracts. And keep in mind that as we bring Biomet into the fold and start layering the Biomet cash flows into the Zimmer hedging program, that will take time to gain traction.","So in the back half of 2015, while the hedge contracts will continue to contribute in a relatively consistent basis from a dollar standpoint as we bring the Biomet revenues into that as a percentage of sales, the contribution of the FX gains will be lower. So that does put some pressure, if you will, on the second half gross margin rate relative to the first half and that's embedded in the guidance that I just provided.","But the underlying ability to drive operating margin improvement is real by virtue of the synergy plans that we have. And importantly, the mix benefits of premium technologies on the Biomet side as we continue to drive growth there. So the cross-sell opportunities - a number of those cross-sell opportunities are focused in the premium technologies that the Biomet portfolio brings to bear day one.","David Lewis","Thank you very much.","Dan Florin","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.","Craig Bijou","Hi guys, it's actually Craig on for Larry. Thanks for taking the questions. I have a couple of questions on EPS, and just starting with 2016 EPS. I think on the last call, you mentioned that we could see 15% to 20% growth on 2015 EPS. So firstly, are you still comfortable with that range? And second, is the accelerating top line growth, could that potentially lead to upside to 2016 EPS growth?","Dan Florin","Craig, this is Dan. Certainly based upon everything that I\u2019ve seen and analyzed to-date, including the details of our synergy and integration program, I am confident that we can deliver earnings per share within that range, a range of $6.65 to $6.80. I'm confident in that regard.","With respect to the top line, the opportunities that David has outlined, in terms of the acceleration of growth through 2016, is embedded within that assumption. So yes, at this point in time, we\u2019re confident in the ability to deliver that EPS growth in 2016.","Craig Bijou","Okay, thanks. And then just as a quick follow-up. When you think about EPS growth beyond 2016, I know in the last call, I think Jim mentioned that the 8% to 10% management goal for EPS growth. And I wanted to ask looking out in 2017, 2018 are the synergy - I guess, are the synergies necessary to hit that 8% to 10% growth, or could the synergies from the deal be incremental to the 8% to 10%?","Dan Florin","Sure. So later this year - first with respect to 2016, we'll be providing official guidance in January for 2016. So our stated goal of confidence in that EPS growth is what we're shooting for, our operating plan will be geared towards the achievement of that. And then in January, we'll give you the official guidance for 2006 team. At the same time, in the upcoming months, the new management team will be going through the strategic planning process looking out beyond 2016.","And certainly as we think about EPS opportunity at the combined enterprise of the 8% to 10% type range, we feel confident based on what we know right now of the combined portfolio that we can deliver in that range. And as we go through the strategic planning process, we'll look for opportunities to exceed that.","But at this point in time, I'd say we're comfortable in that range. And as we talked about 2016 guidance in January, we can give you an update on our thinking longer term.","Craig Bijou","Great. Thanks for taking the questions.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Roman with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","David Roman","Thank you, and good morning, everybody. I know there aren\u2019t a lot of questions on the deal, so I was hoping to ask a couple of questions on the underlying businesses. Maybe you could, David or Dan, give us a little bit more color on what's going on in both the Trauma and Dental businesses? And maybe Trauma and Extremities more specifically, given that those are end-markets that look to be growing quite a bit faster than the growth you're generating right now, and any factors that maybe influencing the trends in your business and any product launches that could be drivers of an uptick on a go-forward basis?","David Dvorak","Sure. I think that the Trauma business - I think we have significant opportunities in that regard, David. When you look at the complementary aspects of that portfolio, we immediately gravitate towards a couple of the key areas. The Distal Radius product category is one that we have not had much of a presence in on the Zimmer side historically. The product offering is first rate on the Biomet side. The Cable-Ready System is strong on the Zimmer side. That's a big cross-sell opportunity into that pipeline.","Also, sales force specialization is going to be meaningful. We've got a channel that historically has been more oriented toward the large joint side of the business and we're going to be breaking out sales rep specialization to bring greater emphasis. So you've got more emphasis at the sales rep level, a more comprehensive portfolio that puts us in a position to compete very effectively in level-1 level trauma centers, where we haven't had as much of a presence [Technical Difficulty], and that's going to add up to a big opportunity to expand our market share.","So that's a good example of what this deal brings into these smaller business categories for us where we had subscale businesses, and now are sort of in a sweet spot where we have critical mass, a broad portfolio are in a very competitive position and are very confident that we're going to be in a share gain mode.","And I would say the same thing about Dental. You're essentially doubling the size of those product categories by virtue of this combination. And so our capability to do well at the premium, as well as the value level within the dental market across the globe is greatly enhanced by this combination. And then you add some other areas including the legacy Zimmer dental regenerative portfolio, which is an industry-leading portfolio that the legacy Biomet reps are going to be able to sell into.","So great opportunities in both, and I think you're going to start to see some of the benefits as we progress through 2016 in those categories.","David Roman","That's helpful, thank you. Then maybe a follow-up on one of your prepared comments. I believe in your prepared remarks you said that the opportunity to sort of invest in innovation would increase by about 70%. That sounds like just adding the Biomet R&D to the existing base Zimmer R&D, but over time, are there opportunities to see leverage on that line given that there might be some duplicative efforts within the two companies and sort of quote R&D synergies and are those included at all in the $350 million number?","Dan Florin","Yes, the number was in that range. It was 80%. And it is - the math that you describe, as far as the measure by dollars that the capabilities are obviously diverse. It's between these organizations. So there is a positive impact in that regard.","There is opportunity to repurpose those resources, and from our perspective go after a more differentiated research and development portfolio, both with internal and external development focused on the musculoskeletal space. And that's logical relative to the portfolios that we're bringing together and the need to continue to maintain the vitality of those go-forward systems, but to be able to invest in some higher risk, higher reward differentiated projects.","At the same time, they're going to be very directly in addressing the unmet needs and getting after some of the opportunities to improve care and address the cost challenges that the customers face. So that's really exciting to us.","I would tell you that it is not an area where we\u2019re looking to pull down our spend. So it is indeed to be a targeted area for expense synergy, if anything, I think that we're going to see big opportunities and potentially to expand our commitment in the research and development areas in absolute dollar spend in the coming years.","David Roman","Got it. I appreciate all the perspective. And Jim, best of luck in your future endeavors.","Jim Crines","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Richard Newitter with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.","Richard Newitter","Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. And good luck to you, Jim. I was hoping that you could talk a little bit more about the SET business. I think that was something you said was now 20% of your revenue base that you see having potential to grow in the mid-single-digit range. Just wondering if you\u2019d go over some of the opportunities there. The faster growing products or the product areas you're most excited about and how long you think - is that an area where you think you could maybe get acceleration faster than some of the other areas of your business, or is that the right way to think about it? Thanks.","David Dvorak","Sure. We are extraordinarily excited about the opportunities within that subset of the business. These are faster growing markets. And as I was describing earlier, these are markets that you can generally characterize as being ones where we've had businesses that have had some scale challenges historically. And those scale challenges create some headwinds both in commitments that you can make from an R&D spend, as well as the sales force build out, medical training education, other important ingredients to running these businesses successfully, and to do that in a profitable way and a value creating way from a stockholder perspective. So they really validate a major premise to this combination of the first instance. And I think you're going to see our performance in a direction that's consistent with that.","I would tell you that I think that there are some big immediate opportunities in that cross-sell list, but those are consistent in the large joint areas too. So I don't think that they're differentiated in that regard. Good examples and opportunities across every one of the product categories is just that SET bunch of businesses have that - have the advantage of getting to scale, have the advantage of enhance sales force specialization being built into our plans, and reinvestment in that regard. And they're also operating in traditionally faster growing markets to begin with.","So when you add all that up, we see that 20% portion of our business being very augmented to - and enhancer to our top line growth rates. So that mid-single-digit growth rate is sort of a short-term perspective, as to where we expect that business to get to. I would tell you that our aspiration is to drive it much, much higher than that.","Richard Newitter","Thanks. And maybe just one follow-up for Dan. As you think about the sequential growth acceleration trajectory that you laid out for \u201816, can you tell me, what\u2019s your implied assumption there on pricing trends for the year ahead? Do you assume it doesn't get any worse than where we are today, or are you embedding some incremental cushion for more - further erosion from where we stand today, and do you still think you can do sequential growth acceleration moving through the year in that situation?","Dan Florin","We've seen, as we discussed, very stable rate of decline on pricing over the past three or four quarters. Our assumption, as we look out to 2016 is consistent with that assumption, based on what we've seen. And so at this point in time, we're not assuming any break in trends from that perspective.","David Dvorak","Vince, we have time for one additional question.","Operator","Thank you, sir. Our last question comes from the line of William Plovanic with Canaccord Genuity. Please go ahead.","William Plovanic","Great. Thanks. Good morning, and thanks for taking my question. The first is just to go back on distribution. What are you doing specifically with the overlapping territories at the rep level? Are you retaining reps, are you repurposing them for Extremities? I\u2019m kind of - you've made a lot of comments in general [ph]. I'm just wondering if we could get some specifics from you, and then I have a follow-up. Thanks.","David Dvorak","Yes. Just to reiterate, William, we're retaining reps. There are too many opportunities by virtue of this combination from a product portfolio standpoint to be able to afford to lose good reps, so we're retaining the reps. And look, we're looking to leverage their strengths and the product portfolio strengths in the best way possible. And that means what they've done well historically is what we would continue to want see them leverage. And areas where they've done less well, we're going to look to augment. And so there are going to be opportunities for enhanced specialization, as all of that is designated, but we're going to make intelligent decisions driven by the people that are closest to the facts and circumstances that allow them to make informed judgments about that.","But the tone is very, very upbeat among the sales force. They see the opportunity and I think fundamentally know that this isn't just a temporary opportunity on the front-end but rather that what we're able to build into the future and the pipeline and solutions that we're going to be able to lever is going to be a differentiated set and a comprehensive set. So that bodes very well for the success that we\u2019re looking to have in those conversations as we complete this integration by the end of the year on the commercial side.","William Plovanic","Okay. And then just, now that the merger is finally complete. Are there any assets that you view is really not core to the combined company?","David Dvorak","We see opportunities for all these assets to contribute to value creation at this point in time. And that doesn't mean that we're going to be overly rigid and cease to evaluate portfolio decisions going forward. It's about value creation.","At this stage, our expectation is that all these assets are going to contribute and we're going to work real hard to help the leaders make those contributions. And to the extent that that view changes at some point in time, then we're going to make the decisions in the best interest of the stockholders that now we're really enthusiastic about the opportunities and synergies, by virtue of this portfolio coming together.","We think that there is a real strategic advantage to the musculoskeletal focus that we have from an R&D standpoint, from an operations standpoint, from a go-to-market strategy standpoint. If anything, the evolving healthcare market is going to make that more important. And we think that we can be more impactful in helping shape those solutions going forward by virtue of these assets.","William Plovanic","Okay. And then, Jim, just thanks for all of your support over the years. I appreciate it. Thank you.","David Dvorak","Great. So I'd like to thank everyone for joining the call today and for your continued interest and support for Zimmer Biomet. We look forward to speaking with you on the third quarter conference call, which is scheduled for 8:00 AM on October 29 later on this year.","With that, I'll turn the call back to you, Vince.","Operator","Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you again for participating in today's conference call. You may now disconnect."],"23155":["Zimmer Biomet (NYSE:ZBH) Q4 2017 Earnings Conference Call January 30, 2018  8:00 AM ET","Executives","Derek Davis - IR","Bryan Hanson - President and CEO","Dan Florin - CFO","Analysts","Mike Weinstein - JPMorgan","Bob Hopkins - Bank of America","David Lewis - Morgan Stanley","Matt Taylor - Barclays","Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank","Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets","Richard Newitter - Leerink Partners","Operator","Good morning. I would like to turn the call over to Derek Davis, Interim Vice President, Investor Relations. As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded.","Mr. Davis, you may begin your call.","Derek Davis","Thank you and good morning. Welcome to Zimmer Biomet\u2019s Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2017 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me today is our President and CEO, Bryan Hanson as well as our CFO, Dan Florin.","Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our comments during this call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings for a detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties.","Also, the discussions during this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation to these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, are included within the earnings release found on our website.","In addition to the earnings release issued this morning, we have posted a quarterly presentation on our website at investor.zimmerbiomet.com, to supplement the content we will be covering this morning.","With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over Bryan.","Bryan Hanson","Thanks, Derek. Good morning and thank you for joining us today on my first earnings call as President and CEO of Zimmer Biomet. Since joining the company six weeks ago, I\u2019ve had the pleasure of beginning a dialog with our key stakeholders, including many of our customers and distributors, senior Zimmer Biomet leadership and team members from around the globe. I\u2019ve also connected with a number of our investors in addition to analysts who follow our stock. Candor and transparency have been important parts of this process and having an active and continuous dialog allows me to integrate a broad range of perspectives in developing our plans to lead Zimmer Biomet to higher levels of innovation, commercial success and profitability.","Through these meetings, I\u2019ve been gaining deeper insight into Zimmer Biomet\u2019s operations and opportunities, both what we\u2019re doing well today and importantly where we need improvement. Overall, my initial impressions have reaffirmed our rationale for taking the job as well as my confidence that my background aligns well with the work that the Zimmer Biomet team does and what needs to be done to position the company for improved performance.","In speaking with our stakeholders, it\u2019s clear that Zimmer Biomet is working from a strong foundation that includes the industry's broadest portfolio, a robust commercial pipeline, meaningful market share in key end markets and world class sales teams. By virtue of those strengths, we also have the potential to go beyond our share of leadership and large joints to drive diversified growth in a number of attractive markets, such as sports medicine, extremities and trauma. Our global scale and depth of portfolio also position us to continue expanding access to our solutions in under penetrated patient subset in global markets.","In terms of our innovation capabilities, Zimmer Biomet is uniquely positioned to leverage platform technologies across our entire portfolio, including advanced proprietary materials and surgical robotics applications. As a company, we plan to build on this foundation. We will have an unwavering emphasis on patient safety and quality excellence, creating an engaged and innovative workplace and working to position the company to deliver top quartile total shareholder returns.","And on a personal level, I've been inspired by the way surgeons have expressed their confidence in our portfolio and in our people. Zimmer Biomet\u2019s 90-year reputation has been built on serving the needs of patients and surgeons and that resonates with my own values. All of that said, I'm not naive about the company's current challenges. I'm committed to turning Zimmer Biomet\u2019s performance around with a deliberate emphasis on rebuilding revenue momentum in the near term as well as execution that leads to value creation.","To get us there, I plan to draw on what I've learned from leading and building large global medical technology businesses. Working closely with the management team at Zimmer Biomet, we have been reviewing the 2018 operating plan to clearly define our go-forward strategies in a number of key areas. Although our review of the operating plan is ongoing, we have identified several immediate opportunities to improve Zimmer Biomet\u2019s operational execution and address certain near term challenges.","First, we will continue completing our quality remediation efforts at the Warsaw North Campus. Our teams have been undertaking this focused work over the past 13 months for the benefit of input from expert consultants. To support the success and quality compliance of our manufacturing network, we will also continue investing in the development of a best-in-class quality management system. ","Second, in order to return to offense and accelerate sales recapture, we will remain focused on fully restoring the supply of certain key brands within our knee, hip and SET categories. To that end, our teams continue to make progress on increasing the production levels of these products, which have been supply constraint due to quality remediation requirements and the non-automation of the North Campus. I reviewed the team's detailed plans for revenue acceleration through supply recovery and I'm confident as I said before that we have the right overall strategy in place.","As I've dug into the details with the team, I see both opportunities and risks associated with the milestones within our schedule. My sense at this time is that these milestones represent more risk than opportunity. We will provide more details on our progress in this area when we provide full year guidance on our Q1 earnings call.","Turning to our commercial strategy, our immediate priorities are to restore supply, engage with the sales channel and return to offense. I carried a sales bag when I started my career, which means I absolutely understand the vital role of the commercial team. Zimmer Biomet\u2019s leadership is fully committed to reconnecting and rebuilding trust with our sales forces as they engage with our customers. In addition to sales recapture, we will also be focused on the significant number of commercial releases we have scheduled in 2018, including the critical additions of cementless and revision systems for our Persona knee family as well as the limited launch of the robotic application for knees.","We have stressed to our commercial leaders that these new product introductions must be launched with excellence to ensure that they are catalysts for growth and share recapture. Last but not least, we are currently focused on gaining a deeper understanding of Zimmer Biomet\u2019s culture. Together, we will build a cohesive company where our team members are engaged and valued, feel accountable for delivering on our commitments and act with a sense of urgency.","Looking to 2018 and beyond, we will be focused on improving the predictability and consistency of our top line growth, which is a commitment to shareholders that I take very seriously. While I recognize that there is a lot of hard work in front of us, I\u2019m confident that with the focused execution of our immediate goals, target investments in this business and a strong culture, we will raise our performance to a higher level and drive sustained shareholder value.","With that, I want to turn now to the fourth quarter results. On a consolidated basis, we delivered improved top line growth in the fourth quarter. Our results benefited from several tailwind events in the quarter, including stronger than expected underlying US market growth, which likely reflected a step up in procedures due to insurance dynamics and a recovery from the Q3 hurricane impact. In addition, we experienced an acceleration in growth of our already solid performing Asia Pacific business, which benefited in the quarter from strong distributor orders.","Consolidated fourth quarter net sales were $2.074 billion, an increase of 3% over the prior year period and 1.5% on a constant currency basis. Billing day differences provided a slight tailwind to the year-over-year growth. In the Asia Pacific region, we delivered a strong 7.2% quarterly sales growth and our Americas region grew 0.8% in the quarter. In Europe, Middle East and Africa, our revenues were relatively flat at a minus 0.3%.","Full year net sales for 2017 were 7.824 billion, an increase of 1.8% over 2016 results on a constant currency basis, which included approximately 130 basis points of contribution from the LDR acquisition. From a market perspective, fourth quarter US knee and hip procedural volumes were quite strong. We estimate that US knee and hip increased around 2.5% during Q4 compared to flattish in Q3. With regard to pricing, we experienced negative pressure of 2.9% during the fourth quarter and negative 2.5% for the full year.","Knee sales were flat compared to the prior year and were slightly better than our Q3 growth rate, due primarily to the stronger US market and increased demand for our Persona Partial knee system, which has continued to garner positive feedback. Despite the improved growth rate in Q4, we believe that the gap between our Americas knee growth and the overall market continued to widen in the fourth quarter. Looking forward, we will remain focused on restoring full supply of our knee product line as well as launching a number of important new products to drive future growth and narrowing our gap to market.","Hip sales increased 1.6% during the fourth quarter and were driven by our strong performance in the Asia Pacific region where we had double digit sales growth. Although we improved quarterly sales of our Taperloc G7 and Arcos systems, supply constraints continued to limit our ability to meet the demand of these high growth brands. ","SET sales grew 4.6% over the fourth quarter of last year with numerous products across this category contributing to growth. We drove solid quarterly sales of our surgical portfolio and within upper extremities, we saw strong demand for the comprehensive shoulder during the quarter. Since November, we have received several FDA clearances in this subcategory and we are particularly excited about the US clearance of our Sidus shoulder. However, while we are encouraged that demand for these key brands remains high, we must restore supply before we can fully capitalize on these opportunities. As we work to resolving supply constraints that are a headwind on our SET performance, we will continue to invest in the success of these higher growth businesses.","Turning to our dental business, sales were relatively flat during the fourth quarter. While dental sales in both the Americas and Asia Pacific region grew challenges from the restructuring of our dental sales organization in certain key Western European markets continued to impact our performance. We remain focused on our commercial and product initiatives to position this business for a sustainable growth. During the fourth quarter, sales of our spine, Craniomaxillofacial and thoracic businesses increased by 0.5%. ","While we benefited from strong demand of our Mobi-C Cervical Disc, our spine business continued to underperform due to revenue dissynergies related to our US spine sales force integration. We continue to work to resolve the impact of these dissynergies, including recent senior leadership changes and we expect to realize the benefit of cross-selling opportunities in the future. Our CMF and thoracic business contributed sales growth during the fourth quarter, with continued strong demand for thoracic products, driven by our SternaLock and RibFix Blu brands.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Dan who will review our fourth quarter results in greater detail as well as our first quarter 2018 sales and earnings guidance. Dan?","Dan Florin","Thank you, Bryan. I'll provide details on our fourth quarter financial performance and then cover sales and earnings guidance for Q1, 2018. As Bryan covered, our net sales in the quarter increased by 3.0% over the prior year period with an increase of 1.5% on a constant currency basis. Our adjusted gross profit margin was 72.7% for the quarter, in line with our expectations. This was 190 basis points lower than the prior year period due to continued incremental manufacturing and inventory costs, primarily at our Warsaw North Campus facility as well as the impact of price declines.","Our operating expenses were higher than provided in our original Q4 guidance due to incremental spending on critical projects in our R&D portfolio as well as investments in our commercial channel. We also incurred additional expenses related to planning and implementing strategies related to US tax reform legislation.","Our R&D expense was 4.6% of revenue at $95 million, essentially in line with the prior year. SG&A expenses were $771 million dollars in the fourth quarter or 37.1% of sales, which reflects lower non-sales force incentive based compensation expense compared to the prior year. In the quarter, we recorded pretax charges of $668 million in special items, 150 million of which were cash outflows for quality remediation, business integration and other items, the non-cash charges related to intangible amortization, certain legal matters and the goodwill impairment write off related to our spine business unit. ","Our diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $6.16, which includes a one-time tax benefit of approximately $6.40, resulting from the recently enacted US tax reform legislation. This adjustment is reflected in the income tax line and has been removed from our adjusted earnings. Adjusted fourth quarter 2017 figures in the earnings release also exclude the impact of the other special items that I mentioned. ","Adjusted operating profit in the quarter amounted to $644 million or 31% of sales, which was 130 basis points lower when compared to the prior year period, driven by the previously described decline in gross margin. Our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was in line with our expectations at 23.4%. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $2.10, a decrease of 1.9% from the prior year period on 204.1 million weighted average fully diluted shares outstanding. A reconciliation of reported net earnings to adjusted net earnings is included in this morning's press release.","Operating cash flow for the quarter amounted to $403 million, inclusive of the $150 million of previously mentioned cash special items and our free cash flow was $275 million. During the fourth quarter, the company repaid $300 million of debt, bringing the total 2017 debt repayment to $1.25 billion. ","I'd like to now turn to Q1 2018 guidance. For the first quarter, we expect revenues to be in a range of $1.955 billion dollars to $1.995 billion, which includes approximately 300 basis points of favorable foreign exchange impact. On a constant currency basis, our revenue is expected to decline within a range of negative 4% to negative 2%. As a reminder, we have one less billing day in the quarter compared to the prior year quarter, which is negatively impacting these results. This headwind will reverse in quarters two through four, so that for the full year 2018, there is no net billing day impact.","","The step down from our Q4 revenue growth rate is due to a number of factors, including the impact of one less billing day, an assumption that the worldwide orthopedics market will soften somewhat from the Q4 growth rate, our expectation of a slower growth rate in our Asia-Pacific region in light of a very strong fourth quarter performance, which benefited from distributor orders as well as a temporary reduction in elective procedures in the UK.","Regarding North Campus production, we expect our Q1 production output to be at least at the level we achieved in Q4. While we are not providing full year guidance today, I would like to share some details to help your models. We expect improvement from our Q1 sales growth rate as the year progresses, driven by the normalization of billing days, increasing supply levels as we progress through the year, enhanced commercial execution and to a lesser extent, the contribution from new product launches. Importantly, these new product launches should create momentum for our sales teams as we exit 2018 and enter 2019.","Turning to EPS, for Q1 and the full year, our gross margin rate will be in a range between 72% and 73%, likely towards the lower end of that range in Q1 and improving slightly in subsequent quarters. Our gross margin rate will be a significant headwind for us in the first half of 2018 compared to the first half of 2017 and then should normalize in the second half of 2018, as we anniversary into the North Campus variances. ","We will continue to invest in critical areas on the commercial side of the business with a bias towards investments that drive near-term growth as supply recovers as well as core R&D initiatives, including the knee and robot projects previously mentioned. As we continue to assess our 2018 operating plan, there will likely be further changes to our investment profile. As a result, our first quarter projected diluted EPS is in the range of $0.73 to $0.88. After the elimination of amortization, inventory step up and special items, our adjusted diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $1.84 to $1.91. This guidance assumes a first quarter effective tax rate in the range of 19% to 20%.","In addition to my prior comments on gross margin, to help you with your P&L models, you should expect our full-year adjusted effective tax rate to be in the same range as Q1 between 19% and 20%. To be clear, we plan to reinvest the tax savings into the business to drive top line growth. Further, as we mentioned earlier this month at a conference, we have a year-over-year expense headwind on non-sales force performance based compensation programs. This headwind, which approximates $35 million is a result of not paying out full bonuses in 2017 due to shortfalls in operating performance. The majority of that expense is recorded in SG&A.","We expect our Q1 2018 free cash flow to be in the range of $250 million to $300 million. As a reminder, our goal is to allocate substantially all of our free cash flow towards debt repayment. Finally, please note our guidance does not include any impact from other potential business development transactions or unforeseen events.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Bryan. Bryan?","Bryan Hanson","Thanks, Dan. Before we move to Q&A, I just want to take a minute and thank Dan. Over the last six months, he decided to not just have the hat of CFO, but also become CEO of the organization and I can tell you from talking to people, his leadership during that time really made people feel confident about the business. I just want to say thank you for the effort that you put in over the last six months and for the time that we've already spent together and I look forward to working with you.","With that, I'll turn the call back to the moderator who will begin the Q&A portion of our call.","Question-And-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Mike Weinstein of JPMorgan.","Mike Weinstein","Bryan, as a starting point before we kind of get into the details of the business and some of the comments, [indiscernible] in the feedback that you've gotten from the commercial teams, from the distributors and reps, as you've had some early meetings with them, I know you've been traveling around a fair amount early on, kind of what you've heard on their view on the business, what the current state morale is and their relative enthusiasm for the changes that have already taken place and what's to come? Thanks.","Bryan Hanson","So I've spent as much time as I possibly can with the commercial team so far, had an opportunity to spend a lot of one-on-one time with folks in the field. As I think you know, I've met with you before. And really, it's kind of a hand-in-hand, let's go visit the customer, let\u2019s go to cases and let me live the life that you've got in that day that I\u2019m there. And I got to tell you that, that combined with the recent kickoff meeting that we had for the Americas where there were a couple of thousand sales representatives there, I've had really good exposure early on to the organization.","The first thing I would say is that we, no doubt in my mind, have the best sales organization in the industry. I feel very confident about that. This is a team that that is engaged with the surgeons, it\u2019s extremely knowledgeable about the space, has energy around, what it is they think we can do. And so, so I'm very confident that we've got the right team. But what I see inside of it though and what I'm hearing from the organization is there has been, what I would define as a, maybe a lack of focus from senior leadership and engagement with the sales organization. ","They felt a little orphaned if you will and that\u2019s going to change. It's changed already. I feel like just the time that I spent with them has been getting out pretty quickly, it\u2019s spreading almost like a wildfire if you will the news of the time I\u2019ve been in the field and I had an opportunity to spend about an hour, presenting to that broad team at the kickoff meeting and I can tell you that my enthusiasm on the stage was fueled by the enthusiasm that I felt from the audience and what they were hearing. And so I got to tell you that we're early on in this, but I believe we've already made as a senior management team, with the focus we've had with the commercial organization an impact.","So to sum it up, I think we've got a great team. I think that we've got to work on the morale and the engagement and we've already begun that process, but I feel real confident about the team.","Dan Florin","This is Dan. I'll just add to that briefly. Having been to a number of these sales meetings before, I can tell you the energy, enthusiasm and excitement of our sales team is off the charts compared to where it's been and the energy in the room was -- people were just using it with enthusiasm and Bryan did a terrific job and really connected with the sales team.","Mike Weinstein","That's good to hear. Let me follow up on the supply side. Bryan, your comments, is that with -- I think you said the milestones represent more risk right now maybe than opportunity, could you just update us on where you are on supply coming out of the North campus and maybe set expectations for the year in terms of the cadence, so when you think you'll see products and when you'll be in a better position to go on the offensive?","Bryan Hanson","So I'm going to give you kind of a comprehensive view of this thing because obviously I've been thinking a lot about it. So I apologize for probably a longer winded answer here. But I think, first of all, it's important recognize, I think Dan said it earlier that our performance out of that factory has stayed consistent with our expectations. So right now, we're consistent with what we've been saying. ","And I want to be real clear, the strategy that I see for the supply and recovery and really the comprehensive project plan that we see around this is sound. I have confidence in it. I do feel that the timeline we've communicated in the past, at the end of Q2, recovery is a possibility. So I just don't want to take that off the table. I do feel that's a possibility. That said, I do think there's more risk probably in a timeline than opportunity. And let me just give you an explanation for this and I kind of bifurcate my thinking on this in two different ways.","The first piece that I think about is just the raw project plan, the risk of actually achieving a timeline of recovery, so that plan itself. And the second piece is what I define as kind of the delay that I think we're going to see in translating that recovery, that product recovery into accelerated revenue growth. Right? So those are kind of the pieces that I break this up and let me just first hit these, the supply piece.","Again, I think that there are key milestones that we have in front of us that I think both have risk and opportunity in them, but the complexity of the project just tells me, just given my history with projects like this that most people believe inside of these timelines that things are going to go as planned and I put that in kind of air quotes. What I've learned over the years and I think most people have that run these complex projects is things never go as planned and unplanned events always occur. ","And as a results of just knowing that and kind of the spicy sense if you will and looking at it, I believe there's more risk than opportunity in the timeline that we see. So it just comes down to the complexity, history with projects like this, you usually see more slippage than you do see people pulling it in. That's the first piece.","The second piece is really a thing that we probably most care about, which is how do we then take the supply recovery and turn that into or translate that into actual acceleration of revenue growth. And I think it's going to be more delayed than what maybe you're thinking and maybe even what I thought when I came in and a lot of this is as a result of the time I\u2019ve been spending with the sales organization.","And so here's my sense on this, this is kind of on two fronts. One, there's just a lack of trust right now from the sales organization for corporate. We have given them timelines that we have failed on and they've gone out through the information they have received from us, approach the customer only to have to pull back again. And so that lack of trust is going to create a situation where even when we have supply available, they're going to wait, they're going to wait. They've been defending their surgeons through logistics hoops they've been jumping through. ","They're going to wait with this new inventory, defend their surgeons without having to jump through those hoops and when they feel really confident that those surgeons are in place and intact, then they're going to go on the offensive. And when you think about this, and I\u2019ve been in sales and I understand the process, it isn't a light switch that occurs. You've got to go out now and build the trust of folks because they haven\u2019t been on the offensive, right, you've got to build the trust of other surgeons, you've got to build your offensive bullpen and then ultimately as a result of that bullpen, you start converting business.","So there's a delayed impact of supply recovery as a result of that. So I just want to make sure that that's clear in the way that I'm thinking about it now and as I've gotten more educated on the topic and spent time with our reps. Again, I'm not going to give you specifics right now because that's going to come in our first quarter earnings call with guidance, but I will give you just kind of the way I'm thinking about it right now and you should be thinking about it the same way.","I see this as a gradual revenue recovery into 2019. And if you're thinking about it in that way, I think it's the right way to put a lens on this and as we get smarter on the topic and burn down some of these risks through the milestones, we'll give you more insight, but that's where my thinking is right now.","Mike Weinstein","And just before I let others jump in, I assume the FDA has not been in yet for re-inspection.","Bryan Hanson","They have not and obviously that's a very material milestone that we're paying attention to.","Operator","Our next question will come from Bob Hopkins of Bank of America.","Bob Hopkins","My first question, I just wanted to follow up on some of the things that Mike was talking about as it relates to your comments about risk versus opportunity. And I just want to be very clear on your pipeline and whether or not to comment on risk versus opportunity, what that might imply for some of the things you guys have been talking about for a while now, specifically, could you comment on the timelines for cementless, for Persona revision, for the robotic platform, are those affected by the potential for more risk and opportunity as it relates to the North campus?","Bryan Hanson","So I\u2019ll give you just kind of my broad thinking on this, because obviously again this is a vector that I've been spending a lot of time on and I feel really good about the product pipeline that we've gotten. And as I said before, I've been out with stakeholders a lot and you can have the general managers and the marketing folks who rate people and give you a feel for whether or not we've got the right products in the pipeline. ","But what really sells it for me is when I go talk to surgeons who know about the pipeline and I talk to our sales reps who ultimately have to sell the pipeline and both those stakeholders are selling it, we've got the right pieces inside of the product portfolio and they're excited about getting those in the field as quickly as they can. I feel pretty confident about the timelines that we have. There's always in these things as you get closer to the end launch date, you get some slight slippage, but I don't see anything material there. ","The key to it though is this, right? When you look at just taking knee as an example, because it\u2019s a big franchise for us, we've got the partial knee out now, using Persona technology which is getting great traction, it's a big first step in the right direction. We\u2019ve got cementless coming up in the timelines we've communicated are ones that we still feel comfortable with. We\u2019ve got revision and then robotics come in as well. ","That to me is a full portfolio that we need to truly get back on the offensive, all right, truly get back on the offensive. The key thing though is it's not the limited lines. That's where you're doing the learning. Really for me is when we get those out, get through the limited launch, get into full launch, that's when you've got full capacity with the bag and the way you should be thinking about that particularly with revision and robotics is the full launch will come anywhere from four to six months after a limited launch, which put us close to the middle of 2019.","So if you're thinking about full capability, full bag in that very important segment for us in the knee, that comes around mid-2019. It doesn't mean we won\u2019t get an opportunity to take advantage of the stuff that launches in between that, but the fully loaded for bear, attitude from the sales representatives will come in that mid-2019 timeframe.","Bob Hopkins","And then just one other question I wanted to ask is a little bit more on -- centered on the fourth quarter and the comments on the first quarter and the guidance. Could you maybe help us sort of quantify some of the tailwinds that you benefited from in Q4 that you think will fall off in Q1? But I think you mentioned Asia, the hurricane, maybe the market softening a little bit, just I also assume there's probably a little bit of conservatism in those numbers as well. So maybe just talk -- help us quantify some of the things that helped you in Q4 that you don't think will be there in Q1.","Bryan Hanson","So I'm going to pass it to Dan, but I just want to make a comment. I really do believe as we look at that Q4 to Q1 that this is a realistic number. I just want to make sure that that's clear. I see this as a realistic number with balance on both sides, but realistic in the view that we have on it. And Dan can speak to some of the specifics around it.","Dan Florin","So Bob, in our prepared remarks, we talked about Q4 benefiting from a strong US market, which we had anticipated coming in for the quarter and then ended up being even slightly stronger than we initially guided to. So based on our models, we think knees are close to 3%, hips close to 2%, something in that range. So clearly a strong US market in hips and knees and shoulders and really procedurally across the board in the fourth quarter and difficult to precisely quantify how much of that\u2019s the hurricane. We came into the quarter signaling that could be as much as 30 basis points. ","I'd probably stick with that type of an estimate. In terms of strength in the US market, we call that Asia-Pacific. Asia-Pac, really since the merger closed, continues to post above market growth on a consistent basis. The team is driving excellent execution in Japan, China, other countries as well. The stocking orders or the distributor orders in the fourth quarter also did benefit us. And then dental actually was stronger than we had expected on Q4. Now, as we approach Q1, we bring in a lot of factors. ","We do our best at looking at the past number of years in terms of seasonality from a stronger than expected Q4 and what that may look like in Q1. So as we said in the prepared remarks, where our assumption is that the worldwide orthopedic market does step down a little bit more than normal into Q1, as a result of the strength in Q4. So that's an element. We talked about the billing day differences, the Asia-Pac step down because of the absence of distributor orders in Q1 and the UK, the NHS announcing that they were going to push elective procedures out through February due to some capacity constraints that they have over there.","And the last part would be, based on the strength of Q4, I think it's fair to assume that our field inventory levels on high running brands are really still depleted. And that will recover as the year progresses. So hopefully that gives you a sense of the tailwinds and the headwinds in to Q1.","Operator","We will now move to David Lewis of Morgan Stanley.","David Lewis","Just a quick clarification on Bob\u2019s question, there is a lot of factors Bryan and Dan that vary from fourth quarter to first quarter. The one factor that does not appear to be a headwind, fourth to first is some change in the supply related dynamics. It sounds like fourth to first, supply is either at or better than it was in the fourth quarter. Is that a fair way of thinking about it?","Dan Florin","Yes. That\u2019s a good assumption. To me, it\u2019s a non-variable when you look at the difference between Q4 and Q1.","David Lewis","And then Bryan, kind of a strategic and financial question for you. I mean, if you got the guidance the first quarter and obviously it doesn't reflect necessarily all 2018, your gross margin is pretty close to what we thought. There does appear to be a little more incremental SG&A investments, some of that was compensation, which we knew about, but it does appear that you are going to reinvest in this business. Could you share with us a little bit about where you think that reinvestment needs to go? I think most investors are supportive of you doing it. Any thoughts you have on where you think it's needed I think could be helpful for people and then I had one quick follow up for Dan or you.","Bryan Hanson","So I am 100% on the same page. We've got to have investment. We -- as an organization, we\u2019ve been chasing the bottom line because we've had top line misses. And as a result of that, just obvious thing that we should have been doing to invest for growth is to have them happen in those moments, for all the right reasons, but the impact of that is negative now because we've got some catchup that we need to do. The things that we're going to be concentrating on is obviously investing for growth as a primary vehicle for growth. There is going to be two kind of pieces to this. ","We're going to have a biased near-term growth I think you guys would want that as well, but inside of it we\u2019re still going to make sure that we earmarked money for research and development. We've got to spend more on research and development and bring on innovations that don't just help us in the near term, but also help us in the longer term. So, some of the money will go to R&D and unfortunately, there will be a longer tail to the impact of that from a revenue recognition standpoint. But that will be where some of the money goes. ","The rest of the money is going to focus on the commercial organization, which is really where we can invest, take advantage of the portfolio we already have and I see that in just broader investments in commercial structure to be able to have more feet on the street, some of those being specialized so that we can take advantage of the opportunity in SET, but a lot of it will be focused on just driving incremental feet on the street, focused on driving the portfolio we already have and taking advantage of the new products that we're going to be launching and very importantly, beginning to diversify our growth engines in to sports extremities and trauma.","David Lewis","And then just last question for me is just, this quarter is sort of remarkable within hips and knees for a couple of reasons. One, it's the strongest hip and knee quarter you posted in a year, but it's also against the strongest pricing headwind I think you've seen in two years. I think you\u2019ve talked about the factors of that hip and knee momentum that may not occur in the first quarter, but Dan or Bryan, what is that pricing number, 3.5% in hips and knees, was that sort of mix related in the fourth quarter and how do we think about that number heading into 2018?","Bryan Hanson","Dave, we've seen fluctuations quarter-to-quarter on price declines. So at a company level, negative 2.9% in the fourth quarter, Q3 was negative 2.1%, so actually below the average. So second half was down 2.5%, first half was down 2.5%. So we're not concerned about that. We're still operating in that type of a range. Clearly when you get some distributor orders, you get some customer mix that comes into that map, but overall we still see price decline in the band that we've been experiencing recently.","Operator","Our next question will be from Matt Taylor of Barclays.","Matt Taylor","So I just wanted to follow up on that pricing question. I was curious because of the magnitude of this quarter. Do you think that your supply constraints are impacting your ability to get price or negatively impacting price at all or is this just within a regular band variance?","Bryan Hanson","Yeah. We're definitely looking at it right now as a -- just a variation that occurs, probably more due to mix. If you think about APAC for instance with the strength that we saw in the quarter, for the same products in APAC, you typically get a little lower price and so that mix, I'm sure, has some play in to the quarter, but we're not looking at this as something that\u2019s sustained or that we're worried about increasing over the next 12 months. And when I think about the supply constraints, I don't feel that the organization is putting price reductions in place to retain customers, which I think is what you're asking. So I don't feel that that's happening right now and we've got pretty good controls over pricing flexibility in the field and our confidence level that that's not occurring.","Matt Taylor","And just to follow up on the supply discussion, we noticed that you had taken off extremities from the watch list in the presentation, you didn't mention that they were constrained. I guess my question is can you talk about some of the lines of product that have improved or not improved and just remind us sort of where you are constrained now.","Bryan Hanson","Yeah. Just quickly that might have been just an oversight, the extremities as we've been talking about, continue to be constrained as a result of the North campus. So I'm not sure what we missed that, but that would be consistent with what we said before. It is still impacted and what I would say is that generally, the way I think about supply recovery is this and again this is coming from direct interaction with the field. Even though we're getting rolling recoveries, certain categories are getting more healthy than others. The sales organization is still waiting to get the full recovery. They still are concerned when we have other issues with other products that we're going to creep into the spaces that we've already recovered, because we've had lapses like that in the past. So it kind of goes back to that trust piece.","Even though things are recovering, they\u2019re waiting for full -- truly a full comprehensive product recovery before they go on the offensive. So, I think we're not seeing the translation yet even in those areas for recovery, because people are waiting to get it all there so they know they can go on the offensive. A perfect example of that, Dan maybe you can provide the Oxford in what you\u2019ve heard on \u2013","Dan Florin","Sure. Yeah. I think Bryan\u2019s point is an important one, which is that lack of trust in the field, the hesitancy to go on offense and the need to have the full bag in order to truly drive offense. So, there are brands out of the North campus that we've restored to full supply as we expected, but the translation to revenue acceleration and that timeline that Bryan is talking about is an important distinction. Part of that is trust, part of it is the duration of the supply situation, but still feel very optimistic that out over time, we're going to bring all of the supply and new products together to drive that acceleration into 2019.","Matt Taylor","You want to give maybe the specific examples, because I think it really kind of remains true with even telling the sales organization, we're in full supply in Oxford and seeing a delay.","Bryan Hanson","Sure. Yeah. With Oxford, we\u2019re at full supply in Oxford, entering the fourth quarter. We're excited to have the Persona partial knee in there as well. So now you've got a full bag of mobile bearing and fixed bearing in the partial knee space. But still even with that full supply of Oxford, saw some delay in terms of the revenue uptake on Oxford. It's taking longer than we expected to see that accelerator. So that\u2019s I think a proof point of what we're describing.","Operator","We will now move to our next question and that will be from Kristen Stewart of Deutsche Bank.","Kristen Stewart","Just kind of I guess big picture for you, I guess to what extent, I guess, are you still excited about costs taking kind of a life of its own, I kind of feel what extent do you still feel very optimistic about the future for Zimmer, because I feel like this -- you've kind of pointed out a lot more of the risk factors. So maybe if you could take a step back and talk about maybe some of the things that you've kind of come in and looked at Zimmer, the pluses and the minuses, since taking over the helm six weeks ago that you might be more excited about longer term as you look at the company more strategically over the next several years? Is it just kind of your view of looking at Zimmer from an orthopedic Company, can you maybe talk about how you may look at Zimmer from shaping the company more directionally? Is it diversification? Is it just getting the company back to -- are you satisfied with a low single digit growth rate? Can you just talk more directionally over kind of a longer term perspective?","Bryan Hanson","Yeah. So Kristen, first, I'm going to correct you. This is Zimmer Biomet, not Zimmer and I think it's important because one of the key things that I'm going to be concentrating on is culture in this organization in some of the things that are in a way of that culture creation right now is we just haven't yet become a fully integrated new organization. There's still camps of Zimmer and Biomet and we need to create the Zimmer Biomet, forget the legacy companies. And sorry to do that, but I think I would be remiss in not doing that because I know that my own team is listening right now. So that was a focus from them.","So just to give you a sense for, I kind of like to think about things that I experience over the last month that maybe I didn\u2019t like as much as I would have expected and then things that I like more than what I expected. And then maybe I can kind of distill that to say, based on those things, how am I feeling about accepting the job and the future of the company. I\u2019ll start with the negative and finish it with the positive.","The things that I probably experienced in a more negative way than I expected is just the complexity and the challenges, the scope of the challenges associated with quality remediation and supply recovery. It's more complex than I think I assumed when I came in. So that would be on the negative side obviously. The culture gap, which was kind of what I was just referencing on the Zimmer Biomet discussion we just had is wider than I expected. ","And I got to tell you that this organization, because of what they've been through, throughout the organization, is fatigued. I can feel the fatigue in the organization and when the culture is not rock solid, that fatigue is exponential, right? And I think that's the issue that I'm seeing and that was -- it's probably not as good as I was even hoping. So those would be the things that on the negative side I\u2019ve experienced over the last 30 days or so.","On the positive side, we\u2019ve got great employees and I\u2019ve spent a lot of time in skip level meetings, one-on-ones, just walking around, popping in people's cubicles, spending time out in the sales organization, spending time in our factories. We have a solid team in the sales organization as I think I've said already is even better than I thought. We have a first class sales organization. I didn't. Like I said, that\u2019s a surprise, but it's a relief, right. The portfolio is very attractive. I thought that coming in, but I'm hearing from our surgeons partners that we have the deepest, broadest portfolio in the industry that is the access to what obviously and they're very excited about the portfolio of products we're going to launch, so that my confidence level there is higher than it's ever been.","This kind of surgeon loyalty and again I've spent time specifically with surgeons and the stickiness associated with that customer is better than I've ever seen in any business that I've been with. And so that\u2019s a surprise on the positive side. Here's one of, maybe a little softer, but it is really important to me, the employees that I've met feel very open to me, most desire a different form of leadership, a more inspirational positive form of leadership and this is something that I love to bring. And so I'm not feeling any resistance at all to it. I'm feeling an acceptance of it and that obviously is one of the things that I was hoping for, but I'm realizing and it\u2019s still kind of, it\u2019s still these things.","I feel and I think the takeaway has got to be this. The cadence of recovery may not be what you were hoping for, but my confidence level right now is better than ever that this business is going to get turned around, I\u2019m 100% confident it's going to happen based on what I'm seeing. And to answer your question further, once we get to that stability place and we get our fair share of the market where I already play in, then I do want to take a step back and take a look to say, are we in the right markets to allow for a better weighted average market growth and ultimately through that weighted average market growth, allow us to grow in that mid-single digit growth rate at some point in the future, because that's the only way you're going to get to double digit EPS growth on a consistent basis.","And so I don't want to go there yet. I'm not always patient, but right now I'm trying to be patient, put that on the back burner. Let's get to health first and then ultimately let\u2019s take a look at the portfolio and make the right decisions. So hopefully that answers your question.","Kristen Stewart","And then just one for Dan I guess and maybe you I guess in terms of just the guidance, what is the main sticking point or what's the main catalyst in terms of determining what the investment trigger is going to be? Is it mainly just what the right level of spend is for the remediation? Is that why they\u2019re hesitant to push off into the first quarter to get 2018 guidance in terms of giving why not a wide range for 2018 and set a no range for 2018 since you\u2019re giving SG&A and gross margin guidance?","Bryan Hanson","I will just give you my viewpoint on it, Kristen and then Dan, he will provide any color. When I look at this as I\u2019ve mentioned, there are a lot of moving pieces and parts right now, pretty material events that need to happen here over the relatively short term. And until we get through some of those and in either one burn down risk as a result of passing those milestones or experience risk, I think that we just want to be cautious in giving you guidance until we get a little smarter on those topics. ","And the only thing that's going to make us smarter beyond the assumptions that we made is actually pushing through the milestones and experiencing the good or the bad. And when we get to the earnings call after Q1, we're going to be a lot smarter on that topic. And so we're really just trying to enable guidance for you that is more realistic and more informed and that's the reason why we\u2019re delaying. There isn't a specific thing. There are a number of things that are pushing us in that direction.","And Dan, I don\u2019t know if you have any other color around it?","Dan Florin","Well, Kristen, I would just say that we've tried to give you some markers on certain elements of the P&L so that you can reflect those in your models. Look, I would expect that the consensus estimates for both revenue and EPS are probably going to come down after today in light of what we have shared, but that does not diminish at all the long term opportunity that Bryan has talked about.","Operator","We will now take a question from Joanne Wuensch from BMO Capital Markets.","Joanne Wuensch","Can we also take a look at what the milestones are or the steps are in our near term that will increase our confidence in giving the guidance or just over the next 12 months. I feel like we have some sweeping verbiage on execution in North Campus facility and supply, but is there a way to get just a little bit more granular on what really needs to be checked off?","Bryan Hanson","Yeah. Probably, one of the and I'm not going to get into too much detail, but I think just probably when we think about supply recovery, which I think all of us would agree is one of the most important components of that revenue acceleration we've been talking about, the first and foremost, you've got to again kind of bifurcate the activities that we've got in place, one of these is taking those processes that are most important to us with high volume products that are non-automated in the North campus and moving them to contract manufacturing that ultimately have a more automated process, proven track record of supplying products like these for others in the industry and transitioning that volume to them. ","Just inside that one piece, that has to go right, this is not just one or two codes, these are families of codes. There's a lot of the SKUs that have to go through this process. There is a verification, and validation process that ensues. And there's nothing you can really do to speed this up. It's time sequence because a lot of it would be like fatigue testing for instance for an implant, but you can get through a million different iterations or movements with this product to check speed testing, find out that it fails, because you got to get 5 million. Then you got to find out why it failed and restart the whole process.","So verification and validation is something that sounds very easy and ultimately we will absolutely get through it, but things always go wrong inside of that and you got to restart the clock as a result. So one of the biggest things that I'm focused on is what is our target dates associated with families that we have that we're moving out on that verification and validation timeframe, when do we think that should close, right? And so when we hit those and we passed them and that will be, we should hit all of those before the quarter earnings call. And so we'll get a lot smarter on whether or not we had major issues or not. ","That's just one example of things that need to go right to be able to get that supply recovery because the only pathway to full capacity is through that contract manufacturing. On the other side of the coin, when you look at our factory in the North Campus and one of the big things that Mike mentioned is, the FDA still has to come in and sanction what it is we're doing with suppliers -- and with the quality remediation. We have a great team working on this. We've been working on it for a month. We're spending a lot of money in this area and a lot of effort of senior management and we have consultants that I think are some of the top notch folks in the industry following us on this and giving us their unbiased view of whether or not we're achieving what we said. ","But at the end of the day, the FDA has got to come in and look at what we're doing and agree with us. If they for whatever reason come in and disagree and there are further things we have to take action on with remediation, that could impact our ability to supply product out of that North Campus. These are just two examples of pretty significant things that we just got to have time to tell us whether we're on the right track. There are many others. I want to oversimplify, but those are pretty big milestones.","Joanne Wuensch","And then a little bit more of a specific question. Can you pull apart a little bit what's going on in your spine and CMF franchise, as it relates to LDR and then the broader market?","Bryan Hanson","So if I kind of break those businesses up, within spine and CMF, obviously two different businesses, but CMF is actually doing pretty well. That's a solid team that we have, good strategy that continues to deliver results and really help that overall franchise out. So, I\u2019d just say, kudos, let\u2019s keep doing what we\u2019re doing over there and get more of it. On the spine side, I think we've got all kinds of opportunity in spine. This is an amalgamation of different acquisitions over time, LDR being the most recent and where we're falling down right now is, the channel integration is not going as planned and we're experiencing, as we said in the comments, dissynergies associated with that channel integration.","And just to be honest, we had to make some changes at the senior leadership team for that organization. We think we've got the right team in place right now. Now, got to get focused on reversing some of these dissynergies and getting a better channel strategy in place. I do believe that can happen. It\u2019s going to take time because just looking at it, it's not anywhere where we needed to be and that we've got to unwind some of the things that have occurred there. But at the end of the day, when that gets past us, we have a very full portfolio that's exciting for our customers and exciting for our sales reps. We just don\u2019t have the channel strategy to implement it right now.","Operator","And that question will come from Richard Newitter of Leerink Partners.","Richard Newitter","I was hoping to just on the outlook that you plan to provide next quarter and I appreciate you don't want to go too far in advance of yourself, but maybe just the question is a little bit more on the process. Coming off of a period here, where we haven't been able to fully bank on kind of the given timelines or thresholds that you provided, what's going to change in the way that you approach kind of the under promises over deliver and within the context of you seem a lot of things that are out of your control, how should we be thinking about when you do provide that outlook? What kind of bottoms up processes you need to change at the organization so that you feel confident that whatever you do provide, we can kind of take at face value?","Bryan Hanson","So some of the things that I've learned over the years and I've been blessed by working with two very good companies, Covidien with a lot of time there and Medtronic more recently. And on the Covidien side, there is a level of discipline and rigor that I received from my old boss and mentor [indiscernible] and that rigor and discipline will be something that we put in place here and I'm not saying it doesn't exist, but the level of focus that I will have with this team in putting a process together that allows us to feel more confident in the guidance that we give will be something that we do. And not new to me and there is a process that I'm used to following and we're going to make sure that we bring that here.","And we've got good people to be able to do it. It's just a -- it's a level of discipline and rigor that I've seen that I want to make sure that we have here as well. So that's one piece and I think it would be helpful, we\u2019re obviously not ready to give 2018 guidance, certainly not anything beyond that, but I do want, again with this idea of full transparency, I want to give everyone a view of kind of what I'm thinking about this right now and I kind of again think about it in three major components that we've got to get in front of us here.","The first one as I've already talked about is supply recovery and I don't want to forget that supply recovery is the first step. The second step is translating that supply recovery into actual revenue acceleration, right? And I\u2019ve talked a little bit about why I think some delays could occur there, but that's got to happen. It's got to be supply recovery acceleration as a result. Second piece is, we\u2019re going to launch these products, excellent product pipeline that I\u2019ve talked about and we got to get to full launch as quickly as we can. I'm seeing that as being somewhere in the mid-2019 timeframe but that has to happen and we've got to do it effectively, right?","And then the second -- the third piece to me is really around this idea of culture shift. I know that people consider it soft. It is a very important thing to me and right now, we have gaps in the culture and we've got to enhance the culture. So those three things need to happen. I just think logically about those from supply recovery and resulting acceleration, that's going to happen later in the year guys. It's later than what you've been thinking, because translating that into revenue growth is going to take longer than maybe what you're assuming. ","I already said the pipeline is really full swing in mid-2019 and anyone who's done any kind of a culture change knows that it takes time. We're having immediate impact in this area. We're going to get quick results out of the gate, but to make it sustainable, it's just going to take time. It's a continuous improvement game. So when I just kind of put all those things together, I think realistically the way we should be thinking about this is a gradual recovery towards market growth if you will through 2019. ","So think about it in that way. That's where I am. I'm going to get smarter on this topic. I'm going to learn more as we go and the very things that we just said as we burn down risk areas, but this is the way I'm thinking about it today. Some of you may have a hope for a faster recovery than that and I get it and potentially maybe it can be, which is based on everything that I'm seeing right now, I'm setting the expectation that I think is realistic that that's probably not probable. Okay. It is likely going to be what I just said. It would be a gradual recovery through 2019. So hopefully that helps provide color, at least in the way we're thinking about the business right now.","Bryan Hanson","Okay. I think that\u2019s the last question. I like to -- we just threw a pot at you in a very short period of time. Some of it probably stuff you didn't want to hear, didn\u2019t expect to hear. At the end of the day, the whole idea behind this from my perspective and Dan\u2019s is, we want to be as transparent with us as we possibly can and that was the intent of the conversation today. Let you know what we know, up to a reasonable point obviously. We didn\u2019t get to this place overnight and you shouldn't expect us to be able to recover from it any time soon. It's going to take some time to get there. ","That said, based on everything I've learned, I am more confident than ever that this business is going to turn around. Although the pacing may not be what you expected or hoped for, I'm 100% confident that the end game is going to be something you're going to be very happy about. So thanks so much. I appreciate you joining the call today. I'm looking forward to connecting with you between now and earnings call, I\u2019m sure, through various events, but really looking forward to connecting on the first quarter earnings call as we give guidance for 2018. Thanks so much.","Operator","And thank you again for participating in today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect. "],"23254":["Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc.

I would like to turn the call to Bob Marshall, Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer. Mr. Marshall, you may begin your call.","Robert Marshall","Thanks, George. Good morning and welcome to Zimmer Biomet\u2019s fourth quarter 2015 earnings conference call. I\u2019m here with our CEO, David Dvorak, and our CFO, Dan Florin.","Before we start, I like to remind you that our discussions during this call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by forward-looking statements, due to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings for detailed discussions of these risks and uncertainties.","During our call, we will compare revenues on a constant currency adjusted pro forma billing day basis. This means revenues for prior year periods have been adjusted to reflect the inclusion of Biomet revenues and the impact of previously announced divestiture remedies, with growth rates measured on a per billing day basis.","Additionally, expense ratios and related margin analysis through operating profit will be computed on the basis of adjusted pro forma financials, as revised, adjusting the all periods for inventory step-up and other inventory manufacturing related charges, certain claims, special items, intangible asset amortization, financing, and other expenses related to the Biomet merger and certain tax adjustments as applicable.","Reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed during our call to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are available on our website at investor.zimmerbiomet.com.","In addition, we have posted to our website updated combined historical financials, as revised, along with adjusted pro forma revenue guidance.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to David Dvorak.","David Dvorak","Thanks, Bob. This morning I will review our fourth quarter and full-year financial results, as well as key highlights from our performance. Dan will then provide additional financial details and discuss our guidance for 2016.","In June of 2015, we joined together two innovative companies and began executing our plans to expand our leadership position in musculoskeletal. Our combination provides significant growth opportunities with a highly complementary portfolio of product and service offerings as well as an enhanced ability to improve operating margins and drive free cash flows.","The early success of our execution of these plans is reflected in our strong earnings performance. In the second half of 2015, we over-delivered against our initial net synergy targets, further validating our confidence and the effectiveness and accretive value of our combined organization.","Notably, in 2015, we generated our fifth consecutive year of adjusted operating margin expansion. During the fourth quarter, we substantially completed the integration of our global commercial organizations. These actions have included the appointment of proven sales leaders and experienced sales representatives, in addition to product cross-training activities to ensure appropriate emphasis on our market-leading large joint reconstructive businesses, as well as an enhanced focus on faster growing non-large joint categories.","Based upon our significant progress, we\u2019re confident in our ability to drive sequential revenue improvement as we progress through 2016.","Turning to market conditions, in the fourth quarter, global musculoskeletal markets demonstrated stability with sequential strength in the United States, offsetting a degree of softness in emerging markets and certain countries within the European, Middle East and Africa region.","With respect to pricing, we experienced price pressure of negative 1.3% in the quarter. Our resulting price decline for the year of 1.9% was in line with our expectations. Moving on to our performance, Zimmer Biomet achieved stable global revenue growth in the fourth quarter with sequential improvement in the United States alongside continued solid results in the Asia-Pacific region.","Consolidated net sales for the fourth quarter were $1.93 billion, an increase of 58.1% reported or an increase of 0.5% over the prior-year period adjusting for billing day differences. Importantly, our large joint reconstructive and S.E.T. categories in United States delivered 240 basis points of sequential year-over-year improvement compared to our flat sales results in the third quarter; more broadly, revenues in the Americas region increased by 0.5% in the fourth quarter.","In the Asia-Pacific region, we delivered 4.0% sales growth, and our sales decreased by 1.5% in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region. Full-year sales for 2015 on an adjusted pro forma basis were $6.0 billion, an increase of 1.1% over 2014.","Zimmer Biomet\u2019s knee business grew sales by 2.2% in the fourth quarter, reflecting positive volume and mix of 4.1% and negative price of 1.9%. Our knee results were led by improved performance in the United States and an ongoing strong contribution from the Asia-Pacific region, which delivered 8.2% growth over the prior-year period.","Our Americas segment increased revenues by 1.4%, and our Europe, Middle East and Africa region grew knee sales by 0.6%. Our commercial teams achieved this result with the portfolio of solutions that meet the personalized needs of each patient, while addressing surgeon and hospital preferences.","Knee sales growth was driven mainly by Persona, The Personalized Knee System, a leading cross-sell opportunity, but was also supported by the strong market demand for the Vanguard 360 revision knee system, as well as the bicruciate preserving and clinically proven Oxford Partial Knee System.","Sales from our hip business decreased by 0.6% in the fourth quarter; including positive volume and mix of 1.6% and negative price of 2.2%. Our Asia-Pacific region revenues increased by 0.7% and hip sales decreased by 0.8% in the Americas as a positive performance in the United States was offset by Latin America results.","Our Europe, Middle East and Africa sales decreased by 1.0% from the prior-year period. In future quarters, we will continue to pursue growth with our broad hip portfolio, including our G7 Acetabular System, Taperloc Complete Microplasty stems and the Arcos Femoral Revision System.","Turning to our SET product category, sales in the fourth quarter increased 1.6% over the prior year period. We achieved solid results with our Sports Medicine, Surgical and Extremities portfolios, which were offset somewhat by our Trauma sales performance. The ongoing growth of our sports medicine offerings is highlighted by our Gel-One Cross-linked Hyaluronate and Subchondroplasty treatments.","In Surgical, our sales were supported by the performance of our Transposal Fluid Waste Management System and A.T.S. Automatic Tourniquet System, which continue to expand our presence in the operating room suite. Within Extremities, we\u2019re addressing a broad range of clinical situations and surgeon preferences as evidenced by the commercial success of our comprehensive Total Shoulder System and the Nexel Total Elbow.","In future quarters, we\u2019ll leverage our specialized sales-force and robust Trauma portfolio for improved results, with innovative solutions such as the DVR Crosslock Distal Radius Plating System, the AFFIXUS Hip Fracture Nail System and the Natural Nail System.","Worldwide dental sales decreased by 6.7% in the fourth quarter. Our dental category experience revenue headwinds due to a supply disruption related to a voluntary field action in response to a packaging issue. We are in the process of remediating this matter and we expect to do so fully by the close of the first quarter, which will help position us to reestablish our momentum in dental in the second-half of the year.","We remain encouraged by the early success of our cross-selling activity, particularly with our market-leading regenerative product line as we progress through the integration of this business.","Zimmer Biomet spine, craniomaxillofacial and thoracic category revenues decreased by 2.0% from the prior year period. Our craniomaxillofacial and thoracic team continue to deliver strong growth, driven by steady demand for our TraumaOne and SternaLock Blu Systems as well as growing acceptance of our RibFix Blu System.","With regard to spine, we successfully completed the integration of our U.S. spine commercial channel with anticipated near-term revenue dyssynergies slowing our growth in the quarter. We believe this business is well-positioned for accelerated performance in 2016, with a more comprehensive portfolio of innovative spinal solutions including the Virage OCT Spinal Fixation System, the Polaris Spinal System and the Timberline Lateral Fusion System.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Dan, who will continue this discussion in greater detail, as well as review our guidance. Dan?","Daniel Florin","Thank you, David. I will review our fourth quarter performance in more detail, and then provide additional information related to our first quarter and full-year 2016 sales and earnings guidance.","Our total revenues for the fourth were $1.934 billion, an increase of 0.5% constant currency compared to the fourth quarter of 2014 on an adjusted pro forma billing day basis. Net currency impact for the quarter decreased revenues by 4.4% or $90 million. The negative currency impact for the quarter was related to the ongoing strength of the U.S. dollar against many international currencies.","As David reviewed, we were encouraged to have substantially completed the integration of our commercial teams, which contributed to the sequential improvement of our reconstructive and S.E.T. performances in the United States, which increased over a flat year-on-year growth rate in the third quarter to 2.4% this quarter, in line with our expectations.","However, we did have some unanticipated headwinds, including decelerating market condition in certain emerging and southern European countries, as well as the dental field action which David referenced. These conditions led to our overall constant currency sales growth coming in at the bottom of our guidance range.","Our adjusted gross profit margin was 75.6% for the quarter and 20 basis points less when compared to the prior-year adjusted pro forma results due to the impact of foreign exchange and price declines mostly offset by gains from our cash flow hedging program.","The company\u2019s R&D expense was 4.4% of revenue at $85.9 million and 20 basis points higher when compared to the prior-year period. Adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses were $723.6 million in the fourth quarter or 37.4% of sales, an improvement of 170 basis points over the comparable period in the prior year. We continue to achieve process and operational efficiencies in the fourth quarter through the ongoing implementation of initiatives designed to capture synergies.","In the quarter, the company recorded pretax charges of approximately $533 million in special items, primarily related to the Biomet acquisition and integration related expenses. Adjusted fourth quarter 2015 figures in the earnings release exclude the impact of these charges, which include $380 million of non-cash amortization and inventory step-up charges as well as $120 million of integration costs.","A full reconciliation of reported net earnings to adjusted net earnings is included in this morning\u2019s press release.","Adjusted operating profit in the quarter amounted to $652.4 million or 33.7% of sales, a 120 basis point improvement over the prior-year period. Net interest expense for the quarter amounted to $88 million, consistent with expectations. Adjusted net earnings were $428.3 million for the fourth quarter, an increase of 39.2% compared to the prior year period.","Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 17.4% to $2.09 on 205.2 million average outstanding diluted shares. These adjusted earnings per share are inclusive of approximately $0.03 of share-based compensation. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the year increased 7.8% to $6.90 on 189.8 million shares.","Our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 23.8%. The company had approximately 202.6 million shares of common stock outstanding as of December 31, 2015, increasing from 169.7 million as of December 31, 2014 due primarily to the Biomet transaction. During the quarter, the company invested $150 million to repurchase 1.4 million shares. As of December 31, 2015 approximately $450 million remained available under the existing share repurchase authorization.","Operating cash flow for the quarter amounted to $433.2 million, an increase of 22% over the fourth quarter of 2014. This result includes $114 million of cash expenditures for integration and initiatives related to our synergy program. Free cash flow in the fourth quarter was $303.7 million, which was 12% higher than the fourth quarter of 2014.","Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $129.5 million, which included $80.4 million for instruments and $49.1 million for property, plant and equipment. During the quarter, the company repaid $350 million on our term loan bringing the repayment total in 2015 to $500 million. Our gross leverage ratio at December 31 was 4.0 times.","I\u2019d like to now turn to our guidance. I will provide revenue and adjusted earnings per share guidance for both the first quarter and the full-year. Additionally, I will review our expectations for free cash flow in 2016.","Beginning with our market assumptions for 2016, we believe that the musculoskeletal markets in which we participate will grow approximately 3%. We expect global market conditions to remain stable in 2016, when compared to the full-year 2015. Price is forecasted to be approximately negative 2% consistent with the last several years.","For 2016, we estimate our adjusted pro forma revenue growth to be in a range of 1.5% to 2.5% on a constant currency basis. Foreign exchange is expected to decrease revenues by 2.0% primarily driven by the euro and Australian dollar along with certain emerging market currencies. Taken together, revenue growth for the year should be in a range of negative 0.5% to positive 0.5% or a range of $7.415 billion to $7.490 billion.","As David outlined, with the integration of our commercial organization substantially complete, we expect constant currency year-over-year revenue growth to improve sequentially as we progress through 2016.","In terms of quarterly revenue phasing, we expect first quarter constant currency growth of 0.5% to 1%. And I would guide you toward market growth rates, as we progress through the second-half of 2016.","We will drive revenue acceleration across multiple product categories with offerings such as Persona, The Personalized Knee System; The Oxford Partial Knee; Gel-One Cross-linked Hyaluronate; Knee Creations Subchondroplasty; and the Arcos Modular Femoral Hip Revision System; additionally supported by a cadence of new product launches.","We expect to realize increasing sales-force productivity over the course of the year, driven by added stability and specialization in our global sales organizations, and supported by the benefits of our medical education and training programs.","As you move down the income statement for 2016, assuming currency rates remain near recent levels, we expect our gross margin ratio to be between 75.5% and 76%. This takes into account anticipated gains on foreign currency hedges, principally from the euro and Japanese yen. I would like to note that the company won\u2019t realize the full annual P&L benefit from the suspended medical device excise tax in 2016, because it was largely treated as an inventoriable cost.","The portion that provides relief to the P&L during the year amounts to approximately $20 million and we intend to reinvest this benefit in R&D to accelerate our innovation and growth opportunities. We expect R&D expense for the year to be in the range of 4.5% to 5.0% of sales. SG&A is expected to be approximately 37% of sales as we continue to realize efficiencies from our synergy initiative and further leverage revenue growth.","Assuming interest rates remain near recent levels, we expect net interest and other expense of $365 million. This incorporates our debt repayment plan throughout 2016. We anticipate and adjusted effective tax rate to be approximately 26%, which is in line with our final full-year rate for 2015.","We anticipate the diluted weighted average shares outstanding for the first quarter to total approximately 204 million shares and in a range of 203 million to 204 million shares for the full year. This share count considers additional share repurchases plan during 2016; therefore, full-year adjusted diluted earnings per share is projected to be in a range of $7.80 to $7.95.","Given our early success in capturing cost savings, we remain on pace to deliver our net operating EBIT synergy target of $350 million by the end of year-three with approximately $225 million of cumulative net benefit achieved by year-end 2016.","As I stated earlier, we expect revenues to increase between 0.5% and 1.0% on a constant currency adjusted pro forma basis when compared to the first quarter of 2015. At this time, assuming currency rates remain where they have been during the first month of this quarter, we anticipate foreign currency translation will decrease our reported first-quarter revenues by an estimated 2.5%.","Therefore, we expect first-quarter revenues to be between 1.5% and 2.0% below the prior-year period, or a range of $1.870 billion to $1.880 billion. We expect gross margin and operating expense ratios to be similar during the first quarter, as those realized in the fourth quarter of 2015. Our adjusted effective tax rate is expected to be between 26.5% and 27%. Therefore, we expect first-quarter adjusted earnings per share to be in a range between $1.90 and $1.95.","Turning to cash flow, we anticipate full-year 2016 operating cash flows to be in a range of $1.65 billion to $1.75 billion, inclusive of approximately $290 million of expenditures in support of our synergy program. This compares to full year 2015 of $863 million.","This includes total capital expenditures for the year, which are expected to be in a range of $550 million to $575 million. Instrument capital is expected to be in a range of $300 million to $325 million in support of our cross-sell initiative, as well as new product introductions.","Traditional PP&E is expected to be approximately $250 million, including $105 million necessary to rationalize facilities and ERP systems, as well as optimize our manufacturing and logistics network. Free cash flow is therefore expected to be in a range of $1.075 billion to $1.020 billion for the year.","Our guidance assumes that we will continue to delever our balance sheet with planned debt repayments of approximately $1 billion. Exiting the year with a leverage ratio of approximately 3.5 times on a gross basis or just under 3.0 times on a net basis. We intend to return excess cash to our stockholders through our share repurchase and dividend programs.","Free cash flow in excess of these capital allocation programs is assumed to be held in cash and cash equivalents or other investments.","For modeling purposes, intangible amortization expense for the year is estimated to total approximately $600 million. And finally, please note that our guidance does not include any impact from other potential business development transactions or unforeseen events.","David, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to you.","David Dvorak","Thanks, Dan. As we approach the opportunities of the year ahead, the substantial completion of our commercial integration combined with our broad and highly complementary portfolio, positions our business for accelerated top-line growth. In addition, we have supplemented our product offerings with an enhanced R&D investment that is 60% greater than existed within either stand-alone company.","During 2016, we expect to release the cadence of differentiated products, technologies and services across the entirety of our musculoskeletal portfolio. Taken together with our demonstrated approach to discipline capital allocation, we\u2019re committed to accelerating revenues and sustaining operating margin and earnings-per-share growth through the balance of the decade.","And now, I\u2019d like to ask George to begin the Q&A portion of our call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now take your questions. [Operator Instructions]","Our first question is from David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","David Lewis","Good morning.","David Dvorak","Good morning.","David Lewis","So just two questions, I\u2019ll start with Dan and then one for David. So, Dan, I think the one thing about guidance that stands out to us, obviously is the EPS guide looks strong, obviously confidence at the high-end of the range, rather materially above the Street. So can you drill down on this, this early in 2016, obviously, what are the factors that give you the confidence in that earnings visibility in 2016? And then a quick follow-up for David.","Daniel Florin","Sure, David. What gives us confidence is really the integration and synergy program and the progress that we continue to make and the clear line of sight that we have to the synergy opportunity as we progress through 2016.","If you recall, at the time of the merger announcement, we announced $135 million of net EBIT synergies in year one. And then, during the Q3 call, we raised that to $155 million and stayed with the $350 million by year three.","As we look at 2016, we see $225 million of cumulative net EBIT synergies in the P&L and we have good line of sight to that. So that\u2019s what gives us strong conviction and the ability to deliver on that synergy, along with the ability to see sequential improvement on the top line and the flexibility we have with our capital allocation.","David Lewis","Okay. Thanks, Dan. And, David, I think investors are getting more confident earnings, but obviously to move the multiple the organic growth has to go higher. I think from our math the picture of the fourth quarter were sort of one still of stability. And so how do you move from stability in the fourth quarter to sort of improvement in the - throughout 2016 and sort of what provides you the confidence that we\u2019re going to get that that steady organic progression here? Thank you.","David Dvorak","Right. David, I think it is appropriate to characterize the fourth quarter performance as you did. And yet, I would tell you that the progress that we made on the commercial channel integration was very, very significant. Probably the most important element of the integration as a whole, as Dan said, we - and you referenced, we have a high degree of confidence in our ability to deliver on the operating synergies.","But with the progress that we made in the fourth quarter to a point sales leaders across the globe, intermediary management level and clarify the roles of reps in all product categories, through compensation plans, the bags that they are going to be carrying, the territories that they\u2019re going to be selling to, targets for them for 2016. All of that clarity and visibility along with a really aggressive effort to get people trained up on products that - six months ago they weren\u2019t at all familiar with, because they didn\u2019t have in their bag. That sets us up to make the progress that we\u2019re referencing in 2016.","So - and then we\u2019re already seeing the beginnings of the cross-sell coming to fruition, as well we had some very successful kickoff meetings with further product training education, and I would tell you that the attendance, from a surgeon-perspective, our medical training education program show a big acceptance and interest in learning about the new products, technologies to ensure their safe and efficacious use, so all of that gives us visibility that we\u2019re going to push out sequential improvement each quarter of 2016.","And stands to reason relative to what we were a year ago that that would be the case with the certainty that comes with the progress I just described to you. Furthermore, the revenue dysynergies will begin to anniversary out as we get into the latter part of the year and so you can picture a line graph where the cross-sell is accelerating through the year. And the revenue dysynergies as you get to the back part of the year begin to anniversary out.","And as a consequence we\u2019d expect to hit market growth rates in the second half of the year, and then exit the year at or above market growth rates.","David Lewis","Okay. Thank you very much, David.","David Dvorak","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Bob Hopkins with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Robert Hopkins","Thank you and good morning.","David Dvorak","Good morning.","Daniel Florin","Good morning.","Robert Hopkins","So just to really to follow-up on that, because you definitely agree that there is really nice progress being made here with cash flow and earnings. So I just want to drill down a little bit more on the prospects for revenue growth improvement, so a couple of quick things.","First, it sounds like this is the case, but can you just confirm, David, that the level of sales-force turnover that you\u2019re seeing is kind of as you expected, I just would love to get a specific update there?","And then, also in your 2016 revenue growth guidance, are you assuming that Southern Europe and emerging markets improve or are you assuming they kind of stay the same? And then, lastly and probably most importantly, I was wondering if you could just kind of drill down a little more specifically on, what are the product lines that you think are most likely to drive acceleration over the course of 2016? What are the things that you have the most confidence in? Thank you.","David Dvorak","Sure, Bob. I think that to take them in order, the sales-force turnover is very consistent with our expectations. We had described to you that with a fairly normal cadence of turnover in 2015. But what had transpired in the first-half of the year was a slowing of the hiring, particularly in the case of the independent distributorships. That began to correct out as the months progressed. And now we\u2019re entering 2016 with an expectation that that will net one another out and we\u2019ll get into positive growth.","In particular, emphasis is going to be placed upon the non-large joint to bring more sales-force specialization, because we have all the necessary ingredients from the product portfolio to compete very effectively in some of those faster growing markets. And a lot of room for growth and runway based upon our market share. So we\u2019re enthusiastic about that.","So consider the sales force to be stable and we would look 2016 to bring net gains and sales force representation. The presumption on the emerging markets and sort of the certain countries within Europe that we referenced in our comments is at steady state, probably more of what we would expect to see or what we experienced in the second half of 2015 continuing into 2016. And there\u2019s been a lot of discussion around, Latin America in particular we\u2019ve experienced that in full.","In our case, our business in China is held up more strongly than what it sounds like other people are commenting on. And we continue to believe that will perform strongly. But even that business has slowed down. We\u2019re still in a growth mode in China.","So those emerging markets have gone from historically strong mid- to upper-teen growth quarter-to-quarter, to sort of double-digit growth by the middle of last year into low single-digit growth. And we\u2019d expect that picture to improve, because we\u2019re going to be anniversarying out of some of those downward trends, so more than that dictates that.","As far as the products go, it\u2019s a long list, but I could rattle off the top of my head some of the ones that we\u2019re already seeing, a lot of interest and uptake on Persona, is it\u2019s doing really well, obviously taking that product into the legacy Biomet customer accounts.","I would tell you that within the knee category, we\u2019re seeing a lot of interest in Oxford at this point in time. And that\u2019s an opportunity for us. In light of the divestiture that\u2019s pretty special. We are doing very well with Gel-One. We\u2019re doing very well with Subchondroplasty.","We\u2019ve talked to you in the past about the hip products that are additive, mostly coming from the legacy Biomet side that had been performing quite well. And that\u2019s a business unit that we need to shore up that concludes revision on the side of the hips. The comprehensive shoulder is doing very well on the Extremities side. And I would add in some of the complementary aspects of the product portfolio within Trauma.","Distal Radius Plating, which was a space that legacy Zimmer was not hardly present at all-in. We\u2019re going to do very well with that product. That\u2019s a pretty good list for you.","Robert Hopkins","Yes. I appreciate the detail. I\u2019ll leave it at that. Thanks very much for the help.","David Dvorak","You bet. Thanks, Bob.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from Mike Weinstein with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.","Michael Weinstein","Good morning, guys. Thanks.","David Dvorak","Good morning, Mike.","Michael Weinstein","So my first question is pricing got better in the fourth quarter. Your pricing was down 1.3% versus 1.9% for the year. And then, you guided to down 2% for 2016. So was there something in the fourth quarter that was an anomaly on the pricing front, or is there a reason to think that pricing will do better than what you\u2019re guiding to? Thanks.","Daniel Florin","Sure, Mike. You\u2019re right. We had experienced the last two years of very tight range within tens of basis points right around that two-number consistently. So the year actually ended on a positive note. And when you pull it altogether, minus 1.9% for the year is on the low-end, really at what we had guided to coming into the year.","It was a good quarter. I think that the teams are doing a nice job in particular of positioning these products. The broader portfolio creates opportunities to ensure they were matching the customer need, customer ability.","And I think that this is going to be a sustained feature of the broader portfolio that comes with the combination. That said, one quarter - a trend does not make. And we just want to be smart about our guiding going forward. I think that the 2% number is the right way to think about price down in 2016. And remember that, although we\u2019re anniversarying out of - at the end of Q1, the biannual adjustment, which got spread off over two years in Japan, we\u2019ll re-enter that world come April 1, with the next round.","So all of that in, I think that that approximate 2% down is the right way to think about 2016, Mike.","Michael Weinstein","Okay. And then just two clarifications; so one, David, you talked about part of the math on growth acceleration in the back-half as you\u2019ll have easier comps. You said that the attrition on your reps was normal. So what is it that you see as being easier in the back-half of the year relative to the first-half in terms of was there in the back-half of the year was your lost business that you\u2019ll anniversary on or lost territory managers that you anniversary on?","And then, just to clarify your view of market growth and getting to market growth in the back-half of the year, is that 2.5% to 3%? Is that better than that, would love to nail you down on that? Thanks.","Daniel Florin","Sure, Mike. I think about that market growth rate in round numbers of 3%. And the sequential improvement really isn\u2019t driven by anything in particular by way of anniversarying, I guess, out of a loss in a particular area, as much as it is just running the offense that we have at this point in time.","I mean, it\u2019s true that the math is advantageous to produce growth rates based upon the performance of the company in the second-half of last year. And you\u2019re able to have full access to those numbers to understand that dynamic, but we\u2019re focused on taking what we believe to be the industry-leading product portfolio and executing. And remember that as we built this channel out across the globe, we picked the most successful leaders.","In the U.S. we\u2019ve referenced this before; on average those selected leaders were growing their business at 300 basis points above those that were not selected to take the business forward. So we have a lot of experience at the rep level, proven leadership at the territory level and with this product bag and running the offense that we expect to run, we\u2019re just going to be driving ourselves back into that market growth rate.","So think of that that second-half as 3% and then, of course, with the presumption that we\u2019re communicating that every quarter we\u2019re going to improve that we ought to be exiting the year at or above that 3% rate going into 2017.","Michael Weinstein","Okay. Perfect. Thank you, guys.","David Dvorak","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from David Roman with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","David Roman","Thank you and good morning, everybody. I want to just to start on the pipeline side of the story. And one of the elements clearly that was sort of sitting under the hood at Biomet is just the degree to which I think at the time of the acquisition they were on pace to develop a fairly decent cadence of new products. So maybe you could sort of talk to us about where you are with respect to integrating the pipeline products like the Biomet XP Knee and maybe some of the products in the Sports Medicine side, and when we can sort of get an update on how those rollouts are progressing.","David Dvorak","We have a couple of dozen products that we expect to launch this year David and just as the visibility to the existing product portfolio has become clear as we\u2019ve been able to get around and talk to various stakeholders, I would tell you that the pipeline is just as impressive by virtue of the combination. And so, the thing I would tell you is that as we move those products into full commercial release, we\u2019ll be communicating those, we\u2019ll update you in the conference calls, we\u2019ll be putting our press releases to highlight those product and solution releases.","And we\u2019d look to do a bit of a preview at the academy this year too. We just want to be smart about the pace of communicating that.","But it is the case that it is across all product categories. It\u2019s an impressive pipeline and that really isn\u2019t the basis for the sequential growth. That plan is really built more fundamentally off of the existing bag. But I would tell you that we think that this product pipeline is going to set us up well, as we get back to market and beyond growth rates to sustain that performance going forward.","David Roman","Okay. So I\u2019d just ask a follow-up on that and then combine it with a financial question. So is it the right way to think about it, David, and that the execution around the sales-force and the integration what drives you back to market growth and the pipeline that you just referenced, and on which we\u2019ll get more detail, is what drives you towards that 4% plus that you presented in January, is it 2020 goal?","And then, on the financial side, Dan, it looks like from your guidance that your conversion from net income to operating - adjusted income to operating cash flow is roughly a 100% which is obviously a pretty good number. Is that the right type of ratio to think about on a go-forward basis?","David Dvorak","So, David, I\u2019ll respond to the first part. I would - maybe a subtle adjustment to the way you framed the response. I would tell you that the existing product portfolio puts us in a position to get back to market growth and then above market growth rate. And I see the pipeline is sustaining that above market performance thereafter.","Daniel Florin","David, with respect to operating cash flow in relationship to adjusted net earnings, certainly, 2015 and to a lesser extent 2016, cash flow has been weighted down by integration related cost as well as the merger cost themselves. So I think that you will absolutely see us kind of return to a normalcy in correlation between adjusted net earnings and our operating cash flows. So that\u2019s the right way to think about it.","David Roman","Okay. Thank you very much.","Daniel Florin","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.","Larry Biegelsen","Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions.","David Dvorak","Good morning.","Larry Biegelsen","First, obviously, you showed a stability in Q4, but there is a narrative out there that the disruptions might manifest few quarters after the deal-close, as contracts start expiring that you signed as part of a retention program. So, David, can you lay people\u2019s concerns that maybe that will come to fruition? And I had a follow-up, thanks.","David Dvorak","Sure, Larry. There really aren\u2019t any such contracts. I think that to the extent that there were any kind of state plan that was more in the Biomet side, and those would have been geared towards retention through closing. So we\u2019ve already transitioned the business. We\u2019re running as one entity.","And I would tell you further more that to the extent the third-party arrangements that we\u2019re into as part of the distribution channel, with those we\u2019ve had great success in solidifying those contracts, getting those things executed and those include any compensation plan that we carry forward. So that is seamless from 2015 and 2016. And we don\u2019t see risk along the lines of what you\u2019re questioning.","Larry Biegelsen","That\u2019s helpful. And then for my second question, maybe it would be helpful to hear your updated thoughts, David, on robotics. Obviously, one of your competitors seems to be getting a little more traction there, as well as custom implants. And at Biomet, I believe, you talked publicly about having custom implants before the acquisition. So an update on that program and how much of a priority that is for you? Thanks for taking the questions.","David Dvorak","Sure, Larry. I think that the opportunity to drive enhanced quality in a cost efficient way is an area of focus for us from an innovation standpoint. It\u2019s been an area of focus for us through both internal and external development over the better part of the last decade. And we\u2019re happy with our progress. The portfolio of preoperative and intraoperative technologies that we\u2019ve assembled and continue to expand is strong. It includes proprietary technologies like iASSIST as well as Signature PSI eLIBRA for soft-tissue balancing.","And we think that there is a wonderful value proposition for that set of technologies. But we\u2019re mindful in a way that we\u2019re developing these technologies to ensure that there is in fact a proven clinical benefit and it\u2019s delivered in a cost efficient way. And in the evolving healthcare market that we\u2019re looking to serve and the partnerships that we want to create, that it will be deeper than ever with these customers, to ensure that they\u2019re bringing about an enhanced level of quality in the patient care, that they deliver at the same time, that they\u2019re managing costs in an optimized way. We think that that\u2019s the right recipe.","So we think that there is a need and an opportunity to improve. We think that, for instance on the large joint side, to drive towards more reproducible use of these systems; the alignment, placement soft-tissue balancing; all areas that we\u2019re very much focused on, we just think that it needs to take the form of clinical proven cost-efficient solutions.","And so that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been focused on and what we\u2019ll continue to focus on. We\u2019re really agnostic as to the embodiment of that technology, so long as it meets those needs.","With respect to - you referenced custom solutions; we have built out a wonderful portfolio of personalized solutions. Our interventions we can help clinicians irrespective of where that patient is in the disease state along the continuum of care. And then, wherever that plot point is on the continuum of care for that particular patient, we want to offer the most personalized solution.","So when you apply that to our portfolio, everything from early intervention, joint preservation solution, such as Gel-One and Subchondroplasty through partial knee replacements, for instance, with Oxford into a total knee solution whether it\u2019s Vanguard or Persona, The Personalized Knee System. That\u2019s a system that offers approximately 17,000 permutations.","So we did extensive work to identify anatomical differences and designed a system that would address any of those anatomical differences with clinical significance. And so, there really is a mass customization strategy that\u2019s worked very well to leverage off of the heritage and clinical proof points of the legacy systems and ensure that we\u2019re bringing about improved patient outcomes without incurring the risk of going backwards.","We referenced Biomet\u2019s custom solutions. It is the case that the Vanguard Select is a custom solution. So as I described to you, the mass customization approach that we took with Persona, there are going to be instances where a patient\u2019s anatomy is such an outlier or in oncology context, bone void context, deformities, you need a true custom solution.","And I\u2019m sure that our company has done more of that in the musculoskeletal space than anyone, including the solutions that Biomet has provided. And that isn\u2019t just in large joints.","We do terrific work. I was just down a week ago in our craniomaxillofacial group. And they\u2019ve done some, quite literally, life-saving solutions for patients on a true custom basis. So across all of our product lines, we have active efforts and existing solutions in that regard.","Larry Biegelsen","Thanks for taking the questions guys.","David Dvorak","You bet, Larry.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Joanne Wuensch with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Joanne Wuensch","Good morning. And thank you for taking the question. Spine was lagging this particular quarter or getting a lot of different results out of different manufacturers. And I was curious, if you could provide a little bit of color on what you\u2019re seeing. But more - what does it take for you to get that back more towards a market growth rate?","David Dvorak","Sure, Joanne. I think that that\u2019s one where as we indicated going back a quarter, the expectation was we were going to see some revenue dyssynergies by virtue of the integration. We\u2019ve completed that integration. All of the independent distributors are signed up at this point. United States is a strong channel and the product portfolio is stronger than either entity had quite obviously.","So whether it\u2019s MIS with the legacy Zimmer PathFinder system or lateral access approach with Timberline and the implant technologies, and we\u2019ve got some exciting launches to come yet in 2016 on that front; so that a sales-force that\u2019s ready to go. I don\u2019t think that we\u2019re going to be talking about that hitting back to market growth for very long before we\u2019re past that point. We\u2019re taking share. I expect that to happen in 2016.","Joanne Wuensch","All right. That\u2019s helpful. And then, this is a boring question, so forgive me. Tax rate, is there a way that this could be managed? Thank you.","David Dvorak","We give, Dan, all the boring questions.","Daniel Florin","Thanks, Joanne.","Joanne Wuensch","Any time.","Daniel Florin","It\u2019s actually a very important issue for us, and one that we are very focused on - over the past year we\u2019ve been focused on establishing a way to repatriate cash from offshore to the U.S. in a tax efficient manner. And we did that through structuring alongside the merger transaction. So that was really a critical near-term priority that\u2019s complete at this point.","And as we come in here to 2016, coordinating efforts with our head of manufacturing and supply chain, we see a path towards a lower future adjusted effective tax rate. It takes some time to put the building blocks in place to accomplish that. But we\u2019re very focused on it, and expect to see improvements in the years to come. Not in 2016, but beyond that we see a path towards a lower effective tax rate.","Joanne Wuensch","Terrific. Thank you.","Daniel Florin","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Matt Keeler with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Matthew Keeler","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess, just to start on - you highlighted strong growth in Asia and mentioned that China had been a point of strength relative to some of your competitors. What do you attribute that, is it sort of different business mix or do you think you\u2019re actually taking share there?","David Dvorak","Well, we\u2019ve had strong performance for a long, long time in that market. So I would expect, we continue to perform well relative to the market, Matt. But I think it\u2019s also fair to point out that the mix of the business is likely different. Some of the companies that are reporting out have business segments and sectors that we don\u2019t operate within, that it sounds like might be more materially impacted by what\u2019s happening in a macro economic sense within that marketplace particular.","For instance, the capital goods side is not that prominent for our businesses. It\u2019s more of a traditional orthopedic business that we\u2019re focused within the Chinese marketplace.","So I would expect that business for us to continue to perform well, but as I said, it did slowdown relative to its historic growth rates.","Matthew Keeler","Got it, thanks. And just my follow-up, your Americas growth in knee has got a little better. I think in hips it was relatively consistent with last quarter. Just any color you can provide on how you see that market and can you give us any context around the impact of LatAm on Americas\u2019 hips and knees in the quarter?","David Dvorak","Yes. It was fairly substantial within the quarter. Now, we\u2019re seeing the fact that that scheme of things, it\u2019s not a large business, just because the downturn has been pretty dramatic in Latin America. As you said, within the United States market, we took a sequential step forward just in growth rates in both the large joint categories, but closed the gap to a greater extent in knees. And, Dan, you may be able to provide a little bit more clarity on the Latin America breakout.","Daniel Florin","Well, I think that as David said in the U.S. on these good progress, closed the gap to market, not at market growth rates based on our model for the fourth quarter. But importantly, began to close that gap. Some work to do on hips. But as we talked about on the pipeline side and the cross-sell opportunity, we see a path towards closing that gap to market first-half of the year, and then, working our way back above market.","The Latin America piece, as David said, is not that significant. But the declines are significant in a place like Brazil, which is enough to create a headwind at the Americas level. And then, quite frankly at the consolidated level as well. And back to the earlier question, our guidance for 2016 on Latin America assumes a very similar environment in 2016 as we\u2019ve seen here in 2015.","Matthew Keeler","Okay. Thanks.","Daniel Florin","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from Glenn Novarro with RBC capital markets. Please go ahead.","Glenn Novarro","Hi, good morning, guys.","David Dvorak","Good morning.","Glenn Novarro","Your EPS guide for 2016 came in well ahead of our expectations. And if I look at the two biggest changes within the P&L, at least relative to our thinking, it\u2019s in the gross margin as well as in the SG&A ratio.","So, Dan, I\u2019m wondering if you can provide us a bridge as to what\u2019s getting us to the higher gross margins for 2016, and as well as a bridge to what\u2019s getting us to a lower SG&A ratio. Any specifics would be helpful. Thanks.","Daniel Florin","Sure. With respect to the gross margin rate, our assumption is that 2016 actually is quite similar to 2015. And now there\u2019s a lot of moving parts within that ability to hold the gross margin rate. There is the impact of foreign currency through the translation, but then there is also the benefit of the cash flow hedges that flow through the gross margin line as well.","On top of that, the synergy program, we do start to begin to see some level of benefit at the COGS line by virtue of the integration. And that\u2019s also contributing to kind of a flattish overall gross margin.","And I think the other important point while, foreign currency, the impact to the 2016 P&L remains significant as that was in 2015. And so the foreign currency headwind, their earnings is in the neighborhood of $0.15 or $0.16 of headwind on EPS. The other important point, as we are planning to reinvest the medical device tax. And so we account for that up in COGS. So there is the shift out of COGS into R&D in our 2016 guidance.","Glenn Novarro","And then, just can you comment a little bit on SG&A, because at least relative to our model, the SG&A ratio is coming in below what we were forecasting; so any specifics there that you can call out? I know that you said on the call that the cost savings are right on track. But at least to us it seems like maybe cost savings are coming a little bit quicker. Thanks.","Daniel Florin","You\u2019re right. The SG&A progress is predominantly related to the integration and the synergy program. So I quoted accumulative $225 million in 2016. And that\u2019s really focused bit in COGS and more proportionally in the SG&A area. That\u2019s the main driver.","Glenn Novarro","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Daniel Florin","You\u2019re welcome.","Robert Marshall","George, we have time for one additional question.","Operator","Thank you, sir. Our next question comes from Matt Taylor with Barclays Bank. Please go ahead.","Matt Taylor","Hi, thanks for taking the question. Can you hear me okay?","David Dvorak","We can.","Matt Taylor","Great. So two questions that are kind of related; one is, I just wanted to understand, I guess, where you are on the synergies. And given that you had already raised the net guidance once and you\u2019re progressing pretty well here, can you talk to any potential to actually raise that number again and outperform your pre-tax synergy guidance?","Daniel Florin","I\u2019ll take that Matt. I think we\u2019ve communicated before. First and foremost, we\u2019re really pleased with the progress we\u2019re making. The teams have done a terrific job driving that. It\u2019s not been easy, but the teams been executing extremely well. And that manifests itself in that range, up to that 155 in year one.","Importantly, to the extent that we\u2019re able to exceed what we\u2019ve communicated, we - first and foremost, we would look to reinvest that back into the business and in towards driving top-line growth. So I think that\u2019s the right way to think about it.","Matt Taylor","Okay. And then, Dan, you\u2019ve mentioned a couple of times in the past kind of general comments on how you would approach getting your tax rate down over time. Can you talk about any specifics around that strategy? Because I noticed in your guidance you really don\u2019t have a lot of tax leverage but you\u2019re still significantly higher than peers.","Daniel Florin","Yes, we are. And driving - the elements necessary to drive our tax rate down, frankly, first and foremost, begins with where you manufacture your products. And so, with the merger we have an opportunity to take a fresh look at our sourcing strategy in that regard, as well as where intellectual property is housed and so forth.","And that\u2019s why there is no quick fix to do that, but we do see a roadmap to drive the tax rate down. It\u2019s something that we were successful with on legacy Biomet and there\u2019s opportunity here on Zimmer Biomet to drive the same type of reduction. It will just take some time.","Matt Taylor","Okay. Thanks a lot, guys.","David Dvorak","Thanks, Matt. So with that I\u2019d like to thank everyone for joining the call today and for your continued interest and support for Zimmer Biomet. We look forward to speaking with you on our first quarter conference call, which is scheduled for 8 AM on April 28. I\u2019ll turn the call back to you, George.","Operator","Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you again for participating in today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect."],"23158":["Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc.

I would like to turn the call over to Bob Marshall, Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer. Mr. Marshall, you may begin your call.","Robert Marshall","Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to Zimmer Biomet's first quarter 2016 earnings conference call. I'm here with our CEO, David Dvorak; and our CFO, Dan Florin.","Before we start, I'd like to remind you that our discussions during this call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by forward-looking statements, due to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings for a detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties.","During our call, we will compare revenues on a constant currency adjusted pro forma basis. This means revenues for prior-year periods have been adjusted to reflect the inclusion of Biomet revenues and the impact of the previously announced divestiture remedy.","Additionally, expense ratios and related margin analysis through operating profit will be computed on the basis of adjusted pro forma financials, as revised, adjusting all periods for inventory step-up and other inventory manufacturing related charges, special items, intangible asset amortization, financing, and other expenses related to the Biomet merger and certain tax adjustments as applicable.","Reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed during our call to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are available on our website at investor.zimmerbiomet.com.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to David.","David Dvorak","Thanks, Bob. This morning I'll review our first quarter financial results, including key highlights from our performance. Dan will then provide additional financial details and discuss our updated guidance. We'll state all sales rates in constant currency terms and all earnings results on an adjusted basis.","We're pleased to report that Zimmer Biomet's revenue was on the high-end of our first quarter expectations coming into the year, which further supports our confidence in achieving sequential improvement as we progress through 2016. Our comprehensive portfolio of musculoskeletal solutions and services provides a broad range of new opportunities for our sales channel, including a strengthened presence in a number of faster-growing product categories.","Together with the increased stabilization and focused execution of our commercial teams, we remain on pace to exit the year at or above market growth rates. As we look to the future, Zimmer Biomet will continue to drive our established leadership with clinically proven devices and therapies, advanced surgical technologies and comprehensive consultative services.","The strong combination of our broad portfolio, pipeline and unmatched musculoskeletal expertise allows us to play a leadership role in defining the future of healthcare through partnership opportunities with hospitals, surgeons and their patients. We'll bolster our portfolio throughout 2016 with strategic internal and external development opportunities.","Our planned commercialization schedule includes over 50 new product launches this year, of which we've completed a dozen in the first quarter. These product launches included expansions to our market-leading knee and hip reconstructive systems, which I'll discuss in a moment.","Our ongoing commercial introductions provide a firm foundation for sustainable revenue growth. Global musculoskeletal market conditions remain stable in the first quarter, with continued strength in United States and the Asia Pacific region. While there were ongoing challenges in certain emerging markets, these conditions were relatively consistent with recent quarters and in line with our expectations.","With regard to pricing, we experienced price pressure of negative 0.9% in the quarter, consistent with our expectations. For the balance of the year, we continue to expect price pressure of approximately negative 2% when factoring in anticipated dynamics such as the bi-annual price adjustments in Japan.","Against this backdrop, Zimmer Biomet delivered consolidated net sales of $1.9 billion for the first quarter, an increase of 67.8% reported and 1.2% adjusted over the prior-year period. Our first quarter performance was highlighted by ongoing sequential sales growth for our U.S. reconstructive business, which posted a 180 basis point improvement. Our overall sales in the Americas increased by 1.8% and by 3.6% in the Asia Pacific region, while our revenues decreased by 1.5% in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region.","Importantly, Zimmer Biomet knee business increased sales by 3.5% in the first quarter, reflecting positive volume and mix of 4.8% and negative price of 1.3%. We accelerated our U.S. knee performance, which contributed to a 3.3% year-over-year sales increase in the Americas. We also maintained strong revenues in the Asia Pacific region, where we delivered solid growth of 7.2%. Our knee sales increased by 1.9% in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region over the prior-year period.","In the quarter, our knee results were driven by our leading cross-sells, Persona, The Personalized Knee System, The Vanguard 360 Revision Knee System and the Oxford Partial Knee System. We were also excited to announce two commercial releases that expand the capabilities of our knee portfolio. Our OsseoTi Tibial Sleeves augments are a cutting-edge porous metal technology that adds to the breadth of the trusted Vanguard 360 Revision Knee System.","We also introduced the Persona Medial Congruent Bearing, an innovative expansion of the Persona Knee System designed to recreate a more natural feeling knee by maximizing joint stability throughout the full range of motion. We'll continue to pursue growth with our knee portfolio, which combines market leading reconstructive systems with advanced surgical planning tools and intelligent instrumentation to offer patient and surgeons an extensive range of personalized solutions.","Sales from our hip business increased by 0.5% in the first quarter, including positive volume and mix of 2.2% and negative price of 1.7%. Our hip revenues grew by 2.9% in the Asia Pacific region, increased by 1.3% in the Americas and decreased by 2.2% in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region compared to the prior-year period.","In the quarter, we were pleased with the growth of our Taperloc Complete System as well as our revision portfolio and solutions that leverage our vivacity and E1 Vitamin E infused advanced bearing materials. We also expanded the G7 Acetabular System with the introduction of the G7 Dual Mobility construct and strengthened our options for the rise in adoption of the anterior supine surgical approach with the introduction of the Echo Bi-Metric Microplasty stem. These product additions along with the balance of our comprehensive hip portfolio continue to position this business for renewed growth.","Turning to our SET category. Revenues increased 0.2% over the prior-year period. Strong U.S. sales of our A.T.S., Automated Tourniquet System, contributed to the growth of our surgical business in the Americas. And we were encouraged by the solid results of our surgical power tools and certain overseas geographies.","The steady growth of our Extremities business, most notably in the Americas and Asia Pacific region also added to our SET revenues. Our SET results were negatively impacted in the quarter by our Trauma performance. We expect to deliver improved growth in the second half of the year with our Trauma business, supported by the increased stabilization and productivity of our commercial channel.","Within Sports Medicine, we continue to be pleased with steady sales of our joint preservation treatments, Gel-One Hyaluronate and the Subchondroplasty Procedure, which was expanded in 2015 to address the growing foot and ankle market. And earlier this week, we announced that we've entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Arizona-based Cayenne Medical. This acquisition, which remains subject to customary closing conditions, will enhance our Sports Medicine capabilities and add a successful portfolio of soft tissue repair and reconstructive solutions for knee, shoulder and extremities procedures.","Our dental sales decreased by 6% in the first quarter, due primarily to headwinds associated with the voluntary product action in the fourth quarter. We expect supply to fully recover by the end of the second quarter. We also continue to make good progress with the ongoing harmonization of our dental commercial channel. Backed by our broad dental portfolio, we're focused on achieving improved results in the second half of year for this business.","First quarter sales from our spine, craniomaxillofacial and thoracic category decreased by 1% from the prior-year period. Our craniomaxillofacial and thoracic team delivered noteworthy growth in the quarter and they continue to generate strong sales of our TraumaOne and SternaLock Blu systems. Additionally, they made great progress with the recently launched RibFix Blu System and the OmniMax MMF System.","In spine, our commercial teams continue to stabilize throughout the first quarter, which supports our confidence for an expected return of growth later this year. We also achieved sales growth for innovative offerings across our spine portfolio, including the Timberline Lateral Fusion System and the Virage OCT Spinal Fixation System. Looking to the future of this business, we're excited for the opportunities represented by our commercial pipeline and focused sales channel.","With that, I'll turn it over to Dan, who will continue this discussion in greater detail as well as review our increased revenue and adjusted earnings guidance. Dan?","Daniel Florin","Thank you, David. I will review our first quarter performance in more detail, and then provide additional information related to our second quarter and full year 2016 sales and earnings guidance.","Our total revenues for the first quarter were $1,904 million, an increase of 1.2% constant currency compared to the first quarter of 2015 on an adjusted pro forma basis. The company recorded the same number of billing days in the quarter as compared to the first quarter of 2015.","Net currency impact for the quarter decreased revenues by 1.6% or $30 million. The negative currency impact for the quarter was related to the ongoing relative strength of the U.S. dollar against many international currencies.","Our adjusted gross profit margin was 75.7% for the quarter and 30 basis points lower when compared to the prior year adjusted pro forma result, due to the impact of foreign exchange and price decline, mostly offset by gains from our cash flow hedging program and a reduction in the expense recognition of the medical device excise tax.","The company's R&D expense was 4.5% of revenue at $85.7 million. As David noted, we commercially launched a dozen new products in the first quarter and we expect to continue to that pace throughout the balance of this year, with introductions coming from across the entirety of our product categories.","Adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses were $716.9 million in the first quarter or 37.7% of sales, 130 basis points lower than the comparable period in the prior year on an adjusted pro forma basis. The positive variance was driven by continued savings in SG&A expense categories, stemming from synergy capture initiatives, which were partially offset by ongoing investments in our specialized sales force, in addition to medical education and training program.","We remain on track to deliver cumulative net EBIT synergies of $225 million by the end of 2016 per our original full year guidance. Synergies realized in the first quarter were in line with our expectation. In the quarter, the company recorded pre-tax charges of $393.6 million in special items, primarily related to the Biomet acquisition as well as integration-related expenses.","Adjusted first quarter 2016 figures in the earnings release exclude the impact of these charges, which includes $285 million of non-cash amortization and inventory step-up charges, as well as $109 million of integration and other costs. A full reconciliation of reported net earnings to adjusted net earnings is included in this morning's press release.","Adjusted operating profit in the quarter amounted to $639.1 million or 33.6% of sales, which was flat when compared to the prior-year period. Net interest expense and other non-operating expense totaled $90.7 million. Adjusted net earnings were $404.3 million for the first quarter, an increase of 51.5% compared to the prior-year period.","Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 29.9% to $2 per share on 202 million weighted average fully diluted shares outstanding. Our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 26.3%. The company had approximately 200.7 million shares of common stock outstanding as of March 31, 2016, increasing from 172.8 million shares as of March 31, 2015, due primarily to the Biomet transaction.","During the quarter, the company invested $415.5 million to repurchase 4.2 million shares. Our share repurchase activity during the quarter was expanded relative to our original guidance and this provided approximately $0.02 of EPS benefit in the quarter.","Operating cash flow for the quarter amounted to $265.2 million, which included $85 million of cash expenditures for integration and initiatives related to our synergy program. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $112.7 million, which included $85.1 million for instrument and $27.6 million for property, plant and equipment.","Free cash flow in the quarter was $152.5 million, which was essentially flat with the first quarter of 2015 and in line with our expectation. During the quarter, the company repaid $400 million on our term loan, leaving $2,100 million outstanding at March 31. And this reflects $900 million of repayment, since the closing of the Biomet transaction.","With that, I'd like to now turn to our guidance. I will provide updated revenue and adjusted earnings per share guidance for the full year and expectations for the second quarter.","For 2016, we now estimate our adjusted pro forma revenue growth to be in the range of 2.0% to 3.0% on a constant currency basis. This update is reflective of our confidence in the ongoing progress of our cross-selling initiatives and increasing sales channel productivity.","Foreign exchange is now expected to decrease revenue by 1% compared to our previous estimate of 2%, with the U.S. dollar weakening modestly across most currency pair. Taken together, reported revenue growth for the year should be in a range of 1.0% to 2.0% or a range of $7,525 million to $7,600 million.","For modeling purposes, we will have you update the fully diluted share count estimates to reflect the noted acceleration and timing of share repurchases embedded in our prior guidance.","We now anticipate the diluted weighted average shares outstanding for the full year to be approximately 202 million shares. Therefore, after updating our assumptions for foreign exchange and our fully diluted share count, our full year adjusted diluted earnings per share is now projected to be in a range of $7.85 to $8.","Our guidance takes into account our noted investment into our sales channel specialization, innovative research and development program and medical education and training to drive sustainable longer-term growth. Our guidance reflects approximately 100 basis points of forecasted operated margin expansion over the prior year on an adjusted pro forma basis.","Now, turning to the second quarter. Including the benefit of slightly more than one extra billing day, which equates to about 180 basis points, we expect constant currency revenues to increase between 3.0% and 4.0%. At this time, assuming currency rates remain where they have been during the first month of this quarter, we anticipate foreign currency translation will decrease our reported second quarter revenues by approximately 1%.","Taken together, reported revenue growth will be in a range of 2.0% to 3.0% for the quarter. Therefore, revenue will be expected to be in a range to $1,885 million to $1,905 million. Lastly, we expect second quarter adjusted earnings per share to be in a range between $1.93 and $1.98.","Finally, please note that our full year guidance reflects the anticipated contribution from our recently announced acquisition of Cayenne Medical, assuming that the transaction closes in the second quarter, which in total represents about 10 basis points of topline growth for the full year. However, our guidance does not include any impacts from other potential business development transaction or unforeseen event.","With that, I'll turn the call back over to David.","David Dvorak","Thanks, Dan. We look forward to building on Zimmer Biomet's first quarter performance throughout the balance of 2016 as well as maintain our progress towards exiting the year at or above market growth rates. We'll continue capitalizing on the growing strength of our commercial organization and our comprehensive musculoskeletal portfolio.","And lastly, we'll also remain focused on sustaining our earnings performance and driving operating margin leverage in 2016, while continuing to meet our financial commitments and exercising disciplined capital allocation.","And now, I'd like to ask Cleona to begin the Q&A portion of our call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We will now take our first question from Matt Taylor from Barclays.","Young Li","This is Young Li in for Matt. I guess to start off, I was wondering if you can maybe talk about some of the initial CJR feedback or experience. Any impact since the program officially started earlier in the month? Understand that various players in the system had time to prepare for it. But is there anything surprising or notable so far that you would like to call out?","Daniel Florin","Well, I would tell you that, Young, first of all we're excited about the opportunity that CJR provides. Going back a decade now we've been building out a comprehensive set of not only implant solutions, but services in a comprehensive nature in anticipation of a world that would be more consistent with what CJR is contemplating, that is how do we go about developing deeper partnerships with customers to bring higher quality of care in the most cost-efficient way possible.","Our acquisition going back nine years ago of Accelero and the services they bring to their patient flow are focused exclusively on that area. And we've been able to bridge technologies and still more services to help develop those partnerships and build out a comprehensive care package that gets into patient engagement earlier in that episode of care, all the way through post acute care with rehabilitative services.","And coming back to your question, that last area is probably where the light is going off in our customer conversation, with realizations that as much as 40% of the cost of care is incurred post acute, so the rehabilitation end of joint replacement. I would tell you that the customers are in different places right now, and their level of developing plans that are truly going to be responsive to the economic model that they're going to be living within going forward, so the early adopters and more progressive thinkers have been very sophisticated and were far long in developing key partnerships and enhancing their capabilities to be prepared for that day.","Others are coming to grips with the reality that over time their world is going to shift away from fee-for-service. But in any event, we feel like we have a lot to offer with a full portfolio of solutions and services in that context. And it is the case, I do believe that as I was just referencing, that it's caused more energy on the customer part to be focused over to the post-acute care dimension of delivering the total joint solution.","Young Li","I guess regarding the trauma weakness in the quarter that you called out, can you go into a little bit more detail as to what drove that? Is it impact from weather or any weakness in geographies you want to call out?","David Dvorak","I don't think that this is much of a market dynamic as it is us rebuilding momentum and focus within the commercial execution side. We have a very strong portfolio. It is the case that weather and other external drivers can impact the trauma market, but I don't think that that usually measures up to be anything more than 100 basis points or 200 basis points.","So we are highly confident as we continue to build out specialized sales force within that category on a global basis, that is, and continue the cross-selling training on the product side, that we're going to show material improvements in that business unit as we progress through 2016.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bob Hopkins from Bank of America.","Bob Hopkins","Two questions; one thing that really struck me was your guidance for revenue growth in the second quarter. You were calling for some very nice acceleration there. And I was wondering if you could just talk about some of the things that you see really driving that acceleration in the second quarter versus the first? Is that on the hip and knee side, is it across the portfolio? I assume a little bit of it's in dental. Just maybe talk about the really nice acceleration you expect in Q2?","David Dvorak","We referenced just so you have an apples-to-apples comparison sequentially, Bob, the impact of billing days. So there is an enhancement by virtue of billing days in the second quarter, but notwithstanding that, we showed continued progression in our forecast as we displayed from Q4 to Q1 and we just believed that everything that we're doing to stabilize the sales force, to invest in the non-large joint categories, in particular, with expansion of that sales force, the cross-training, the medical training education events, all of that is building towards the progress in each of the product categories.","And so I would tell you that it is very broad-based. Quite literally every geographic segment and every product category is anticipated to improve sequentially between now and the end of the year. And it's one of the reasons that we have such strong confidence in that progression is there isn't a single category that's driving it. Rather, every category is expected to prove in each quarter between now and the balance of the year.","And I think that we're seeing it earlier probably in large joints and it stands to reason that that would be the case with the size of the business and those portfolios and the historic culture being ultra-focused on large joints and knees in particular. So I think knees is out ahead even within large joints of hips, but we are seeing the same signs of continued improvement in hips.","And then I would tell you that the SET category is expected to show some very material improvement beginning in the second quarter and continuing into the second half of the year. It's driven by the cross-sell primarily, but we're starting to lace in, as we begun to emphasize some of the new product introductions too. And as we get into the second half of the year, we'll see some of the early signs of traction with those product launches that went out in the first quarter.","Bob Hopkins","And then one other quickly I want to touch on is just EMEA, is there an action plan. That seemed to be one area in the large joint side that was a little weaker. So maybe is there an action plan to sort of turn that a little bit? And maybe just talk about the prospects for EMEA as you look forward the rest of the year?","Daniel Florin","Yes. You're right. And this is one where we've seen excellent historic progress and generated great results over a long time period and so that team are the proven leaders and winners within that market. So we have all the talent that we need, and in an enhanced portfolio I think it's probably a geographic segment that has had more work to do on the integration front. And if you think about integrating within those jurisdictions, you have work councils and some external pacing items that sort of create inhibitors to getting after the cross-sell opportunity, for example.","We're pushing through those consistent with our plans, and I think that what you saw in Q1, Bob, was the consistent performance, if not on large joints, a bit of sequential improvement from Q4 to Q1. And we expect to see another step in that direction and a pretty significant step up in the SET category. So we have good visibility to improve performance and that ought to stair step in Q2, Q3 and Q4 within EMEA.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley.","David Lewis","I wanted to start off on a financial question for Dan on earnings. I guess, Dan, a couple of things going on here. One, solid quarter, obviously better than our expectations, a little bit. You also have currency going for you, specifically with the yen. And then look, given that you're holding the line on cost and driving synergies, and you had this improving revenue outlook, it just seems to me like with that increased drop through, earnings guidance is a little on the conservative side.","So can you walk me through any headwinds I could be missing? So I just feel like better quarter, better guide, better currency, the guide could have come up more. I appreciate it's early in the year, but there're factors that we're not missing that suggest that we have some earnings headwinds?","Daniel Florin","David I wouldn't call them earnings headwinds, I call them intentional investment to drive topline growth. Smart investments focused at topline growth. So as we have indicated, for example, on the medical device tax, the suspension of that, the reinvestment of that, that's embedded in our guidance --it's still embedded in our guidance.","And then as we look at the balance of the year, with respect to the currency tailwind, we do see opportunities to continue to make investment in our areas of focus such as specialized sales forces, medical education and training globally, but also importantly in the emerging market to sustain that growth.","Our R&D programs, investing in personalized solutions and consultative services that add value across the continuum of care that David spoke about, enhanced instrument deployments to further drive cross-sell, and things of that nature. So as we look at the opportunity to reinvest, we're keenly focused on proper drop-through of better earnings, but also reinvesting that where it make sense to reinvest.","David Lewis","So it's safe to assume you're feeling pretty good about your earnings and cash flow visibility right here?","Daniel Florin","Yes.","David Lewis","And then, David, another obviously thing that we're not expecting was this early in the year to raise your confidence in your organic numbers or constant currency numbers for the business on the top line. Our sense is there's two dynamics going on here, in the first quarter.","One is, the market certainly feels a little better in reconstruction, based on some of your peers, but it also does appear on the margin you're narrowing the gap from a competitive share loss. Can you sort of talk to us about those two dynamics? How you feel about the market how you feel about narrowing your share gap?","David Dvorak","Sure, David. Both of those dynamics are very accurate. We have seen, particularly in the U.S., a step-up in large joints. I think that the EMEA market is healthier than what we're currently experiencing as we were just responding to the prior question on that front. So the market is healthy in large joints and we know that we have big opportunities in other product categories as well.","The focus on the large joint categories we have been improving our performance sequentially even above the rate of the improvement in the market growth rates, and so over a 100 basis points of GAAP closure in large joints as a whole, and that's been driven both by U.S. and o U.S. knee improvement. We see the U.S. knees improving about 70 basis points relative to market performance; o U.S. knees improving about 160 basis points relative to market.","And U.S. hips as well going from Q4 to Q1 improved about 120 basis points, so those GAAP closures are really important measures, as you referenced, but it's always nice to be participating in a robust market itself. And both of those factors contribute to the visibility that we have to improve the performance and close the GAAP, and as a consequence raise our guidance for the full year to the 2% to 3%.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joanne Wuensch from BMO Capital Markets.","Joanne Wuensch","One of the things that we've been seeing a lot has been sort of that strength in the overall market for medical devices. And again, I apologize if you have gone into this already, is that what you're witnessing also? And if so, do you have a theory why?","Daniel Florin","I think that the fundamental demographic drivers, Joanne, I think we are seeing healthy markets stable. There is a bit of an offset obviously as everyone else has been discussing relative to certain of the emerging market. The Latin America headwinds are still real consistent with expectations coming into the year. The Q4 and Q1 have been healthy markets in the developed countries and we certainly have benefitted from them. We look to benefit to a greater extent as the quarters progress in 2016 with our execution.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Mike Matson from Needham & Company.","Mike Matson","I was just wondering if you could maybe give us an update on where you stand with the efforts to develop your specialized sales forces. I know you've been focusing more on that since you completed the merger with Biomet?","Daniel Florin","Sure. We have a good pipeline and we've made progress even in the first quarter in that regard. Mike, right now, outside of large joints on a global basis, we have round numbers 2,000 sales reps exclusively focused in the other categories. And between now and the balance of the decade, we look to expand that sales force in a material fashion and 2016 represents our first installment. So you could measure our plans in the hundreds in that regard. In 2016, we're tracking consistent with that plan.","Step one was obviously the second half of 2015 to make the integration steps and stabilize those sales forces. We've rebuilt the pipeline of talent and that talent is coming to fruition, so we're in a net add position as of Q1 even, and we will look to accelerate that for the balance of the year. So I feel like we're executing those plans very well and we're already seeing some of the early signs of traction. It's part of what gives us confidence and accelerated topline growth between now and the balance of the year.","Mike Matson","And then just in the trauma business, this seems like a market where having scale and breadth is really critical, and I was just wondering now, with Biomet products in the mix, do you feel like you've got the critical mass to really compete against the leaders DePuy and Stryker?","David Dvorak","We absolutely are confident that we do. We have the existing portfolio to complete effectively. And you're right, scale does matter and in this category, the level ones and the level twos demand, comprehensive portfolios, and it's tough to be a niche player in that phase. And the combination greatly enhances our competitiveness within trauma.","The other thing that it does is, and it's consistent across some of the other non-large joint categories for us, it puts us in a position to continue to innovate in a more diversified way and get after some of the higher risk, higher return projects to address on that needs in that category.","And so rest assured that not only do we expect to execute with the current portfolio in an effective manner, but our pipeline is going to be more diverse than it's ever been and the scale gives us that opportunity. So we would look to address on that needs and push out really to establish ourselves as true innovators within the trauma space in due time.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Roman of Goldman Sachs.","David Roman","I wanted just to start with a comment you made in response to a prior question regarding reinvesting some of the better expected top line performance, as well as the earnings upside in Q1. Can you maybe give us a little bit more detail on where those dollars are going, whether that's on the sales and marketing side, or R&D? When you would expect us to see a return on that incremental investment?","Daniel Florin","I responded earlier in terms of the types of investments, so there were clearly be a focus on the R&D line. So you can expect to see our spend at the R&D line to improve or to expand sequentially as we progresses through the year and that's a fairly broad base sort of investments focused on large joints, SET, programs aimed at our personalized solutions portfolio as we discussed.","You'll also see in the SG&A categories some reinvestment, medical education and training, so that takes the form of training new surgeon around the world, capitalizing on the opportunity that the cross-sell investments in med ed in emerging markets, and specialized sales force, as David just mentioned adding hundreds of incremental focused sales rep particularly in the SET categories, and things of that nature. So I think you'll see it mainly in the R&D line, but also in SG&A as we progress through the year.","David Roman","And then maybe a broader question for David. You've had three quarters since the Biomet transaction was completed, now under your belt. You have seen an improvement in your revenue growth rate. Maybe you could just help us think about what you observed over the past several quarters, and any learnings that you think will inform your go-forward investments that gets you back to that market growth rate, because clearly things are getting better, but still sitting below that 3% level. So what are you seeing in your experience thus far, and are there any changes you're making on your go-forward strategy to help accelerate the pace of getting back to market growth?","David Dvorak","Sure, David. I think we have an opportunity, because of the pendency period that was prolonged for 14 months between signing and closing to do extensive planning. And the teams took advantage of that time and developed extraordinarily detailed integration plans to go after the topline opportunity as well as the operating expense opportunities, and it's pretty clear based upon our execution that we've been able to, if anything, retrieve and realize the operating expense synergies in an accelerated fashion as evidenced by last year's performance in that regard.","I think to your question, you end up with the best visibility one can have in planning those topline opportunities and now we're in a stage where we're executing it. So we're making refinements and part of what Dan is outlining, by the way of reinvestment, would include something like the products that are going, and beyond, in theory having a cross-sell opportunity, we're realizing success.","We're up in production. We're ordering more instruments. And so that's a good example of the reality. With any new product launch, and as we referred to it as sort of the mother of all product launches, you end up having some surprises both negative and positive, and where we see the positive surprises, we're going to fuel that growth.","So we've got a stable channel. We're on a net basis adding sales reps in an intelligent way relative to our opportunity to make sure that our coverage is going to exploit fully the broad bag that we have, and then we're dialing it up in medical training and education and instruments and inventory where we see the growth opportunities because of early traction in the sales force. And that visibility is extraordinarily helpful. It gives us line of sight, as to sequentially between now and the end of the year, what we think we can do.","David Roman","Can I sneak one more quick one in here? Dan, what does it all mean for the cash flow profile of the business, and if you're upping medical training, inventory, et cetera, are you still comfortable with the cash flow guidance you provided last quarter or does this still -- do some of these initiatives soak that up? And then I'll drop.","Daniel Florin","David, we're still comfortable with the previous cash flow guidance that we provided both on an operating and free cash flow basis.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matt Miksic from UBS.","Matt Miksic","I hope I haven't asked a question here that's already been covered, but David, I'd love to get your sense on some of the pricing trends we're seeing in the market have been more favorable. I think at the lower end of your range, it's not the first quarter I think for you and some other folks that reported some similar trends. And I would just love to get a sense of what you think is driving that, or not to diminish less of your pricing, but is it possible that it has anything to do with your year-over-year SKU for SKU calculations with the deal? Any color would be helpful. And I have one follow-up.","Daniel Florin","We're comfortable with the consistency of the calculation and the visibility that's provided. We had had a successful quarter in managing the business in this regard in Q4, and as you know another successful quarter in Q1 of 2016. Some of it has to do with just our forward visibility to contracts and renewals and what's in the pipeline.","And so we came into the year expecting minus 2. We continue to expect something closer to that in subsequent quarters. Q2, Q3 and Q4 of 2016, and contributing to that potential uptick relative to where we were in Q1 is going to be the biannual price adjustment in Japan, which comes online here at the beginning of the second quarter, so that's sort of been quantified. It's consistent with most of the past adjustments, say, in mid-single digits based upon our product mix.","So you can look at that as being the potential for round numbers, a 20 basis points uptick on a consolidated basis, but I think that we're managing the business intelligently. I mean one of the benefits of the combination is the capability with this broad portfolio to product position, and with the breadth of the portfolio and the capability to tier these products and better match the demand, the needs of customers, it puts us in a better position to maintain pricing on premium technologies, for example, across the globe, that is. And with the increased transparency on pricing across the globe, that's a big asset.","So it's a good new story. The teams are taking advantage of that opportunity, but again, its two good quarters in that regard and we don't want to call it a stronger trend at this point in time. That probably does cause us to moderate a bit the negative 2% price expectation coming into the year, but we think that we're going to edge above up the 0.9 that we experienced in Q1, as we move into Q2 and beyond.","Matt Miksic","That's helpful. I appreciate why we wouldn't necessarily want to get too excited about pricing, given where we've been, but that is encouraging. And I had one follow-up on the subject that you talked about, I think earlier in the Q&A, on bundling. Coming out of AAOS, it struck me that, yes, most of the costs that could come out of this bundled payment push, and we're early in that understanding, that is downstream after post-op and rehab, et cetera.","But it also strikes me that you've talked about, I think some of your other larger orthopedic competitors have talked about stepping into the void for some of these networks, to help them understand and deal with managing those downstream costs, which are often out of the hospital or with third-party partners. And so I'd love to understand how you see that playing out in terms of sort of the value you're providing and the benefit that you would hope to get from that sort of expanded relationship in networks, as you sort of team up to get your arms around or get their arms this change?","David Dvorak","It's a big dynamic and a big opportunity, Matt. And it's so consistent with our focus on musculoskeletal care, up and down the continuum and across the episode of care with systems, solutions and services. And this has been our strategy going back for the better part of a decade. So we really do believe, we're uniquely positioned, and these conversations and the partnership that we're entering into reflected that, the breadth of our portfolio and our commitment to developing these partnerships in a manner that adds value is going to be long-term and deep.","I will tell you, every one of those conversations is validating to the work that we've done. As I said, over the last decade, I think that you can envision a day where it's very much the case that the end-to-end patient engagement is something that we're more deeply involved with. And as a consequence of the data and insight that we glean in partnership with customers that are progressive thinkers in this regard that we're mining that data, creating the right treatment algorithms, and the right clinical and economic support that announces where the unmet needs are and the opportunities for continuous improvement on both clinical and economic basis. And that's our vision.","And there are a lot of customers across the globe that share that vision. And I think that, again, there are limited numbers of companies that can sit at the table with the offerings that we have to bring value to that conversation and be able to follow through and deliver. So we're excited about the opportunity and you're going to hear a lot more from us going forward on that front.","Matt Miksic","And just if I could, so to speak -- I'm still on the line here?","David Dvorak","You are.","Matt Miksic","Thanks for that. The difficult part for us, I think, in looking at that engagement is the value exchange. Clearly, I think you can provide value to your larger customers in a way that a smaller player can't and a less broad provider can't. And I guess, how do we think about not to be all about share and compliance and penetration, but how does Zimmer benefit from this over the long term? Is it contracting? How should we think about it?","David Dvorak","I think its deeper partnerships, Matt. And I think that one doesn't want to take too superficial of a view and jump to the monetization of that relationship, rather I think it needs to be about value creation. And if there is true value creation opportunity, we believe that there is true value creation opportunity through those deeper partnerships, there is going to be plenty of opportunity to sharing that upside and broader relationship up and down.","Again, that continuum of care and that episode of care, and you can envision from the point of diagnosis and joint preservation through sports medicine, partial, total, revision, salvage, and the large joint, biological solutions, interventions that make sense both clinically and economically, we are convinced that there is value to be gathered for both parties and all the other stakeholders, and most importantly patients. And if we get that right, we're going to be able to figure the rest of it out.","So that's the mindset that we have in entering into those relationships. A lot of flexibility and agility to get after making a difference for patients, and that's going to redound all the other stakeholders benefits. And we're sure that we'll participate that in an appropriate way.","Robert Marshall","Cleona, we have time for one additional question.","Operator","And our final question comes from Raj Denhoy from Jefferies.","Raj Denhoy","Wonder if I could ask two questions. You did note the gap in joints in the market has certainly improved, which was great to see. But some of the other business, the other 40% of the business continued to lag a bit. And I know you've described your plans for getting those back up. But perhaps you could just describe whether the integration of those businesses has proven to be a bit more challenging perhaps than the large joint side? Is there anything to that or is it really just taking a bit longer?","David Dvorak","I think it's just timing to get after the opportunity more than anything, Raj, as it relates to the SET businesses. The opportunity that we have with this combination to materially enhance the focus from a commercial standpoint is one that we're taking advantage of. And we're going to start to see in the short-term, as in Q2, some of the benefits in the SET categories.","And then you jump outside of the SET categories, down we had a unique event with a field action back in Q4. As we've referenced, we were working through that challenge and Q1 will be out of that challenge by the end of Q2, and that's going to help enhanced the performance of the dental business.","And then as we noted all along, the commercial integration on the spine side was known to be more challenging. And so we're going to like the result, but that one is going to take a quarter or two longer than the large joint. So we're tracking very consistently with what our integration plans contemplated, Raj. And the teams are doing an excellent job from our perspective on the execution front.","Raj Denhoy","Just one last one, just on cash use. The cash flow over the next several years is going to be pretty significant for you guys as well as your access to cash. And in the quarter you did a small deal, but you also bought back a lot of stock. And so really just curious how you were thinking about the balance between those two efforts as well as perhaps paying down debt a bit sooner? Whether your thinking has evolved or really where it stands right now?","Daniel Florin","Raj, I would say that our thinking on that remains as it has been, which is we continue to be interested in smart business development opportunities with a strategic focus remaining on musculoskeletal. We'll remain discipline in that regard. We'll look for targets that leverage our sales channel to drive sustainable growth and maximize shareholder value. And we'll also stay focused and show sustainable and solid returns within a reasonable time horizon.","So I wouldn't think of any shift in that regard. We're still very focused on driving improvements in our free cash flow yield out overtime that will continue to be a focus, and that gives us a lot of flexibility as we progress looking at debt pay down, M&A activity, dividend payment and so on and so forth. So we will stay very disciplined as we always have been.","End of Q&A","David Dvorak","With that, I'd like to thank everyone for joining the call today and for your continued interest and support for Zimmer Biomet. We look forward to speaking with you on our second quarter conference call, which is scheduled for 8:00 AM on July 28. So I'll turn the call back to you, Cleona.","Operator","Thank you, again, for participating in today's conference call.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, October 26, 2018. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Cole Lannum, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and IRO. Please go ahead, sir.","Cole Lannum","Thank you and good morning. Welcome to Zimmer Biomet\u2019s third quarter earnings conference call. I am joined by our President and CEO, Bryan Hanson and our CFO, Dan Florin.","Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our comments during this call will include some forward-looking statements and of course actual results may differ materially from those indicated by forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Please note that we assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements even if actual results or future expectations change materially. Please refer to our SEC filings for a detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties in addition to the inherent limitations of such forward-looking statements. Also the discussions on this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is included within the earnings release found on our website at zimmerbiomet.com and we urge you to take a look at those.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Bryan. Bryan?","Bryan Hanson","Thanks, Cole and I just want to say thanks again for everyone joining us this morning. Overall, we feel pretty good about Q3. We delivered constant currency revenue of 2.3% and I can tell you pretty much across the board when I talked to our team members. We are all encouraged by the progress we are making in a number of areas and I will get into those in a second.","But before I do that with the idea of being fully transparent on the quarter our results actually look a little better than they actually are for a couple reasons. First of all and I think this is probably pretty clear to everyone, we had a pretty easy third quarter comp, which buoyed revenue growth in the quarter obviously and unfortunately that will not continue in the fourth quarter. We have a much more challenging comp in the fourth quarter. In addition to that, we experienced notable timing benefits in the quarter with regard to both tenders and capital sales on the tender front that happened both in Asia-Pacific for us as well as EMEA and on the capital side it was mainly in our S.E.T. business, either way that those buoyed the third quarter results and will come as a result of that with some pressure to the fourth quarter. Good news is we have banked the revenue, which is the most important thing. So even though you are going to move those between quarters, I would much rather have the sale. So as much as we are happy with the third quarter, I believe it\u2019s important to highlight these factors, because I think very importantly, I don\u2019t want my team or you to get too excited that we appear to be at a weighted average market growth for the business.","While we are pleased with the progress we are making, we clearly are not declaring victory and until we sustainably deliver that performance, we won\u2019t. And I still firmly believe this should be a 2020 expectation. So, I guess the overall takeaway should be that our recovery timeline remains on track, but we are going to see some atypical quarterly timing and revenue facing here in the back half. So, my net message is on maintaining the sense of cautious optimism as I expressed in the second quarter and feel good that we are progressing in the right areas. So with that, I would like to provide an update on the short-term priorities that we have been concentrating on since I joined the organization.","Turning first to quality remediation, what I want to say here is that anytime we think about quality remediation, I want to be clear that the number one priority we have as a business than I personally have is patient safety. So as we think about our process in remediation, we will always have patient safety first and foremost on our mind. If I think about the activities specifically, our ongoing efforts remain on track and we continue to keep the FDA updated on our progress. And as we have stated before at this time, our quality remediation does not restrict our ability to produce or ship products out of our factories and as a result of that would not have an impact on our supply recovery sustainability. And importantly, we also continue to believe that with the work that we have in front of us this will not put us in a position that will materially impact our financial forecast or projections.","In the area of supply specifically we are still not exactly where we want to be, but we are making progress and we are going to remain diligent in this area because we want to make sure that our service levels continue to come up, but our progress in this area continues to increase. And as a result of that our comprehensive supply will not be a barrier to accomplishing our 2018 guidance and I think even more importantly our turnaround timeline is higher than ever. Throughout 2019 though what we need to do is to start shift away from our manufacturing folks focusing on just triaging of product supply and begin to focus more diligently on the rigorous approach to reducing costs in our manufacturing facilities, which will eventually lead to margin expansion for the business.","On the commercial side of the business we have continued to build momentum. The combination of stronger sales force engagement, this improving supply that I just talked about, the introduction of new products, all of those pieces coming together are giving our sales organization the traction they need and the traction that we need to be able to keep the organization on pace with the recovery. Relative to new product introductions specifically, we are pleased to see the traction our newly released products are getting pretty much across the board with our surgeons. Notably, we are happy with the growth of Persona Partial Knee which is an important space for us and we are seeing very good uptake on the more recently released Persona TM Tibia. By the way we have now surpassed 1,300 cases in our limited launch process and we feel are getting very positive surgeon feedback.","Our two largest upcoming commercial projects which I get questions on all the time, the Persona Revision system and the Rosa robotics knee application are progressing well versus timeline and as a matter of fact both are waiting on regulatory approval. Regarding Rosa knee specifically, we are excited to be ahead of schedule to perform our first case in Australia. In other areas of innovation earlier this month we announced an exciting new collaboration with Apple and Zimmer Biomet mymobility. This technology as you probably have already heard there are some of the media launches that we have had on this, is really a digital platform that allows the knee and hip patients to be better connected to their caregivers. This is throughout the entire episode of care and what\u2019s unique about it is you can do this by using the Apple Watch in the iPhone that the patient would have.","What we are going to do inside of this is to make sure that we also have a study that will look at the clinical outcomes as a result of using this technology. This will cross thousands of patients that will participate in the study and as a result of this will be one of the largest evidence gathering clinical studies in orthopedics history. I can tell you through this study and in collaboration with Apple, we absolutely look at changing the patient journey for knee and hip procedures and I think ultimately as a result this will set of new standard in digital healthcare for our space. As these and other new products expand our clinical offerings, I feel even more confident that our portfolio\u2019s capability will be there to differentiate us from the competition and ultimately as a result of that help to drive the future growth of the business.","Because our primary goal is in fact driving revenue growth, I want to stress that we will continue to invest in appropriate growth initiatives and that we expect those investments to increase over the next several quarters not decrease. These initiatives are already having an impact and will be crucial to achieving the goals that we have for consistent at-market or better growth by 2020. In addition, we continue to look aggressively at active portfolio management opportunities that further diversify our portfolio and ultimately as a result of that bring up the weighted average market growth of our business.","Turning to our culture building initiatives, we have been on an absolute tear relative to this area. We have held mission ceremonies with thousands of our team members over the past six months since we launched the new mission. And I would say that these are very impactful. We come in do a mission ceremony and present in person the mission and guiding principles of this organization. To-date we have met with nearly half of the organization to personally engage with them on the one mission, one culture focus of this business. As much I am happy about that progress, I look forward to reaching every team member with this important message over the coming quarters. So overall, though we still don\u2019t clearly have a lot of work ahead of us, we have made great progress, pretty much across everyone of our top priorities.","And so with that, I am going to turn the call over to Dan to get into our financials.","Dan Florin","Thank you, Bryan. To start off, in addition to Bryan\u2019s comments about our third quarter performance, I would like to point out a few other items that will impact your models. First, I want to highlight a couple of headwinds affecting our revenues including some specific pressure on our other revenue line in addition to the foreign exchange. There are also a couple of items below our operating income that will benefit us over the next several quarters as we expect both our net interest expense and our effective tax rate to come in lower than previously expected.","Turning first to revenues, our results will be impacted by disruption related to the pending termination of our U.S. distribution agreement with a bone cement supplier. This matter is still evolving and is currently in litigation. At this time, we anticipate the termination of this distribution agreement may have a negative impact of between $10 million and $15 million per quarter on our other revenue line beginning in the fourth quarter. Importantly, we are actively working to mitigate this issue by transitioning our customers to our internally produced bone cement, but we still expect the net impact will be a revenue headwind over the next several quarters. Regarding FX, the strengthening U.S. dollar over the last several months will continue to put pressure on reported revenues and earnings. To put this in perspective, while our organic revenue growth in the third quarter was above our expectations, the negative FX impact was about 100 basis points worse than previously expected and we expect a similar impact for the next several quarters.","Turning to items below operating income, as you model our net interest expense, you should expect modest declines from the $68 million that we reported this quarter. In addition, we have taken advantage of further tax planning opportunities, which is primarily why you see the third quarter tax rate coming in lower than expectations. Because of this, we now expect the tax rate for the full year to be below our prior guidance range. While the points I just discussed will likely move some specific line items in your models, we do not expect dramatic changes to 2018 earnings. In other words, the positive effect of tax and interest will largely offset the negative FX impact that we are seeing in 2018.","Turning now to our detailed third quarter results, net sales totaled $1.837 billion, an increase of 1.3% over the prior year period, which represents an increase of 2.3% on a constant currency basis. On a similar basis in the Asia-Pacific region, our sales increased by 7.6%, Americas sales increased by 1.7%, and our Europe, Middle East and Africa sales were flat.","Moving down the income statement, GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.79, adjusted earnings per share were $1.63, adjusted operating margin came in at 25.6%, including an adjusted gross margin of 71.6%. A reconciliation of reported net earnings to adjusted net earnings is included in this morning\u2019s press release. These adjusted results exclude $247 million of expenses in the quarter, approximately $148 million of which are non-cash charges primarily related to intangible amortization. The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 16.5%, which brings our year-to-date adjusted effective tax rate to 18.6%. Operating cash flow for the quarter amounted to $484 million and our free cash flow was $345 million. Year-to-date free cash flow totaled $1.49 billion. We paid down $300 million of debt in the quarter bringing our year-to-date total debt pay-down to $900 million.","With that, let me turn the call back to Bryan.","Bryan Hanson","Thanks, Dan. As you have just heard, we are pleased with our progress and I think more importantly and more broadly that the entire Zimmer Biomet team is coming together as one Zimmer Biomet and I can\u2019t stress enough how important that is for us to be able to have sustained performance in the business. And overall, our achievement in the third quarter even though it looked a little better than it was clearly is showing that we have confidence that we are on track with our turnaround and ultimately positioning the company for long-term value creation.","And so with that, I am going to go ahead and turn it back over to Cole and move into Q&A session.","Cole Lannum","Thanks, Bryan. Before we start the Q&A session, I want to remind everyone once again to please limit yourself to a single question with a brief follow-up if needed in the past, I think that\u2019s worked very well to get as many as people in and as many questions as we possibly can do and that\u2019s our goal today. Obviously feel free to put yourself back in queue afterwards, I promise we will get through as many questions as possible and we get to you if we can. With that operator, may we please have the first question?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Amit Hazan with Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Amit Hazan","Great. Thanks. Good morning, guys. So just a question maybe start with gross margin considerations for \u201819 and \u201820 leverage, thinking about leverage from volumes and costs, if I adjust the negative price headwinds, it does appear as though you\u2019ve had some positive volumes really all year in hips and knees, and if that's so, does that potent better gross margin next year? Just trying to get a sense of where volume growth needs to be for you to start seeing leverage? And then relatedly, when do you expect to start seeing the benefit from the rigorous approach to reducing costs in manufacturing facilities that you mentioned, can that be a 2019 event? Thanks.","Dan Florin","Okay, Amit. This is Dan. Let me first start by saying that we\u2019ve talked extensively about the pressures on gross margin and the fact that we expect those pressures to continue through 2019. And that the primary driver of that is the same driver, which is elevated production costs predominately out of the North Campus facility. And recall that we\u2019ve talked about not only the incurrence of elevated production costs that is tied together with the quality remediation work that we're doing in that factory and the fact that our accounting policy is such that we capitalize those costs and they flow through the income statement as we sell that inventory. So, there's about a one-year lag between incurrence of variances and getting the full impact in the P&L of those variances. So that works the same way as we drive cost improvement. So, as we drive cost improvement, it goes on the balance sheet and then it takes a full-year before that\u2019s fully through the income statement. So, that's why there is a delayed impact from benefit and a delayed impact from incurrence. So, as we sit here through 2019, we\u2019re still going to be incurring the full run rate of those elevated costs throughout 2019. Now our new Head of Operations, Ken Tripp continues to bring in additional resources and as that team triages away from focus on supply recovery, the team will start to pivot towards significant cost reduction activity. We expect that pivot to occur next year, and so I would not expect any gross margin benefit in 2019 through those efforts, that\u2019s more of a 2020 impact to the income statement.","Bryan Hanson","Thanks, Amit. Next question, please.","Operator","Our next question is from Bob Hopkins with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Bob Hopkins","Oh, great. Thank you. Can you hear me okay?","Bryan Hanson","Yes.","Dan Florin","Yes, Bob.","Bryan Hanson","Loud and clear, Bob.","Bob Hopkins","Great. Thanks. Thanks, good morning. So, I\u2019ll just lay my questions out here. So quickly for Bryan, I was wondering, if you could just touch on two good things for us. Just maybe for you specific on when you think the supply issues will be fully behind you and also I heard some comments on the robot, but just to be clear when do you expect the full launch of the robotic platform for Total Knee? And then for Dan, the one thing I\u2019d love you touch on is that, when you think about the things you\u2019ve got affecting the income statement going forward, you've got tax rate and your spending and clearly currency is an impact, but the Street is modeling roughly 3.5% earnings growth for 2019, do you think the Street is accurately capturing all those moving pieces? Thanks very much?","Bryan Hanson","Alright, great. So, Bob, I want to go and get started on the more than one question that you asked.","Dan Florin","We\u2019ll discuss that after.","Bryan Hanson","But let me start with the \u2013 with supply. I think first of all, I want to be very clear and just kind of reiterate something I've been saying, I absolutely do not see supply as being a barrier to achieving our 2018 targets that we have and I think probably even most importantly, to getting to our turnaround timeline, so, I don't see supply as being a barrier to these things. At the same time, I\u2019m not happy with where we are. The fact is, we need to continue to focus on bringing up our service levels to our customers. We need to be best-in-class in this area. And I got to say, to be able to do that, what I want to hear is my sentiment from the sales organization begins to match some of the backorder reduction in the inventory building that we\u2019re doing and until I get that sentiment at a place where everybody feels confident that they have the inventory they need to go after offensive situations, we\u2019re not there yet. So that\u2019s where we are. In addition to this, we've got to start spending a little more time evaluating the portfolio that we have. One of the best things about our portfolio was the scale. It\u2019s absolutely unmatched. It\u2019s the best portfolio largest portfolio out there, but the promise we have had is it also inhibits our ability to have best-in-class service levels. The fact is we have got to start reducing the size of the portfolio, because it creates a very complex supply chain for us. And I am not going to say that we are going to be able to just out of the gate, because we still have to focus on our short-term priorities, but we have got to look at reducing the number of product families we have, because the number of SKUs attached to those product families is extremely cumbersome. And by the way when we do this, not only does it help service levels, it also has peripheral impact to other financial benefits and efficiencies for the organization. So again, I don\u2019t feel like that we are ever going to where I want to be on service levels until we start to call back the portfolio that we have.","And as Dan mentioned before, it is critical though that as we come into 2019, this whole triaging activity that we have around making sure supply is there, has gotten to be shifted. That focus has got to be shifted to cost reduction activities, because as Dan mentioned, the capitalization cycle says that once you start those projects, you don\u2019t get full advantage of them for a year. So 2019 has got to be that pivot period for us to be able to get after cost reductions and stop focusing so much on this triaging of product supply. So on the robot, I mentioned that we are ahead of schedule actually and I will give you a little more color on that. We actually had 5 cases that we were able to do in Australia and I want to be clear that this is the beginning now right of us getting out and actually doing cases, actual surgical cases and this is ahead of schedule. There is no question, it\u2019s ahead of schedule. First of all, I just want to say that when I referenced ahead of schedule, I want to be clear. That gives me confidence that the overall project is on track that we don\u2019t have a lot of risk in the project, but I wouldn\u2019t get too excited about the fact that it\u2019s ahead of schedule. I have said in the past whether we limited launch in the fourth quarter or the first quarter, it doesn\u2019t really make the big difference to the rollout plan and I don\u2019t think it will have a material impact on our revenue results, but I am pretty happy with the fact that we are ahead of schedule right now, because that clearly tells us we are in the right place and now we are waiting on regulatory approval in the U.S.","Also, little more color on the procedures in Australia. We did 5 procedures in one surgical day with one surgeon, so think about that, that\u2019s 5 procedures which is pretty decent low for a surgeon in a typical surgeon, surgery day with one surgeon and that would speak to the efficiency that we are looking to bring to the table with our robotic system and this is the first time if the surgeon has used the system in the operating room. So not only are we ahead of schedule, but that\u2019s a pretty good stat that we feel good about. The thing I do want to concentrate on though in answering your question specifically is I do want to think about this as being kind of a back half full launch of 2019. This is consistent with what I have been saying we are going to have the full product portfolio in the back half of 2019 that then positions the sales organization to go on 100% offense and then ultimately that keep us in line with that 2020 turnaround, which is where we are going to be at weighted average market growth consistently. And I think that\u2019s important. One of the things I will say though is that full offense that I am talking about I don\u2019t expect this to be in full offense with a similar portfolio offering as everybody else. I truly do believe as we continue innovations like the collaboration with Apple as we leverage the differentiation we already have with things like Persona and we have that full product portfolio, I believe that we are going to be differentiated versus our competition and we are going to bring more ammunition to the pipe. At the end of the day, we are not here to play, we are here to win and I truly do believe this portfolio is going to position us to do that.","Dan Florin","And Bob, with respect to 2019, first and foremost to be clear we are not providing 2019 guidance on today\u2019s call, we will do that in the coming months. But let me try to provide some color to help folks with their models. First, with respect to revenue at current FX rates as we look to 2019, there will be more than 100 bps of headwinds on reported revenues in 2019 versus 2018 and I mentioned the bone cement transition that also will be a bit of a headwind for the next several quarters as I said in my prepared remarks. On the positive side, as Bryan just said, continued supply recovery, the important new launches that we have coming all feed a growing momentum in the base business. With respect to earnings per share for 2019, again some headwinds and some positives; first, with respect to headwinds just relative to our last earnings call if you look at the combination of foreign currency and the bone cement issue together those represent about a $0.15 per share headwind for 2019, with probably more than half of that coming in the first half of the year. I spoke to gross margin earlier that will continue to be pressured through 2019 as well for the reasons I have discussed and importantly we are going to continue to invest in the business for growth as we have been talking about. Now on the positive side, again relative to our last earnings call, we do anticipate lower interest expense and a slightly lower tax rate through 2019, which will make up for some of that incremental EPS pressure coming from FX and bonus amount. And we will continue to work through the other moving parts in the 2019 financial model. And when you put that all together for the reasons that I have stated, I would not expect operating margins to expand in 2019, but again we will provide more specifics when we provide 2019 guidance.","Cole Lannum","Thanks. Next question please.","Operator","Our next question is from Josh Jennings with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.","Josh Jennings","Hi, good morning. Thanks gentlemen. I was hoping to just follow-up Bryan on your comments about portfolio rationalization and just to get a sense of have you taken advantage of some supply constraints to begin the rationalization of the portfolio, I think you are coming up on the third year anniversary just pass through the anniversary of the Biomet acquisition and just wanted to hear some more details around how you are going to pursue that process and does that risk your return to the weighted average market growth that you are pursuing? Thanks for taking the question.","Bryan Hanson","Yes. Josh I appreciate the question. So it wouldn\u2019t risk our Pursuit of that weighted average market growth if we do it the right way. Here is \u2013 first of all we have reduced certain SKUs already, we are just not anywhere near where we need to be. In reality we have got to be cautious at how fast we pursue it because let\u2019s say we have had supply issues as an organization for all the reasons that we have referenced in the past, the worst thing we can do right now when we have been stressing our surgeon partners because of the supply issue is the start taking away products they know and love. And so we do have a sequence this thing appropriately, get to that place where we feel confident that supply is in good shape that our field sales organization feels the same way as well as our surgeon partners. And at that point we begin the process of removing families that don\u2019t make sense anymore with the strategy that we have. But to do those concurrently it would put too much pressure on our ability to service our customers and I think we frustrated customer right now, that\u2019s the reason why we are pacing it. I just throw it out there because it is something we will have to tackle as an organization to be able to get to the service levels that I would expect of our organization. So that\u2019s kind of where we stand with it right now, it\u2019s something we are going to pursue we just got to sequence it in the right way.","Cole Lannum","Next question please.","Operator","Our next question is from Rick Wise with Stifel. Please go ahead.","Rick Wise","Good morning. Let me start with \u2013 I will just ask my three questions as well, FDA basically Bryan what\u2019s next, where are we, are you feeling encouraged that the progress you are making there. And maybe a question for Dan, Dan obviously free cash flow, debt pay down as the priority, maybe just help us think in broad terms about free cash flow driving initiatives and how we might think about if u are generating a couple of billion and round numbers of free cash flow this year, what that might look like in \u201819 and beyond? Thank you.","Bryan Hanson","Alright and great, Rick. I will start with the FDA, really nothing more than what I had in my prepared remarks. The fact is we are diligently pursuing the remediation activities that we need to put in place. We are on track with the timeline that we would have expected for that remediation. We continue to put patient safety first and foremost in our mind. I just want to make sure that I say that, if we ever feel that we have a risk to patients that would change the trajectory of that remediation. Certainly we don\u2019t feel that way and that\u2019s why we feel we are on track. So and again to the extent that we can we are trying to keep the FDA informed with everything that we are doing and make sure that we stay as close to them as possible. But I guess that\u2019s really all I have to say. We are on track with the remediation timeline and we feel confident with where we are in that process.","Dan Florin","And Rick with respect to free cash flow and debt paydown, year-to-date, our free cash flow is $1.049 billion. So, good free cash flow for the first three quarters of this year, so we\u2019re on track to deliver free cash flow in line with the guidance that we provided at the beginning of the year. And clearly, our priority as we\u2019ve been saying in terms of what we do with that free cash flow is to pay down debt and pay the dividend, that's really the \u2013 where our focus is. We\u2019ve talked also in the past about capital allocation first-and-foremost to pay down debt to get leverage inside of three times, we\u2019ve talked a lot about that. And we have a host of free cash flow initiatives that we've been executing last year, this year and we\u2019ll continue to do so, everything from basic working capital improvements to productivity of instrumentation and those will continue certainly as we look at our cash thresholds particularly the quality remediation burn rate. We expect that to start to wind down through next year that will be a source of free cash flow as well. So, we still feel as part of the turnaround that we\u2019ve talked about that our increased financial flexibility will start to show itself exiting next year.","Cole Lannum","And Rick, you threw out a number of a couple of billion in free cash flow in line with what Dan just said, while I look forward to the day when that is the correct number. I just want to clarify here that Dan\u2019s comment earlier on our free cash flow expectation for the year, which remains unchanged is $1.2 billion to $1.35 billion, just a little bit south of the $2 billion number that you threw out there. Operator, next question please.","Operator","Our next question is from David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","David Lewis","Good morning. So, just questions for Bryan and they\u2019re all kind of centered around growth. So, Bryan I'm just trying to align a couple of messages. You\u2019ve talked about not being able to sustainably grow 2% to 3% until 2020, but you're also making progress. So, my way of math is next year's numbers should be somewhere between 2% and 3% on the high-end obviously not going to get there, but better than the growth rates you're putting up in 2018. Could you just talk about the messaging for the fourth quarter, first of all, is that likely to slow from the third quarter, and is it a reasonable assessment to think about 1.5% to 2% next year is somewhere between 18 and 2% to 3%. And then related to that, this particular quarter spine was the only business, frankly, that didn\u2019t take a step forward. Can you just sort of talk to us about the distributor challenges in spine and how they may reverse themselves next year? Thanks so much.","Bryan Hanson","Sure.","Cole Lannum","Before we get there, I want to remind people again, guys, one question per caller, please don\u2019t make me come in and do this anymore. It really helps. Bryan, please continue.","Bryan Hanson","Okay. So David, just maybe I\u2019ll start with the revenue growth discussion. So, in the fourth quarter you're accurate. I think what we\u2019re trying to get everybody to recognize is that we will likely see less growth or we\u2019ll see less growth in the fourth quarter revenue growth rate than we did in, in Q3. So your assumption there is accurate, that is the message we\u2019re trying to send. Lot of that has to do with the timing that we referenced and also the cement issue that Dan talked about. When I think about beyond that we haven't given any guidance at this point beyond 2018, but I want to continue to reference the fact that I do believe that the turnaround would require us to be in that 2% to 3% consistently. I expect that to happen in 2020. And obviously, if we\u2019re saying that would happen in 2020 consistently then it would be some number below that in 2019. We haven't given specific guidance, but when the time is right, we will. Relative to the spine distributor, a situation I think we\u2019re progressing pretty well to be honest. Just remember, we have a complete restructuring of the channel that is ongoing as we\u2019re delivering the numbers that we are. So, what the risk would have been inside of this is as you\u2019re doing it, you actually see a deceleration in that growth. And the fact that we\u2019re maintaining the growth rates that we are tell us that we\u2019re kind of driving down the street changing the fan belt at the same time and it's working. And so I\u2019m pretty happy with the progress that the team has put into place. And I expect as we work through the end of this year, we\u2019ll be in a place we need to be with the sales channel. And the hope is from that point we can begin to accelerate, but the fact that we're staying where we are while we\u2019re making all of these changes is actually a positive thing. Dan?","Dan Florin","Yes, I have nothing to add. I mean, I agree with what Bryan said with respect just to reiterate the fact that our revenue guidance for 2018 remains unchanged other than updating our FX assumptions is the only thing I would add to what Bryan just said.","Cole Lannum","Thanks. Next question please.","Operator","Our next question is from Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Isaac Ro","Good morning. Thanks. Bryan, just want to try and get a little clarification on your comment to the beginning of the call with regards to the timing benefits you got from some of the tendering capital sales items. Could you maybe try and quantify a little bit what that meant to the quarter, so that as we look at next year we have the right comp in mind? Thank you.","Bryan Hanson","Yes. So, I purposely didn\u2019t give a specific number there, but I will give you some color around it. Dan referenced the fact that in the fourth quarter we are going to be challenged a bit on the cement side of our business just given the distribution change that\u2019s happening. You referenced that would be between $10 million and $15 million. What I would tell you was that when I think about the comps, not the comps, but when I think about the timing issues for both tenders and capital, if I combine those it\u2019s a number smaller than that, it\u2019s a number smaller than that. So, the benefit that we received in Q3 is something under that range and the pressure that we will receive in Q4 will be the same thing, something under that range.","Isaac Ro","Thank you.","Cole Lannum","Thank you. Next question please.","Operator","Our next question is from Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Robbie Marcus","Great. Thanks for taking the question. Bryan, when you took over the CEO role at Biomet Zimmer, you said that part of the challenge was regaining the trust of your physician users, but also the internal sales force. Can you kind of give us an update on where both of those stand, because there are key components to the turnaround story? Thanks.","Bryan Hanson","Yes. I appreciate the question, Robbie. So, I think we are moving well. One of the things that I referenced in my prepared remarks is we have got a few things working in our favor when we look at the commercial organization and as a result of that, our surgeon population as well. We are getting better engagement with the commercial team. There is no question that, that engagement is increasing and it\u2019s being felt across the board. I will say that this is a continuous improvement game and will never be where I want us to be, but if I just think of where we are now from an engagement standpoint with the sales organization versus when I started, I think anyone you ask would say that it\u2019s better and I would say much better than it was, but we will not stop there, we will continue to make sure that we improve in that area. And then of course outside of engagement, supply recovery certainly helps put a positive in the sales reps arm in new products. We have been on track with the new products that we have been referencing. We have been on time. And when you are on time with new products that gives the sales organization alike to what they need to drive the organization forward. And I think the combination of those things is really what\u2019s changing the engagement and the feeling that you have in the commercial organization. We are not where we want to be. We still have opportunity for improvement, but it\u2019s definitely moving in the right direction. And I would say the same with our surgeon partners.","Cole Lannum","Thanks, Robbie and thanks for sticking to the one question. Next question please, operator.","Operator","Our next question is from Craig Bijou with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead.","Craig Bijou","Thanks. Good morning, guys. Just want to ask on the recon market, so if we collectively look at you guys and maybe some of your competitors that have already announced the recon market books may look a little bit better in Q3 and recognizing that comps are little bit easier. So just wanted to see what your general thoughts on the overall market, did you see any improvement in the market and anything else pricing or anything else that you saw for the ortho market in the quarter?","Bryan Hanson","Yes. It\u2019s \u2013 I usually try to stay away from many of these strength or weakness from a market perspective in a quarter. The fact is we delivered a little better results than we expected in the quarter. Some of that was due to the timing that I referenced before. Some of it is just natural momentum in the business that we are getting based on the other things that I have referenced. But there isn\u2019t anything in particular that I am hearing from my sales organization that would indicate that we saw strength that would be unusual in the quarter. I really do think that for all organizations it was a relatively easy comp in the quarter that made the market look a little stronger than maybe it actually was, but again nothing that I saw in the quarter, I think Dan you probably feel the same way that would indicate to us that there is unusual strength that we could count on moving forward.","Dan Florin","Yes, I agree. And just with respect to pricing, pricing continues to be very stable. So pricing for Q3 for us was a negative 2.4%, which was in line with if you look back to full year 2017 was negative 2.5% and Q2 was negative 2.5% as well, so very stable price declines in that 2.5% type range.","Craig Bijou","Thanks guys.","Cole Lannum","Thank you. Next question, please.","Operator","Our next question is from Steven Lichtman with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.","Steven Lichtman","Thank you. Hi, guys. I just want to follow-up on spine, you talked about the distributor work you are doing. Can you update us on the state of the pipeline there, but you have a number of things coming out in 2019, I think ROSA on spine, perhaps in expandable cages, can you just give us your overall state of the pipeline within spine? Thanks.","Bryan Hanson","Yes. I would tell you as you said, the new products is everything for an organization and that to have the channel in the right structure as we exit this year, we are going to be able for the first time to actually have in a while to have a kickoff meeting with the spine organization. And I\u2019d tell you when you have a kickoff meeting with an organization that\u2019s ready to go and you introduced new products that there is serious energy that comes out of that and that\u2019s what we expect to be able to do. One of the biggest things that people are excited about obviously is to be able to bring robotics to spine. We are still on track with what we have been saying. We are also waiting on regulatory approval for that spine application for ROSA. And for that reason, we are still on track with what we have been expecting, but yes, we have got new products coming, we have got the channel in the right place and we are going to have our first kickoff in a while with that team coming up here in the beginning of the year.","Cole Lannum","Thanks, Steve. Next question please.","Operator","Our next question is from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Larry Biegelsen","Good morning, guys. Dan, I wanted to ask about the implied Q4 guidance, just maybe you can help me with some numbers here. I am getting to about negative 2% reported FX, about negative 2% and flat constant currency at the midpoint? And then on EPS, the range is relatively wide, $0.20, so why such a wide range should we be thinking about the midpoint at this point? Thanks for taking the questions.","Cole Lannum","So, Larry, let me jump in there. I mean, let me be clear on this. We have been clear all year. We are not going to give specific quarterly guidance nor should you ever assume a midpoint being a more likely number than any other number in the range. While offline I am more than happy to take you through all the different puts and takes that we have talked about publicly here and get you through the numbers. We are not going to speak to specific numbers or answering questions about guiding to a specific number in a quarter, we are just not going to go there.","Bryan Hanson","And I would just add, agree with Cole and we have provided a fair bit of information that should enable you to model Q4 revenue and EPS for that matter. And just to reiterate that our revenue guidance remains unchanged other than updating our FX assumptions for the year.","Cole Lannum","Yes, Bryan. I think Bryan specifically had talked about the number of things that affected the third quarter, will affect fourth quarter. I think directionally we are giving you a lot of color here. And in fact we are giving you a lot of color about 2019 in an environment where we are not even giving specific 2019 guidance yet, but I think we are going to draw the line there and not get anymore specific qualitatively, okay. Next question please.","Operator","Our next question is from Glenn Novarro with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Glenn Novarro","Hi, good morning. Just wanted to clarify, Bryan, the 2% to 3% goal weighted \u2013 to get back to 2% to 3% revenue growth by 2020, can you get there through the internal pipeline, it sounds like you may need some acquisitions to get there and if so will you be in a position to do acquisitions in 2019? Thank you.","Bryan Hanson","Yes. Thanks, Glenn. So no, I think that the 2% to 3% is with the current pipeline. I feel that\u2019s our weighted average market growth. It is what we should be able to get to with our current pipeline. In reality, I would like to see us with the current pipeline be able to do more than, to be able to take share. But what you can count on typically is that you should at least be able to be at your weighted average market growth if you are firing on all cylinders if not higher. When I talk about active portfolio management, it\u2019s because I don\u2019t like the idea of our weighted average market growth being 2% to 3% and the active portfolio management would be focused on getting us in the spaces that are higher growth rate than that build scale in those spaces and ultimately as a result of that increase, our weighted average market growth. So that active portfolio management would be fully intended to get us above the 2% to 3% growth rate.","Glenn Novarro","Okay, great. Thanks, Bryan.","Cole Lannum","Thank you, Glenn. Operator, can we have the next question please?","Operator","Our next question is from Larry Keusch with Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Larry Keusch","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Just two questions here. Just you referenced and this is not the first time obviously, but you have referenced increase in investment spending as you move forward. So maybe just talk a little bit about where that investment is going and perhaps, Bryan, some broader thoughts on your innovation engine and how you are thinking about that? And then the second question is just how do you differentiate growth in the total knee application versus sort of any of the other technologies that are sitting out there?","Bryan Hanson","Okay, great. So when I talk about the investment spending, I am not going to obviously give too any specifics, because I don\u2019t want to make it clear to my competition, where we are going to be spending our time and effort, but it\u2019s pretty consistent broadly with what I have said in the past. Part of that will go to research and development. Part of it will go to our selling and marketing organizations to make sure that we have specialization where needed. So we can drive traction in those faster growth submarkets that we play in and ultimately diversify our growth, so that will continue. But remember as we do launch ROSA as we do try to get additional traction with this collaboration with Apple, that does require spend and that will \u2013 when I talk about increasing those investment when we come into 2019, that\u2019s exactly what I am talking about, to launch those appropriately, to be able to get the traction that we need in the field, we need to make sure that we are increasing the spend in those areas, so that\u2019s what I talk about, those are the areas of concentration and that\u2019s the reason for the increased investment. When I think of ROSA differentiation, we have been trying to stay away from speaking too much about telegraphing our talk track associated with what our system is going to do versus anybody else\u2019s. But I think you can get a clue from what I talked about earlier, which is the first surgeon doing procedures with the system brand new, did 5 cases in a typical surgical day. That would tell you something about I know the way that the robotic system will work with the current flow of a procedure. And that will be one of the biggest things that we talk about, won\u2019t get into other things, but just know that, that will be one of the primary things we concentrate on is being able to use robotic system without dramatically disrupting the surgical flow, which is a big deal.","Cole Lannum","Thanks. Next question, please.","Operator","Our next question is from Kristen Stewart with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Kristen Stewart","Hi, good morning everybody. I was just wondering if you could maybe just talk to the big picture from a operating margin perspective. I think on a year-to-date basis you are running around 27.4%, you have talked about seeing some pressure for 2019. I am just curious on how you think about much longer term outlook. Your old colleague over at Baxter clearly has done a great job of improving operating margins. Do you think that there is a similar opportunity here as you look out across the different levers to really generate significant operating margin expansion over maybe the next 3 to 5 years?","Bryan Hanson","So I am wondering who you are talking about over there at Baxter.","Cole Lannum","Yes, there are a lot of people. You talked about the ex- Goldman Sachs sell-side analyst or who is that okay?","Kristen Stewart","Yes, I heard it all David Roman that was responsible for.","Bryan Hanson","David is doing a great job over there. So obviously, Kristen, given the history that I have with the individual you are talking about, there is similar playbook that we would put in the place here. I don\u2019t know that the opportunities are as readily available as maybe what you have seen there, but there is always opportunity in the business, 100%. And one of the key areas we are going to be concentrating on would be in gross margin. As Dan referenced, we are going to continue to see some pressure as we come into 2019, because all of these costs that we have haven\u2019t quite capitalized in yet, but as we turn the machine on and we start to get after cost reduction in our manufacturing facilities, there is no way that, that doesn\u2019t begin to translate into margin expansion. That will be one of the primary areas we concentrate on. So it will come. In addition to that, we will look at stuff below gross margin, OpEx to make sure that we are truly doing zero-based budgeting that we understand why we are spending and where we are spending and we will look to be able to reduce costs where it makes sense. One of the primary things it allows you to do that is to get better focused on growth drivers, we are not as focused as I would have liked us to be as an organization in selecting the markets, they are going to matter most to us, getting our path to leadership inside of those markets and then differentially spending in those areas. Once we do that that will by default allow us to decrease spending in areas that don\u2019t fit those growth driver categories. With just that mix shift alone and the efficiency we get out of that focus will drive operating margin expansion. So, I am not committing to it overnight that we have already given some color on this, it was going to take some time, but there is clearly opportunity in the organization over time.","Dan Florin","And I would just add that in addition to all of that as the revenue growth accelerates that natural opportunity to leverage our fixed overhead structure is a big opportunity as well, so plenty of opportunity over time as Bryan just said.","Cole Lannum","Pretty soon, you will be talking to the people of Chicago and comparing them to the ones in Zimmer Biomet. Next question please.","Operator","Our next question is from Richard Newitter with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.","Richard Newitter","Hi, thanks. I wanted to ask a question on ROSA, so I appreciate your pending FDA clearance for spine in the application. So I am just curious about when it\u2019s ready for commercial launch, should we be thinking of a spine application and the knee application potentially available at some point in the same skin of the platform or are customers going to have to buy separate robots for separate applications? And then also if you could within that answer or comment on your willingness to pursue volume-based contracts as some your competitors have mentioned that they are doing with their robotics platforms? Thank you.","Bryan Hanson","So out of the gate, well, I want to be clear on, we are waiting on regulatory approval for both the knee and spine applications. They are two different units today. So with spine that will be in the same chassis if you will with brain. So, our brain application and spine application will be in the same robotic system. I think probably everybody knows, but we are already marketing on the brain side. That system is already out and we are actively selling those units. And once we get regulatory approval on the spine side, that unit will also have the capability to do spine procedures as well. Out of the gate, the knee system will be separate. There is an opportunity clearly for us to be able to combine all three applications in one unit. The benefit associated with that is that you are going to get better return on invested capital for accounts, because you are going to get more volume out of the same unit. We are not doing that out of the gate, we are going to be assessing the value of doing that in the future. And if it makes sense, we could certainly make that happen. Relative to the way we are going to commercialize, the robotic system, I don\u2019t want to get too much into our plan here, because I don\u2019t want to telegraph anything, but just we are not in the business of robotic sales, we are in the business of market share. And so we are going to approach the platform in a way that brings the most value to our customers and brings the most value to Zimmer Biomet.","Dan Florin","I would also like to add just really a shout out to our team that has made this possible, just remember, we acquired MediTech in September of 2016. So in just over a 2-year time period, we are launching ROSA knee with our ROSA spine coming and just tremendous effort by our team. I don\u2019t want to shout them out for the great job that they are doing. We are excited about 2019 on robotics.","Cole Lannum","Operator, next question. Thanks, Rich. Next question please.","Operator","Our next question is from Matthew O'Brien with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Matthew O'Brien","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just as far as when I look at your performance, the Americas hip number was quite good. But S.E.T., when you back out, I think the benefits you got from the order in the quarter might have been a little bit lighter than I might have thought given how good that market is. So, is this a function of the productivity at the North Campus getting a little bit better on the hip side, still maybe a little bit pressured on the S.E.T. side of the business and if that\u2019s true, is this the kind of snapback we can expect once you get back to more regular productivity out of that facilities?","Bryan Hanson","So let me try to hit this. So on the hip side, we are couple of things there, if you call it out, we had a pretty easy comp that benefited the number, but we aren\u2019t seeing progress. We have supply recovery, which is helping our field sales organization. We have a grade hip line and being able to have that supply, have our sales organization, utilize the supply is translated into benefit in hip for us. Certainly, in the quarter, you don\u2019t expect those quarters moving forward, because it wasn\u2019t an easy comp that made it look as good as it was. But we are seeing momentum in hip. On the S.E.T. side of the business what I would say is, it is probably a little more hindered on the supply side than hips and knees. But in reality we are still on our trajectory to be able to get improvement in S.E.T., particularly versus first half and second half. We need that improvement that overall growth rate improvement, I like to see it every quarter, but I am going to look at it as, because you always got time in between quarters. We need that improvement to continue and we expect that it will. So we have other product launches in the S.E.T. categories that we would expect to continue to help us. And as we have said before some of that investment that we have been making is specialization in those areas which again should allow us to continue that improvement of revenue growth as time moves on. I am not happy with where we are even let\u2019s call it even if we are looking at the growth rate in the quarter we are in, that was buoyed by comps, we are still not in market growth rate. So we have real opportunity here, real headroom that we need to make sure that we continue to take advantage of.","Cole Lannum","Thanks. Operator we are coming up on the bottom of the hour, we would look to try to get at least two more questions if we can. Next question please.","Operator","Our next question is from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Vijay Kumar","Thanks for taking my question. So maybe one quick one on the distributor termination you guys spoke about, Dan I just want to make sure I heard the numbers correct, so this is $0.10 to $0.15 impact for next year, but there was also some impact for Q4, so is that \u2013 does that mean that $0.03 to $0.04 impact in Q4 in the low end of the guidance which implies $2.14 EPS for Q4, you are reiterating that $2.14 number inclusive of this incremental headwinds? Thank you.","Bryan Hanson","Let me start Vijay, on the guidance numbers I would refer you back to the press release where we have clearly stated which numbers we are reiterating, which ones we are not. What we are not going to do is more interpolate additional numbers based on that, again more than happy to take you through the math offline if needed, but we are not to go through specific numbers down the call as I have said earlier. With that let me turn over to Dan, I think...","Dan Florin","Sure. Yes. I would just reiterate that what I said is that for the fourth quarter, you should expect the bone cement issue to be size of between $10 million to $15 million of negative impact in revenue in Q4 and that will continue until we anniversary out of that. Now we are doing a lot to mitigate against that number plus that\u2019s our best estimate at this point in time. The second thing I will just reiterate is when I talked about 2019 I said that\u2019s the combination of FX and the bone cement would be a $0.15 headwind on 2019 that we are looking to 2019 earnings, that\u2019s right, yes. And that\u2019s relative to our last earnings call, right, so $0.15 per share next year that will work to offset to the extent possible.","Vijay Kumar","That\u2019s helpful guys. Thank you.","Cole Lannum","Thank you, Vijay. Next question please.","Operator","Our next question is from Bruce Nudell with SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Stan Fediuk","Hi, this is Stan Fediuk on the line for Bruce Nudell. Thank you for taking my quest. Given the competitors recent move into robotics and spine, do you share the view that a closed system robotics and spine will result in greater pull through of the entire product line, greater ASP and stability and put pressure on lower tier players who don\u2019t have a robotic system?","Bryan Hanson","I would personally never say it that way. But I do think that having a robotic system whether it would be in spine, whether it would be in brain, whether it would be in orthopedics, recon, I think is a must to have. I think if they are going to be a real player in any of those spaces, you better ensure that you have got a robotic platform that brings some value to the equation. I think it will table stakes to play in my opinion.","Cole Lannum","And operator, I think we have got time for one more question. Let\u2019s try to do one more question before we wrap up.","Operator","Our last question will be from Chris Pasquale with Guggenheim. Please go ahead.","Chris Pasquale","Thanks. Good morning guys. I appreciate you squeezing me in. Hips was a bright spot again this quarter, can you talk about the sustainability of the strength there and maybe contrast the acceleration we have seen in the U.S. hips with the shallower recovery in knees, is the difference in momentum there related to the portfolio, the bigger impact of robotics or would you point to something else?","Bryan Hanson","I don\u2019t know that I have any more specific comments on hips side of the business. I think we saw \u2013 we are seeing traction. Our supply recovery is in place on the hip side. We have a great portfolio. Sales organization is getting traction as a result of it. I just wouldn\u2019t expect Q3 to be a number that you are going to see anytime soon, because the comp was a real benefit to us.","Dan Florin","Yes. And I would just add to that, that the strength of our portfolio deserves above market growth sustainably as we have just not \u2013 we have not been delivering that mainly due to supply and as supply is recovering, you are seeing that in the hip number, but again just to reiterate Q3 was up against an easier comp. But as we look for the future, we are very \u2013 feel really good about our hip portfolio and what the team can do with that.","Bryan Hanson","Yes. I did want to, if I didn\u2019t get a chance to, but the cement thing I do want to spend just a little bit more time on that. We have quantified it obviously in the $10 million to $15 million range in fourth quarter and that\u2019s going to continue into 2019, sorry about the train in the background, but I just want to give some additional color on that. I mean, it\u2019s really frustrating that it\u2019s happening right now, because the fact is our recovery is in full swing. The momentum we have in the business feels right and to have something like this come in that creates a material headwind is beyond irritating. As Dan said though, we are not going to just sit idly by and let this thing just leak from us, we do have an internal bone cement, we will be and already have plans in place to be able to try to pursue this business and stop that leakage, but until we actually get traction on that execution, we want to be very clear this is a real headwind for us that we are going to have to deal with. The good news is it\u2019s a relatively small category. So I don\u2019t expect any peripheral impact associated with this. In other words, cement is not going to have this kind of negative pull-through effect on our recon business. That\u2019s just not going to happen. As a matter of fact eventually, the size and scale of our recon business is probably an opportunity for us to recapture some of this business that we lose over the short-term. And I think probably the most important thing I want to call out here is regardless of the negative impact we have on losing this distribution right here, the fact is we are still on track with the recovery and though it maybe a pain point for us in 2019 and in the fourth quarter of 2018, it is not going to get in the way of that recovery that we have talked about in 2020. It\u2019s a finite thing. It has a beginning and an end. It\u2019s a distribution agreement that\u2019s lost, it\u2019s going to hurt us and then it\u2019s going to annualize out and it\u2019s gone. So I just want to make sure that, that\u2019s clear. I am frustrated by it. It\u2019s a real headwind for us, but it is something that will start and finish and it\u2019s not going to get in the way of the recovery.","Cole Lannum","So with that everyone, thank you. I know it\u2019s in the middle of early season and it\u2019s a Friday. We really appreciate your time this morning. Appreciate you joining us. As a reminder, a replay of the call will be available later today to review on our website at zimmerbiomet.com. Have a great day and great weekend. Talk to you soon. Cheers. Bye-bye.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you again for participating in today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect."],"23162":["Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc.

I would like to turn the call over to Bob Marshall, Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded.","Mr. Marshall, you may begin your call.","Robert Marshall","Thank you, Mariah. Good morning, and welcome to Zimmer Biomet's First Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. I'm here with our CEO, David Dvorak; and our CFO, Dan Florin.","Before we start, I would like to remind you that our discussions during this call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings for a detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties.","Also, the discussions during this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included within the earnings release, which is available on our website at investor.zimmerbiomet.com.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to David.","David Dvorak","Thanks, Bob. This morning, I'll review our first quarter results, including key highlights from our performance. Dan will then provide additional financial details and our updated guidance.","Zimmer Biomet delivered first quarter top line growth and earnings results that were consistent with our expectations coming into the year. In concert with our sales execution, we advanced the ongoing commercialization of differentiated technologies, solutions and services across our industry-leading musculoskeletal portfolio.","In March, we showcased several of our most innovative offerings at the Annual Meeting of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. These included solutions from our knee business such as our Vanguard Individualized Design total knee replacement and Persona Medial Congruent Bearing as well as a preview of our future robotics total knee platform. From our comprehensive hip portfolio, we featured our G7 Dual Mobility Construct and our unique hip preservation offerings.","We also highlighted technologies that address faster-growing categories within the musculoskeletal market such as our Quattro Link knotless anchor for soft tissue repair and our broad range of deformity-correcting foot and ankle solutions. Additionally, our comprehensive Vault Reconstruction System was very well received. This advanced shoulder solution features the first commercially available patient-matched glenoid implant and integrates with Zimmer Biomet's unmatched range of intelligent instrumentation options.","Importantly, we capitalized on this global medium by getting our stakeholders an in-depth look at Zimmer Biomet Signature Solutions, our suite of end-to-end clinical services and digital technologies for musculoskeletal practices. We generated positive feedback from clinicians and representatives from institutions who are interested in pursuing Zimmer Biomet Signature Solutions to drive enhanced patient outcomes, clinical efficiencies and cost savings across the entire episode of care. We look forward to further developing and commercializing Zimmer Biomet Signature Solutions in 2017 and beyond.","Before turning to our sales performance, I'll provide an update on the product availability of certain legacy Biomet brands as well as our ongoing investments into manufacturing and quality excellence. First, from a manufacturing perspective, as described on our January call, we have continued to implement operational process improvements at our Warsaw North Campus manufacturing facility as part of our ongoing regulatory compliance-enhancement efforts. As we implemented these process adjustments during the quarter, we experienced a greater-than-expected number of temporary and occasional production delays. While our overall production throughput improved during the quarter, these delays resulted in lower-than-expected levels of finished goods and strained inventory availability of key brands throughout the quarter.","While these impacts have been more profound and challenging than initially expected, the dedicated efforts of our team members across multiple functional areas supported steady first quarter sales results and, importantly, resulted in an improved and more consistent production output in recent weeks. This progress supports our confidence in our ability to restore adequate supply and accelerate growth during the second half of 2017.","As we discuss often, our long-standing commitment to quality is a top priority for our company and the surgeons and patients who rely on our products every day. Consistent with this objective, during the quarter, we continued to more broadly invest in the harmonization and optimization of our global manufacturing and quality systems.","Against the backdrop of this ongoing work, we achieved net sales of $1,977,000,000, an increase over the prior year quarter of 4.5%, which included approximately 220 basis points of contribution from the LDR acquisition. Embedded within these global results, our Asia Pacific business delivered a solid 5.9% increase in sales as our Americas region accelerated sales by 4.7% and our Europe, Middle East and Africa region generated 3.1% sales growth over the prior year quarter.","Prior to discussing the performance of each of our product categories, I'll provide a brief comment on market conditions. During the first quarter, global musculoskeletal markets continued to demonstrate stable growth, in line with prevailing trends we have observed over the past several years. With regard to pricing, we experienced negative pressure of 2.3% for the first quarter, which was also consistent with our expectations.","Turning now to our knee business. We increased sales by 0.6% over the prior year quarter, reflecting positive volume and mix of 3.0% and negative price of 2.4%. Our Asia Pacific business increased sales by 3.1% as our Europe, Middle East and Africa region grew sales by 0.9%, and revenues were flat in the Americas compared to the prior year quarter.","We continued to successfully drive the growth of Persona The Personalized Knee System, our flagship total knee, that has now been utilized in more than 500,000 procedures since its commercial introduction in 2012. We also achieved noteworthy sales of our trusted Oxford Partial Knee system, which leverages more than 4 decades of clinical success. Our knee team is really focused on transitioning our new Persona partial knee into full commercial launch during the second half of the year. This latest addition to the Persona product line will complete our partial knee portfolio with a fixed-bearing design that incorporates anatomic compartment-specific solutions and precise efficient instrumentation.","Our hip business increased first quarter sales by 2.4%, including positive volume and mix of 5.6% and negative price of 3.2%. Our Asia Pacific region led hip sales growth with a strong 8.9% increase over the prior year quarter as we grew revenues by 2.7% in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region and sales were flat in the Americas.","Our Taperloc complete hip system drove steady growth as well as our G7 Acetabular System and our recently launched G7 Dual Mobility Construct. We also increased sales of the Arcos femoral revision system and premium constructs, leveraging our proprietary 3D-printed OsseoTi Porous Metal Technology and vitamin E-infused advanced bearing materials.","During the quarter, our Europe, Middle East and Africa hip team hosted over 1,000 orthopedic hip surgeons and leading clinicians at a premier event held by the Zimmer Biomet Institute. This global congress was an invaluable opportunity to present the full breadth of our best-in-class hip portfolio while reaffirming our commitment to offering world-class medical education and surgical training.","As we look to the balance of the year, we remain fully confident in the opportunities for growth within our knee and hip businesses while we continue to focus on supporting these trusted brands with greater supply readiness.","Turning to our S.E.T. product category. We delivered a solid 6.5% increase in sales, including good performances from each of our geographic segments. During the quarter, we generated strong growth with our differentiated surgical portfolio, highlighted by the sales of our IntelliCart system, which significantly advances fluid and smoke waste management technology in the OR suite.","Within our sports medicine business, we continue to drive the growth of our proprietary Gel-One Cross-linked Hyaluronate injection and Subchondroplasty Procedure. From our extremities portfolio, we've enjoyed the benefit from strong demand for our market-leading comprehensive total shoulder system. And the ongoing success of our trauma business was reinforced by noteworthy sales of our A.L.P.S Proximal Humerus Plating System as well as steady demand for our NCB Periprosthetic femur plating system and DVR cross-linked distal radius plating system DVR Crosslock Distal Radius Plating System. We believe our diversified S.E.T. offerings, supported by our specialized commercial organizations, position this important category for ongoing sustainable growth.","Our dental sales growth was flat compared to the prior year quarter. This stabilizing performance was supported in part by the sales acceleration of our hybrid surface T3 implant. We remain confident in our ability to optimally position our broad dental portfolio of advanced implant technologies, regenerative solutions and multitiered offerings for this evolving global sector.","Turning to our spine, craniomaxillofacial and thoracic category. We increased sales by 32.1%. Building on our progress from recent quarters, we remain focused on executing our spine sales force integration, which will position this business to meaningfully contribute to our consolidated top line growth as 2017 progresses.","Our success in these ongoing efforts can be seen in the continued sales acceleration of our Mobi-C Cervical Disc prosthesis, a leading offering for a growing global market. We also capitalized on the demand for our innovative new spine offerings such as the Vitality Spinal Fixation System for degenerative and complex thoracolumbar procedures.","Importantly, during the first quarter, our spine portfolio continued to garner clinical validation and industry recognition. The International Society for the Advancement of Spine Surgery recently awarded its Best Clinical Paper for 2017 to a 7-year study on the Mobi-C Cervical Disc prosthesis. This study demonstrated that Mobi-C patients experienced less radiographic adjacent segment pathology compared to those receiving traditional cervical discectomy infusion. Outcomes such as these further validate our ongoing confidence in the future of our spine business.","Among our craniomaxillofacial and thoracic offerings, we achieved another strong quarter of growth with the SternaLock Blu and SternaLock 360 primary closure systems as well as the RibFix Blu Thoracic Fixation System. We look forward to the continued positive performance of these differentiated clinical solutions.","With that, I'll turn it over to Dan.","Daniel Florin","Thank you, David. I will review our first quarter performance in more detail and then provide additional information related to our second quarter and full year 2017 sales and earnings guidance.","Our total revenue for the first quarter came in at $1,977,000,000, an increase of 4.5% constant currency compared to the first quarter of 2016 and 2.3% constant currency excluding acquired revenue from the LDR transaction. Consistent with our guidance, we recorded slightly less than half of an extra billing day in the quarter as compared to the first quarter of 2016 due to the timing of Easter, which added approximately 70 basis points to the growth rate in the quarter.","Net currency impact for the quarter decreased revenues by 0.7% or $12.6 million. The negative currency impact for the quarter was related to the ongoing relative strength of the U.S. dollar versus the euro and the British pound. Our adjusted gross profit margin was 75.2% for the quarter and 50 basis points lower when compared to the prior year due primarily to the impact of price declines and lower gains from our cash flow hedging program particularly associated with the Japanese yen.","R&D expense was 4.6% of revenue at $91.1 million, 10 basis points higher than the same period in the prior year. This added expense reflects the inclusion of pipeline activities from acquired companies such as LDR and Medtech, partially offset by a shift of quality and regulatory experts to ongoing remediation efforts at our Warsaw manufacturing facilities.","Adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses were $760.8 million in the first quarter or 38.5% of sales, 80 basis points higher than the comparable period in the prior year. The negative variance was driven by increased freight costs due to expedited product shipments and the ongoing absorption of the acquired business expense infrastructure as well as investments in our specialized sales force, offset in part by continued savings in SG&A expense categories stemming from our synergy capture initiatives. In the quarter, we recorded pretax charges of $287 million in special items, which include $169 million of noncash amortization and inventory step-up charges as well as $35 million of quality remediation and $83 million of integration and other items.","Our diluted earnings per share were $1.47, an increase of 172% from the prior year. Our current year earnings benefited from a onetime $70 million tax item related to an internal restructuring. Adjusted first quarter 2017 figures in the earnings release exclude the impact of these special items, including the onetime tax benefit.","Adjusted operating profit in the quarter amounted to $635.7 million or 32.1% of sales, which was 150 basis points lower when compared to the prior year period. Our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 21.5%, a decrease of 430 basis points from the first quarter of 2016. The reduction is related to the favorable resolution of various international tax matters, which will have ongoing benefit to our effective tax rate.","Adjusted net earnings were $433.4 million for the first quarter. Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 6.0% or 11% excluding the impact of foreign exchange to $2.13 on 203.1 million weighted average fully diluted shares outstanding. A full reconciliation of reported net earnings to adjusted net earnings is included in this morning's press release.","Operating cash flow for the quarter amounted to $275.4 million, which included $109 million of cash expenditures for our synergy program and quality remediation initiatives. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $129.5 million, including $86.4 million for instruments and $43.1 million for property, plant and equipment. Free cash flow in the first quarter was $145.9 million, which was essentially flat with the first quarter of 2016 and in line with our expectations when adjusting for the timing of certain working capital initiatives.","During the quarter, the company repaid $150 million on our term loan. Also during the quarter, the company borrowed $400 million from our senior credit facility to bridge the retirement of a $500 million senior note which matured on April 1. Therefore, gross debt reduction during the first quarter and the first week of April amounted to $250 million.","I'd like to now turn to guidance. As a result of lower-than-expected manufacturing output of certain legacy Biomet brands during Q1 that David described and taking into account the resultant diminished product availability entering the second quarter, we are adjusting our view of the second quarter and full year revenue and earnings outlook. We expect to have sufficient inventory as we progress through the second half of the year to enable our commercial teams to drive accelerated growth, albeit with a slight downward adjustment of 25 basis points to our previously guided second half growth rate, which now approximates 3.5% constant-currency growth.","For the second quarter, we expect revenues to be in a range of $1,940,000,000 to $1,960,000,000, which reflects a negative impact from foreign exchange of 2.2%. On a constant-currency basis, our growth rate is expected to be in a range of 2.4% to 3.4%, inclusive of a 240 basis point contribution from LDR as well as approximately a negative 100 basis point impact from fewer billing days compared to the prior year. Therefore, the midpoint of our Q2 guidance range is similar to our Q1 performance on a billing day adjusted basis.","For the full year 2017, our estimated revenue growth is now expected to be in a range of 2.0% to 3.0%. Foreign exchange is now expected to decrease revenues by 1.2%, which is a 30 basis point improvement from our previous guidance as the dollar has weakened modestly versus many currencies. Taken together, constant-currency revenue growth is expected to be in the range of 3.2% to 4.2%, inclusive of 120 basis points of acquired revenue from the LDR transaction.","In dollar terms, revenues are now expected to be in a range of $7,835,000,000 to $7,915,000,000. Our expected range is down slightly from our previous guidance range of $7,855,000,000 to $7,930,000,000, which - with favorable foreign exchange partially offsetting the reduction in our constant-currency growth rate.","Turning now to full year 2017 earnings. Although our expected dollar revenue range has decreased slightly, the mix impact of operational growth versus foreign exchange impact has a negative impact on our profitability. Additionally, we are incurring incremental manufacturing and distribution costs to maximize production flow while, at the same time, maintaining critical investments in sales channel specialization, innovative research and development programs and medical training and education.","Special items for the year are now estimated at $550 million, an increase of $20 million from previous guidance. This includes a $40 million increase in quality remediation costs, which are now estimated at $210 million. Notwithstanding these items, we are increasing our earnings per share guidance due to the onetime benefit of the previously mentioned tax item recorded in the first quarter.","We now estimate our reported earnings per share to be within a range of $4.68 to $4.88. However, excluding the impact of inventory step-up and the special items, we are revising our 2017 adjusted earnings per share guidance to a range of $8.50 to $8.60. This EPS range represents 7% to 8% growth over the prior year or 12% to 13% excluding the negative impact of foreign exchange. Our estimated free cash flow range remains unchanged at $1,250,000,000 to $1,400,000,000.","Finally, our Q2 expected EPS is in the range of $0.95 to $1.05. After the elimination of inventory step-up and special items, our adjusted EPS range is in the range of $2.08 to $2.13. Our Q2 guidance contemplates the resolution of certain tax matters, which drives a 100 to 200 basis point improvement in our Q2 ETR from Q1. We still expect our full year adjusted ETR to approximate 22.5%. Finally, please note that our guidance does not include any impact from other potential business development transactions or unforeseen events.","With that, I'll turn the call back to David.","David Dvorak","Thanks, Dan. Our achievements during the first quarter have built on the foundations we've laid for improved supply chain throughput and enhanced manufacturing systems. These efforts, along with the contributions from our expanded global spine business, are positioning Zimmer Biomet to deliver stronger, broad-based sales acceleration in the second half of the year.","We remain confident in the promising opportunities within the global musculoskeletal market. As we look to the balance of 2017, we'll remain focused on driving sustainable growth through innovation at every level of our global business, guided by our long-standing framework for value creation.","And now I'd like to ask Mariah to begin the Q&A portion of our call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. We'll take our first question from Bob Hopkins with Bank of America.","Robert Hopkins","Can you hear me okay?","David Dvorak","We can, Bob.","Robert Hopkins","Great. So first question is I just want to make sure I have a good understanding of what's driving the change in guidance. So I guess, for Dan, first of all, it looks to me like organic revenue growth guidance is coming down by about 50 basis points. Is that all due to these production delays related to the supply issues?","Daniel Florin","Yes, it is, Bob.","Robert Hopkins","Okay. And then same question on the earnings side. The change in earnings - on adjusted earnings, is that all related to the increased costs associated with this?","Daniel Florin","The adjustment to earnings is a combination of the revenue reduction, so the earnings drop-through impact of the revenue reduction combined with the incremental production costs, particularly in the North Campus.","Robert Hopkins","Okay. And then, David, I just wanted to kind of ask a bigger-picture question on the production delays. So can you just take a step back for us and give us a sense as to what really is the root cause of these issues on the legacy Biomet side and just on the supply side generally? And I just would love it if you could give us a little better understanding of what also the incremental issue is this particular quarter and how long is this going to take to resolve. So I think it'd be really helpful just to give people some perspective as to kind of how we got here.","David Dvorak","Sure, Bob. Well, as we explained in the last call, we have been working through the integration process to harmonize and optimize our quality and manufacturing systems as part of the integration. Those efforts as it relates to the Warsaw North Campus were greatly accelerated as a consequence of both internal audit findings as well as the FDA's inspection that concluded in the fourth quarter of last year. So we had a pretty fluid situation in the fourth quarter leading into the beginning of this year.","We've made accelerated changes to those operations. And obviously, in addition to implementing operational improvements at the facility as part of these regulatory compliance enhancement efforts, we were focused on ensuring that the production was coming back up to satisfy, in a prioritized way, existing customer demand and then working towards replenishing safety stocks that would allow us to go back on offense. Because some of these key brands that come out of that facility provide us with some of our best competitive opportunities, so they're a very important set of brands and strategically relevant to the acceleration of the top line. And so it really is a matter that is focused on that facility. And as we got into the beginning of the year and production began to accelerate back up, it just took us longer to ramp that production back up.","You can understand why we'd be operating with an abundance of caution, most importantly, with the interest of the patients that are served by these products in mind. These are high-quality products. We want to make sure that we're putting them out without any compromise, and so the monitoring processes are very sensitive. The implementation of these processes, as I said, this was done on a very accelerated basis for obvious reasons, and it just took us longer to ramp up that production in the first quarter than we originally anticipated.","As we exited the quarter and in most recent weeks, those production levels have been brought up to a point where we're going to be able to begin to more fully satisfy existing customers and, as the second quarter progresses, work towards replenishing those safety stocks. So in the summer months, we expect, in particular, to make a lot of progress on that front and to put ourselves in a position then to not only fully satisfy existing customer demand but then go back on offense.","Robert Hopkins","From where you sit right now, when do you think this is completely behind you?","David Dvorak","No, I wouldn't say that it's completely behind us, but I think we have better visibility, Bob, on the matter than we did 3 months ago. As I said, the output has risen to levels that allow us to work down the back orders. As those back orders are brought down, some of the cases with existing customers that were currently missing we will regain. That will take us through the second quarter. But then as we exit the second quarter and work into the second half of the year, we do believe that we'll be putting this behind us.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Matthew O'Brien with Piper Jaffray.","Matthew O'Brien","Just to follow up a little bit on Bob's question. As far as your customer base goes, have you seen - at this point, it's a couple of quarters where you've had some of these manufacturing issues. Do you have any sense for your ability to retain share within your customer base given the shortfall in terms of product availability? And what are some of the programs that you're putting in place in order to retain some of these customers as you work through these issues?","David Dvorak","Yes. I would tell you that the teams have done an excellent job of moving product around and being very responsive to the customer demand. There are instances where we aren't able to satisfy those demands in particular cases, but you should think about it predominantly as instances where we're missing cases with existing customers. But the larger relationship is maintained, and that is part of the reason we have such a high degree of confidence that, as these production flows begin to replenish stocks out in the field, that we'll be regaining those cases. So that's more the matter that's in front of us. And we think it's very achievable to regain those cases, and we'll begin to do that here in the latter part of the second quarter.","Matthew O'Brien","Okay. And then a follow-up question. I'm looking at - it looks like in the knee and the hip business that the pricing pressure you saw this quarter is the highest that I can find over the last kind of 5 quarters. Understanding Q1 of last year was a little bit lighter than you've been seeing. So are you - that modest elevation in some of the pricing pressure you're seeing in hips and knees, is that a direct result of this manufacturing issue, you're having to give up a little bit more price? And do you think you'll - this will be a level that you may have to continue to deal with over the next couple of quarters?","David Dvorak","It really isn't related. The slight uptick in price pressure was more geographically focused out of the Europe, Middle East and Africa businesses and, in particular, 2 or 3 countries where we have large share. And those are market-driven price-down efforts in those markets, and so that was really the dynamic that led to the incremental price pressure sequentially.","Matthew O'Brien","Okay. Should we expect this level of pricing pressure for the next couple of quarters?","David Dvorak","Well, I think that this is really consistent with our guidance, and nothing's changed for 2017 on our perspective as to what price is going to look like.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan.","Michael Weinstein","My question relates to Lotus and [indiscernible]. So when Lotus relaunches later this year, you're going to have the challenge of bringing a product back to market that's been off the market for 6 months. Can you just give us your thoughts on where you think the balance between the 2 settles out for you as it relates to 2018? What do you think respective positions are of those 2 products in Europe?","David Dvorak","Mike, it was difficult to make out your question if you are directing that our way. [Technical Difficulty].","Operator","Hearing no response, we'll continue to David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.","David Lewis","Can you hear me?","David Dvorak","We can, David.","David Lewis","Okay. A couple of quick questions here. Dan, I want to start with you on margins. Can you give us a better picture of the factors sort of weighing on margins here both for the quarter and the year? And I guess I'm trying to better understand the dynamic of synergy progress relative to remediation. And sort of what is your confidence for the balance of the year that we have a good handle on this remediation costs given they sort of accelerated here in the quarter?","Daniel Florin","Sure, David. First, with respect to the integration synergy program, that remains solidly on track. We have described that as an incremental $85 million of benefit in 2017. So that continues to be on track, and the Q1 instalment, very consistent with our expectation. The incremental production costs and I also mentioned in my prepared remarks some incremental distribution costs as we've expedited shipments around the world, the combination of those 2 is the big change. Keeping in mind we're still delivering very strong ex-FX earnings per share growth on an adjusted basis.","So I'd say what's changed, consistent with the commentary on the production throughput, it's just costing us more to produce those products out of the North Campus. That will change over time. As we continue to make progress on these operational process improvements, there's no question that the cost to produce products out of the facility will normalize out over time. But we have dialed that in for the remainder of 2017. We've dialed in the incremental distribution expenses, and then we've gone back through and looked at some other productivity initiatives and looking to tightly manage discretionary spending. And you put all of that together, and that's where we landed on earnings guidance.","David Lewis","Okay. You remain confident that these remediation issues at this elevated level represents the ceiling on the cost for this year?","Daniel Florin","Yes, David. And keep in mind - so what I just described is included in our adjusted earnings per share, the incremental production costs. Included in that would be some incremental quality inspection. In addition to that, with respect to the remediation activities of the 483 observations, we've also increased that estimate, and that's included in special items. And our prior estimate was $170 million, and we've increased that by $40 million to reflect the additional work that's taking place there. That's included in the special items in our GAAP P&L.","David Lewis","Okay. And David, just a follow-up question for you, if I could. The thesis for most investors on Zimmer is they want to see that steady incremental organic acceleration. I think, to be fair, over the last few quarters, there's a bit of a \"1 step forward, 2 steps back\" effect. So I think - what I think most investors would really like to hear is a couple of things, number one, this really is about manufacturing and it has nothing to do with sales attrition and nothing to do with competition. Maybe you could comment on that. And then, once again, I think what they really want to hear is your confidence that when the company says, \"We're going to be making these slow steady progress forward,\" it's now going to be steps forward and not steps back. And maybe you could help us with your conviction on that as we head over the next 2 or 3 quarters.","David Dvorak","Yes. First, to confirm, David, it is all about that production facility. We have - we believe that even within the first quarter to second quarter, you can think about that production facility impacting the top line growth at an estimated 150 to 200 basis points. And so quite literally, as those products roll out, everything that we make is going to get sold, and you're going to see the elevated top line off of that. There is no under - any other underlying root cause of the top line performance that we've been discussing.","And I would tell you that not only are we confident based upon the progress that we're making on the production side in the recent weeks that we're going to be able to fill that demand to a much greater extent by the end of Q2 and moving into the second half of the year, we were really optimistic about some of the other growth drivers we've been working hard to create, including the integration of the spine sales channel and create success with the Mobi-C products. So our vision for the second half of the year is you're going to see this work through. Our large joint business is going to be positively impacted by our progress in this regard. We'll continue to perform well on the S.E.T. category, and we're going to be adding another cylinder to that growth with an integrated spine channel with the best-in-class cervical disc product, Mobi-C.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan.","Michael Weinstein","Sorry about that earlier. I was trying to jump back and forth between 2 calls. So I think David asked the right question there. It does feel to everybody like it's 1 step forward, 2 steps back. So what - how do we get to a point where, from an investor standpoint, we have enough confidence that these issues are really behind you in 3 months and that you really will get the second half reacceleration that you're talking about? What can you do from - for the investor base here to give us some confidence that these issues at Warsaw and the issues before them are going to be a thing of the past?","David Dvorak","Mike, I would just reiterate that the visibility that we have exiting the quarter and in the most recent weeks as to those production levels, the solutions to that, it's really as simple as once the field inventory gets bled down and they're - even with extraordinary efforts, there is no ability to move product around the covered cases with existing relationships, you're going to start missing some of those cases. And that's what transpired in Q1, and we're going to be working our way out of that issue as we exit Q2.","So we have very good line of sight as to the product that's flowing out of that facility now, and we can map out precisely what cases we're missing and the status of those relationships. And when you bring those lines together, you see this problem resolving as we exit Q2 and move into the second half of the year. Thereafter, it's a dynamic of not only fulfilling existing customer demand by virtue of the enhanced production levels that we're seeing currently but then rebuilding safety stocks that allows us to go back on the offense and compete very effectively with this great product portfolio for competitive business.","Daniel Florin","Mike, this is Dan. I would also add that Q1 - I think the right way to think about this is that the Q1 production throughput delays has pushed our time horizon out by approximately 2 months in clearing back orders and replenishing safety stock and getting back on offense. And importantly as David said, in recent weeks, we've reached production throughput out of that campus to levels that are necessary to fuel that.","So we've already demonstrated in the past couple of weeks the level of output necessary to fuel that growth. Now there's a time lag between coming out of the facility, getting through terminal sterilization and then pushed out to the field, having complete sets and then going on offense. Those are the - that time lag. But I think it's really important that we have, in fact, been performing, from an output perspective, to the degree that we need to, to fuel the second half growth.","Michael Weinstein","And David, where does the FDA fit in on all this? I assume the FDA hasn't yet been back on the Warsaw facility for reinspection.","David Dvorak","Yes. As we provided the update during the last call, we obviously take these matters, as evidenced by everything we're doing, very, very seriously. And we've developed a comprehensive remediation plan to fully address the issues cited by the FDA, and we're going to continue to communicate with the agency as we execute that plan. We're going to take the necessary steps to address these gaps in that operation. And I would tell you we also would express that we remain confident in the quality and safety efficacy of these products. So it just is an ongoing process, Mike, at this point in time, and we'll keep everyone up to date with any appropriate disclosures as that process unfolds.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.","Craig Bijou","It's Craig on for Larry. Can you hear me?","David Dvorak","We can.","Craig Bijou","I guess, David, for you, just given some of the commentary about rebuilding the safety stock and going back on the offensive, I wanted to ask about - when looking at '18, is it fair to assume that you guys can accelerate on the 3.5% growth you expect in the second half?","David Dvorak","We think that, that - you should think about that as a base as we exit 2017 and move into 2018. No doubt, there are opportunities to go beyond that. But obviously, work to do and operating plans to be developed before we get specific about that, Craig.","Craig Bijou","Okay, that's helpful. And I wanted to ask on - with the display of ROSA at AAOS, I wanted to get your view on the place robotics will have in the overall hip and knee market for the next couple of years. I mean, if you step back from the competitive dynamics, just robotics in general, is it going to be a tool just for surgeons that may be placed in a niche market? Or do you see it as a bigger treatment shift?","David Dvorak","Yes. I think consistent with our discussions and our innovation strategies over the past decade, I would maybe start by characterizing robotics in a broader way into intelligent instrumentation. And I would tell you that as it relates to intelligent instrumentation, more broadly defined, we believe that it's going to be the predominant way, ultimately, that these procedures are done and, frankly, the standard of care. And that includes everything that we've been doing from a navigation platform through custom jigs, the Signature offering, the legacy Zimmer PSI offering.","We've done this across various anatomical sites, knees most extensively. We have the iASSIST technology in that space, eLIBRA for soft tissue balancing, preoperative planning systems. And these technologies are going to converge in ways that satisfy 3 conditions, improve the quality of care, take cost out of the procedure and enhance the throughput of patients. So I think, again, those are the key value drivers. As we develop those technologies in a portfolio fashion that we're focused on, we think that robotics can have an appropriate place within that. I don't think that, that one tool out of the box is going to be the total answer, rather I think it's going to be a portfolio of technologies that address the needs and create value across those 3 dimensions. And so we're really enthusiastic about the broad portfolio that we've assembled.","We've been at it for 10 years, and I think it's one of the reasons that as we previewed potential opportunities to bring the ROSA platform into a knee procedure, we think that we can go at that in a differentiated way and leverage all the work that we've done over the last decade, along with our new team members from Medtech, to make a difference in that space. And so I don't know how to break robotics out of a broader portfolio of intelligent instrument solutions that will become the future. But a decade from now, I think that these procedures are going to predominantly utilize these intelligent instrumentation procedures, and I suspect, across various anatomical sites, robotics can be part of that portfolio.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Joanne Wuensch with BMO Capital Markets.","Joanne Wuensch","Can you hear me now?","David Dvorak","We can, Joanne.","Joanne Wuensch","At one stage, you had put up a slide that showed sort of an aspirational growth of 4% organic revenue. Do you believe that is still attainable with the current product - the portfolios that you have? And can you give us an idea of what your time frame might look like to reach that?","David Dvorak","Yes. We absolutely are confident in that capability. We - you reflect back on each of these entities on a stand-alone basis, and for the prior 2 years, before any deal work began, they were performing in the mid-4s on a stand-alone basis. And the portfolio has been greatly enhanced by virtue of the combination. So we're very confident in being able to achieve that goal. And look, our expectation is going to be to exit the year consistent with what we're forecasting, in kind of that midpoint of 3.5% in the second half of the year, and that puts us on a nice path towards the number.","Joanne Wuensch","Okay. And my second question has to do more with expenses. Obviously, there's a lot in getting everything sort of fully on track. I'm going to assume most of that's running through SG&A. Should we think of your 38.5% in the first quarter as a go-forward rate? Or will you be able to manage that down throughout the year?","Daniel Florin","Joanne, first, most of the incremental costs that we're incurring beyond our original guidance is actually up on the gross margin line. So the incremental production variances flow through cost of goods sold. The distribution expense that I referred to is in SG&A. But essentially, our gross - or SG&A profile remains on track to migrate back towards the original guidance levels that we have provided. So we'll - that's where a lot of the instalment of the synergy capture is flowing through, and that enables us to move closer towards 37.5% on a full year basis.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Glenn Novarro with RBC Capital Markets.","Glenn Novarro","Can you hear me okay?","David Dvorak","We can.","Glenn Novarro","I just had a follow-up on ROSA and then a question on free cash flow. So at AAOS, you talked about ROSA being launched at AAOS in 2019. But in 2018, I think we're all assuming that the Mako launch is in full swing. So what keeps the Zimmer surgeon from migrating to the robot? I know, Dave, you talked a lot about you offer more than the robot. But I'm curious, does the promise of the robot in 2019 keep the Zimmer surgeon from migrating? And are you still confident that ROSA could be launched at AAOS in 2019?","David Dvorak","Sure, Glenn. That is the track that we're on. We expect to move into clinical evaluation state in the second half of 2018 that would lead to the achievement of that objective of 2019 academy launch in earnest. But in the meantime, we're excited about continued penetration with our intelligent instrumentation offering. We did almost 100,000 cases, as I rattled off just a bit ago, the various technologies within our current portfolio, and that continues to grow.","We had a great receptivity on the Signature Solutions front to help better manage the end-to-end episode of care. And again, back to the 3 value drivers of enhanced clinical outcomes, workflow efficiencies and then increased patient throughput, that's what that program is all about, and that's what our intelligent instrumentation offering is all about. So all of that, in addition to the fact, Glenn, that we have some exciting product introductions within that category that are going to make a difference, some of which we've discussed, such as the Persona partial knee that moves into a full release in the second half of this year, and others that we haven't discussed at this point in time but are going to be highly relevant to that same time period that you referenced. And in the aggregate, it puts us in a position to be very comfortable that we're going to compete effectively in our market-leading knee space.","Glenn Novarro","Okay, great. And just, Dan, on the free cash flow, the guide there is unchanged even though we're taking down adjusted sales and EPS. So can you maybe talk through the puts and takes in the free cash flow for 2017?","Daniel Florin","Sure. So the free cash flow guide of $1.25 billion to $1.4 billion, as you said, we're retaining that. And really, despite the earnings takedown, as we look at other working capital and operational levers we have available to us at this point in time, we remain confident that we can deliver free cash flow within that range. I think it's important to just remind you that in the current year, there is still significant special items. We've increased the quality remediation spend up to $210 million. In addition to that, there's incremental Biomet integration expenses and other integration activities. So we're still committed to our long-term goal of $2 billion of free cash flow. So within our 2017 guide, there is still hundreds of millions of dollars that should dissipate over time as we work towards that $2 billion long-term goal.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Steven Lichtman with Oppenheimer & Co.","Steven Lichtman","First question is just on the specialized sales forces. How are you looking to grow that overall footprint in 2017? And maybe just an update on how you're seeing the development of the specialized sales forces as a driver of S.E.T.","David Dvorak","Yes. We haven't disclosed the specific numbers, but it's a key area of focus for us. I mean, between the large joint business versus the other categories, our sales adds are predominantly focused on the non-large-joint categories because we have such a large footprint and an existing capability on a global basis within the large joint section. So it's substantial. We made a lot of progress in the design of the organizational structure at the time of the integration and had a lot of success last year with adds and expect to make another meaningful installment in 2017.","Steven Lichtman","Okay. And then - and just a second question, Dan, just to further clarify your comments about a couple of months delay in terms of the ramp. So it sounds as though you are seeing the acceleration or ramp of production over the last several weeks. It's just simply a couple of months later than you would have thought, and that's what's sort of pushing it out a little bit. Is that the way to think about your 2-month comment?","Daniel Florin","That is exactly the right way to think about that, that, importantly, we're currently - in the past couple of weeks, we've seen throughput out of the facility at the levels necessary to clear back orders, to meet existing customer demand, replenish those safety stocks and then get back on offense.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Kyle Rose with Canaccord.","Kyle Rose","Can you hear me all right?","David Dvorak","We can.","Kyle Rose","Great. So I just wanted to ask about the pipeline. Obviously, you showcased a lot of products at AAOS. But there's - with the manufacturing and some of the remediation plans going on, I just wanted to understand what, if any, impact the work on that side of the house has impacted some of the timing and cadence of product development launches over the coming 12 to 24 months.","David Dvorak","Yes. It has caused a reprioritization, but there are - the key products that are in the pipeline now move forward. Many, many products are either in early launch or about to get launched, and I would tell you that notwithstanding the reprioritization, we still have a very robust pipeline. The expectation is still approximately 40 new product launches within fiscal year 2017.","Kyle Rose","Great. And then just one housekeeping question. I know you disclosed the pro forma growth number excluding the contribution of LDR, but just wondering if you could give us the overall underlying organic growth number for the quarter excluding all acquisitions.","Daniel Florin","So the - we'll start with, in my prepared remarks, described the constant-currency all-in number of 2.4% to 3.4%, with LDR contributing 2.4%. So ex FX, ex LDR, 0% to 1%. And then we had the billing day headwind of 100 basis points. This is in our Q2 guide. So that 1% to 2% is indicative of the organic growth rate. The other acquisitions are having some impact. We're very pleased with how those products are performing, but I think the right way to think about our organic growth is as we're disclosing it.","David Dvorak","With that I'd like to - I'm sorry. With that, I'd like to thank everyone for joining the call today and for your continued interest and support for Zimmer Biomet. We look forward to speaking with you on our second quarter conference call. I'll turn it back to you, Mariah.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes the Zimmer Biomet , Inc.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, Friday, February 1, 2019. Following today's presentation there will be a question and answer session. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions]","I would now like to turn the conference over to Cole Lannum, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and IRO. Please go ahead, sir.","Cole Lannum","Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Zimmer Biomet\u2019s fourth quarter and full year 2018 earnings conference call. I'm joined by Bryan Hanson, our President and CEO, and by our CFO, Dan Florin.","Before we get started, I'd like to remind you that our comments during this call will include forward-looking statements. Now, actual results may differ materially from those indicated by forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Please note that we assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements, even if actual results or future expectations change materially. Please refer to our SEC filings for a detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties in addition to the inherent limitations of such forward-looking statements.","Also, the discussions on this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is included within the earnings release found on our website at zimmerbiomet.com.","With that, I'll now turn over the call to Bryan. Bryan?","Bryan Hanson","Thanks, Cole and thank you to everyone for joining us this morning. Today I'd like to provide a little color on our fourth quarter and full year results, as well as an overview of the progress we are making on our short-term priorities. Dan will then spend time talking about the financials in more detail and provide color around our 2019 expectations.","Looking at the business from an operational perspective, we generated 1.6% revenue growth for the quarter. Overall, the team is encouraged that we closed the fourth quarter strong in several product categories and geographies. We delivered solid o-US results, driven by strength in our Asia Pacific and Europe, Middle East, and Africa regions.","The quarter also benefited from improved growth in our global Spine & CMF business. When looking at the full year 2018, there are a few things I'd like to point out. First of all, our overall growth rate improved from 2017 to 2018, driven mainly by global large joint performance improved growth in both our Americas and EMEA regions and steady outperformance from our APAC region. And inside the year, revenue growth improved from the first half to the back half of the year.","In fact, the last two quarters in 2018 were the best quarters we've had in global large joints in the last two years, which allowed us to reduce the gap to market in 2018. And obviously, although, none of us should get too excited about 1% growth, we are clearly making progress consistent with our turnaround timeline.","Additionally, during 2018, we made significant progress across all of our communicated short-term priorities: supply recovery, quality remediation, new product launches, driving a One ZB mission and culture, as well as talent and structure. These are the priorities that will allow us to reshape Zimmer Biomet and begin to position the business for offense. I'd like to spend a little time discussing our progress across each of these.","Now first, we made solid progress on supply recovery. As a result of our sustained focus, we successfully reduced back orders in 2018 and increased safety stock levels. We also enhanced the talent and leadership of our manufacturing and operations teams. Importantly today, we no longer consider supply to be a barrier to delivering our financial commitments or stated turnaround timeline.","The next step will be regaining the full trust of our commercial organization as we shift to offense, which I'm confident we will achieve together in 2019. To make our progress sustainable, this year, we will also start shifting our focus from just supply stability to initiatives aimed at increasing our overall supply chain efficiency.","In 2018, we also continued to make progress on quality remediation. We are executing a detailed remediation plan on the Warsaw North Campus and continue to have constructive communications with the FDA. We expect to complete the remediation plan and to be ready for reinspection by the end of 2019.","Patient safety, quality, and integrity are guiding principles of our organization and we will continue to put resources behind this effort. As a part of that commitment, we have begun shifting our focus from just quality remediation to building best-in-class quality systems and driving a culture that will ensure the sustainability of those changes throughout the organization.","Turning to new product introductions, we are entering the phase of exciting innovations for the company. First, we are completing our flagship, Persona personalized knee system with partial, cementless, and revision knee offerings.","In robotics, we just received FDA clearance for the ROSA Knee, and we look forward to the future clearance of ROSA Spine. Both of these robotic offerings will build on the ROSA platform already cleared for the brain with more than 100 units installed around the world.","We've also introduced mymobility a unique digital platform for our customers and their patients. While these are all promising individual product launches, going forward our commercial strategy will increasingly focus on our unique ecosystem of differentiated solutions.","For example, by combining Persona, ROSA, and mymobility we will be able to operate more personalized robotic procedure with a digital health platform backed by Apple. These important new offerings will be in full swing by the second half of 2019, making this an exciting time for our pipeline and more importantly the value proposition we can bring to our customers.","Turning to mission and culture, when I joined the company a year ago, I wanted to tackle this right out of the gate. Since drafting a new ZB Corporate Mission, we've held more than 40 mission ceremonies in 13 countries around the globe meeting with over 11,000 team members. I want every team member to feel connected to our mission and culture, including the direct impact they have on patients' lives which is why this outreach will continue to be a top priority throughout 2019.","Finally to deliver sustainable results, we need the right team and structure in place. That's why over the past year, we've enhanced the organization with new talent. If you look at our leadership team today, 70% of us are new to the position.","I'm pleased to report that we're benefiting from broader diversity of expertise and viewpoints on the team. Last year, we also restructured our businesses to streamline reporting and decision-making with team members at every level driving a more agile and results-driven organization. These were obviously our priorities in 2018 and will continue to be our focus areas throughout 2019.","As we have consistently communicated 2018 and 2019 are part of a two-year effort to reshape Zimmer Biomet and position us for offense and ultimately allow for durable weighted average market growth by 2020.","Our strategy for 2020 and beyond will have three pillars. First, we will become the best and preferred place to work. We want to make sure that people want to come to work every day because they believe in the organization and understand their direct connection to the One ZB mission and culture.","Second, we want to establish Zimmer Biomet as a trusted partner to all of our stakeholders including our customers, regulators, team members and investors. We want all of our stakeholders to know that they can count on us to do what we say and to do it in the right way.","Third, we want to be a top-quartile performer in terms of total shareholder return. Once we stabilize the business and have began to deliver 2% to 3% growth in 2020 we will be well-positioned to execute against a 5-year plan that will accelerate our revenue growth, drive margin expansion, and increase free cash flow.","Although, we will remain relentless on our short-term priorities during 2019 we have already started to better align our compensation structure with these metrics focused on driving top-quartile performance. Over time, as we execute in each of these areas, we will increase our financial flexibility and our ability to drive shareholder value.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Dan.","Dan Florin","Thank you, Bryan. I will provide highlights of the fourth quarter financial performance and then go into a bit more detail on the 2019 sales and earnings guidance included in our press release this morning.","Net sales totaled $2.1 billion in the fourth quarter, an increase of 0.1% over the prior year period with an increase of 1.6% on a constant currency basis. As Bryan noted, we delivered solid results in both Asia Pacific and in our Europe, Middle East, and Africa region.","Within the quarter, our EMEA region increased sales by 4.7%. Note that the EMEA region benefited from top line rebate adjustments. But even excluding these adjustments, the region still reported a growth rate of nearly 3% for the quarter, its best performance in almost two years.","Our Asia Pacific region, delivered another strong quarter with sales growth of 7.2%; while our Americas region declined 0.9% reflecting tougher comparisons in the quarter. In addition, our Spine & CMF business increased sales by 3.1% on a constant currency basis, achieving its highest growth rate in the last three years.","With regard to pricing in the quarter, we experienced an overall decline of 2%. However, when you adjust for the rebate benefit in our EMEA region, pricing was in line with our historical norms.","Moving to the income statement. We reported a GAAP diluted loss per share for the quarter of $4.42. After adjusting for special items, our non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share were $2.18. A reconciliation of reported earnings per share to adjusted net earnings per share is included in this morning's press release.","Of note, we recorded a one-time non-cash charge of $4.78 per share related to goodwill impairment of our Spine and EMEA reporting segments. In addition, we recorded a non-cash accrual of $0.59 per share related to a negative development in a previously disclosed litigation matter.","As usual, operating margin for the fourth quarter was seasonally strong at 29.3%. For the full year, operating margin came in at 27.9%, which was in line with our expectations. The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 16.5%, which brings our full year adjusted effective tax rate to 18%.","Operating cash flow for the quarter amounted to $380 million and our free cash flow was $260 million. For the year, operating cash flow was $1.7 billion and free cash flow was $1.3 billion.","We paid down $250 million of debt in the fourth quarter bringing our full year debt paydown to just under $1.2 billion. During 2018, we reduced our adjusted net debt leverage ratio to 3.2.","Now, let me turn to our 2019 guidance. In our press release this morning, we highlighted a number of specific items which should help you in your modeling. Starting with revenue, for 2019, we expect reported growth to be in a range of negative 0.5% to positive 0.5% which brackets the current consensus estimates.","Included in our reported growth range is the negative impact of foreign exchange, which we expect will reduce reported sales between 100 and 150 basis points. Importantly, there are two factors that will impact quarterly revenue phasing; foreign currency and billing days.","First, based upon today's rates, virtually all of the negative foreign exchange impact will be realized in the first half of the year weighted much more heavily in the first quarter as compared to the second quarter.","In addition, while there is no significant impact from billing days for the full year, there is about a day of headwind in the first half of the year which is offset in the second half.","On an operational basis, we expect our growth rate in 2019 to be better than our performance in 2018, reflecting progress toward achieving our two-year turnaround goals.","Turning to profitability, we expect operating margin for the full year to be between 27% and 28%, reflecting the investments we are making to launch our new products. If you look across the quarters, the phasing of our reported sales will have a direct impact on operating margins and earnings. Therefore you should expect the first half operating margin to come in closer to the lower end of the range with the second half closer to the higher end of that range. We expect our adjusted tax rate to be between 17% and 18% and we expect adjusted diluted earnings per share to be between $7.70 and $7.90.","For 2019, we expect to generate free cash flow between $1.1 billion and $1.3 billion. Note that this range includes the potential one-time payment of approximately $170 million for the litigation matter that I mentioned earlier.","If you adjust for this potential one-time payment, we expect our free cash flow to be at or above the amount we generated in 2018. We expect to continue using the majority of our free cash flow to pay down debt and achieve our leverage goals.","Finally, you should expect interest expense to come in between $230 million and $240 million with the quarterly number falling throughout the year as we continue to reduce our debt levels.","And with that I'll turn the call back to Bryan. Bryan?","Bryan Hanson","Okay. Thanks Dan. And before we move into Q&A, I just want to say that I'm very pleased with the progress we've made as a team. Our performance was better in 2018 than 2017 and we expect 2019 to be better than 2018. While we're halfway through the turnaround timeline, importantly, we have retired more than half the risk associated with that plan. Although, we still have a lot of work to do, we have a team that's ready to launch important new solutions for our customers and deliver on our near-term commitments to transition the organization to full offense and prepare for 2020 and beyond.","And now I'd like to go ahead and turn the call back to Cole, so we can get started on the Q&A.","Cole Lannum","Thanks, Bryan. Now, before we start the Q&A session, I want to remind you to please limit yourself to a single question with a brief follow-up, if and only if needed. Feel free to put yourself back in queue afterwards, and I promise we will get through as many questions as possible that way.","With that operator, may we please have the first question?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Joanne Wuensch with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Joanne Wuensch","Good morning. And thank you for taking the question. I think one of the things that we've been talking to investors about is how this AAOS will be different for you than last year or the year before that particularly with the launch of ROSA. Could you give us an idea of how you plan on launching ROSA into the market and what we can expect this year?","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, one moment while we check for technical difficulties. And Mr. Lannum, you are live.","Cole Lannum","Hi, everybody. Well, that was interesting. Sorry for that. Right now we were closing up. Our line went dead, but now we're back with you again. Thanks for your patience. Operator I believe you queued up the first question. Did you say that was coming from Joanne?","Operator","Joanne Wuensch with BMO Capital Markets.","Coleman Lannum","Joanne. Thanks everyone for your patience. Joanne, please go right ahead. We're all here.","Joanne Wuensch","Thank you. The question was just so good that I broke the system. Anyway, this year's AAOS is positioned to be very different for you than last year or the last couple of years. And a lot of investors are focused on the launch of ROSA and how you plan to roll it out not just in March, but throughout the rest of this year. Could you give us an idea of what to expect at AAOS and what to expect from ROSA?","Bryan Hanson","Yes, Joanne. Thanks for the question. The \u2013 I don't think it was you. I think it was Cole pressed and hung up on us. But AAOS will be very different for us coming up and one of the things that we're going to be doing differently at the conference is to have an investor meeting. I think its a couple hours, Cole, what we\u2019re thinking about. And the idea behind that would be to give a view of both our spine as well as the orthopedic businesses. We'll have both of our Group Presidents that manage those businesses at the event. It will give you an opportunity to get to know them in the investor meeting, and we'll have breakout sessions where we'll get into some of the more meaningful technologies that we'll be launching in 2019 or have already launched.","ROSA, obviously, will be one of those things that we talk about, very likely both in orthopedics as well as spine and probably even at least reference to some extent what we're doing in brain. But it would not be the only thing.","So again we expect it to be a much different feel, AAOS this year. And certainly we want to make sure that we spend additional time with our investors to give them visibility to our team and probably very importantly for everyone more insight into the innovations that we have.","Cole Lannum","And Joanne since you brought that up, let me also note and put a plug into this. We've sent the invitation out. Anyone who's on the call who has not got the invitation send me an e-mail and let me know. And it is very important that everyone preregister because we've already gotten a pretty overwhelming response to that meeting. We want to make sure there's enough room for everyone. So please if you're planning on coming, let us know. And thanks for the question.","Operator, next question please.","Operator","We will take our next question from Mike Matson with Needham & Company.","Mike Matson","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I guess, I would just like to follow-up on Joanne's question about the actual robot launch. I understand you're going to have some investor events there. But can you just talk about how you're actually going to launch it? Are you going to be willing to place robots in exchange for increased implant sales? Are you building a capital sales force? And how should we think about the impact on your growth in 2019 and 2020? Thanks.","Bryan Hanson","Yeah, absolutely. I'm not going to get into specifics relative to our placement strategy whether it be associated with ASP, the types of arrangements we might have outside of just direct sale. But just know that one of the primary focus points of robotics for us is to be able to drive share obviously. So we're an implant company that will be the primary focus of the organization. But clearly we believe robotics is an important factor associated with being able to more share implants.","What I would say is we're going to -- as we've been saying pretty much all along, we're going to do a limited launch out of the gate. We want to be very disciplined in our approach to launching a new robotic system to make sure that we do it right. We have the right education. We have the right service levels. And we will do that limited launch for let's call it six months. Post that limited launch is when we move into full launch.","And that's when the organization gets unleashed and we utilize that technology in that full launch status. And in the guidance that we provided for 2019 that is already assumed inside the guidance. So I guess just generally speaking though, I'm excited.","One of our competitors presented just recently here and talked about the continued strength in robotics. That's perfect. I love to hear it because we're just about to launch our robotic platform in a market that is surging. And when you think about it and the under-penetration of robotics in general, when you think about the number of surgeons that are doing procedures today with our implants, there's very good opportunity for us and we couldn't be more excited about the fact that robotics is getting good traction. And we're excited about our launch.","Mike Matson","Thank you.","Cole Lannum","Operator next -- okay, thank you. Next question please.","Operator","Our next question is from Raj Denhoy with Jefferies.","Raj Denhoy","Hi, good morning. Maybe Dan I could ask about the gross margin in the quarter. It was a little bit better. And I know there's some seasonality there, but when you think about the comments you've made now about moving beyond being supply constrained and the quality issues starting to fade, maybe you could offer some guidance or some insight into how gross margin should trend here in 2019.","Dan Florin","Sure Raj. Well, as we said in our prepared remarks and you just referenced, Q4 is typically our highest operating margin quarter due to the seasonally strong sales volume. And that seasonally strong sales volume also benefits gross margin rate. And if you look just back over history, you'll see not only operating margin, but gross margin rates for the company being usually the strongest in the fourth quarter. And really the primary reason for that is that we're able to leverage certain fixed cost components that are inside of the cost of goods line, all right? So, that's why it's probably better to look at gross margin for Zimmer Biomet on a full year basis which for 2018 was 72%.","So, as we look out to 2019 and contemplated in our guidance, our guidance of operating margin 27% to 28%, while we're not going to get specific line item detail inside the 27% to 28%. As we've been saying, you shouldn't expect margin expansion until 2020.","And really when you think about gross margin and operating margin in 2019, the reasons for that include the continued higher production costs that we've been talking quite a bit about, but also the investments that we're making in our sales channel and the investments that we're making to support the new product launches that we're very excited about.","So, again, I think for 2019, as we've been describing, no operating margin growth. You'll see that in 2020 and our guidance contemplates that.","Raj Denhoy","Great. So\u2026","Cole Lannum","Yes, go ahead.","Raj Denhoy","No, I was just going to ask. So, we should assume that both gross margin and operating margin should be flat in a sense. So gross margin could potentially tick-up as you noted with better sales. But you'll probably be spending a bit more in SG&A, I guess, to keep that gross -- excuse me -- to keep the operating margin flat. Is that the way to think about it?","Dan Florin","Well, I mean the guidance provide the range. And inside of that there's obviously moving parts through the P&L. But I think that the message we're sending is that 2019 is a year of continued investment and topline acceleration in the back half and margin expansion is more of a 2020 story and beyond.","Raj Denhoy","Okay, great. Thank you.","Cole Lannum","Thanks Raj. Next question please.","Operator","Our next question is from Bob Hopkins with Bank of America.","Cole Lannum","Good morning Bob.","Bryan Hanson","Maybe there's a technical difficulty.","Cole Lannum","Yes, Bob, are you on the same line that we're on? Are you there? Okay, operator, could you go to the next question please and if Bob\u2026","Bob Hopkins","No, sorry, I'm here. I apologize. Can you hear me okay?","Cole Lannum","No problem. Yes, we can hear you Bob. Go ahead.","Bob Hopkins","So, super. I just wanted to ask one quick question and I'm going to keep it high level this time. I wanted to ask a question Bryan on U.S. knee market share. Because as trying to gauge the stability of your knee franchise and as outsiders, all we can really look at is, kind of, relative revenue growth rates in knee. So, it's hard for us to understand sort of volume share given that mix can have such a big impact on revenue growth.","So, my question is this, kind of, what do you think the Zimmer U.S. market share is in knees exiting 2018? And how does that compare to where you were a year ago? And again, the reason I'm asking the question, I'm trying to get a real sense as to sort of the true stability of your knee franchise over the course of 2018 in the U.S. where I assume you have the best data. Thank you very much.","Bryan Hanson","Okay. I appreciate the question, Bob. So I've been thinking a lot about this as well. I'm just going to try to paraphrase what it is you're asking. But I think what you're looking for is, if you look at share you can either look at it from a dollar perspective or you could look at it from a unit or procedure perspective.","And what I would say is that, either way if you look at where we are in 2018, whether you look at it for procedures or units or you look at it in dollars, we have closed the gap to market. It doesn't matter which way you look at it, we have definitely closed the gap to market. But inside of that, I believe that our unit gap or procedure gap is actually lower than the dollar gap and always has been.","And let me just kind of explain why I'm saying that, because I've been spending a lot of time on this, so it's a good question actually. Really, three reasons or kind of factors for share loss for the company that I see. The first one is kind of the obvious, right? I mean, you lose a surgeon to the competition.","This is something that would impact both unit share as well as dollar share. It may not be exactly, because the price points might be slightly different, but they impact of both. The other one would be, losing our patients to the competition's surgeon. And what I mean by that, if a surgeon's doing -- if a patient's doing an elective procedure and they decide to do research on where they're going to get that procedure done. And they decide they want to go to a robotic surgeon that's no longer a patient that's going to my surgeon it\u2019s going to be somebody else's surgeon. That also impacts both unit and dollar share.","The third one is this idea of competitors that are increasing their revenues due to mix. Whereas in the same procedure they had with the same surgeon, they're just increasing the share of wallet they're getting in that procedure. Those are all three things that are happening. I really do believe we are losing surgeons and we're not winning the churn game right now. I do believe we're losing patients to our competitors' surgeon. But I think by far, the biggest contributor to share loss is third category, that our competitors are doing a very good job of going right to the surgeons they have in the procedures they already have and upsell in robotics in cementless and other areas. And so, for that reason, I actually think that the unit share loss that we've had is not as substantial as the dollar share loss.","And the reason why I think it's important and I think it's kind of -- probably it's getting to your question, the fact is one of the biggest contributors to mix benefit inside of the space that we play is robotics. And you got robotic surging right now and here we come with our robotics platform. And let's not forget that when you look at the largest number of surgeries being done today in knees, it's our implants. It's our surgeons doing those procedures. And we're about to provide them an opportunity to have access to robotics in that largest segment of knees globally. So that's pretty exciting.","Don't get me wrong here. We're going to go after every single one of these areas to be able close our gap to market and begin to get back to market or above. We're going to try to convert competitive surgeons. We're going to market directly to patients with a personalized robotic approach, using our mymobility app backed by Apple, which has very strong consumer demand. But I think our biggest opportunity to close the gap is to be able to get the mix benefit in the procedures we already have with the surgeons that we already have. So we're pretty excited about it obviously.","Cole Lannum","Thanks, Bob. Thanks for the succinctness of the question. Could we have the next question, please? Next question operator, please.","Operator","Our next question is from Kyle Rose with Canaccord.","Kyle Rose","Great. Thank you very much for taking the questions. Can you hear me all right?","Bryan Hanson","Yes.","Kyle Rose","So Bryan for the last 12 months and including this morning, you noted the importance of regaining the trust of both the sales force and the physician customers to really be able to go back on the offensive.","Can you talk to us and just kind of give us an update on where both of those stand exiting 2018 moving into 2019? And what specifically needs to happen over the course of 2019 to get you to the position where you want to be exiting the year to get to 2% to 3% topline growth in 2020?","Is it as simple as just hitting launch and your product availability, milestones or are there other things that need to happen across the course of the year?","Bryan Hanson","Probably just depending on which constituent you're talking about. But if you talk about surgeons, I think it's exactly what you just said. We've got to be able to continue to provide the product when they need it and what they want. And we need to bring these new product launches to market in a flawless manner.","And my belief is, with the supply coming in, in the way it is with the new product launches that we have coming, I have a lot of confidence that our surgeons will build confidence in our organization throughout 2019. So that to me is as soon as we are supposed to do which I fully expect we will, our sense is we're going to see increased confidence from our surgeons and we're going to delight them in 2019.","From a internal team member perspective, I think there's more that goes into it. Obviously having supply is first step. No question. You got to make sure that we can deliver what our commercial organization needs, but also it's the support that.[Technical Difficulty]...","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen please standby. Mr. Lannum you are live. ","Cole Lannum","Hi, thanks again everyone. We're certainly going to have to talk to our AT&T folks after this and we apologize for the continued snafus. Let's go back. Bryan you were responding to the question.","Bryan Hanson","Yes. I don't know for sure where I dropped off. But I think I was talking about how we get the trust and confidence of our team members at this point. And what I was saying is, it goes beyond just supply. Obviously that's a foregone conclusion.","New products will absolutely contribute to the feeling that they have and the confidence they have in the organization. But the big one is to make sure that the leaders of the organization including myself; Ivan Tornos who now runs the orthopedics business is directly engaged with that commercial organization.","So they know the leadership is behind them. The leadership understands the value they bring to the table and that nothing happens until they sell something. So we'll be the support that they're looking for. The compensation scheme is in place to make sure that we're driving offense versus defense.","The other thing that I would say is, we just have all of our kickoff meetings. I was able to attend some of them. Obviously I was at the Americas kickoff meeting which is our largest. And the energy that I felt in those meetings was better than I've ever felt.","And I'm not talking about this environment in any meeting I've ever been in. It was definitely a situation, where the team was there. We had bigger presence than we've ever had at that meeting around the world, and people are walking out the door excited about 2019. Now they've got to deliver but the energy coming out of that meeting gives me the confidence that the organization's moving in the right direction relative to trust.","Cole Lannum","So, Kyle hopefully you heard between the first part and the second part enough of that complete answer and again, everyone, thanks for your patience. Operator, next question please.","Operator","Our next question is from Richard Newitter with the SVB Leerink.","Richard Newitter","Thanks for taking the questions. Just to focus a little bit on the international strength we've been seeing here for a couple of quarters. My question is, how sustainable is this? And as you answer that, can you maybe talk about some of the headwinds and tailwinds we should be considering that you face in APAC and EMEA? Thanks.","Bryan Hanson","Yeah. Yeah. So first of all, I would be completely remiss, if I didn't congratulate both regions. APAC just continues to be a force and overachieve versus market and they did not disappoint us again in Q4. And it's just been a phenomenal year for that team and we fully expect that they'll continue to perform well coming into 2019. So, just congratulations to that team once again.","In EMEA, it hasn't been as strong this year, but the fourth quarter was fantastic. And I got to tell you, I really want to call that team out, because in the face of leadership changes that are pretty material the whole \u2013 the actual leader of the region has changed, and we've changed the structure of the team. And in the face of that, which could have been disruptive, they delivered their best quarter in the last two years.","So they're clearly benefited from the rebate adjustment when you look at the whole number that Dan talked about in the prepared remarks. But the fact is, it was still even outside of that, the best growth rate they've had in some time. So I'm happy about the performance.","What I would tell you, is if I look at EMEA specifically, I would fully expect when you look at the full year 2018 for their performance to be better in 2019. I'm not necessarily saying it's going to look exactly like the fourth quarter. But when you look at the full year, I would fully expect them to be better in 2019. And so for Asia-Pacific, again, I think we're going to continue to see strength. And with EMEA, I think we're going to see improvement 2018 to 2019.","Richard Newitter","Thanks.","Cole Lannum","Thanks, Richard. Next question, please.","Operator","Our next question is from Glenn Novarro from RBC Capital Markets.","Glenn Novarro","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. You guys highlighted your debt leverage at 3.2 times. And my question is that, a number that you feel comfortable with to start diving back and start doing acquisitions? And the reason I'm asking is your goal is to get to 2% to 3% market growth by next year. But I know you don't want to stop there. I know, you want to be above that in the years thereafter. So talk about, where the leverage is and talk about how important M&A is to getting to higher growth rates and the timing as to when we could start seeing M&A? Thank you.","Bryan Hanson","So, Glenn, why don't I take a shot just at the top line kind of answer to this and then Dan I'll pass over to you with more specifics on the debt leverage. What I'd tell you is that clearly our goal on the debt ratio is to be lower than what we are right now. And as Dan mentioned, we're going to continue to use a lot of our cash to be able to buy down that debt. At the same time, if there are targets that are attracted to us and make financial sense and strategic sense to the organization and we think it provides good shareholder returns that we would certainly look at those targets today.","If I have everything done perfectly and sequentially as I would like, my preference would be to wait to the back half of 2019 to really start to do any type of real BD&L, because BD&L as much as it is beneficial, it can absolutely be distracting. And I want the organization to stay maniacally focused on the short-term objectives that we've laid out between 2018 and 2019.","So, if I can lay it out perfectly, I want to start moving more into active BD&L towards the back half of 2019 or 2020 and stay very focused our short-term objectives until then. But I -- just so we don't surprise anybody, if an opportunity ever came about, if something came out opportunistically in a period shorter than that and we thought it made sense, we would certainly take a look at it. But Dan why don't you...","Dan Florin","Sure. I would just add Glenn that when you think about our financial flexibility and what we're trying to accomplish on the leverage side, it fits perfectly with the timing that Bryan just described.","In other words, we're entering 2019 at 3.2 times. Goal has been to make progress beyond that net leverage in that three times type range or better. And I think that based on our guidance that we provided, the free cash flow that we'll generate in 2019, we said the majority of that will go towards that paydown. I think that fits perfectly with what Bryan just described on the strategic front and the BD&L side of things. So, we're excited about the ability to as we enter 2020 to have financial flexibility and firepower to do the things -- to supplement the organic growth of Zimmer Biomet.","Glenn Novarro","Okay, great. Thank you.","Cole Lannum","Thank you for the question Glenn. Next question please.","Operator","Our next question is from Matt Miksic with Credit Suisse.","Matt Miksic","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. So, I'll focus if I could just on Bryan your comments on growth and the gap to market -- closing the gap to market, which I take to mean the degree to which you're growing below market, kind of, narrowing that growth gap if I understand it correctly.","So, if the U.S. market is growing maybe 2%, the U.S. knee market, say, and your Americas knee growth is down 1.5% to 2%. My question is now that supply issues are kind of behind you as you talked about in your prepared remarks no longer a challenge to growth, when should we expect to see you sort of get to that market or exceed that market growth rate over the next several quarters? And how does that work?","Bryan Hanson","Yes. So, the way you're reading my description of our gap to market is accurate. Unfortunately, it's not talking about the gap above market; it's talking about the gap closing below market. But the way we've been describing it is that this two-year kind of reshaping and positioning for offense is to allow us in 2020 in a durable manner to be able to get to market. That's the weighted average market growth that we've been describing in that kind of 2% to 3% in 2020.","So, if you kind of just read into that knee being a very large portion of our business that would indicate that our expectation would be that we would continue to see share unfortunately in 2019. But in 2020, that would no longer be the case.","And the thing that gives us confidence in that is that we got innovation coming that we have not had in a long time. And most of that gets into full swing and full launch in the back half of 2019 which gives our organization, that commercial channel that we were just talking about, the opportunity now to go on full offense.","Matt Miksic","Just to clarify, I guess, if I could. So, the supply -- the return to supply is sort of a component, but not sufficient in your view to start rolling that back -- start rolling those share losses back. It will be the products. It will be the ROSA launch. All of these things together kind of maybe in the back half. Is that -- am I hearing that right?","Bryan Hanson","100% read that. If you think about the comment that I made when -- it was Bob's question I believe. Bob's question on unit versus dollar market share, one of the biggest contributors to revenue growth right now in our space is increasing the mix, right?","So in other words, you getting a higher share of wallet inside a procedure you already have. That comes through new technology, not just flat recovery. It comes by keeping the surgeons you have, obviously, being able to supply them but being able to upsell because of better technology and get more share of wallet through those procedures. That doesn't really happen for us in full swing until we get into the back half of 2019. So it is an extremely important component for us to get back to market or potentially exceed market.","Dan Florin","And certainly the full launch of cement -- Persona cementless, which is happening now; and then Persona Revision in the back half of the year both at premium price will contribute towards that.","Bryan Hanson","Yes, I agree.","Matt Miksic","Okay, great. Thank you.","Cole Lannum","Thanks for the question Matt. Next question please.","Operator","Our next question is from David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.","David Lewis","Good morning. Bryan, just one for me and maybe I'll shift focus to spine. So this is an area where you had a fair amount of enthusiasm last year. It was mostly targeted on your confidence sort of the spine integration and distributor transition that was ongoing. Obviously it was better quarter here in the fore.","So two related questions are, one, how confident are you feeling in that and continue to improve in the spine business in 2019? And there's been a lot of commentary robotics and knee on this call, but obviously the debate in spine for 2019 will be robotics and spine. Where are you with spine robotics? And how important is that as a factor here in 2019? Thank you.","Bryan Hanson","Yeah, yeah, thanks. So real quick, just on the spine piece on ROSA. We are waiting for FDA approval on that. And I don't want to give a specific time line, but it would be great to have that before AAOS. There's a possibility of that. But we do think that sometime in the second quarter we will have it. The hope is we get it before and we can talk a little bit more about it AAOS. So that just gives you a little sense of where we are with spine, but we have submitted the approval or the request.","I also want to call out I mean this is the best quarter. I think Dan said it in his prepared remarks that it's best quarter we've had in a few years in this combined business. And it's a testament to the team getting the job done.","I also want to make sure that it's clear that it was both businesses that had a better quarter. Spine continues overall to be negative for us, and I don\u2019t know if we've ever called that out. But it is negative for us overall, but it improved. So we've talked about that gap to market before, the gap to market reduced, but it's still a negative number. But it did improve, which is a big part of that improvement in the fourth quarter.","And then the CMF business continues to show strength and had a really strong close to 2018. And a portion of that, which we haven\u2019t really been talking much about was our sales in ROSA, Brain. So remember it's not just ROSA Knee application, it's not just the spine application, we also have an application in brain and we had pretty good sales in the fourth quarter. And that helped the number as well.","So overall congratulations to the team. Best quarter in a while. And I feel like we've got the right leadership, we've got the right structure in place. And we've got a nice product portfolio that's coming in 2019. So, when I look at that total business, I'll be very surprised if we don't do better in 2019 than we did in 2018.","Cole Lannum","Thanks for the question, David. Next question operator please.","Operator","Our next question is from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.","Larry Biegelsen","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to focus on ROSA for total knee since that's such an important product for you guys. So my question is Bryan or Dan around how de-risked do you think the full launch in six months? How broad is the limited launch going to be?","Are you confident you've kind of worked out the major kinks? And if you could give us any color on how many implants have been done so far and what you think the unique features and benefits are of the system that would be helpful? Thank you for taking the question.","Bryan Hanson","Yes. So I don't want to get too much into the unique feature set associated with ROSA. We've talked a lot about it probably even more than I would like to be honest. Because in reality anything we're seeing here, it goes right to our competition. Until we are actually getting more in the full swing of the launch, why would we do that?","I will tell you that, you're going to get much more insight on what we believe the value is of ROSA for our surgeons, which is the most important constituent that we have. And you're going to see that at AAOS.","What I would -- just say generally speaking is, I think we have a very competitive robotic system. One of the key things that we try to focus on is to be able to get high-volume surgeons to be able to use robotics. Remember, when we talk about the play here, there's an opportunity for share of wallet gain in every robotic case. Every robotic case provides an opportunity for better mix.","So the better throughput we can get on our robotic system, the better off we are as an organization to take advantage of that mix. And high-volume surgeons just historically...[Technical Difficulty]","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen please standby. Mr. Lannum you are live. ","Cole Lannum","Okay. Third time's a charm and sorry about that again. We're going to continue where we left off.","Bryan Hanson","So this is reminiscent of our supply problems in 2016 and 2017. No longer our supply problems going forward. But I think I was just getting into thing around high-volume surgeons. High-volume surgeons typically had stayed away from robotics because it slows them down and they can't keep the volume of patients that they'd like to have.","Our goal is to eliminate that, to be able to get all the accuracy that we get with robotics, but not change the flow of the procedure in a way that would reduce the throughput they could get on patients. That's a big deal because high-volume surgeons is who we want because you get mix benefit for every procedure.","So just, that will be all, I'd say about the differences of us versus the competition. You'll see more AAOS. I feel like we're in pretty good shape relative to confidence in being able to roll this out effectively.","Remember, we're not new to robotics. We have the brain robotic system that's been out in the market. We have over 100 units out in the world today. We understand the service associated with these units. We understand the education that's required and we have expertise in the organization that is not new to robotics. So that gives me a lot more confidence than if we were organization launching our first robotic system.","Larry Biegelsen","Thank you.","Cole Lannum","Thank you, Larry. Next question, please.","Operator","Our next question is from Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs.","Isaac Ro","Good morning, guys. Thank you. Wanted to ask a question related to the guidance specifically with regards to spending that you're doing on the supply and quality remediation work. Just curious, what's baked into the guidance? I think you guys have called for flat margins more or less. And I'm wondering within that, if the spending on quality supply remediation is going to be flat up or down and in what area? Just any context there to help us think through what's going on under the hood would be great? Thank you.","Dan Florin","Sure, Isaac. Well, first let's talk about within the adjusted earnings per share guidance, which was $7.70 to $7.90. What I was describing before, the operating margin of 27% to 28%, inside of that operating margin continues to assume pressure at the cost line, as we've been describing. So meet those elevated production costs, the capitalization of those costs and to expect that pressure to continue through 2019 with improvement coming in 2020. So that's on the adjusted P&L side of the house. Within our cash specials is where we've been capturing the pure remediation costs for quality remediation. And as we continue to progress on that program as we prepare for a FDA inspection by the end of 2019 that quality spending \u2013 that quality remediation spending will be ramping down as we progress through 2019.","So in our free cash flow that does contemplate a reduction and a ramp-down in quality remediation spending, which I think is a good setup for 2020 in terms of again cash specials continuing to ramp down. Also, within the free cash flow is investment in new product launches. So the instrumentation, the inventory associated with all the new products that's all contemplated inside our free cash flow range as possible as well. So, again, just to reiterate within the adjusted P&L, continued pressure of the gross margin line for the reasons we've discussed. And then on the cash flow guidance, an expectation that quality spend will be ramping down.","Isaac Ro","Got it. Thank you.","Cole Lannum","Thank you, Isaac. Next question, please.","Operator","Our next question is from Amit Hazan with Citigroup.","Amit Hazan","Thanks very much and good morning. I want to come back to guidance for a second and just set-up the top line as a question for you and try to gauge, if this is indicative of increased confidence or if I'm reading too much into it. But if I kind of take the upper end of your ex-FX guidance, you obviously get to about 2% growth so you're into that 2% to 3% weighted average market growth. And we talked before in the past \u2013 recent past about bone cement being an impact of 50 to 75 basis points. And so that gets you well into kind of the mid-range of your weighted average market growth. So that seems to be an increased confidence versus what you guys were talking about in the last few months of 2018. Just help me out in thinking about that and whether that's the case or whether I'm reading too much into it?","Dan Florin","I think one thing \u2013 one thing I will mention to you Amit is, what you're doing there is you're taking the very high-end of our ranges, and that's fair. I mean, that's within the range. But your assumptions would be that everything goes, right and push us to the high-end of the range, that's certainly a possibility. But I think in order to do that you need to also understand that range is a range and there are things that could push us to lower in that realm as well.","Bryan Hanson","Yeah. But I think the \u2013 when you look at the performance in the back half, when you look at all the things we're stating relative to the innovation pipeline that we have not had in a while as an organization, and you look at some of the momentum, we're getting relative to the way the field is reacting to what they're seeing. It does give us confidence. I mean, fact is we're halfway through the two-year timeframe that we referenced, but as I said in my prepared remarks, I truly do believe we retired more than half the risk.","It doesn't mean there aren't still challenges ahead of us. It doesn't mean that there's not a lot of things we still need to do. But the fact is we're feeling as bullish as we have. But we've given you a range for a reason. As Cole said, there are things that we think can help us get to the top end of that range, but there are also things that we need to manage through as we roll out the year to ensure that we don't move to the bottom end of that range.","So, we've really spent a lot of time trying to give you a balanced view of what we think we can do in 2019. So, I hope you're reading into this more confidence as I'm feeling it. But the range is still reflective of that confidence.","Cole Lannum","Hope that helps Amit. Next question please.","Operator","Our next question is from Rick Wise with Stifel.","Rick Wise","Good morning Bryan, hi Cole. Is product portfolio optimization a priority for you Bryan? Maybe it's a question for you and Dan. When I think about optimizing the business and typically in turnaround many times redundant product lines, older product lines are involved in the turnaround, SKU reductions phasing out the older products, making room for the newer ones, all of which I assume would benefit over time throughput margins, working capital, cash flows, et cetera. How are you thinking about that? And where are you in that kind of a process? And just what impact would that kind of a process have on growth, outlook, execution, et cetera? Thank you.","Bryan Hanson","Yes. You're right on. I mean it is an important part of what we need to do as an organization. They're in for a number of reasons. But if I just think about supply and I think about quality just thinking about those vectors by themselves. As we begin to rationalize over time the portfolio, we clearly have an opportunity to increase our service levels from a supply perspective. The fewer categories we have, the better supply guarantee we're going to be able to provide, and the better service levels we're going to have.","From a quality perspective, as you start to reduce SKUs, obviously, you have less risk in holds, in recalls, in process of getting ready to approvals. So, all those things benefit the organization and guarantee when we talk about moving from just supply stability to truly getting into supply efficiency this is on the radar.","I don't want to scare anybody though at the same time because whenever I talk about this, everybody gets scared that we're going to do this and we're going to risk topline. That is not going to happen. Topline is the primary focus of the organization, but over time, we have got to be more disciplined relative to the portfolio optimization that we have.","The other thing that's going to drive us in this direction is we will be a more focused organization. There's no more shotgun. It will be a rifle approach this year. We need to make sure that we look at the very specific areas that could drive mix benefit in our business and make sure that the organization collectively is focused in those areas. That gives us an opportunity to clearly start driving momentum in those specific areas. It gives us an opportunity to get better signals to the operations team so that we have better demand planning and ultimately directs traffic in specific areas, so we get better results.","So, for all those reasons that I see us moving more in this direction, I just don't want anyone to be concerned that we're going to move too aggressively here and risk the topline.","Rick Wise","Thank you.","Cole Lannum","Thank you, Rick. Look, folks we're coming up on the bottom of the hour and I want to -- we need to wrap it up pretty soon. But I know we had a couple of lates here. Operator, let's try to see if we could sneak two more questions in and then we'll wrap it up. Next question please.","Operator","Our next question is from Bruce Nudell with SunTrust.","Bruce Nudell","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Bryan, I just want to talk about the mix benefits associated with the robot and assure that I'm thinking about this right. So just in the context of about a $5,000 implant you have $250 to $500 of robotic disposables. Going forward past that, you've got added value both in terms of planning and robotic technician support which helps stabilize the price. And then going forward beyond that, you have robots facilitating higher-end products like cementless knees and ultimately, bicruciate. So am I thinking about that right? And then also might the robot, when it's broadly used across the industry might we see real stabilization in knee pricing?","Bryan Hanson","I'm not going to -- so I wouldn\u2019t verify the specific elements relative to the disposable value or anything like that. But all the elements that you just referenced are exactly in line with the way we're thinking about mix inside of robotics. And my guess is, anybody else in robotics is thinking about it the same way.","Another factor associated with this beyond just mix that I don't want to lose, because I do believe that we have an advantage is when we talk about Persona which is personalized medicine. It is personalizing the knee and anatomically speaking and size-wise for the patient.","We start talking about personalized robotics with digital platforms that have the consumer appeal of Apple that is a pretty unique solution that we can begin to communicate to patients who do their homework on these procedures and potentially begin to deal in some of those patients to our surgeons.","That will definitely be an area that we concentrate on. So it's not just robotics, not just mix. We clearly want to take advantage of that because we think there's a real opportunity and the elements that you referenced are exactly right. But we don't want to lose the other either.","Bruce Nudell","Thanks so much.","Cole Lannum","Sure, absolutely. Thanks. And let's do one last question, operator, and then we need to wrap up after that. Next question, please.","Operator","Our last question will be from Kristen Stewart with Barclays.","Kristen Stewart","Hi, everybody. Thanks for taking my call. Bryan, I know I kind of touched on this last quarter, but I wanted to get your updated thoughts. Just, as you're thinking about the longer-term kind of earnings power of this company, how should we think about how you're framing this?","It sounds like from the guidance, the second half from an operating margin perspective will be towards the upper end of the range. It sounds like gross margins could be in a position to start to maybe expand again in 2020. Not to kind of get too far ahead, but how should investors just kind of think about what type power this company has today, absent any M&A?","Bryan Hanson","Yes. So, -- I think it's a great question. So, first of all, you're thinking about it exactly right. We communicated pretty clearly; we don't expect margin expansion in 2019. I think the range indicates that. We've been saying that all along, but we would expect to start to see movement in that direction in 2020.","And very clearly as we say that the three pillars of the organization, one of those pillars is going to be top-quartile performance for total shareholder return that would indicate that we clearly believe, not just topline, but also margin expansion and increasing cash flow are all things that this organization is capable of doing. Because there's no way that we can have that as a primary pillar of the organization if we didn't think in each of those categories we can improve.","And I do believe that the stabilization that we've been talking about just in the businesses that we play in today is very real the target that we should have in 2020. But when I think about the mix benefits of some of these categories, if things go well, we can get deeper penetrations and things like robotics or cementless or see the stemless which all have premiums in those procedures, then there is that opportunity even without acquisitions to outperform the market.","Now, my feeling is going forward, we want to do both if we want to durably be a contender for top-quartile performer in total shareholder returns. But don't think that today given the portfolio, if things go right, we wouldn't have a chance of outperforming market.","Kristen Stewart","Thank you.","Cole Lannum","Thanks for that Kristen. Thank you, Kristen. With that, we're going to close it down. Just as a couple of quick notes before we wrap-up. First of all, the sign of a good team is someone who can react quickly when something unexpected goes along. So, hopefully we were able to come back and still work through and answer most of your questions.","If for some reason, and again, I apologize for the technical snafus, that was not the case, please do come back to me and -- so we make sure we could help you understand what's going on.","As a reminder, a replay of this call is going to be available later today. You can review it on our website zimmerbiomet.com. And have a great Friday and a great weekend everyone. Bye, bye.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you again for participating in today's conference call. You may now disconnect."],"23157":["Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, July 27, 2018. [Operator Instructions]","I would now like to turn the conference over to Cole Lannum, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and IRO. Please go ahead, sir.","Cole Lannum","Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to Zimmer Biomet's second quarter earnings conference call, Friday edition. Joining me this morning is our President and CEO, Bryan Hanson; and our CFO, Dan Florin.","Before we get started, I'd like to remind you that our comments during this call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Please note that we assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements even if actual results or future expectations change materially. Please refer to our SEC filings for a detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties, in addition to the inherent limitations of such forward-looking statements.","Also the discussions during this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is included within the earnings release found on our website zimmerbiomet.com.","With that, I'll now turn over the call to Bryan. Bryan?","Bryan Hanson","Thanks, Cole, and thanks to everyone for joining us this morning. Before we get into specific update on our short-term initiatives, our Q2 results and update to 2018 expectations, I would like to just spend a minute on my view regarding our progress as a company and team. As you may remember during our fourth quarter call, I described the business is having more risk than opportunity due to the status of our supplier recovery efforts and quality remediation work as well as our culture building process.","On our first quarter call I changed my prospective to a more balanced view of risk and opportunity. Thanks to the early progress we made on the supply recovery milestones and meaningful engagement with the broader organization focused on culture building, including very specific interactions with the field sales organization.","As we come into Q3, my current position is one of cautious optimism fuelled by further progress on supply recovery, field execution improvements as reflected by the team's overall Q2 revenue performance and continued traction around the one mission, one culture focus of this Zimmer Biomet team.","It's important to recognize that my current sentiment takes into account the headwinds of excess pressure we need to offset and the continued heightened state of risk we must manage while executing our quality remediation efforts. There is fairly much work to be done but I like the progress that has been made and look forward to the team driving towards continued traction.","With that said, let me provide a bit more detail for each of our previously stated short-term priorities, which are the ongoing quality remediation, our supply recovery efforts, new product introductions and our culture enhancement activities.","Turning first to the status for quality remediation. As we communicated previously and also shared publicly, we submitted our comprehensive response to the FDA's 43 observations stemming from the re-inspection of the Warsaw North Campus. Although we currently have no additional information to share, I want to reiterate that none of the FDA's observations identified a specific issue regarding the performance of any particular product. As a result the facility continues to manufacture its full range of products at this time. At Zimmer Biomet, patient safety is our first and guiding priority, completing our quality remediation to the highest standards of the matter utmost important that we take very seriously. Execution of our remediation plans is progressing with the sense of urgency. However fixing these issues in the right way takes time. I remain confident in the people and the processes we have in place and I can assure you that we will continue to appropriately resource and staff this important work and we will keep the FDA updated on our progress.","With regard to supply we\u2019re happy with our progress but we are not completely satisfied with where we are versus our internal steady-state goals. We still have important work to do with regard to manufacturing and quality remediation, which is why we're going to stay diligent in these efforts. That's said, our progress toward a steady supply environment is real and contributed to our performance in Q2 and increases our confidence that supply will not be a barrier to accomplishing our 2018 guidance and the turnaround timeline we previously communicated.","Now turning to our new product launches, we continue to have confidence in the products we have already launched and the timelines for the pipeline products still to come. For example, we are very excited about our most recent additions to Persona family, including the Partial Knee system and our most recently launched TM Tibia system, which will be in full launch later this year. Both of these new offerings have gone under very strong clinical feedback resurgence thus far.","We also look forward to products launching at the end of the year including the limited launches of the Persona Revision system and the total knee applications for rROSA robotics platform. As a reminder, the combination of steady state supply in the full launch -- and importantly stating the full launch of these differentiated technologies will allow our sales organization to truly go on full offence.","In addition to positioning our organization to deliver sustained organic growth, we are committed to active portfolio management to drive diversify growth and enhanced shareholder value. Zimmer Biomet's trusted brand, scale and expertise afford us an opportunity to build leading positions and faster growth of categories. On the culture front, we continue to strive for higher levels of engagement with Zimmer Biomet's team members worldwide. As part of that effort, over the last quarter, I told several mission ceremonies with thousands of our team members to share with them our new mission and guiding principles. Our plan is to reach every team member with this important message regarding the one mission, one culture focus of this organization.","We also recently completed a comprehensive employee engagement survey, which has provided us with a clear picture of our strengths and opportunities for improvement within our workplace, as well as a baseline for measuring the progress of our future culture building initiatives. We're encouraged to be most about our results without our team members are overwhelmingly ready and willing to go above and beyond in their roles the global stronger, more innovative company. As CEO, I'm energized by their personal commitment as we work together on the path to future success.","With that, I'll turn it over to Dan to go through our financial results in more detail.","Dan Florin","Thank you, Bryan. Before we get started I'd like to note that this quarter, we are changing the presentations of our GAAP income statement to provide additional transparency. We no longer will use the special items, operating expense category, instead, we will now provide more specific details on the items formally in that category. Importantly, there is no change to our historical or future GAAP or non-GAAP earnings per share.","Turning to our performance. Net sales totaled $2,008,000,000 in the second quarter, an increase of 3% over the prior year period, which represents an increase of 1% on the constant currency basis. On a similar basis, in the Asia Pacific region, our sales increased by 5.4%, while our Americas sales increased by 0.9%, and our Europe, Middle East and Africa sales decreased by 1.8%.","Our adjusted gross profit margin came in at 71.9%, reflecting a benefit from mix, offset by continued incremental manufacturing and inventory costs as well as the impact of price declines. Our GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.90.","Our adjusted results exclude $265 of expenses in the quarter, approximately $110 million of which are cash outflows for quality remediation, business integration and other items. The non-cash charges are primarily related to intangible amortization. ","Adjusted operating profit in the quarter amounted to $562 million or 28% of sales. Our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 18.9%. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $1.92. A reconciliation of reported net earnings to adjusted net earnings is included in this morning's press release. Operating cash flow for the quarter amounted to $393 million and our free cash flow was approximately $300 million. Our year-to-date free cash flow totaled $704 million.","I would like to now turn to our updated 2018 guidance. We now believe that our organic revenue growth for the year will be slightly better than discussed last quarter. However, we are updating our revenue growth guidance to a new range of between 1% and 2.5%. This new range assumes an annual positive impact from foreign currency of between 100 and 150 basis points. This is less of a positive impact on our previous estimates due to the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar.","Given the modest improvement in our base business, we should be able to largely offset the earnings impact of foreign currency, which is about $0.10 per share in the second half of 2018, without affecting our ability to continue making focused investments into R&D and our commercial organization to help accelerate future revenue growth opportunities.","Therefore, our original 2018 adjusted earnings per share guidance of $7.60 to $7.80 remained unchanged. It's important also remind you that we continue to expect the third quarter to be hit fairly hard by normal business seasonality. Due to continued strong cash flow performance primarily attributable to increased accounts receivable collections, we are updating our free cash flow guidance to a new range of between $1.2 billion and $1.35 billion.","With that, let me turn the call to Bryan.","Bryan Hanson","Before we're going to Q&A, I just want to reiterate the fact that our second quarter results reflected improved overall performance, as well as continuing progress on our operational and manufacturing goals. I want to emphasize that our second quarter achievements strengthened our confidence that we are focused on the right immediate priorities and that over the long term we are well-positioned to client back in the positive market share of growth.","As I've said before, our turn around will take time to complete, and we won\u2019t declare success until we\u2019re consistently delivering top line growth at or above market rates with a competitive operating margin. From where we stand today, I can tell you we still have a lot of work to do to achieve these goals. But as we enter the second half of 2018, I\u2019m encouraged by the progress we're making and I\u2019m confident that we're building a strong foundation to deliver sustainable, long-term growth and ultimately value creation.","With that, I\u2019m going to turn it back to Cole, so we can enter into the Q&A.","Cole Lannum","Thanks, Bryan. We try to reserve the majority of the time on the call this morning for your questions. Before we get into the Q&A session, I would remind you to please limit yourself to a single question with a brief follow-up if needed. I really appreciate if you'd respect the process. Please don\u2019t make me have to cut you off. You can still free to put your step back into queue, if you further questions after that. And that will allow us to get into as many different questions as possible. With that Lauren, may we please have the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Mike Mattson with Needham & Company.","Mike Mattson","Bryan, it sounds like you're planning to take sort of a portfolio management approach here at Zimmer similar to what you did at Covidien. And I guess what I'm wondering is Covidien had a kind of much wider mix of businesses when you look at growth and margins and things like that. And at Zimmer, it seems like there is more consistent margins and growth rates across the various businesses. So that's the first part of my question. If you can just maybe comment on how you can implement that here. And then the second thing would be just with regard to M&A, are you looking at opportunities more within the existing markets? Or would you consider going more of a diversification drop similar to what strikers done within the recent years? Thanks.","Bryan Hanson","Yes, absolutely Mike. I just want to make sure the first part of your question I understood, could you just give me a little more color around what you are referencing there?","Mike Mattson","Yes, so I mean you've talked about portfolio management in order words shutting maybe lower margin, lower growth businesses, why you are looking to acquire things that are higher growth and higher margin. In the businesses like Covidien, there was more of a fix of -- we had some really low margin, low growth businesses and really high margin and high growth businesses. So could you please review that, it seems like the businesses is here of more similar. So that's my question essentially?","Bryan Hanson","I got you. Understood. So when I think about active portfolio management, I guess first and foremost is, it is another opportunity for us to be able to drive consistent shareholder value. Clearly, organic growth is the primary focus of the organization and we have to get to a place where we are at market of better. But I want to be able to compliment that by ensuring that we're waiting into businesses and markets that are more attractive in the places we're in today.","And let me just kind of really put an explanation mark on that. First and foremost, I'd like to scale in some of the areas that we already play in that have better growth profiles in some of our larger businesses. Some of that would be in the set businesses obviously. So our first area of focus will be to add scale in areas where we already play in faster growth sub markets where we have an opportunity to take advantage of the brand that we have in the commercial organization to be able to drive attraction in those places. And ultimately as a result of that, bring our weighted average market growth up. So that will be the first kind of leg of this process. I really want to make sure that we're doubling down in spaces we already play in, build more scale and make sure that we increased the weighted average market growth, and there is plenty of opportunities to do that. I'm not at all opposed as we go into the active portfolio management process and we have more fire power to do so in diversifying the business even beyond some of the areas that we currently play. Again with an eye towards driving the mission of the organization, making sure that it's economically attractive for us to do so and drive shareholder value with an eye towards that increase weighted average market growth. So that's kind of that the phased approach that I would see. It's double down in areas where we already play and drive scale, drive weighted average market growth up and then potentially diversify outside of the spaces as well. Relative to divestitures, which I think is really the first part of your question there. It isn\u2019t just the margin profile that we would look at; it would be really mission alignment. It would be our ability to win in the space given our capabilities versus maybe others that might find our business is more attractive. And the fact is, we love all of the businesses and that we have, not all of them are going to be invested in equally and not all of them have the same opportunity for us. And if any of our businesses are attracted to others of third-parties, that see more value in them than us and they are not critical to our mission, we would contemplate divestiture assuming that we can take those proceeds and apply them to the areas I talked about in the beginning here. So that\u2019s the way we\u2019re going to take the approach. It will be similar playbook that what we have done previously at Covidien and what we done at Medtronic as well. But that ultimately, as you said, we don't have that real difference in margin profile in our businesses. So the margin profile will be one of the primary things we look at.","Cole Lannum","Thanks, Mike. Next question please.","Operator","Our next question is from Bruce Nudell with SunTrust.","Bruce Nudell","Bryan, just looking at major joint market year to date, it looks like it's around 1%, last year is around, and historically, people have thought of major choices 3%. Is there something secular going on? And if there is, is that putting more alacrity in your diversification efforts? Thank you so much.","Bryan Hanson","Sure. First of all, nothing that's happening right now would have changed our opinion or aggressiveness or stance on diversification. As I wouldn\u2019t read anything into what you may be seeing relative to large joints market growth. And to be honest, as we said in the first quarter as well, because there was a lot of discussion around, are you seeing pressure on volumes in the first quarter, we really aren\u2019t. The fact is when you work the numbers based on everybody's performance over the last two quarters. Clearly, what you're saying about the growth rates is accurate. But what\u2019s interesting about it is you\u2019re not really hearing any company complaining about this market growth. And what's interesting for me too is I\u2019m not hearing my own organization complaining about volumes out in the marketplace as a reason why they can't obtain or drive past the goals that we set. So that tells me that even though we\u2019re seeing maybe a little more pressure than normal, please stay it on the math. We\u2019re not actually seeing an impact in our ability to drive the goals that we have for the year. So, again, I don\u2019t want to read too much into the market growth over the last two quarters. I think it is not a perfect science in the first place associated with looking at these things in a view add up to the major players and there are differences in a lot of things to go into those numbers that I don\u2019t always stated their perfect science on this. But at the end of the day, it's not going to change our opinion on how quickly we\u2019re going to look to diversify. The diversification is a strategy that we had and we will continue to move forward. And again anything that we've seen relative to market growth in large joints does not change our opinion in what we\u2019re going to be able to accomplish this year or beyond that.","Cole Lannum","Next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Pasquale with Guggenheim.","Christopher Pasquale","Bryan, can you give us some more color on the supply situation and where things stand today relative to what you were hoping? When you talked about being back to full capacity by the start of 3Q, are there particular categories where you're in good shape today, but others where you still having issues or is it broader than that?","Bryan Hanson","Thanks, Chris. I'd say, I don\u2019t want to speak to specific categories just for competitive reasons, but and I'm just kind of pretty transparent person. I'm pretty happy with progress that we didn\u2019t hit all the goals that we had set for the first part of Q3, some of its split. And so with that that's won't be transparent with that. That's said we've obviously made great strides in making progress here. And ultimately we're seeing that reflected in the results in Q2. And we're going to, obviously, we\u2019re seeing it in our cautious optimism here because we're seeing supply is not going to be a barrier for us to accomplish what we said in 2018 and we turnaround itself. But before I get into any more detail, I do want to just call out a couple of groups and team members that we have that have made this a reality. Again we're not where we want to be, but the progress is real. And our manufacturing team has done a yeoman's work here. I spent a lot of time on the floor talking to folks that are actually working on the manufacturing floor. I guess that these people are putting in a lot of time, a lot of extra hours to get this company back to where it needs to be. Again still work to be done. But the attitude and work ethic of these folks is absolutely inspiring. When I'm having a bad day, I will go out to the floor, and talk to some of those folks and it turns my day around. So I want to make sure that I call them out because they've been a big part of the progress that we've made. And the group is our sales organization. I've spent a lot of time in the field talking not just to the territory leaders and not just to the reps, but also the folks that are running operations in the field. Again all of these individuals are doing significant work to make sure that the product that we do have gets the surgeons that fills the cases and takes care of the patients. And that is extra work that they are doing everyday in the supply constrained environment. So I appreciate what they're doing. It's a big part of why we are able to get the performance we did in Q2.","But here is the thing that I really want to concentrate on, steady stage in our supply is the first step, and we are making progress towards it. Certain brands that are lagging behind but we'll catch those. The most important thing now is to be able to get to steady state and sustain it because at the end of the day steady state supply has to translate into incremental revenue, accelerated revenue. One of the things that we've been doing now is really to find internal city organization. What do you mean by steady state? And beyond the obvious stuff back order recovery and safety stock levels and those types of things. We're also starting now a sentiment survey from our commercial organization. How do they feel about where we are with supply? Because ultimately until they feel confident we are not going to get the revenue acceleration that we are looking for. This is part of process of saying, we're not where we want to be yet.","In the Q2 survey that we did just three very simple questions. First one is do we get make progress from the previous quarter. The second one is do you feel confident now with the supply you have, the service to your customers? And the third one is are you ready given the supply and situation to go after competitive surgeons? And in this Q2, we got a pretty good response on was their improvement. We've got a neutral response on can I supply my current surgeons, which tells me that they feel like they can, but haven't been doing it long enough for them to feel comfortable yet. And there was a negative response in the scale that we have and being able to go after competitive surgeons. And again that tells me we're not where we need to be. Because what they are telling us is until I know for a fact that I can supply my current surgeons, I'm not going to take on the additional risks they go after material of new business. And that's where we've got to get. So what I say we still got to make progress here. It's not just getting to steady state, it's maintaining it and getting the sentiment that the sales organization to shift and move to revenue acceleration.","Operator","Our next question comes from Glenn Novarro with RBC Capital Markets.","Glenn Novarro","Bryan, a question on the North facility observation. So fewer observations this inspection relative to the last, but they were eight repeat observations and this is made some investors worried at the North facility could receive a warning letter. So could you provide your view on the repeat observations? How fixable are these observations? And your confidence that the remediation plan on the observations will be acceptable to the FDA? Thanks.","Bryan Hanson","Well, what I would say first is I don't want that get into any specifics relative to any of the observations or how I feel about the observations. We've been pretty transparent in the entire process relative to our quality remediation and interaction that we've had with the FDA. So everything that we provided in our responses to the observations is public. We make sure that you could see that. Not every company would do that, we did it. And so I think you've got what you need in the public domain on how we feel about the observations and our responses to those. What I would tell you is, I think, this is really important. I just want to reinforce that JD as well as myself, we take our commitment to quality and ultimately patient safety very, very seriously. It is the commitment that we make as an organization as a matter fact the new mission that we created. Our monetary right now around the world communicating this mission live and in color to our team members isn\u2019t just an inspirational mission. There are principals inside the mission that define who we are going to be. We are and we\u2019re going to continue to be. One of the primary principles talks about quality, patient safety and conducting ourselves with integrity period. These are not just words in a mission statement. These are things that we will actually define ourselves by. And when I present to the organization and these mission ceremonies, we talk extensively about what that means to each and every one of us. So I just want to make sure that that's clear. Relative to where we are right now, I feel good about the responses that we've had with these observations. I\u2019m 100% committed as is the team to resourcing appropriately to quality remediation in the North campus. I do not like to have an open checkbook policy on anything. But in this particular situation it is an open check book. If resources are needed, the resources are retained and we\u2019re going to move this thing forward. So again, I don\u2019t want to comment on anything specifically. We don't -- we can\u2019t relative to respond into the observations. And now it's just -- the process has just got unfold.","Cole Lannum","Next question please, operator.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.","David Lewis","Bryan, I wanted to ask about the status share across the business. And specifically, where is share better, where is loss more pronounced? I wonder how is it trending at customers that have historically been through higher Zimmer customers versus where your share has been lower. At this point, how much of your share loss you think is supply related versus the product positioning? Thank you.","Bryan Hanson","I tell you it's always tough to actually speak specifically to the reasons where we have deficiencies in share. When I say share, I think, what you're talking about is just growth versus market growth and that's specifically where our current stage is relative to overall market share, but a lot of our categories that's basic. We have been growing below market. And that's the very thing that we're concentrating on is a matter of fact we define the turnaround in this organization as overall getting back to market or above market growth in a sustained way. That will require us in our major categories to be able to get to market growth and sustain it. Now we're making progress. And I think some of the progress that we've made in certain categories has everything to do with the fact that we have a great sales organization that is prepared to sell. We have a combination of Zimmer portfolio and the Biomet portfolio, which is second to none. We've been saying that all along. We just got to be over supply it. And the fact is we have the manufacturing team increased the capability in supplying that product. So all those things coming together on some of the culture building as well, has been able to help us start to close the gap where we've had gaps in our performance versus market. We're not there yet and we're clearly not there. I mean that's basic even though we beat our expectations in the second quarter, we're far from being at overall market growth. We need to get there. That's the goal. The things that need to happen for us to feel confident that we can do it is that steady state supply, what we maintain it and we get that sentiment of the sales organization up and translated into revenue growth. We forgot to launch the new products where we have product assets we've talked about in the past and get those in the full launch that needs to happen. And then ultimately we got to continue to drive the culture of the organization to make people believe we can win. And those are the things that we have to accomplish to be able to ensure that when you ask this question in the future, we can confidently and comfortably say we are at market or better in the major categories that we have.","Cole Lannum","Thanks David. Laura, next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matthew O'Brien with Piper Jaffray.","Matthew O'Brien","Bryan, there has been a lot of discussion on the call about diversification or maybe into the faster growth areas, you've got very good free cash flow, the leverage ratio, I think, is less then 3x now. But you've got this manufacturing issue. So is that the biggest gaining factor to you going out and doing some more deals need to get you into faster growth areas that are already in or other areas? Is that something where we should think of you getting more aggressive maybe six to nine months after you feel better about where manufacturing is at?","Bryan Hanson","John, first of all I just made a quick correction that we're not yet from a leverage perspective under 3. It was still 3, slightly above 3. The goal would be to be below 3 and we expect to be able to do that in 2019. But John, what I would tell you is in a perfect world if you are sequencing this, we would do exactly what you just said. We would focus first on our short-term priorities as we've previously stated. Those short-term priorities would get us to the point where we were steady state as a business, which would mean in the spaces that we already play with the businesses that we already have in our major segment that were growing at or above market. ","Once that's stabilized, then we would start to get into more active portfolio management. But in reality, what we know is you can put best way plan never survives first contact with the enemy, right. And so that plan, in the realistic world, says if we are opportunities in spaces that we know are attractive to us become available and opportunistically we can wait into those we're not going to ignore them. And we do have the fire power now to do smaller tuck-ins. And so if those opportunities become available to us, even if we haven't gotten to the place where we're defining our business as steady state, we would take advantage of those opportunities, if again they maybe on extent and we thought they could drive shareholder value and importantly we drive the mission for the organization. So if we can sequence it perfectly would be the way you said putting the real world, it doesn\u2019t always happen that right.","Cole Lannum","Thanks, Matt. Next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.","Larry Biegelsen","So by my math the guidance implies about one 1% to 1.5% constant currency growth in the second half. The question is do you expect that sequential improvement in the constant currency growth rate in Q3 and Q4? And what are you assuming now for resolving the supply constraints are not drivers that any response by to Chris' question earlier. Thanks for taking the questions.","Bryan Hanson","Dan, why don't you take the first part of the question? And then I'll handle the second one.","Dan Florin","Sure. So Larry the second half implied constant currency growth rate about 1% as you are suggesting. The Q3 to Q4, we\u2019ve not given specific guidance on the phasing of Q3 to Q4. The comps are different. The seasonality has been difficult to the nail precisely Q3 to Q4. But feel good about that about 1% second half constant currency growth that\u2019s implied in our guidance.","Bryan Hanson","One lab that you would expect that giving typical seasonality Q3 would be more pressure than Q4. What I would say on the supply recovery, I think why I want to answer it is, there's work to be done in certain brands, but we feel confident given where we already are. And that where we nowhere going to exit in Q3 that this is not going to get in the way of us delivering what we just said in 2018 and will absolutely not getting the way if the turnaround time that we've communicated in the past. To me the most important thing at this point is to get the sentiment of the organization up to be the sales organization so that the translating that supply into revenue acceleration. But again I just want to reiterate, we do not see supplies being a barrier to our ability to deliver what we said.","Cole Lannum","Thanks Larry. Next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Richard Newitter with Leerink Partners.","Richard Newitter","Just wanted to focus on the S.E.T. business. This was a little bit representative narrowly of underperformance relative to our forecast was, obviously, your recon was better. I'm just curious, with respect to an earlier question that was asked how much is supply versus product gaps driving that within the S.E.T. business. Can you talk a little bit about whether that's more impacted perhaps from a supply issue relative to recon? And I'm also going to just ask if you can comment on the stemless shoulder launch. I would have thought if it's not supply that might have helped that division. Thank you.","Bryan Hanson","So first of all stemless shoulder going well. As a matter of fact we're just talking to shoulder surgeon last night at dinner, and that he was commenting how excited he is about the launch. He is using the product already and he has had very good results. So I would just tell you that we remain confident and comfortable with our expectations around our stemless shoulder in just the shoulder space in total. What I would say is you're accurate. The S.E.T. business -- first of all, not all of our brands are impacted equally relative to the speed at which were recoveries supply. And in the second quarter, the S.E.T. business was pressured a little more than large joints when it comes to supply recovery. So that was part of -- some of the performance of the business in the quarter. But the other thing too is we decide some timing quite frankly of capital that will benefit us in the back half of the year that just didn\u2019t translate into the second quarter, so that's some of it as well. In the final pieces, we've actually has some good convergence in the set business. I'm not going to speak specifically to where, but across the S.E.T. business. And a lot of that's not going to translate until Q3 and Q4. So I feel good about our progress in S.E.T. I feel good about the supply recoveries we come into Q3. And I think what you're going to see in S.E.T. is our ability in the back half to have better performance than we did in the first half.","Cole Lannum","Next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rick Wise with Stifel.","Rick Wise","Maybe highlight some if you would give us little more color on the challenges you are facing in the EMEA region. You called out the weakness there. Maybe help us understand some of the softness drivers. Is there a specific geography? What's the pathway timeline for recovery? Is it a small fix? Is it portfolio? Is it people? Anything to help us understand find that would be helpful.","Bryan Hanson","So what I would say is if I may, it was a little wider than what we have contemplated for the second quarter not dramatically. So to be honest, that a little wider than what we had thought. And a few reasons that I would point to you, I think, first of all, supply constraint was renowned in Q2. It probably impacts Europe a little more than other areas just given the tendering process that occurs to be able to get in certain tenders and win those tenders you have to have a full portfolio available. It has been always the case and other regions in the world. So it does intend them maybe a little differently strictly depending on where you are in Europe. That's one thing. The other is we have some tender timing, not lost tenders, but just tender timing that's going to push us towards the back half of the year where we thought we're going to get those earlier in the year and that's real. And then noticed being honest, we had Katarzyna lead the organization. She has been in place for a long time. Whenever you have a senior leadership shift like that, there's always a risk for some level of disruption. And so I don\u2019t want to say that there isn't that. I don\u2019t see it is being material. But the fact is -- that there's some level of disruption that you got to assume is happening. At the same time I've spent a lot of time in Europe with the team underneath Katarzyna and we have strong players. I have a lot of confidence in the team. I feel very confident that they are going to continue to be able to steward the business, and I don't see us having a falling knife situation here at all. At the same time I don't necessarily believe we're going to see a quick turnaround either. I would say that the back half of the year was look pretty similar to the first half of the year when we're talking about that region of the world. So again not a major concern. It's not far-off of our expectations in what we assumed so far of the year. And the performance of EMEA throughout the rest of the year has already contemplated in the expectations that we just provided.","Cole Lannum","Laura, can we have the next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs.","Isaac Ro","Quick question just as a follow-up to [Indiscernible] Bryan can you talk just a little bit about how much time you're spending when it comes to recruitment whether it would be in sales force or leadership team? Just kind of adjusted in the progress there some of the things that you're doing there put into place that the people who you want maybe are harder for us to see on the outside. Thank you so much.","Bryan Hanson","For me it\u2019s a big part of what we need to do in the organization is just to increase this kind of one Zimmer Biomet mission and culture. And I don\u2019t want to -- sometimes people put this as a secondary thing, but to me, culture and mission any organization is absolutely critical -- it's absolutely critical. We have great people in his organization. I don't need a wholesale change of leadership or folks in the organization, I have confidence in the team. What we need to do is to create a framework. And in an environment where these individuals can perform and the way that I know they can. And talking about the mission of the organization, getting people excited about the culture of the organization he fact that it's one team, one five goes long way to unleashing the capability of the people we already have on this team. So I just don\u2019t want there to be a sense out there the investment community or anywhere else that we don't have the team members needed to be able to make this business turnaround. I feel confident that we do. We just got to create an environment that allows them to do it. At the same time, in certain critical areas, we have added talent from outside the organization that I think will help increase the capability of the organization that turn things around. Our Head of Operations, as I said in the past, is new. That individual is bringing additional people in that I think will help us in capabilities where we have certain gaps today. Again not that we don\u2019t have a great team already but we\u2019re adding additional capabilities that I think will only help. We\u2019ve done the same thing in our portfolio management strategy area. We upgraded talent there. We\u2019re going to continue to do that. And my senses will continue to see additional folks come onboard underneath Rachel and that gives me more confident that we are going to have a sound strategy and even more focus in this organization to ensure that we're applying our resources to the areas that kind of bring the most value to the organization and ultimately our shareholders. So we\u2019re making changes in addition where we need to but make no mistake. We have a very good team and we\u2019re creating the environment where that team can be unleashed.","Isaac Ro","A follow up on \u2026","Cole Lannum","No, no. Isaac, one question. Get back into queue and we will put you back in the queue if we have time. Okay? Next please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robbie Marcus with JP Morgan.","Robbie Marcus","Dan, two very quick financial questions for you. One on EPS spacing for the back half of the year. Historically, Zimmer had a drop of 15% in EPS from second quarter to third quarter. How are you thinking about that with this year? And then maybe just give us an update on I know your FX hedges will flow through gross margin. What are you thinking of the impact gross margin in the '18 and '19? And any color on EPS impact form FX next year would be great? Thanks.","Dan Florin","Sure, Robbie. So first on phasing Q3 to Q4, it's certainly appropriate to look back over the past number of years and look at that seasonality its significant in our business and you see it every year. In particular, when you look back at Q3 of last year from an earnings perspective, recall that we made some bonus accrual adjustments in Q3 of last year, which was a benefit to the P&L as we trued up those bonus accruals. So we came into this year from a full year guidance perspective and talked about that as a significant year-over-year headwind and there is a significant item in Q3 about the headwind. So I think, as you model Q3 versus Q4 just know that inside of Q3, you've got this big credit in Q3 of last year that won't be there in Q3 of this year because thus far we're performing. So while I'm not going to give you the precise phase in Q3 and Q4, I would just remind you to look back at revenue seasonality of the corresponding OpEx that is expect various variable and then just know that the prior year Q3 had that credit inside of it.","With respect to hedges, in my prepared remarks, I talked about a total FX headwinds earnings of about $0.10 in the second half of the year, given the sharp move in the U.S. dollar since our call in April, so that movement about 5% strengthening of the U.S. dollars while we have a very robust hedging program, the sharpness of that move really prevents us from completely offsetting that in the P&L. So the $0.10 headwind would have been significantly worse if we didn\u2019t have a heading program. And the offset for the heading program will flow through 2019 as well. So last piece would be when you think of gross margin 2018 to 2019, we've talked a lot about the headwinds in 2018, we talked about the incremental production costs that were still incurring, the capitalization policy that's associated with that. And therefore when you think about '19 versus '18 you're still going to have a bit of a headwind on the gross margin rates due to pricing and then also that that incremental pause that would still be followed through the P&L.","Cole Lannum","Robbie, let me add one more thing on the sequencing thing. You mentioned the 15% number. I won't be clear and Dan just had said this as well. There is a mean of necessary we're going to have an exact 15% kind of impact. We're not going to talk about specifics there. It could be higher than that, it could be lower than that. I think the reason why it's important to know that we pointed out is a lot of people on the street have got that right. It's very, very straight forward it's how it happens every single time, a lot of surgical oriented companies see that seasonality shouldn\u2019t be a big deal. And if you want those people than you are in a good shape. We have already receive three people out there though that may have not fully understood this SG&A dynamics again we're talking about and we just going to highlight this so that when you do the models you go back you take a look at that you understand that's SG&A in particular comp has a real impact there. And of course happy to go through all this offline with anyone if there is any confusion on that okay.","Thanks a lot Robbie. Next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joanne Wuensch with BMO Capital Markets.","Joanne Wuensch","I want to fast forward to a year from today. And I think, everyone on this call understands that this is a shift, a progress, a gradual improvement, pick any out to you want. But a year from today what is a win and what will you be saying or could be saying that will be deemed to disappointment? And the second question to that is when you think you stop losing market share?","Bryan Hanson","Well, the sister question is kind of buried in the first question anyway. So what I would tell you is a year from today, I hope we're not saying anything, that\u2019s a disappointment to where we thought we would be. Here is the imperfect timing actually to be a year. A year from today what we need to be saying and this is our short-term objective is number one we have gotten to the place where steady state in our supply has been maintained in the sentiment of our organization, particularly the commercial organization, realizes this and does not have concerns with pursuing new business as result of supply constrains. That has to be in place. Second piece that we talked about, we've got to launch the products that we've been openly communicating are important to the portfolio to get our reps back on full offense and we need to get them into full launch, which by the way around the year from now would be the timeframe that we should be in full launch of that full portfolio. So if we\u2019re at that place with supply recovery and we continue to make progress on the culture of the organization, particularly, again, around our commercial organization, I think we\u2019re in a position to begin to go on through often. Now what I do know about being in a position going to offense and actually realizing it, there's typically some period of lag between that. We\u2019ve got to build up your bolt-in of offensive opportunities and ultimately translate that bolt-in build in into convert the business. So my feeling is as we\u2019re coming into a year from now, those three things will be happening and will be able to talk about the offensive position that we\u2019re in. And then ultimately, as we've talked about the turnaround to the business, we want to be at or above market growth in a sustained way and we truly do we believe that can happen in 2020.","Cole Lannum","Thank you, Joanne. Operator, can we have the next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI.","Vijay Kumar","Maybe going back to the guidance question. So I just want to understand the 3Q in 19 comments where it's a 3Q, obviously, there is seasonality. And what I think, I think there is also days impact make the composite easier supplies coming back up on. And I just want to understand how all of those things ready together. And I think relative to that the FX impact for 19 at current levels. I think, on the last call we said that we expect the operating leverage. I just wanted to understand that is still impact right given where rates are currently? Thank you.","Dan Florin","Sure. I would just say that our guidance for the second half of the year takes into account everything that you just said. It takes into account the comps from the prior year, takes into account in improving some live situation that Bryan is referring to and the FX movements. So that\u2019s all factored into the second half guidance. With respect to 2019 operating margin and Bryan talking about the comments on this as well, we\u2019re going to stay focused on delivering what we\u2019re talking about here in the back half of 2018 first and foremost. We\u2019re going to see how that goes. And we will continue to have a bias for investment in areas that deliver returns from a growth profile perspective. So when we look out next year as we go through our budgeting process and see how the year is progressing, we'll look for additional opportunities to invest to drive growth. And I think it's fair to say that if we see opportunities to do that we will priority over that relative to driving operating margin expansion.","Bryan Hanson","I don\u2019t know if I have anything material to add, well said. I mean to me, I think to us as an organization and probably to you as well, the primary goal of this organization has got to be to get revenue growth up and get it up in a sustained way. That will be the primary focus, and that will be our Northstar. When we accomplished that then we can truly look at operating margin expansion, but I would give up on operating margin expansion in the short-term to be able to drive revenue growth. And when we do see those opportunities, where we getting traction in areas where we're making investment? We will double down in those areas and continue to push even if it impacts our ability to get that modest expansion we've been talking about in 2019 for margin.","Cole Lannum","It's a good point. I'm glad that you brought it up Vijay. Operator, next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Raj Denhoy with Jefferies.","Raj Denhoy","Maybe a two-part question Bryan. The first would be on new products. You mentioned the importance there but you did have some launches in the quarter Partial Knee, the Tibia was out there and then you have two slated three year. And so what is now baked in there just from the --let's call the partial launch of those products and guidance. And the second question would just be on portfolio management. Dental was below our expectations. Just wondering what the strategy is there and what the company contemplate potentially a spin or a divestiture of that asset going forward? Thanks again.","Bryan Hanson","So first of all when I think about the new product launches, I think the primary thing that I'm looking forward here just across the board, you forget for a minute new product which is across the board. Are we as an organization doing what we say we're going to do? It is very important to me. It's one of the culture pieces that we want to have as one Zimmer Biomet. When we say we're going to do something we do it. And if we get any challenges in the process we pivot inside of those and we make sure that we ultimately accomplish what we said how to accomplish. That's one of the things that I'm really concentrating well in the organization. And we're sending that message loud and clear. What I'm happy about on the new product side as we are delivering on what we committed. We've been hitting pretty much on target, all product launches that we had committed to. And I'm taking about internal commitments to timelines not just the external commitments that we've made to you. And we're delivering on the expected revenue growth associated with those new products. I'm not going to get into specifics. We just know that the revenue growth that we expect from those products is coming to bear. And ultimately it is built into the guidance and expectations that we set for the back half of the year and beyond. So I feel really good about that. I feel solid about where we are. Relative to specific new products, across the board where we've launched, the response from surgeons is extremely positive. I just can't wait on the cement less side to get the full launch because the response associated with that product so far is extremely positive. And full launch is becoming at the end of the year. And it's not remembered just about the revenue associated with that individual products, it's the potential pull through of other categories and our ability to get back to market using other categories. This new product gives energy to the sales organizations and ultimately gives energy to our surgeon partners. So again I'm very happy with what we see thus far. I mean we still have a lot to do. We get major products we still have to launch, but every indication is that we're still on track to delivering those limited launches as we've been communicating. Specifically dental, I would agree that the dental market is a tough market for us right now. It remains very competitive. And we've been, as we've previously stated, making changes within the dental organization to senior management. We're continuing some of those changes within the dental organization to try to position us to be able to compete in a more holistic way. The key thing that we put in the place to stabilize we got to stabilize that was dropping for equipped. We want to at least stabilize that drop and then try to move into a position of growth. Fairly we haven't got to the second phase of that plan. We have stabilized little wonder where we want to be in the second quarter, but it's not in consistent with previous quarters. The real goal for us there what to use the momentum of that new team and begin to get traction in the dental business. That's where we are with the dental business.","Cole Lannum","Thanks to ask me although I would note that sounded suspiciously like more than one question that you asked, but I'll note that for you after the call. During the time shifts, I\u2019m real quick, we\u2019re going to have time for maybe two or three more questions we're going to try to get them through if we can. Operator next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Craig Bijou with Cantor Fitzgerald.","Craig Bijou","I wanted to ask on the spine stemless business. You guys obviously saw pretty good step up there in the quarter. So just wanted to see what the driver was there? And then maybe your overall thoughts on the spine market and the growth profile of your specific business going forward?","Bryan Hanson","Yes, so I would say, I'm, again pretty happy with where we are right now with that segment of our business. Big part of it is we've just made, I just talked about the dental business, we've made some management changes and some structural changes to that segment of our organization. We got some new team members in almost across-the-board in spine. But also in other categories of our business that I think are setting a really strong strategy. They began to implement a channel strategy that provides risk because there's change in the channel strategy that is needed, but progressively moving that forward and having good success so far as indicated by the Q2 number. And we continue to feel confident that we\u2019re going to be able to deliver what we expect in the back half. So I\u2019m excited that some combination of a new team, new products that we\u2019re launching and a channel strategy that we\u2019re putting in the place that's all coming together to be able to allow that business to perform that plan or even slightly better.","Cole Lannum","Thanks for that. Operator, next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kyle Rose with Canaccord.","Kyle Rose","Earlier in the call you talked about the rose in the application coming on track for launch. Just want to see if you can frame that out in terms of how you really define a control launches 10 robust to 20 robust? Is it similar customers? Is it competitive customers, the DeNovo robot users versus experienced robot users? And then just on the second part, from a rose prospective is when you anticipate the reengaging the spine market with the robotic application?","Bryan Hanson","I'll start with that one first. The goal would be to have a limited launch either right at the time or just right behind the rose in the application for spine. So spine would follow directly the rose in the application. And when we define limited launch, we don't get into specifics about how many robotic systems, what kind of revenue are we talking about in limited launch, the whole idea behind limited launch is to learn. Particularly, when we\u2019re talking about a robotic system, we want to roll this out in a safe and effective manner. We want to make sure that we have the right train that goes along with it and want to learn as we go. Are there any mishaps associated with product launch that we have and if so how do we correct those one a go forward basis. That usually takes us 5 to 6 months. And that's what we would expect probably that the further out piece of that and we\u2019re talking about the robotic systems plus about six months post the time that we limited launch. And to me again, I like to concentrate on individual products because they are important, and certainly when we talk about robotics indeed it is an important area for us. But most important for me is to have that full portfolio that allows us to go on full offence. And to have a robotics platform that complements what I truly believe that the best knee system in the marketplace allows us now some differentiation versus everybody else. The others may have a robotic system but they certainly don't have the Persona Knee System that we have with a personalized capability that brings to the table. And it also differentiates us because with robotics and the segmentation we had in these kind of good, better, best also provides us with some differentiation at that time because much of that like to rose the platform. I like that the fact that we're going to have robotics. I think the bigger story is it is a piece of the puzzle that will allow us to be differentiated first to their competition.","Cole Lannum","Thanks for that. We are coming up at the bottom of the hour. We just got suite one more quick question. And then we're going to call it operator. So last question please.","Operator","Our final question comes from Jeff Johnson with Baird.","Jeff Johnson","Bryan, that was hopeful to comment on the timing around the robot. But wondering on fetus just when do you think full launch there when will instrument set has to be built? You don\u2019t talk things like that on that. And then on the revision knee, same question, is about a six month after last year prelim launch that we should expect instruments that the kind of the whole commercial launch then on the revision as well?","Bryan Hanson","So on fetus, we're already in full launch. We've entered full launch. And again as that been out -- I've been lucky enough to be with a couple of really exceptional shoulder surgeons and have seen shoulder procedures. I have not yet seen a fetus procedure. But I just got the offer last night from the surgeon that I talked to visit his site and see a fetus procedure. But I can tell you that each of the shoulder surgeons that I spent time within the operating room, are excited about the technology. So we're in full launch and it is being accepted well. As far as revision goes, again, as group referenced, we're looking at a limited launch at the end of the year. I would give that same timeline when we build-up our capabilities to go in the full launch, learning as much as we can, build the supply that we need to be able to go to full launch and that would be towards the middle of 2019. And I would say again, the folks that have seen the revision system really I like it. We haven't gone in limited launch yet, but people have had exposure to it and the exposure to that system is governing very positive responses.","And remember, when we do launch revision, it's an important category for us that product is important product for us. But ultimately there are folks that are sitting on the side line that would likely use persona but are waiting for a revision system, so not just the importance of launch in revision, but it's also getting some of the folks on the sideline into the Persona again.","Cole Lannum","And we're going to wrap it with that. Really appreciate the vast majority of you -- keeping to the one question on the call. We got through bunch of you and I hope this has been helpful. Really appreciate you joining us on the call. A replay of the call will be available later today on our website. And of course the IR team will be available throughout the day to answer any follow-up questions you may have. Have a great Friday and a great weekend. Take care. Bye-bye.","Operator","Thank you, again, for participating in today's conference call. You may now disconnect."],"0":["Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, February 4, 2020. Following today\u2019s presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions]","I would now like to turn the conference over to Cole Lannum, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and IRO. Please go ahead, sir.","Coleman Lannum","Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Zimmer Biomet's fourth quarter 2019 earnings conference call. In the room with me today, we have Bryan Hanson, our President and CEO; our CFO, Suky Upadhyay; and our new Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Chief Communications Officer, Keri Mattox.","Now before we get started, there are a few things I want to go over with you. I'd like to remind you first that our comments during this call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks and uncertainties.","Please note we assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements even if actual results or future expectations change materially. Please refer to our SEC filings for a detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties in addition to the inherent limitations of such forward-looking statements.","In addition, the discussion on this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is included within the earnings release found on our website at zimmerbiomet.com.","With that, I will now turn over the call to Bryan. Bryan?","Bryan Hanson","Thanks, Cole. I appreciate it. And before I jump into it, I just wanted to say the congratulations, first of all, to Keri. Obviously, Keri Mattox, it's her first call with us at Zimmer Biomet in her new role. I'd say it's early on, but we're pretty excited about what we think she is going to bring to the table. So I'm looking forward to that.","I also want to make sure that I take just a minute here and say, thanks Cole. It's been harder to leave, but already two years that we've been working together in this capacity. And I would say that we've come a long way and a lot of that has to do with your guidance along the way. So, I certainly appreciate it. I know you're not going anywhere, we're going to have access to you, but this will be the last time you\u2019re on one of these calls, so I wanted to make sure that I call you out for what you've been able to do for us over the last two years and look forward to the next year together.","All right, so getting into the quarter. We are encouraged by our performance in the fourth quarter. We posted solid revenue growth slightly above our weighted average market growth rate expectations and grew earnings per share faster than revenue. This was driven by improved performance versus prior year across all geographic regions as well as most of our businesses. We also made further progress in executing on our short-term priorities; supply, quality remediation, new product introductions, and ZB\u2019s mission and culture. We also continue to invest for growth.","This progress has laid the foundation for further innovation and commercial execution that will drive our accelerated growth over the long term. These are all important steps forward; and while we\u2019re happy with our progress, we're certainly not satisfied. Rest assured that we're still striving to continuously improve our business, our performance, and the value we deliver to patients as well as customers and investors.","Along those lines, let me talk about the team's momentum around the key short-term priorities. Regarding supply, we have consistently met customer demand and improved service levels further enhancing the confidence of our global sales teams and putting them back on offense. With this supply stabilization, we are focusing more on opportunities to decrease the complexity and increase the efficiency of our supply chain. I'm happy with our progress thus far.","On quality, I can confirm that the FDA recently concluded re-inspection of our Warsaw North facility. This inspection was anticipated based on the progress reports we've been providing the FDA on site readiness. We want to thank the agency for a productive and collaborative visit. By way of background, the FDA last inspected this facility in April 2018, and we've been executing a comprehensive remediation plan over the past couple of years.","We believe the latest FDA inspection validates the significant improvement and progress that has been made at the Warsaw North facility. Not surprisingly, the FDA issued observations at the conclusion of the inspection, and we are confident in our ability to address them to FDA satisfaction. Our anticipated path forward with the FDA is fully contemplated in the 2020 guidance that we provided earlier this morning. We look forward to continuing to partner with the FDA as we strive to make Warsaw North a best-in-class medical device manufacturing facility.","Let me take a moment to thank our quality and operations teams for their tireless work and dedication to patient safety. What they have accomplished over the past two years and what I know they will deliver for ZB moving forward is impressive. With improvements made in supply and quality, we also continue to sharpen our focus on innovation. Our enhanced R&D efforts drove significant new innovation in 2019 and give us increased confidence in our new technology pipeline as we move into 2020 and beyond.","And these programs increasingly include enabling technology and solutions around our implants such as robotics, mini robotics, informatics, and operating room efficiency. While the implant is core to what we do, our goal is to provide a complete ecosystem that is both patient and customer centric. At the upcoming AAOS meeting in March, we'll showcase additional innovations inside this ecosystem that connect our implants, data, and robotics, all designed to optimize decision making and improve patient outcomes.","Moving to mission and culture. We continue to communicate and drive the mission of the ZB organization. I can say today with confidence that everyone in the organization considers themselves part of one team. Our strategy is very clear and cascades down to all team members in the organization. It's important that everyone knows where we're going and how we're going to get there.","Now turning to our fourth quarter results, all three of our regions performed well versus prior year with strong performance from Asia Pacific and improving performance in the Americas. Relative to our businesses, we're pleased with the performance of the knee franchise with solid results across all three regions. Our core knee business accelerated, driven by Persona, including the recently launched Revision system.","ROSA Knee also accelerated and drove a little more than 50% of the overall global Knee growth. ROSA placements were strong, accelerating from Q3 and our customer pipeline continued to grow supported by a very positive feedback so far. We project continued growth with ROSA in 2020 as we increase our commercial efforts, including salesforce expansion and enhanced surgeon training support. In summary, we are very pleased with the ROSA Knee launch and the overall robotics uptake.","While S.E.T continues to be an important focus area for us, it is not yet delivering at our goal of durable mid-single-digit growth. We will continue to prioritize innovation and accelerate the expansion and investment in our specialized sales channel in order to drive scale in the high growth S.E.T markets. Our dental team delivered its third consecutive positive growth quarter.","The team\u2019s focus on strategic priorities, execution and culture, along with the targeted investments in key areas continues to drive the business forward. We still have much to prove in this business, but I'm happy with the current momentum and the performance of the dental team.","Relative to our Spine & CMF business, although we did see improvement from Q3, we continued to perform below market in the quarter. The primary focus areas for this business will be working through the final steps of our channel consolidation and leveraging our new product pipeline, including recent and upcoming product launches.","We are making steady progress driving innovation and shaping the future of this organization. We\u2019ve built a strong foundation and are now better positioned to accelerate our innovation and execution strategy. I am encouraged as we reshape Zimmer Biomet for sustained success.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Suky to get further into the financials.","Suketu Upadhyay","Thank you, Bryan. We delivered solid financial performance in the fourth quarter with accelerated revenue growth and leverage earnings, while increasing investments for long-term growth. Also through robust cash generation, we continue to make progress in delevering the balance sheet for strategic flexibility. I'll provide some highlights on our fourth quarter financial results and unless otherwise noted, the numbers I will be discussing on a constant currency basis.","Net sales totaled $2.1 billion, a reported increase of 2.6% over the prior year with an increase of 3.2%, excluding the impact of foreign currency changes. During the quarter, all three of our geographies performed well. Our Asia Pacific team delivered 8.6% sales growth driven by continued strength across both developed and emerging markets.","The Americas increased 2.4%. The strength in knees and hips driven by new product introductions, supply stability and improved commercial execution. Our Europe, Middle East and Africa team delivered 1.4% revenue growth led by strength in developed markets.","Turning to our businesses. In Q4, our global Knee business grew 4.9% with improved execution and new product launches. Our Hips business grew roughly in line with market growth at 3.2% and was aided by the recent launch of Avenir, where we are seeing good early market acceptance.","S.E.T grew 3.1%, slightly below our expectations, but we remained focused on growing that business at mid-single digits over time. Dental posted another solid quarter at 5% growth, driven by increased commercial and channel investments throughout 2019. Spine & CMF posted 0.2% revenue growth. While the growth was positive and sequentially better, we still have more work to do to stabilize the business.","Turning to the P&L. We reported GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter of $1.54. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $2.30, 5.5% increase over the prior year. Better adjusted operating margins and lower interest expense drove this leveraged earnings profile.","Adjusted gross margin was 73.1%, a sequential improvement, an increase over prior year due to higher volumes and favorable timing of costs within the quarter. Adjusted operating expenses increased sequentially due to sales commission and investments across commercial and R&D priorities in our Knee and S.E.T. businesses.","Overall, adjusted operating margin was 29% in the quarter. Moving beyond operating margins, interest expense of $52 million was down both sequentially and versus prior year due to debt paid down.","Lastly, we had solid free cash flow generation of $295 million in the quarter and paid down an additional $161 million of debt, further deleveraging the balance sheet. It was a solid quarter.","Looking ahead, our growing confidence in the business is evident in the 2020 guidance that we provided in our press release. Starting with revenue. While quarterly results may fluctuate due to seasonality and timing, we expect our full-year cost and currency growth to be between 2.5% to 3.5%. The first quarter will benefit from about one additional billing day with no material impact expected in the remaining quarters.","We expect our adjusted operating margin for the full-year to be between 27% and 28%. Our adjusted effective tax rate should be between 16% and 17%. And we expect adjusted diluted earnings per share to be between $8.15 and $8.45.","Against the backdrop of these 2020 expectations, I'd like to spend a few minutes on incremental steps we're taking to enhance shareholder value and to move our financial profile closer to top quartile.","We have begun to implement the comprehensive multi-year restructuring plan with the objective of reducing costs and driving a mix shift of investments to higher priority growth opportunities.","We estimate that these activities will generate gross annual adjusted pretax operating expense savings of approximately $200 million to $300 million by the end of 2023. This program gives us additional confidence that we can invest for growth and accelerate adjusted operating margins.","I know the next question will be what does accelerate margins mean? While we expect to deliver operating margins of at least 30% by the end of 2023. To support this restructuring, we estimate approximately $350 million to $400 million in one-time cost over the same period. Consistent with this, during the fourth quarter, we recorded a charge of $31 million.","As part of these restructuring activities, we've also reorganized several businesses to drive enhance strategic alignment across our key growth areas. As a result of this reorganization, you can expect that we will modify elements of our external reporting in the first quarter of 2020 and we'll share that information with you before our next earnings call.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Bryan.","Bryan Hanson","Thanks, Suky. And in summary, we're proud of the progress that we are seeing in 2019 that we've clearly stabilized many parts of the business. We've made key investments in priority areas. We drove better topline growth and delivered solid sustainable financial performance. There is clearly more work to do. We entered 2020 with increased confidence in our business and remain optimistic about our future.","Now I'll turn the call over to Cole and Keri to manage the Q&A portion of the call.","Coleman Lannum","Thanks, Bryan. Before we start the Q&A session, I want to again remind you to please limit yourself to a single question with a brief follow-up if and only if needed. [Operator Instructions]","With that, operator, may we please have the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. One moment please for the first question. We'll take our first question from Raj Denhoy with Jefferies.","Raj Denhoy","Hi, good morning. I wonder maybe I could start with the knee growth in the quarter. It really stood out. So, Bryan maybe a couple of questions there. One, can you maybe offer whether you think you have stabilized that business on an underlying basis? You offered that half of the growth was from ROSA, but on an underlying basis, do you feel your share position is now secure? And then on ROSA, is there anything more you can offer in terms of where you're seeing placements, what the demand has been? Just really anything you can offer in terms of how that system is faring?","Bryan Hanson","Yes, absolutely. I would tell you that we're pretty excited actually about the quarter. It\u2019s unmistakable with that across the business, but particularly knees was strong for us. And what I like about it, in addition to us, we saw strength in other parts of the market. So I know it's just one quarter. We don't want to get too excited about that, but the fact that we were able to surge in the market as others did, I think that's a good sign.","And yes, ROSA was clearly a big part of that contribution in knee growth. As we said, it's a little bit more than half of the overall growth. But even when you look at the base business, I would say that we're seeing that business move as one would expect.","It's not where we need it to be. I need the overall market in knee, our business in the market in knee to be able to outperform the overall market. We're not there yet, but the fact is we're definitely seeing traction in base knee as well. It's actually one of our best growth quarters in base knee that we've seen since the merge.","Well, what I would tell you is that ROSA demand is very strong. We have \u2013 probably what we do have the largest funnel right now for replacements than we've ever had. We've done over 2,000 procedures already. And again, we\u2019re just a couple of quarters into this launch, so that would tell you that we're really seeing acceleration of focus in this area.","I had an opportunity to be out in the field and see a few cases, one particularly on the West Coast where I had a surgeon continue to look across the operating room and say, \u201cI couldn't do this before without ROSA,\u201d who is making 0.5 millimeter adjustments in tissue balancing and getting real time feedback in the procedure, and he was practically giddy about the response he was getting from the robotic system.","So again, I think people are seeing this. As a result of that, more people are desiring to get trained on the system, and we're going to continue to see that momentum go forward. It was great to see our competition have a really strong quarter as well. That tells you that the uptick in robotics is real and that benefits all of us.","So again, I'm pretty happy with where we are right now with base business as well as momentum with ROSA. I still have a lot to do. I think it's going to take us some time to get above-market growth in knee. Remember, we have a very large base that's going to take time to influence it because it's a significant number.","We still have some of that negative inertia associated with the competitors' placements of robotics. It's going to take a while for us to disrupt that inertia, but I think we will over time. And we still have the major products that are out there that are launching, they're doing well, but they're early. So again, I feel really bullish in the area, but it\u2019s just going to take us some time to be able to get that business growing above market.","Raj Denhoy","Great. Thank you.","Coleman Lannum","Thanks for that. Thanks, Raj. Next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI.","Vijay Kumar","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. If I could, maybe a two-part question on \u2013 one, ROSA expectations for 2020. I know you said a sequential step up in placements for 2019. Is that still the margin assumption for 2020?","And on the margin side, Suky, implicitly we're looking at 60 basis points, 70 basis points of annual margin expansion. When does that kick in, right? Is that kick starting in 2020 or is that more for 2021 nuance, and congrats and thanks guys.","Bryan Hanson","Okay. Yes, I'll start off with the ROSA and cast our view certainly, obviously on the margin piece. Yes, as I said before, ROSA funnel is as strong as it's ever been. We're adding commercial infrastructure to be able to support that, and we're adding significant training capabilities so that we can get people trained with a safe and effective use of the product.","So, I absolutely expect 2020 to be better than what we saw in 2019. It's kind of logical just given the fact that we'll have it for the full year. We did not have it for the full year in 2019, but that momentum is real. I would expect it to continue and certainly be a driver for us in 2020.","Suketu Upadhyay","Yes. Thanks, Bryan, and thanks Vijay for the question. Regarding margins and the overall restructuring program that we announced just a few minutes ago, you're right, we talked about 30% operating margins by 2023, at least 30% operating margin. So your math is right. If you sort of took a linear glide path, that's about 60 basis points, 70 basis points per year.","However, I would say that, it may not be linear, right. Depending on the overall revenue profile, our investment profile over that three to four-year horizon, that margin expansion could be a bit lumpy and it could fluctuate. So, I wouldn't look at it as sort of in a linear fashion.","Regarding 2020, operating margins completely consistent with how we've characterized this all the way through 2019 including our third quarter call, where we said we see the opportunity for modest operating margin expansion in 2020, and if you look at our guidance that's represented in the top half of that guidance.","But we also said, given the number of attractive opportunities we have across the business, that we may use some of that margin upside to instead invest against the business for topline growth, because we do see topline growth as the best, most durable pathway to long-term, margin expansion, earnings growth, and shareholder value. And so, that's reflected more in the bottom half of that overall margin profile guidance.","I would say we're in early days as part of that restructuring program. However, we do expect to see some benefit into 2020 and that's been fully incorporated into the margin guidance that we've provided today.","Vijay Kumar","Thanks guys.","Coleman Lannum","Thanks, Vijay. Next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matt Miksic with Credit Suisse.","Matthew Miksic","Hi. Thanks so much for taking the question. Just one on, follow-up on Raj's question on knees, and then I have one follow-up as well, if that's okay. On the knee growth, Bryan, you mentioned, it's going to take a while to get above market growth in knees. If you could talk maybe a little bit about where you are in the U.S. in terms of holding share? And what the timing looks like in the U.S., given the trajectory robot sales and some of the other projects? You mentioned timing to get back to or get above market growth?","Bryan Hanson","Yes. So I won't give specific timing on that. But just know, we have our sights on getting above market growth and we also believe that we have the fuel to do it. And I'll just go through a couple of those things that I think will give us that confidence.","But when I think about the U.S., we're still below market. We're still seeding share, but the rate that we're losing market share is much slower. So we're clearly closing that gap. And our confidence level is high. I mean the U.S. momentum is real. I was just at the kickoff meeting for the Americas. Obviously a big part of that is the U.S. commercial organization.","And I can tell you in all my years of doing kickoff meetings around the world, I have never been to an event where the energy was as high as it was in that meeting. So people are ready to go. They're fired up and that momentum is real and that's meaningful.","Beyond products and innovation, supply and everything else, the way people feel and their confidence, absolutely drive traction in the field. And I can say right now it\u2019s there. So that's probably the first thing that we have a pathway to get above market. The real brass tacks is associated with products though.","As I mentioned before, ROSA strength is real. I've also seen as I'm out in the world and I'm seeing ROSA placements. I'm seeing people that we didn't even expect, surgeons, that are competitive surgeons now getting trained rapidly to understand how to use our robotic system. And as a result of that over time, we're going to expect to see that pull through because they have to use our implants when they begin to use the ROSA system.","That will take time because they have to first drop the implants that they're using, really get trained and understand how to use the robotic system that we have, and then we're going to get that uptick. But that will take time because we're early in the launch, but it will happen.","When I look at cementless, we're still seeing traction in Persona, in Persona cementless. I'm not going to get into specifics here. But there's no question, this gives us an opportunity for mix. A little bit of conversion opportunity too particularly tied with robotics, but a big part of it is mixed benefit.","And then Persona Revision, I got to tell you, there's a few different ways, we can drive revenue growth here. But the traction we're getting and the momentum that we're getting is bigger than we expected.","As a matter of fact, we're actually building triple the amount of S.E.Ts. that we expected based on the demand that we're seeing. So there's no question in my mind, people love the Revision system and its being well accepted in the marketplace.","Really three different ways that we can grow business inside of Revision. First one is, I've already got Persona users out there that are not using my Revision system because we're just launching it. There's no reason, if they like the Persona product that they wouldn't convert to the Persona Revision system. So that's the first order of business. Go to our current accounts, where they're using Persona and get to Revision business.","The second one is, I've gotten an opportunity to get out and get those surgeons that wanted to move to Persona, but wouldn't go there until we got the Revision system. And the third one is just competitive conversions.","We have a great Revision system. Revisions are always a little more challenging for surgeons. So when you can make Revision easier as a result of a system like Persona, there's an attraction to that system that opens the door to competitive conversions.","So those are the pieces that I know we have in place to get us to at or above market growth. But the key thing is, it's going to take time. We're early on in the rollout of these things, but I can guarantee it's going to happen. It's just a question of when, and I just can't give a specific time right now.","Matthew Miksic","I appreciate that color. And so maybe\u2026","Coleman Lannum","Matt, sorry. Matt, one question per person, sorry. Next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.","David Lewis","Okay. I'll keep it to one question there Cole. Bryan, let's now talk about the 2020 outlook. I think you\u2019ve been adamant around the 2% to 3% growth. This is 50 bps better on the margin and the comps are going to be tougher in 2019. So you're clearly guiding to improve the momentum in the business at 2.5% to 3.5% for 2020.","Can you sort of walk us through and where that confidence is coming from either by segment or sort of across the business broadly? I think that's the kind of the key focus here on the call. Thanks so much.","Bryan Hanson","Yes. So David, it would've been funny if you were to come on and say get a three-part question, but you lost it. So I would say, yes, it's a number of things. First and foremost, it's just the momentum we're seeing. I mean if you look at the last couple of quarters, there's no question that there's a difference in the business right now that the momentum is real and we've proven that now for two quarters.","And that's a big confidence booster for all of us. If you think about it, the performance is good, but there hasn't been that many quarters as a company that we've had that type of performance. So it have to in a row does give you some of that confidence.","So certainly, that strength across all regions, that performance that we've had already and the future-looking impact of new products gives us the confidence to be able to take the revenue. I'm not going to follow-up guidance, but our view of what 2020 is going to look like. So that was really the major impact.","I mean, I look at it and say, we're still not delivering what I expect us to deliver in S.E.T. But the investment is there. The new product innovation is there. So that's going to happen. I have confidence it\u2019s going to happen. We're not where we want to be yet, which is given the amount of investment and focus in this area, I know its coming.","I already talked about knee. Hip just continues to hang in there. The Avenir Complete is going well. We have a robotic application that will be coming soon. That maybe the catalyst for us to be able to boost the hip performance as well. We've been hanging in with markets, but I'd like to see that above market. And I believe that the robotic application would give us that momentum. So again, a lot of things moving in the right direction.","I always want to balance that with some of the things that could be challenges for us. The fact is, we do have great momentum in our products. The demand is high, but they're early, so that momentum has got to continue. Suky just talked about a multi-year restructuring program, which is a must-have because it's going to allow us to invest for growth while also driving margin expansion. But there's always a risk of disruption when you put a program like that into place.","So I'm trying to look at the ebbs and flows, the puts and takes for our business and give you guys what we really believe is going to happen in 2020. And there's enough momentum, there's enough positive to offset all those things that could be disruptive. And that's why we took the number up.","Coleman Lannum","Thanks for that David, and thanks for complying with one question rule. Operator, next question please.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Bob Hopkins with Bank of America.","Robert Hopkins","Great. Thank you and good morning. So I guess my one question I'd love to Bryan, if you don't mind follow-up a little bit more on your comments on S.E.T. And just maybe a little more specifics on kind of what's coming and when we might see better growth? And obviously a lot of people are trying to wonder if some of the merger activity going on around you might lead to some opportunities, so maybe just a little more color on S.E.T.?","Bryan Hanson","Yes. So when I just take a step back, when I think about this business over time, obviously we're not suggesting in 2020 being at the overall business ZB being at a mid-single-digit growth because that's where we need to go. When you think about our strategic pillar of being a top quartile top performer in total shareholder return, it requires us to increase our growth rate.","We have to get to that mid-single-digit growth rate. And one of the major contributors to that is going to be a sustained kind of durable growth rate in that market growth range for S.E.T. As a matter of fact, really need to see it on the top end of that range, that mid-single-digit range, and we need to see the outperformance of needs. So those are the two major categories that we're going to be heavily focused on to ensure that we get ZB at mid-single-digit growth. Again, over time, but that's what's got to happen.","When I think about us being able to do that, he was pretty clear to me, we have the formula in place. Number one, we've got to be able to increase the innovation pipeline and we've been doing that, not just the pipeline, but the cadence of those new products.","Things like the Alliance, Glenoid that we're launching, that gives more personalized way to do a total shoulder is going to be exciting to surgeons. We're early on in this. No, but I can tell you right now. The response from surgeons is very strong. The signature one planner, we lagged in this area. When you look at pre-surgical planning, we no longer lag in this area and we have a lot more coming when it comes to informatics and our robotics in the space as well.","So I feel confident that the innovation cycle is real, it's coming and it will have an impact. And the other one that we've been talking about for a long time now and we're really doubling down and is continued investment in a dedicated channel. This takes time, obviously, the hope would be that with some of the disruption out in the marketplace that facilitates quicker expansion of our sales organization and we're certainly going to try to make sure that we take advantage of that.","But the fact is we've got to be able to get that channel in place. We're investing in it now. And then the operating mechanisms around that channel to make sure that we're driving accountability and focus brings all these things together. So I know the formulas there, the variables are all lined up. We just got to solve the equation and it's just a matter of time. So I have high level of confidence it's going to happen. It's just not happening yet and it's not happening durably yet.","Coleman Lannum","Thanks for that Bob. Next question please.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Richard Newitter with SVB Leerink.","Richard Newitter","Thank you. Just to follow-up on the restructuring. Can you maybe just elaborate a bit on the types of projects or initiatives and the timing within that three year, but that three year trajectory, I guess really, if you could also parse it out between you things like sales incentives, structure changes or any kind of incentive structure changes throughout the organization? What's low hanging fruit versus kind of maybe the harder stuff to go after and when in the timeframe, so that's where your timeframe, you're going to go after each? Thank you. ","Bryan Hanson","Yes. Why don't I just kind of provide just a real general overview of what we were trying to accomplish in the restructuring and again early days. So it's we don't know that we've done these things yet, but we're just the intent of the restructuring and then seeking maybe getting some more detail of the underlying assumptions. First of all, the whole goal of this was to drive better alignment, better accountability and efficiency, right.","So we really do believe the restructuring is a better way to manage the business with efficiency included. And if I just think about it, we've taken all businesses now, we have them under one leader and the whole intent behind that is to have faster and less biased resource deployment decisions, right.","We still have centers of excellence around robotics and informatics and other areas that that you want to have unbiased views of how you're going to deploy those resources across the businesses that now exist by having all businesses going to one person. We also want to have clear accountability.","So if you're going to make these decisions on resource to plan it, you better have accountability for getting it done and accountability for executing against it. And we're streamlining the organization. We're making it less complex and as a result of doing that you can drive margin expansion, right.","So those are the reasons why we've done this. Ultimately it's going to allow us to invest aggressively for growth while expanding margins and managing the business more effectively. So that was the purpose behind it. And then Suky, if you to want to give some additional detail?","Suketu Upadhyay","Yes. Sure. So Richard, you're thinking about the right way. There are a number of initiatives and they're going to be cadence of different times. Just based on sort of complexity and time it takes to get some of initiatives up and running. In the early days, I would say it very much is about blocking and tackling and some of the low hanging fruit that you sort of referenced.","One, we took a complete cost taxonomy of the organization and we looked at that cost taxonomy relative to that spending versus external benchmark relative to internal benchmark relative to our growth opportunities in our markets and our businesses. And that's leading to quite frankly a mixed shift and a lot of our spending but also some very clear areas of opportunity to reduce spending in lower value areas.","Blocking and tackling things like T&E procurement, just basic costs down, again, blocking and tackling. The second area, that's more near-term Bryan talked about the reorganization some of our business units that's leading to efficiency. It's leading to efficiency by de-layering the organization. So we're putting our commercial leadership closer to our customer and closer to the patient.","And it's also leading to some reductions and redundancies. So those are we call no regret moves because they lead to margin expansion, but also make the organization more efficient and effective. Longer-term, we're also putting things into place. It's going to take some while for those to mature and bear fruit.","But it's around consolidating a pretty fragmented footprint. When you think about the two companies, Zimmer Biomet coming together and then follow on acquisitions and some of the focus that the company has had to spend over the last few years on supplying quality remediation.","We can now start to turn the corner from stabilization to efficiency and start to think about how do we consolidate some of that footprint and make ourselves more efficient. And then of course there's going to be some opportunity in the longer-term around centralization of back office and G&A type functions.","So those are just a few examples, there are several other initiatives or a number of initiatives as we've talked about going on in manufacturing supply chain, which we think over time after we've stabilized gross margins can lead to some modest improvement in gross margin as well. So hopefully that gives you a little bit more color as to how we're thinking about it and how we're approaching it.","Coleman Lannum","Thanks for that Rich. Next question please, operator.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Matthew O'Brien with Piper Sandler.","Matthew O'Brien","Good morning. Thanks for that question and Cole good luck in the future. Bryan, I was hoping to talk a little bit about ROSA, over the last maybe four or five years here, you've lost about 400 or 500 basis points of Knee share. So I'm curious on the ROSA side, and I know it's early, but you talk about this massive funnel?","Can you talk about what you're seeing in that funnel in terms of is it just more people that have been using Zimmer over the last several years and have been good customers or is it a majority of those people that are in the funnel right now are have you been surprised by the number of folks that you've worked with in the past that have come back into the funnel and could be customers here in the near-term again or even just de novo people that\u2019s you've never worked with in the past? If you could kind of wait, where some of those clinicians would kind of stay within those three buckets? I think that'd be helpful. Thank you.","Bryan Hanson","Absolutely. It's kind of a mixture, when we put the strategy in place, it was pretty clear that our first intent was to go after those accounts that are already using us. The folks that know and love our implants, I've always had an interest in moving into robotics, but wouldn't do it if they couldn't use their own implant.","So there's no question that that's a pretty big element of our success. Just pursuing those that love the implant of Zimmer Biomet and now can use that implant in concert with robotics, but what we're finding is that it's never a perfect world in the way you rolled out a plan. And there are situations that are competitive where we know accounts that we would not have pursued in the first place are actually active in looking at robotics.","So naturally, as a result of having a robotics solution, we get involved in that process. And we have found that in those competitive situations, even where we didn't have the primary strength in the account, we're winning some of those decisions. And so as a result we are actually seeing conversions being a part of the placement that we see with ROSA. So it's kind of both.","And then on top of that, we're also finding, which I kind of referenced before, is once we do get a robotic system in place. Even in an account that is one of our platinum accounts, one of our big users, there's always individual surgeons that are using competitive implants and if they want to migrate to robotics, there's obviously a natural gravitational pull to do that. But they have to use our implants. And so that was what I was referencing before.","I was just in an account where five surgeons that were using competitive priority using competitive implants or now getting trained on robotics want to begin using robotics, which is great because that will drive conversions, but it will also drive demand for another robotic system because that's going to get tapped out pretty quick.","So again, it's a combination of those things. Also I make sure that we recognize that there's multiple ways to drive revenue when we do place robotic system. The obvious upfront capital purchase is clearly an opportunity for us. ","You get a mixed benefit, kind of a share of wallet benefit because there is an increased price associated with the disposables you need to do a robotic procedure and then you get that natural pull through that I just referenced, where you get competitive conversions to be able to use robotic system.","So again, it's all coming together. I mean, in fact it's early. We're rapidly training and getting these things out there and building the commercial infrastructure to be able to support demand. But it feels good so far.","Coleman Lannum","Thanks for that Matt. Operator, next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.","Coleman Lannum","Good morning, Larry.","Lawrence Biegelsen","Hey, Cole. Thanks for taking the question. Just on the ROSA pipeline, just a question on that. Bryan, I heard you talk about hip coming soon. So could you give us an update on the hip, knee, and revision knee, are those 2020 approvals and if ROSA wants spine still in early 2020 launch? Thanks for taking the questions.","Bryan Hanson","Yes. So I would just take a quick step back and just let you know that there's been a pretty significant shift of focus in the organization. We've done a very good job of rethinking how we deploy resources inside of research and development, and commercial infrastructure by the way.","But we've really taken a hard look at the R&D pipeline, started to get more bias towards robotics and informatics and spend significantly more money, almost the mix shift that has occurred in those areas. It doesn't mean that we're not going to continue to do implants.","But the fact is most of the money now is shifting, a good portion of that money is shifting towards ROSA, towards a mini robotics, towards informatics, towards efficiency in doing the procedure. So that was a pretty significant innovation shift for the organization because we think it could bring real value to the patient and the customer. So that was a big shift that occurred.","As a result of that, we now have more in the pipeline in applications for ROSA in other areas. And so the next things that you're going to see from ROSA that we've been very transparent about this is a partial knee application as well as the hip application. Those will likely come in 2020, but I don't want to give specifics. You'll learn more about these at the AAOS meeting. But those are the next in line.","Revision is something that we're clearly working on. We have an opportunity to be able to do this because we don't need a CT scan to be able to use the robotic system, opens the door for our Revision procedure. But that's a challenging application to provide, would be a big window because it's one of the most challenging procedures to do. So if you could have robotic assistance inside of that, it would be attractive. But I don't want to give a view on timeline for that.","So again, we're shifting dramatically our innovation pipeline to those very important elements of the ecosystem that are around the implant. We don't lose focus on the implant, but we just \u2013 we enhanced our capability to bring the implants to the market in a way that helps patients and customers more.","Coleman Lannum","Thanks for that Mr. Biegelsen. Next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matt Taylor with UBS.","Matthew Taylor","Hi. Thank you for taking the question. So I just wanted to clarify one thing on this operating margin guidance. When you talk about the 30% in 2023, is that the full-year number? And the reason I asked is because if we use the midpoint of this year that does imply higher than that 50 to 70 bps beyond this year over that timeframe. And I guess I was wondering if that's right, and what has to happen on the topline for you to achieve that?","Bryan Hanson","I'd say it's interesting because we're talking about 30% and 30% of our questioners have been \u2013 Matt. But I'm sorry.","Suketu Upadhyay","Yes. So you're thinking about it correctly, Matt. It is 30% in-year in 2023. Again, as I said earlier in call, it's not going to be \u2013 we would not expect the cadence to be linear. It could happen sooner. It could be more in the back end of that period depending on topline growth and our level of investment back into the business. And I'll come back into that.","You're right. Relative to 2020, the midpoint would not suggest any significant margin expansion on an operating margin level. And that's consistent with how we've talked about the year where we could see some modest improvement in overall operating margin.","However, again, coming back to if we see the right opportunities to invest for long-term growth \u2013 near-term growth for that matter, we will make that decision and the overall guidance range reflects that optionality if you will around margin expansion or investment.","I will say though, I've got confidence and we're early days, but the team is executing extremely well against these programs that we've launched. And I would say that we're going to see margin expansion as early as 2021. But again, I don't know that you can take a linear footprint from today to 2023 and mark 2021 in that way. But we do expect to see some large expansion into 2021.","Coleman Lannum","Matt, it probably is worth it to expand on that. Just to remind everyone again, we don't guide to midpoints. We guide ranges and that's exactly what Suky is talking about there. I think that's an important thing to keep in mind as we think very carefully about what ranges to give. With that, next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ricky Wise with Stifel.","Coleman Lannum","Hey, Ricky.","Frederick Wise","Some people won't miss Cole, Bryan. Maybe turning to some of the financial perspectives, maybe I missed. So it could be operating cash flow guidance, but obviously the balance sheets made significant improvement over the last 12-month, a year-ago was almost 4x leverage, now you're roughly 2x leverage. Are you where you want or need to be just where you're aiming towards from here? And does this progress on the balance sheet and driving cash flow open the door in some way, should we imagine the door is a little more open to increased growth enhancing M&A in the year ahead? Thank you very much.","Suketu Upadhyay","Yes. Thanks for the question Rick. So first of all, on 2019, we ended the year at about $1.1 billion of free cash flow. As we move into 2020, we expect that number to be somewhere between $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion, again 2020. And that's inclusive of these restructuring charges that I talked about a bit relative to the restructuring programs that we're initiating.","Again, we're saying operating costs or investments for that program will be somewhere between $350 million to $400 million over the time horizon to 2023. We think a little more than half of that will be in 2020. So again, our guidance for cash flow \u2013 free cash flow in 2020, $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion. And again that is inclusive of these restructuring charges that we\u2019ll have to take.","You're right. We've made good progress on the balance sheet and delevering. We got ourselves to a point where we're just under three on a net debt basis, ending 2019. And relative to our overall capital allocation priorities, we expect to continue to make progress on delevering the balance sheet into 2020. And again that's strong, durable, sticky cash flow generation is a big component of that.","The second thing I'd say though is beyond the priority to continue to delever the balance sheet. We are in a better position now operationally, financially, I think strategically as well. Where if we see attractive M&A targets that meet our strategic filters or financial filters, but also maintain a strong capital structure and profile and investment grade, we may decide to invest capital into M&A in 2020 and beyond.","So again, organically we expect to continue to delever the balance sheet. But again, we may also decide to deploy some capital towards M&A that meets all of our filters that I talked about.","Coleman Lannum","Thanks, Rick. Thanks. And we all know that's not the worst you've ever said on an earnings call. So next question please, operator.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan.","Robert Marcus","Thanks for taking the question and nice quarter. Just from the \u2013 fine, I was hoping you could give a little more color on the updates with the FDA inspection. What exactly did the new items entail? How should we think about the seriousness of them? And then is this something that can get resolved in 2020? Or do you expect resolution more in 2021 timeframe? Thanks.","Bryan Hanson","Yes. So first of all, I just want to say anytime that we're talking about interaction with the FDA, quality, patient safety, any of those things, I just wanted to be very clear that we take quality of our products and patient safety as the most important thing we do as an organization.","The mission of this company is to alleviate the pain of people in the world and make the quality of life better. That absolutely means that our product needs to do, it's intended to do and keep them safe. So that's the first thing that we look at and we feel very confident we're in check there.","The fact is it also shows when we saw the FDA come in that we've made real progress. I mean it's hard to describe because you have not been able to see the factory, but a lot of the same FDA investigators that were there, actually were there from the very beginning. And even for me, when I walk in the factory, it just looks different. It literally looks different, and the culture, the energy in the factory is different and that was recognized by the FDA.","In fact is we\u2019ve got observations though. We have eight observations in the factory. I would tell you that all of the observations we feel are manageable and we feel very confident that we can respond to the FDA in a way that's going to be satisfactory to them.","The way I look at these things is we already have money earmarked to be able to continuously improve that factory. And the fact that the FDA has given us guidance in the way that they have on where we should focus, it's actually a good thing because if we're going to spend money, I'd rather spend it in an area that I know the FDA is concentrating on. So it's basically a roadmap for us to be able to do that.","But I want to reiterate the fact that we feel very confident that we're going to be able to respond in a way that the FDA is going to be satisfied and we're going to be able to continue to move that factory forward.","I think it's important to recognize though that this isn't going to be an issue that gets resolved in 2020. It's just not. I mean, the only way you move down a path to remove a warning letter is to have an audit where you have basically very little to no observations, and obviously that didn't happen this go around.","And from here it's just up to the FDA and when they come back in. We're going to respond to the observations in a very timely manner, in a comprehensive way, keep that dialog moving with the FDA, but ultimately it's their decision when they come back in.","And even when they come back in, if we get a stellar audit and we have very few to no observations, it still takes time to be able to remove a warning letter. So it's just a process that's involved. At the end of the day though, even with the warning letter in place, I just want to reiterate the fact that we can absolutely function effectively out of that factory base. So I appreciate the question that we feel really good about the progress that we're making. Obviously, some work to do still, but we feel confident we can get there.","Coleman Lannum","Thanks for that Rob. Next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike Matson with Needham & Company.","Michael Matson","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I guess I just wanted to ask another ROSA question. So I didn't really hear any commentary on the status of the spine and brain version of the robot. So can you maybe talk about the launch plans there and whether or not you sold any in the fourth quarter? Thanks.","Bryan Hanson","Yes, I appreciate that. We have folks using the ROSA Spine system, but it's really just those that are developers. So we're not in a really a launch mode yet for that system. But if I just take a step back and I think about the Spine business overall, I think about it in a few different ways. We clearly have not been performing the way I would like and we're not performing right now with predictability in that business. There are key areas that we need to concentrate on.","The number one thing is we have to get the channel that we've decided on to be able to take advantage of the portfolio that we have. The fact is we have the best cervical disc in the market and we need to make sure that now we're taking advantage of the Mobi-C in the way that we should now that we have stability in the channel.","We have the Tether, which is an absolute pivotal change for those with scoliosis. It dramatically changes the care for that patient population, a very exciting technology. But the channel's got to take advantage of that.","And we have now gap fillers like the TrellOss titanium 3D printed interbody. That was a major gap for us. We now have that 3D printed interbody that we need to make sure that we're taking advantage of, and we have to launch ROSA, and that's got to happen in 2020.","It's not just ROSA though, it's got be ROSA in concert with our mini robotics platform in Walter, because that provides a comprehensive solution for the surgeon when we talked about robotics, not just placing screws, but also being that third or fourth arm for the surgeon and the procedure.","All those things need to come together in a predictable way so that we can start turning that business. So ROSA Spine is definitely a part of the equation. It's just not the whole equation and the intent is to launch that in 2020.","Coleman Lannum","Thanks for that Mike. Next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ryan Zimmerman with BTIG.","Ryan Zimmerman","Great. Thank you. So just want to follow-up, Bryan, I heard you loud and clear on the S.E.T. business. And I just want to dig into the components of that between sports, extremities and trauma. Can you just talk about kind of where you're most focused of those three? If we were to kind of parse it out a little bit more than kind of what we've seen thus far? Thank you.","Bryan Hanson","Yes, it's a great observation. I mean, the fact is, the S.E.T. businesses, although in aggregate, they do grow in that mid single-digit growth area. They're not all created equal obviously. And the whole idea in our organization is to make sure we're disciplined and focus. So as a result of that discipline and focus, we need to make sure that we're picking the most attractive sub-markets inside of S.E.T. And I can tell you its kind of obvious when you look at it.","Sports and extremities will be the areas that we focus most on. And so you're going to see a lot of our attention, not just in research and development, but also from a commercial channel standpoint, training and education being focused in those areas. The fact is we already have a significant right to win, and we need to take advantage of that in upper extremities.","I want to see us build more scale on lower extremities and absolutely become a market share leader there and we have a lot of traction and opportunity for us in sports. So those are going to be the areas where you're going to see significant investment, significant focus, our operating mechanisms are being built around that and that will be the area that we concentrate inside of S.E.T.","Coleman Lannum","Thanks for that. Next question please, operator.","Operator","Next question comes from Josh Jennings with Cowen.","Joshua Jennings","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. I was hoping to just get an update on the salesforce. I know there's different salesforces for different divisions, but just from a high level, can you just share with us the attrition rates you're experiencing entering 2020 or exiting 2019 versus exiting 2018?","And then I think you talked historically about the compensation scheme being in place to drive the salesforce coming on offense. Can you just talk \u2013 help us understand the nuances to that compensation scheme, and then that was put into effect? Thanks for taking the question.","Bryan Hanson","I would say it's \u2013 we've actually had zero regrettable turnover in the commercial organization. And I always look at it to say if you stuck with the organization through all the hell that occurred over the last number of years and you leave the organization now and the momentum comes. I probably don't watch it in the organization anyway because you're not making rational decisions. But that's playing out. I said it kind of tongue and cheek in the past, but the fact is we've had zero regrettable turnover in the commercial organization.","It\u2019s a testament to the fact that people understand momentum is coming, that we have a market leadership position in large joints. We have potential to do the same thing in S.E.T. and we have new products that are coming that get the sales organization excited.","And so I just \u2013 again, I see that momentum. I feel it. I was in the Asia Pacific kickoff meetings. I felt significant energy there. Same thing in Americas. I'll be in \u2013 actually after this event, we'll be heading to Spain for the European kickoff event. And I can tell you the energy is just there. So we're not seeing that turnover.","When you see momentum like this and you don't have a critical turnover, it gives you the opportunity to decide who stays in the organization and who doesn't. And that gives us an opportunity to upgrade talent as we go. That will be a major focus of this organization always ensuring we have the best talent, developing the best talent and retaining the best talent.","Coleman Lannum","Thanks for that Josh. Next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank.","Philip Chickering","Thanks guys for taking my questions. And Cole, thanks for help over the years. While so early in ROSA launch, I was curious what percent of ROSA knees are being done cementless right now? I'm certain that you use that with knees and robots. Are you starting to convert the non-ROSA knees to cementless?","Bryan Hanson","Yes. So the cementless opportunity is it's kind of bifurcated. We have an opportunity to be able to convert knees to cementless without ROSA. So we're certainly trying to do that and are doing that.","At the same time, when you look at the robotic application, you get such confidence in cuts that typically what you find is people are more willing to go to cementless as a result of having robotics in. So it is a combination of those two things and you would naturally see in robotic cases a higher mix of cementless versus non-robotic cases.","But either way, we don't have a lot of robotic systems out there today and we're not slowing down in our pushing of the cementless option because we think it's a very good one. So it's both of those things, right. So we're going to go after conversions and get a mixed benefit for those that are already using our implant with cementless and we're absolutely going to take advantage of robotics to be able to address them as well.","Coleman Lannum","Thanks for that Pito. Next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kristen Stewart with Barclays.","Kristen Stewart","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Cole, I guess you won\u2019t be missed. I have a question just about the restructuring program in general. So if I'm looking at the pretax savings that you're expecting to be generated, it looks like that contributes pretty much all of the operating margin expansion over the next several years.","And then the free cash flow I guess as well. I guess that's also eating into the cash flow, I guess that you're expecting as well. The $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion that you're guiding to. How should we just think about the operating cash flow for the next couple of years, too, because $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion seems kind of flattish relative to where you've been out for the last couple of years? So just trying to understand what kind of the base businesses doing absent this restructuring charge or charges and savings. Thanks.","Suketu Upadhyay","Yes, sure. So you're right Kristen. If you took the range that we discussed, $200 million to $300 million by 2023, and you dropped all of that margin, you could effectively get to 30%, right. Your math is right on.","But I think it's important to understand that that program is not just about margin expansion and through cost reduction and dropping that. It really is more about creating a mix shift and providing us the ability and the confidence to invest against our highest priority opportunities to drive topline growth, right.","So I would say the program is more about creating and liberating that funding to drop topline versus just a sheer dropdown into operating profit. So we think it's actually going to be a combination of accelerating revenue growth from where we are today, but also improving overall margins as we leverage our infrastructure and grow SG&A at slower rate than topline. Okay, so that's how we think about overall the margin profile between now and 2023 where we're saying at least 30% operating margin.","Relative to free cash flow, again, we ended 2019 at just about $1.1 billion. We do expect to see an improvement into 2020. So our guidance has that profile baked into the $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion. And again, that $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion is burdened by some of these restructuring costs that we said will be $350 million to $400 million over that three to four-year period. Again, more than half of that being in 2020. So the underlying cash flow operationally within the business is in fact improving and improving at a really healthy clip into 2020.","And again, as we think about what are our key metrics and financial priorities, revenue growth, margin expansion, free cash flow conversion, we do expect to see an increase and an improvement in overall free cash flow conversion into 2020. So hopefully that\u2026","Kristen Stewart","Yes. Is that - $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion, is that an adjusted cash flow or is that like a real cash flow number?","Suketu Upadhyay","No, that's straight cash flow. That's operating cash flow less property plant and equipment and instruments.","Kristen Stewart","Okay. I'll have another question online. Thank you.","Coleman Lannum","Yes, let\u2019s do the last offline because we're after the bottom of the hour. So we're going to wrap it right there. Thanks everyone for joining us today. Certainly appreciate it. Keri, Barb and I will be around for the rest of the day to answer any questions you may have. There'll be a replay of this call available on our website posted later on today. Best way to reach us is probably by emails and send us a note if you have any follow-up questions. Have a great day and a great week everyone. Goodbye.","Operator","Thank you again for participating in today's conference call. You may now disconnect."],"23160":["Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:ZBH) Q3 2016 Earnings Conference Call October 31, 2016  8:00 AM ET","Executives","Robert Marshall - VP, IR and Treasurer","David Dvorak - CEO","Dan Florin - CFO","Analysts","Bob Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Matthew O'Brien - Piper Jaffray","Mike Weinstein - JPMorgan","David Lewis - Morgan Stanley","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo","Matt Miksic - UBS","Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets","Matt Taylor - Barclays","Richard Newitter - Leerink Partners","Glenn Novarro - RBC Capital Markets","Operator","Good morning ladies and gentlemen. I would like to turn the call over to Bob Marshall, Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer. As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded. Mr. Marshall, you may begin your call.","Robert Marshall","Good morning and welcome to Zimmer Biomet's third quarter 2016 earnings conference call. I'm here with our CEO, David Dvorak and our CFO, Dan Florin. Before we start, I'd like to remind you that our discussions during this call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings for a detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties. ","Also the discussions during this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included within the earnings release, which is available at our website at investor.zimmerbiomet.com.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to David.","David Dvorak","Thanks Bob. This morning, I will review our third quarter financial results, as well as provide an overview of some of our new technologies and solutions, and the focused actions we are taking to drive sustainable growth. Dan will then provide additional financial details and discuss our updated guidance.","Zimmer Biomet\u2019s third quarter revenue performance was highlighted by the acceleration of our S.E.T. category, and ongoing strength in our Asia Pacific region. However, consolidated sales were below our expectations on weaker than anticipated results from our large joint and dental categories. Overall, broad demand for our differentiated portfolio remained high throughout the quarter, particularly for our focus cross-sell products.","Variable commercial performances by our sales teams were in part caused by unanticipated supply constraints related to our transitioning supply-chain infrastructure. This resulted in shortfalls that needed implants and additional instrument sets to fully exploit sales opportunities in key product categories. In response to this challenge, we have accelerated work to enhance certain aspects of our supply-chain infrastructure as we harmonize and optimize our sourcing, manufacturing and quality management systems.","Through these efforts we expect to improve our demand fulfillment in the coming months. As a consequence of these supply constraints, we project fourth-quarter sales results to be similar to those of the third quarter. However as we look ahead, we remain confident in our ability to successfully reaccelerate our revenue growth in 2017. As I mentioned, demand for our expansive portfolio of differentiated and clinically proven musculoskeletal technology, solutions and services has never been stronger. Our global sales organizations remain stable and have in fact achieved a third consecutive quarter of net personnel additions.","These teams remain focused on delivering high-quality personalized solutions to our customers and their patients. To that end, during the quarter we consummated a number of strategic external development transactions to expand our musculoskeletal portfolio and capabilities while continuing to deliver leveraged earnings-per-share. By joining together with LDR Spine in mid-July we now possess a leading position in the attractive global market for cervical disk replacement.","Additionally, our recently completed acquisition of Medtech SA provides us with current brain and spine robotic technology, and positions us to identify and develop additional applications for the ROSA robotics minimally invasive platform. This differentiated technology supports our strategy to offer the industry\u2019s most comprehensive range of intelligent instrumentation options.","Also during the quarter we acquired new clinical solutions that extend our reach across the continuum of care, spanning from state of the art 3-D range of motion simulation software to an innovative telerehabilitation platform. These portfolio additions are designed to support healthcare providers in personalizing musculoskeletal treatment. Importantly, these assets further strengthen our Zimmer Biomet\u2019s Signature Solutions offering, which is designed to assist hospitals and medical practices to seamlessly transition to value-based healthcare models.","With our end to end clinical services, proprietary technologies and analytical tools we are enabling healthcare providers to maximize productivity and patient engagement across the entire episode of care. As have previously communicated, the rollout of Zimmer Biomet\u2019s Signature Solutions comes in an opportune time when an increasing number of healthcare providers are striving to comply with bundled payment models by placing a greater emphasis on the quality and cost effectiveness of knee and hip replacement service lines.","Before I review the performance of each of our sales categories, I would like to comment on third quarter market conditions. We noted overall global market stability during the quarter. In addition, we believe that while the US market demonstrated some softness during the summer months, it strengthened towards the end of the quarter. With regard to pricing, we experienced negative 1.9% of pressure, which was in line with expectations and consistent with trends in recent years.","Against this backdrop, Zimmer Biomet delivered third quarter consolidated net sales of $1.83 billion. This performance represented 3.5% of constant currency growth over the prior year quarter of which the recently acquired LDR Holding Corporation contributed 190 basis points. Embedded within these results, we achieved solid 6.4% top line growth in the Asia-Pacific region, while growing sales in the Americas by 3.7% and by 0.9% in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region.","Zimmer Biomet\u2019s knee business was flat on a global basis in the third quarter reflecting positive volume and mix of 1.9% and negative price of 2%. Our 2.6% sales growth in the Asia-Pacific region was offset by our results in the Americas, where sales decreased by 0.9%. Our knee revenues increased by 0.3% in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region as compared to the prior year quarter.","Despite continuing attractive growth rates during the quarter for Persona, the Personalized Knee System, our sales execution on this leading cross selling opportunity was limited by the supply issues I just mentioned. The Oxford Partial Knee also delivered solid sales results during the quarter.","Additionally, we were pleased to announce the commercial launch of our Vanguard Individualized Design total knee replacement system. This first of its kind total knee construct supports our soft tissue preservation focus and market leadership with independent medial and lateral polyethylene bearing that simplify soft tissue preservation and balance. We are committed to driving focused execution in support of stronger knee results in future quarters with this exceptional portfolio.","Third-quarter hip sales grew by 0.6% reflecting positive volume and mix of 3.0% and negative price of 2.4%. We grew revenues by a solid 5.9% in the Asia-Pacific region, while sales were flat in the Americas. Hip sales decreased by 1.4% in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region compared to the prior year quarter. Within this overall performance we continue to drive the sales growth of our Taperloc Complete System","and Arcos Modular Femoral Revision System, as well as offerings that leverage Zimmer Biomet\u2019s proprietary Vitamin E-infused advanced bearing materials.","We were also pleased with the commercial traction of the recently introduced G7 Dual Mobility Construct. We are well positioned to build on these successes in future periods by leveraging the industry\u2019s most comprehensive range of hip solutions.","Turning to our S.E.T. category, we achieved a healthy 7.8% increase in global revenues, supported by solid results in all geographic segments. In our surgical business, we have been pleased with the ongoing progress of our growing specialized sales channel and the commercial success of our diversified offerings for the OR suite.","Our Sports Medicine results were once again driven by our proprietary Subchondroplasty procedure and Gel-One Cross-linked Hyaluronate Injection. Similarly, our extremities business continued to leverage our market-leading upper extremities portfolio, including the Comprehensive Total Shoulder System and the Nexel Total Elbow. ","Lastly, we delivered ongoing improvement in trauma with third quarter sales being led by our AFFIXUS Hip Fracture Nail System and NCB Plating system. We expect that our S.E.T. product category will remain an integral component of our sustainable revenue growth platform with innovative clinical solutions that meet the needs of surgeons, patients and healthcare institutions.","Dental sales decreased by 7.6%, which was below our expectations. Nonetheless, we achieved good performances from the 3i T3 Implant system and the recently introduced aesthetic implant system. Looking forward we expect to more fully capitalize on this and additional future product launches as we enhance our multitiered offerings to address an evolving dental marketplace.","Our spine, craniomaxillofacial and thoracic category sales increased by 23.9% on a constant currency basis in the third quarter, which represented approximately 1% organic growth. Following our recent LDR acquisition, we are making good progress we the initial phases of integration throughout our spine commercial organization. Among our spine offerings, we have been encouraged by the sustained revenue performance of the Mobi-C Cervical Disc prosthesis. Last week we announced that Mobi-C is now the most widely covered device for one and two level cervical disc replacement by commercial health insurers in the United States.","In addition, we also continued to deliver growth with the Vitality Spinal Fixation System. We are well positioned to continue to bolster the competitiveness of our spine business with an expanded portfolio and strengthening sales channel.","With regard to our craniomaxillofacial and thoracic business we continue to be pleased with the ongoing strong sales growth of the SternaLock Blu and SternaLock 360 primary closure systems, as well as the OmniMax MMF System. ","With that, I will turn it over to Dan, who will continue this discussion in greater detail as well as review our updated revenue and earnings guidance. Dan?","Dan Florin","Thank you, David. I will review our third quarter performance in more detail and then provide additional information related to fourth quarter and full-year 2016 sales and earnings guidance. Our total revenues for the third quarter were $1.833 billion, an increase of 3.5% adjusted constant currency when compared to the third quarter of 2015, and 1.6% excluding the contribution from the LDR acquisition.","The net currency impact for the quarter was a positive 60 basis points or $11 million on consolidated revenue results. We had an immaterial difference in billings days in the quarter as compared to the third quarter of 2015. Third-quarter revenue was below our expectations primarily due to execution issues within our large joint supply-chain, which led to degradation in order fulfillment rates late in the quarter as well as our performance in dental.","As noted by David, customer demand was strong in the quarter but certain aspects of our supply-chain integration impacted our ability to effectively respond to shifting product mix, most notably within our knee and hip portfolios. As a consequence, we underestimated demand for certain key cross-sell brands within our existing customer base leading to a depletion of our safety stocks and also affecting our ability to capitalize on new customer opportunities.","We are working diligently to enhance our supply-chain processes and execution, particularly in the areas of demand forecasting, global inventory tracking and asset deployment systems while we replenish our safety stock levels. However, these issues have some carryover effect into the fourth quarter, which I\u2019ll address shortly in the context of our updated Q4 guidance.","Turning now to the balance of our third quarter results, our adjusted gross profit margin was 75.1% for the quarter and 110 basis points lower when compared to the prior-year, due mainly to the impact of ASP declines, as well as lower foreign currency hedge gains, which we have been recently highlighting. The company's R&D expense was 5.2% of revenue at $95.6 million, reflecting investments from our recently acquired businesses, as well as our Zimmer Biomet Signature Solutions program.","Adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses were $727.7 million in the third quarter or 39.7% of sales which was 40 basis points higher than the comparable period in the prior year. As anticipated, ongoing investments in our specialized sales forces and medical training and education programs combined with the inclusion of our recent acquisitions offset the benefit of SG&A cost synergies in the quarter. We remain on track to deliver cumulative net EBIT merger synergies of $225 million by the end of 2016. In addition to the Biomet synergies, we are also laying the foundational elements for synergy capture in 2017 from our recent acquisitions.","In the quarter, the company recorded pre-tax charges of $355 million in special items, primarily related to the Biomet and LDR acquisitions, including $181 million of non-cash amortization and inventory step-up charges as well as approximately $140 million of acquisition and integration-related expenses. Adjusted third quarter 2016 figures in the earnings release exclude the impact of these charges. A full reconciliation of reported net earnings to adjusted net earnings is included in this morning's press release. Adjusted operating profit in the quarter amounted to approximately $553 million or 30.2% of sales, which was a decrease of 200 basis points when compared to the prior-year period due to the reduction in gross margin, as well as expected impacts from acquisitions.","Net interest expense and other non-operating expense totaled $94.6 million. Adjusted net earnings were $362.4 million for the third quarter, an increase of 7.1% compared to the prior-year period. Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 9.1% to $1.79 on 202.9 million weighted average fully diluted shares outstanding.","Our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 21.1% which reflects a year-to-date true up to recognize the tax benefit associated with the noted product mix shifts coming from tax efficient supply-chain jurisdictions as well as certain other items. Our year-to-date adjusted effective tax rate is 24%. ","Operating cash flow for the quarter amounted to $353 million, which included $161 million of cash expenditures for acquisition costs, integration activities, and initiatives related to our synergy program. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $150 million, which included $94 million for instruments and $56 million for property, plant and equipment.","Our free cash flow in the third quarter was approximately $202 million compared to $16 million in the third quarter of 2015. Ongoing working capital initiatives and improvements are expected to keep the company on track with full year cash flow generation of approximately $1.1 billion. During the quarter, the company repaid $200 million on our term loan, reflecting $700 million of debt repayment since the beginning of this year. Additionally during the quarter, the company consummated its new five-year $1.5 billion multi-currency senior credit facility along with a new $750 million term loan to finance the LDR transaction. As a result, gross debt increased by $550 million in the quarter.","I would like now to review our guidance. As we look to the fourth quarter, revenue growth is expected to be in the range of 1.6% to 2.6%. Foreign exchange is estimated to decrease revenue by approximately 30 basis points. Therefore reported revenue is expected to be in the range of $1.960 billion to $1.980 billion. Fourth quarter constant currency growth on a day adjusted basis is expected to be in a range of 3.3% to 4.3%, or 1.0% to 2.0% excluding the contribution from LDR. ","On a similar basis, the company had previously estimated revenue growth for the quarter in a range of 5.8% to 6.8%, or 3.5% to 4.5% excluding LDR. As a reminder, we have one less billing day as compared to the prior year. Our fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share on a fully diluted basis is now expected to be in a range of $2.08 to $2.13. ","Turning to the full year 2016, we now estimate revenue to be in a range of $7.630 billion and $7.650 billion, or an increase of approximately 27% on a reported basis or 2.4% to 2.7% on an adjusted pro forma basis in each case as compared to the prior year. The adjusted pro forma revenue guidance range is inclusive of approximately 110 basis points of contribution related to the LDR transaction.","We now expect foreign currency translation to decrease full year revenue in 2016 by approximately 30 basis points compared to our previous estimate of 50 basis points with the Japanese yen strengthening against the US dollar and a stabilized euro partially offset by the weakening British pound. Therefore full year revenue growth excluding the impact of the LDR acquisition on a constant currency adjusted pro forma basis is now expected to be in a range of 1.65% to 1.9%. Previously the company estimated full year revenue growth to be in a range of 2.5% to 3.0% on a similar basis.","Turning to the full year P&L, after updating our assumptions to reflect our recent performance, acquisitions, a lower expected tax rate, as well as foreign currency exchange rates and the associated operating margin implications, our full-year adjusted diluted earnings per share is now expected to be in a range of $7.90 to $7.95, an increase of approximately 15% over the prior year.","Our full year reported earnings per share are expected to be in a range of $1.50 to $1.60 after giving effect to our year-to-date results and anticipated special items in the fourth quarter. Special items are largely associated with non-cash amortization, costs incurred to capture net synergy targets and acquisition-integration expenses. Finally please note that our guidance does not include any impact from other potential business development transactions or unforeseen events.","With that, I will turn the call back over to David.","David Dvorak","Thanks, Dan. Although we were naturally disappointed with these third quarter results, I want to reiterate our confidence in Zimmer Biomet\u2019s market-leading and diversified portfolio as a driver of sustainable long-term growth. We are fully focused on restoring product supply and positioning our commercial teams to deliver on high market demand as we enter 2017. More broadly, we remain committed to creating meaningful partnerships to drive efficiencies across musculoskeletal healthcare with innovative technologies, services and solutions that improve the lives of patients. ","And now I would like to ask Kareen to begin the Q&A portion of our call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Bob Hopkins with Bank of America.","Bob Hopkins","Hi, good morning. Can you hear me okay?","David Dvorak","We can Bob. Good morning.","Bob Hopkins","Good morning. So, thanks for taking the question. First a question for Dan and then a question David for you, so Dan, first just on the quantification side, can you give us a sense as to the impact of this sourcing supply issue on Q3 revenue growth and the anticipated impact on Q4 revenue growth and just maybe a sense of how long this will last into 2017, and does this impact earnings outlook for 2017 growth?","Dan Florin","Sure Bob. First with respect to the quantification of the impact as David said in his prepared remarks as well as mine very important to note that customer demand remains very strong. So that is a real positive and our current supply chain not being fully integrated did hamper our ability to respond effectively to this shifting product mix, and while not anticipated we understand the root causes, we understand the fixes that are necessary and we are highly confident in our ability to implement those changes.","It will take several months to make those corrections. In terms of sizing impact for the quarter it is not a perfect science but I would roughly anticipate or estimate that to be about 100 basis points of impact due to the supply issues in the third quarter. We have a very robust backlog of demand and with respect to the impact in the fourth quarter I would size that even slightly above that 1% impact.","Bob Hopkins","Okay. And then just as a follow-up to start, does this compromise your ability to grow earnings 10% in 2017, and then David for you maybe just a little bit more color on when did this sourcing issue start to manifest and maybe just describe a little bit more exactly what this is, is it only in knees, why only in the US, just a little bit more detail would be really helpful. Thank you.","Dan Florin","I think Bob, the manifestation was really as the quarter progressed and late in the quarter the science became clear that we had a pretty significant product mix with the lack of visibility on a forward basis that allowed our supply chain to respond obviously if we fully integrate on the operations front. We're going to have a much more agile supply chain and be able to respond to these kinds of demands in a much shorter time period as we are in international state now, we just did not have the ability or the force side.","So, part of this is forecasting systems part of it is just operational execution and lead times for these products but primarily driven by the large joint demand, if you think about the cross-sell product categories, you're going to be aligned with the biggest opportunities that we had. And probably on the forecasting side the most significant underestimation was the demand for those same products with existing customers. And so, it cost us to have the step back to make sure that we're redoubling our efforts to serve this existing customers and as we've referenced that took away from some of the authentive opportunities that we have.","But please don\u2019t construe that to be a lack of demand. We know that we have significant opportunities to gain competitive accounts and business and as we restore the supply chain, we'll get after those opportunities and reaccelerate our top line momentum.","And then Bob just coming back to your 2017, I would just say that 10% earnings growth in 2017 off of 2016 remains our goal.","Bob Hopkins","Just how long does this last into 2017, Dan, and that's my last question?","Dan Florin","I would see some tail effect into the first quarter of 2017, Bob.","Bob Hopkins","Okay. Thanks a lot for answering, thank you.","Operator","We'll move on to Matthew O'Brien with Piper Jaffray.","Matthew O'Brien","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just to follow up a little bit on Bob's question. Is it fair to say that this really is more focussed in just a few areas within large joints from a product perspective and you were seeing such demand for those products that you just weren\u2019t able to kind of meet that demand and as you were kind of integrating and seeing some of these sales disruptions that, that was really the issue or was it more broad-based kind of a cross different products?","Dan Florin","It was focussed on the key cross sell products very much. So if you think about the Persona system, the demand is very high for that system. The host of cross sell product opportunities that we have on the legacy Biomet hip portfolio, would be another significant example. And then the third category I would say to a lesser degree but still having an impact on the upper extremity side, the comprehensive shoulder system.","So, those are all market leading systems and the demand within existing customers as well as competitive accounts is very strong.","Matthew O'Brien","Okay. And the as a follow-up. On the retention of business side of things, as we get into 2017. And I know you said the demand has been really strong for the products and you feel good about that but just now that you have this hiccup, how do you grab that momentum back which you were seeing and feel comfortable that you can get back to those kind of market growth rates you've been talking about in '17 and beyond.","Dan Florin","Yes. We're passively working towards addressing the supply issues and I would tell you that the forward visibility of addressing those supply issues combined with the known activities that we have on opportunities that we have for competitive accounts gives us that plan. And the confidence as we on our 2017 that we'll reaccelerate the top line.","Matthew O'Brien","Right. Thank you.","Operator","We'll move on to Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan.","Mike Weinstein","Thank you. Pardon me guys, that I'm still struggling a bit this so. David, explain to me why this wouldn\u2019t have been obvious until in the quarter?","David Dvorak","Yes. I think that the lack of visibility that we have with forecasting systems safety stocks were burning down. It just became a more profound issue as the quarter progressed. In retrospect we look back and we kind of understand why some of those demand signals weren\u2019t as timely but that's in retrospect. So, we just got to a point as the quarter progressed where we had the shift to limited supply both inventory and instruments to service existing accounts and it took away from the offensive opportunities that we could capitalize on, Mike.","Mike Weinstein","Okay. And so, sorry I can picture that that you're working down your excess by than you get late in the quarter and you're finding yourself short on product. But if the quantification is right and with a 100 basis points, that still suggests that overall it would have been light which you were expecting to do in the quarter. So, is the quantification accurate, do you think you would have been call it 2.5% organic head in this happen. And that's the case that it's obviously wasn\u2019t your goal for the quarter for the back half of the year.","Dan Florin","Yes, Mike, this is Dan. I think the other component was the dental performance in the quarter being below our expectation. And at our expectation level, you'd be 3% or thereabouts plus, had dental perform to our internal expectations. I think also with respect to the supply changes to indicate or give a little more colour on the fixes that are coming along. We've been integrating all the back office functions, the supply chain is extraordinarily complex. However, importantly we do have new tools coming online beginning this quarter with integrated global inventory data warehouses which did not exist at that part of the visibility fix that we lacked.","We had some interim processes in place that enhanced. They were not as robust as we needed them to be. We also have integrated demand planning tools and production planning tools coming online next quarter. So, those are key foundational elements to the supply chain that are coming online and critical to the fix.","Mike Weinstein","That and Dan, just one question on the financial side. The tax benefit that we saw this quarter that got you to the EPS numbers, just what should we assume on tax going forward to that's the same amount.","Dan Florin","Mike, we're at 24% year-to-date. Embedded in our fourth quarter guidance is the tax rate that is just slightly below that and we absolutely believe that to be sustainable. And as we discussed, we see a path to further reduce that over the coming years.","Mike Weinstein","Understood. Thank you, guys.","Operator","We'll move on to David Lewis from Morgan Stanley.","David Lewis","Good morning. I just had a few quick questions here. Dan, just to give the fourth quarter's sort of follow-on to Mike's question. We think about the fourth quarter guidance versus our expectations to sort of down two points. The supply chain is one point. To the incremental point of organic growth depression in the fourth quarter is that conservatism continuation to the dental trends. Can you just square the fourth quarter like you just did in the third?","Dan Florin","Sure, David. The 1% was the Q3 impact. The Q4 impact as I said is going to be above that, so think of that probably closer to 2% impact to the fourth quarter. So, I'd say that that\u2019s the quantification on the top line impact from the supply chain issues.","David Lewis","Okay. And then just two more quick ones. Then the third quarter, obviously margins were important in the stories in top 10% is the goal for next year. Gross margins were okay in the third quarter but obviously SG&A spending was higher. Can you just talk about again why third quarter margin compression was so severe and so what the implications are for the fourth quarter?","Dan Florin","Sure. I would say that in the third quarter, the SG&A margin which decreased or SG&A increased as a percentage of sale 50 basis points. You have to keep in mind the LDR acquisition and the impact of that. So, as David said, we're very pleased with the top line acceleration of Mobi-C. At the same time we've inherited the cost structure and as the team looked to integrate LDR in Zimmer Biomet spine, you'll begin to see leverage come from that integration that\u2019s not in the third quarter, you'll start to see that in the fourth quarter and certainly more significantly as we progress through 2017.","So, that leverage from integrating our acquisition is a big contributor to the growth in operating margin next year. Combined with our other growth investments that we've been making during the course of the year, the medical training and education, the specialized sales forces which are driving that SET growth that David described. And then further investments in our Signature Solutions platform which David described as well all which are critical to long-term sustainable growth.","David Lewis","Okay. And then just one quick one for David. David, I am sorry to keep jumping back on this horse but it's -- was this a situation where you have a Zimmer business and a Biomet business, you have initiatives to shift that mix, and you so for example the Zimmer knee and a Biomet knee, at the end of the quarter more physicians than you expected for one knee over the other, I hate to oversimplify this, but I'm just trying to give a dearth to the sets of how this could happen and how it could happen quickly.","And then related David, I would say how is your supply chain and manufacturing with critical parts at this merger. What could you say to investors that give them a confidence that you really feel this is an isolated issue? Thank you, I'll turn back in queue.","David Dvorak","Sure, David. It is very much the case where we underestimated the degree to which existing customers were ultimately going to be desirous of some of these key focus brands and for the reasons that we've outlined and the fixes that we have in place to address those issues that Dan just referenced for highly confident that we're going to be able to address those supply chain deficiencies and be able to get after the offensive opportunities with a new competitive business and accounts.","So, I guess what I would want to focus you on as well, David, is that demand is a terrific problem to have. We're disappointed that we didn\u2019t foresee that demand because it's taken us away from being able to run the kind of offense that we would otherwise be able to run. But these aren\u2019t product GAAP issues. We've got an incredible portfolio and in the natural state of one of these integrations, a complex integration which we would of course seen this. We've got the right fixes in place to get after it. The supply chain will respond and we'll get back, in offensive mode as the month's progress here and have a high degree of confidence and the team's capability to swipe the opportunities that are out ahead of us.","Operator","We'll move on to Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead, sir.","Larry Biegelsen","Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions, guys. Can you hear me okay?","David Dvorak","We can.","Larry Biegelsen","Great. David, I heard you talk about accelerating growth in 2017. When do you expect to be back to market growth and that 4% target that as you laid out earlier this year and I had to follow-up. Thanks.","David Dvorak","Yes. We absolutely foresee at or above market growth in 2017 as Dan said. There is likely to be a little bit of a carryover effect of the supply challenges at the beginning of the year. But we would see the year progression quarter-to-quarter throughout 2017 and accelerating growth in light of effect that we will have these supply issues behind us. And we'll provide this specific guidance beyond that, Larry, when we get to the January call.","Larry Biegelsen","Perfect. And then on dental. Could you give us a little bit more colour on what the issues were? I know you had a recall in the past and you were supposed to return to growth in the second half, I think in 2016. And so, when do you expect to return to growth there and in the past you explore strategic alternatives for dental. Can you talk about whether that is still strategic or as in requirement? Thanks for taking the questions.","David Dvorak","You're welcome. We believe that there are good value creation opportunities within the dental market. As we've referenced in the past, strategically each of legacy Zimmer and Biomet have been focussed on the so called premium market and we have significant opportunities and we're working to develop the strategies and then execute those strategies increasingly to get after those various market segmentations including the value segment.","As the business stands now, commercial execution is key. I would tell you that we had a pretty stable Q2 to Q3 performance within the America's had some drop off outside the United States. And so the team is very focussed on showing up the commercial execution on a global basis. We have a terrific regenerative portfolio for cross sell opportunities. And we would expect to see sequential improvement. I would anticipate that we get into a growth mode but not before 2017.","So, we expect to see improvement sequentially from Q3 to Q4 and then get into a growth mode as we're on our 2017.","Larry Biegelsen","Thanks for taking the questions.","David Dvorak","Sure.","Operator","Moving on to Matt Miksic with UBS.","Matt Miksic","Hi, thanks. So, I had one question on the Medtech Robot platform. And then I'm sorry to say one follow-up on this inventory issue. But on Medtech, David, you mentioned positioning you to potentially explore other applications over time. Can you talk a little bit about where and when and how long something like that you think would take particularly on the large joint side if that's something that you're thinking about. And then as I mentioned I have a follow-up.","David Dvorak","Yes. The development of any applications for us Matt, on the minimally invasive technologies and soft tissue preserving technologies and the broader portfolio of intelligent instrumentation is going to be driven by proven clinical benefit in a cost efficient way that also addresses the provider's capability on throughput front. And so, those are really the three preconditions, any anatomical site is fair gain for that, but our broad portfolio of intelligent instrumentation puts us in a position to be able to bring the right technologies and converge the right technologies whether those are preoperative planning integrating and or interoperative execution set of technologies in an optimised way.","So, this is a piece of the portfolio we think it will become an increasingly important piece of the portfolio but just a piece of the portfolio and we want to bring the right tool to address the issue in a cost effective way. So, as far as forecasting that out, we would expect continue to drive the convergence of these innovative technologies and in the operating periods to come at. And we give updates at appropriate points when applications are developed and gotten at the point where we're doing limited launches moving towards full launches of those other applications. Right now, the Rosa Robotics technology is focussed on brain and spine applications.","Matt Miksic","Okay. So, this isn\u2019t one of you competitors had a toning application they were working on and talking about probably for at about a couple of years before it finally began to reach the market. Should we sit in a -- do we not expect that kind of plan to land us -- to the pipeline for us a little bit?","David Dvorak","You shouldn\u2019t expect this to layout our internal innovation pipeline. That\u2019s right, Matt.","Matt Miksic","Okay, that's fair. I think I get that. So, on the not to kind of speed that works on this supply chain issue, but it has I don\u2019t think we've ever, I'm trying to think of an example that we see like this north be it. And you've managed to a number of large launches and ads and flows between preferred products before. Maybe I remember there was something about before the Biomet the others, something that you were tackling as on your supply chain kind of been a lean out working capital get more efficient.","I don\u2019t know if this has anything to do with, greater reliance on preop planning and the visibility that gives in the supply chain. But is this get -- is this sort of an unfortunate consequence of some of your efforts to get more efficient and one step forward and we'll expect to, one step back and two steps forward. Or just some colour would be very helpful on how this how we got here.","David Dvorak","Yes. I understand your question, Matt. And I would tell you that it's much more simple than that. This is much more simple in regard to appropriate forecasting in having forward visibility. So, the system fixes and infrastructure that Dan referenced earlier during the call are the solutions here. It isn\u2019t driven at all by any kind of innovative go to market or demand signal and transformation, nor is it driven by any kind of consolidation of the portfolios in the form of rationalization.","So, I wouldn\u2019t want people to misconstrue that the, yes it\u2019s a complicated operation because these are large product lines and manufacturing facilities. But there isn\u2019t anything other than blocking and tackling that fixes this problem we know we need to do to address it.","Matt Miksic","Okay, thank you.","David Dvorak","You're welcome.","Operator","We'll move on to Joanne Wuensch with BMO Capital Markets.","Joanne Wuensch","Good morning. Can you hear me okay?","David Dvorak","We can, Joanne. Good morning.","Joanne Wuensch","Good morning. Thank you for taking the question. You were able to quantify the tailwind or the impact in the third and the fourth quarter, the commenting that is going to roll into the first quarter. How should we think about that quantification and is there an all clear signal where we don\u2019t have to worry about this anymore?","David Dvorak","Yes. We wouldn\u2019t expect it to accelerate as we move into next year. So, I think that that quantification that we provided as far as the Q4 impact would be the high water mark and expect it to dissipate as we move into in through 2017, Joanne.","Joanne Wuensch","Okay. And then it was mentioned if I recall, that the average selling price is or the price pressure may have been somewhat higher than normal during the quarter. Could you please address that?","David Dvorak","Yes. We just have a little bit of a not pick but consistent with expectations. Primarily as far as the geographic segments go and the America's and Asia Pacific. But nothing that we didn\u2019t anticipate coming into the year or nothing that we didn\u2019t anticipate even coming into the quarter. Part of that Asia Pacific uptick is obviously the biannual adjustments in Japan.","Joanne Wuensch","Okay. Thank you, very much.","David Dvorak","You're welcome.","Operator","Matt Taylor with Barclays has our next question. Please go ahead.","Matt Taylor","Hi, thanks for taking the question. Can you hear me okay?","David Dvorak","We can, Matt. Good morning.","Matt Taylor","Good morning. So, I just wanted to understand from your customers point-of-view, elevated the supply issue that basically they're asking for inventory like Persona and you have to tell them that they have to wait a few weeks. Or can you help us characterize that so we can get the impact on your customers look the risk that you lose anybody because of the [indiscernible]?","David Dvorak","That risk will be minimised. I mean, this is part of the reason that has any of those signals we receive back we back off of some of the offense of deployments to make sure that we're taking care of the existing customers. So, that's the priority. It's a good question. And I would tell you that our entire organization is very focused on addressing any of those desires with the historic customers for the business side of legacy, Zimmer or Biomet.","Matt Taylor","Then on the fixes that you have with forecasting in the moment. Can you give us a sense of, what are the kind of long holes in the tent there. I like to give some upside or downside to your expectation, that will be $3 in a two months.","Dan Florin","Matt, this is Dan. If I mention some of the fixes being a global inventory data warehouse that is in user acceptance training as we speak. So, we expect that to come online in the coming weeks. That immediately gives us the type of global visibility to finish goods in inventory levels around the US and around the world. That's critical to that comes online in the coming weeks. The so I think we're very low risk of that going purely based on the testing that's been done today.","The integrated demand planning tools come online shortly after the new year and based on the learnings over the past few months, needless to say a lot of focus on the process for that and then the deployment of these tools were we're deploying our approve tool. So confident that we're going to be able to get that up and running without a glitches. Importantly over the past month, we significantly ramped up production levels but given lead times from vendors and production lead times that just takes time to build inventory and replenish those safety stock levels. But all of the above were aggressively dealing with and have been for the past several weeks.","Matt Taylor","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","We'll move next to Richard Newitter with Leerink Partners.","Richard Newitter","Hi, thanks for taking the questions. Maybe just to turn away from the supply issues for a moment. You mentioned some initiatives to try to tell your solution a bit more to the bundle payments that we're seeing take hold of the CJR. You acquired this respond well business. Can you talk a little bit about how we can expect these types of solutions to just fit into your overall strategy and how we should expect them to generate sales or what the business model is there?","David Dvorak","Sure, we take the form of much broader and deeper partnerships with the hospital customers. And I would tell you the discussions that we've had which to-date have been focussed primarily on large academic institutions have been very positive. So, we would enter into a deep partnership that could include risk sharing in an appropriate manner to optimise the quality of care for patients. And as well address the economic pressures that are on these customers as they get transitioned over to a more value base system.","To do that well, obviously, it requires an end-to-end management in the episode of care. And that's where the patient engagement tools become so important. Prehab is important, education, patient surgeon communications, obviously a really bright light has been shining as of late. Because of CJR, the post discharge cost that are incurred and that\u2019s where the teller rehabilitation and leveraging technologies that lead to a better patient outcome, but do that on a cost effective way can become so meaningful.","So, that product portfolio across the continuum of care including these services and solutions including our couple of decades of experience through our Accelero consulting services that help lean out processes and ensure that the quality of care is raised and it's done efficiently and throughput is drive through these systems is what signature solutions is all about.","And as I said, it\u2019s a message that's really resonating. I think they were in a unique position as we participate in over 1.5 million procedures across the globe on just the large showing side alone to understand what best practises can be transferred from one institution to another. And then ultimately with the appropriate structure on an end-to-end basis. We're going to be able to along with our hospital customers draw data that will lead to continuous improvement and refinements of how the care is delivered.","So, we love the opportunity. We think that we can be a big part of the solution for the hospitals going forward. And the deeper partnerships in the Zimmer Biomet Signature Solutions is the umbrella that allows us to bring those solutions to the customers.","Richard Newitter","Okay. And just one follow up on LDR. I think Dan, you had mentioned, leveraging that acquisition into the fourth quarter in a more meaningful in '17 as a reason for confidence and operating profit growth through acceleration. I guess my question just there is, do you -- what's your confidence level that you're going to be able to maintain the salesforce in what always is tricky with spot acquisitions and what level of confidence do you have that we won't see any surprises kind of for that business to potentially alter that margin outlook. Thanks.","Dan Florin","Sure. And we will do nothing to impede the momentum of Mobi-C. We can assure you that the opportunity is really keeping mind that the Zimmer Biomet spine business still in the process of being integrated, you bring LDR into that and that and now we have an opportunity to further design the right or structure for robust growth in the right level of supporting infrastructure.","So, it's really you have to think about Zimmer Biomet LDR all emerging together in from a back office perspective and so forth. But we will do nothing to impede the growth. In the LDR portfolio and then capitalize on the cross sell opportunities that exist between the Zimmer Biomet portfolio with Mobi-C. Very exciting and how the confident in our ability to drive the top line while delivering on the integration and the synergies.","David Dvorak","Cray, we have time for one additional question.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take that from Glenn Novarro with RBC Capital Markets.","Glenn Novarro","Hi. Two questions. One, back into the temper you guys were on the conference trail and you highlighted the FX headwinds for 2017 on the EPS line. So, can you give us an update on the FX impact in terms of EPS for 2017 and what are the offsets? And I have a follow-up.","David Dvorak","Sure, Glenn. The impact on 2017 is still the same and we've characterized that roughly in the neighbourhood of a 4% headwind to EPS growth next year. And that's still the case. We continue to feel good about the Biomet synergies which offset that. And then some of the other activities that will be driving to work towards that 10% goal that I described before. So, nothing had changed in that regard.","Glenn Novarro","Okay. And then, just on the salesforce back at AAOS, there was a lot of chatter about the Zimmer reps and resume's out in the field. But Dave, I think on the call you said that you were a mid-adder of sales reps this quarter. So, can you quantify and where is this coming. Is it coming particularly in knees and hips? Thanks.","David Dvorak","Sure Glenn. We have been a mid-adder as you said in the first quarter of this year, in the second quarter of this year and again in the third quarter of this year. And it's across all product categories Glenn, if there is a lot of focus obviously consistent with as we've been talking about building up the specialize salesforces and so the non-large showing categories as well had be recipients of the continuous filled out of the salesforce.","And I think that you're just beginning to see the science of the productivity of those specialized salesforces is evidenced by the continued improvement of the SET category. And that was global improvement as is our build out of the specialized sale force, since it's very much a global offense and strategy.","David Dvorak","So, with that, I'd like to thank everyone for joining the call today and for your continued interest and support for Zimmer Biomet. We look forward to speaking with you on our fourth quarter conference call. I'll turn the call back to you, Careen.","Operator","Thank you, sir. And thank you again for participating in today's conference call. You may now disconnect."],"23159":["Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc.

I would like to turn the call over to Bob Marshall, Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer. Mr. Marshall, you may begin your call.","Mike Marshall","Thank you, Sara. Good morning and welcome to Zimmer Biomet's second quarter 2016 earnings conference call. I'm here with our CEO, David Dvorak and our CFO Dan Florin. Before we start, I'd like to remind you that our discussions during this call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings for a detailed discussions of these risks and uncertainties. During our call, we will compare revenues on a constant currency adjusted pro forma basis. This means revenues for the prior-year periods have been adjusted to reflect the inclusion of Biomet revenues and the impact to the previously announced divestiture revenues.","Additionally, expense ratios and related margin analysis through operating profit will be computed on the basis of an adjusted pro forma financials, as revised, adjusted in all periods for inventory step-up and other inventory and manufacturing-related charges, special items, intangible asset amortization, financing and other expenses related to the Biomet merger and current tax adjustments, as applicable.","Reconciliations to non-GAAP financial measures discussed during our call to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are available on our website at, investor.zimmerbiomet.com.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to David.","David Dvorak","Thanks Bob. This morning, I will review our second quarter financial results and key highlights from our performance as well as the ongoing development and expansion of our musculoskeletal portfolio. Dan will then provide additional financial details and discuss our updated guidance. Before I launch into these topics, however, I would like to take a moment to reflect on the one-year anniversary of the formation of Zimmer Biomet. Throughout this past year, we've continued to be guided by our long-standing value creation framework which focuses on investing for sustainable growth, driving operational efficiencies and redeploying capital in a disciplined matter.","We successfully integrated and leveraged the combined expertise and cultures of the two organizations, while executing on a highly complementary portfolio of technologies, services and solutions. Our financial results have provided the tangible proof points that Zimmer Biomet reflects our initial vision of an ideal fit. Our Company has reached an important inflection point, having successfully reestablished top-line momentum by beginning to capture the promise of the attractive cross-selling opportunities inherent in our merger, in addition to successfully delivering on our synergy commitments.","We're now poised to move forward with our plans which include the acceleration of our commercial and innovation strategic priorities. These priorities are designed to further enhance and sustain our growth well into the future. Consistent with this progress, Zimmer Biomet generated solid revenue acceleration in the second quarter, again above the top end of our expectations, further validating our strategies to achieve above-market revenue growth by the close of 2016. Our steady advance towards this goal demonstrates the increasing productivity and focused execution of our commercial organization and for the balance of the year, will continue to exploit the opportunities presented by our differentiated musculoskeletal portfolio.","Turning briefly to market conditions, in the second quarter, the demand across the globe for musculoskeletal solutions continued to grow at a steady pace, in line with our expectations and consistent with recent quarters. With regard to pricing, we experienced negative price pressure of 1.2% in the quarter, consistent with broader trends throughout 2016. Against this backdrop, Zimmer Biomet delivered second quarter consolidated net sales of $1.93 billion which represented an increase of 65.6% on a reported basis and 4.5% adjusted compared to the prior-year quarter. We increased sales in each of our segments, with Americas up 3.6%, Europe, Middle East and Africa regions growing 4.5%; and the Asia-Pacific region delivering 8.2% growth. Within our consolidated results, Zimmer Biomet's knee category grew sales 5.0% in the second quarter, reflecting positive volume and mix of 6.5% and negative price of 1.5%.","Our U.S. knee business continued to deliver solid results which contributed to a sales increase of 3.0% in the Americas. We also achieved strong revenues in markets across the Asia-Pacific and Europe, Middle East and Africa regions, where we increased sales over the prior-year period by 9.6% and 7.1%, respectively. As anticipated, the cross-selling opportunities of our market-leading knee portfolio continue to drive growth, led by the ongoing sales performance of premium reconstructive systems such as our flagship Persona, the Personalized Knee System and the Vanguard 360 Revision Knee System.","In addition, during the quarter, we marked the 40th anniversary of the launch of the Oxford Partial Knee, the most widely used and clinically proven partial-knee replacement in the world which has been used in more than 600,000 surgeries across 50 countries and featured in more than 280 published studies. And, as part of our commitment to continuous product innovation, during the second quarter, we released a series of next-generation enhancements to our OSS orthopedic Salvage System. Advancing this unique solution for salvage revision procedures and oncologic applications. As we look to the second half of the year, we will further leverage the commercial opportunities of our knee portfolio for the ongoing growth of this important category.","Turning to our market-leading hip business, we accelerated consolidated sales growth to 3.2% in the second quarter, including positive volume and mix of 5.4% and negative price of 2.2%. Hip revenues grew, 8.1% in the Asia-Pacific region; 3.6% in Europe, Middle East and Africa; and 1.5% in the Americas compared to the prior-year quarter. The second quarter progress of our hip category was led by our innovative Taperloc Complete System and our comprehensive revision portfolio in addition to our Vitamin E-infused advanced bearing materials, Vivacit-E and E1. During the quarter, our sales channel focused on increasing the adoption of differentiated recent additions to our hip offerings, including the Echo Bi-Metric Microplasty Stem and the Arcos One-Piece Revision System.","We also continue to gain traction with the G7 Dual Mobility Construct. This unique solution is designed to achieve stability with optimal range of motion and is compatible with a full line of fixation options within our G7 Acetabular System. We plan to further deliver hip growth in the second half of the year, backed by a diversified portfolio of solutions that address a broad spectrum of clinical challenges and surgical approaches. Importantly, we increased our S.E.T. revenues by an impressive 7.2% in the second quarter, supported by the positive U.S. performances of every business within this category. In Surgical, our sales were again strengthened by our offerings for the OR suite, led by the Transposal Fluid Waste Management System and the ATS Automatic Tourniquet System.","From our Sports Medicine portfolio, we continue to deliver attractive growth, with our joint preserving Gel-One Hyaluronate Injection and the Subchondroplasty procedure in addition to a solid initial quarter of results for our Quattro Link Knotless Anchors and XTRAFIX System from our recently expanded line of Advanced Soft Tissue Repair and Reconstruction Solutions. Within our market-leading extremities business, we have been pleased with the ongoing sales performance of our Comprehensive Total Shoulder System and the Nexel Total Elbow. And through the increased productivity of our trauma commercial teams, we sequentially improved our trauma performance, with steady sales of our AFFIXU.S. Hip Fracture Nail System and a Natural Nail System. Going forward, we plan to continue accelerating growth in our SET category as part of our global strategy for a diversified and sustainable revenue platform. ","Zimmer Biomet dental sales decreased 0.8% in the second quarter, representing a stabilizing sequential performance that had set the stage for expected growth in the second half of the year. In addition to benefiting from the increased harmonization of our dental commercial channel, during the second quarter, we successfully resolved a supply disruption associated with a voluntary product action that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2015. We also continued to improve sales acrossed our dental portfolio, including our market-leading regenerative solutions. From our dental commercial pipeline, we've been pleased with the ongoing U.S. launch of the 3i T3 Short Implant designed for challenging vertical grafting procedures and the 3.1 millimeter diameter aesthetic implant for narrow anterior sites. We will remain focused on the improvement of our dental business in the second half of the year, leveraging our scale, expertise and competitive portfolio of dental solutions.","Our spine, craniomaxillofacial and thoracic category increased sales 1.4% over the prior-year quarter. Our craniomaxillofacial and thoracic team continues to grow sales of our recently launched RibFix Blu System and OmniMax MMF System, while delivering strong results with our TraumaOne and SternaLock Blu Systems. In our spine business, we continued to deliver steady revenues with the Polaris Spinal System as well as the Timberline Lateral Fusion System, an offering which we enhanced during the quarter with valuable expansions. Our spine results were also supported by sales of our recently launched Vitality Spinal Fixation System.","Going forward, we're well-positioned to capture the opportunities resulting from our acquisition of LDR Spine. By joining together with this successful and innovative international spine company, we're enhancing the scale, portfolio and capabilities of our global spine business, including an immediate leadership position in cervical disc replacement, the fastest growing segment of the $10 billion spine market. We have also gained a number of valuable new offerings to expand our minimally invasive technologies.","In addition, earlier this month, we acquired a controlling share of French surgical robotics innovator, Medtech SA, including its Rosa Robotics Platform for a range of minimally invasive brain, neurological and spinal procedures. This advanced combination of robotics technology, with surgical navigation, will further diversify our spine and CMF portfolio as well as bolster our strategy to offer the industry's broadest range of intelligent instrumentation options.","Furthermore, we see significant potential to leverage this platform technology for additional anatomical sites in the future. Upon acquiring the remaining Medtech shares in the coming months, our integration priorities will focus on building a strong foundation to support the expansion of this platform technology across our musculoskeletal portfolio. We will prioritize future application development and ensure that R&D resources are expanded appropriately. We will also ensure the key capabilities and support functions, such as manufacturing and quality systems, are built out in a manner that will support our growth plans.","These and other highly complementary transactions, in combination with the diversified internal pipeline, are accelerating our strategies for delivering sustainable longer term revenue growth across all musculoskeletal markets. The ongoing expansion of our personalized technologies, services and solutions also allows us to play a meaningful role in transforming healthcare by addressing the evolving needs of the sector.","To that end, earlier this week, we were pleased to unveil our latest offering, Signature Solutions. This comprehensive suite of clinical services and technologies is designed to assist hospitals and medical practices to seamlessly transition to value-based healthcare models by maintaining excellent patient outcomes while maximizing procedural and cost efficiencies across the entire episode of care.","Built on our nine decades of musculoskeletal expertise, Signature Solutions will combine Zimmer Biomet's established consulting platform with a strategically curated suite of technologies and services that drives improvement across every aspect of the healthcare value equation. We will initially offer Signature Solutions to musculoskeletal service lines that select academic facilities in the United States, leading the way for a broader release scheduled for 2017.","Importantly, we expect the expansion of Signature Solutions to coincide with an increased focus on knee and hip replacement at U.S. facilities participating in Medicare's CJR payment model. Through innovative service-driven offerings such as this, we're deepening our commitment to advancing standards of musculoskeletal care and enhancing our partnerships with healthcare stakeholders.","With that, I will turn it over to Dan, who will continue this discussion in greater detail as well as review our revenue and earnings guidance. Dan?","Dan Florin","Thank you, David. I will review our second quarter performance in more detail and then provide additional information related to our second-half and full-year 2016 sales and earnings guidance. Our total revenues for the second quarter were $1.934 billion, an increase of 4.5% constant currency compared to the second quarter of 2015 on an adjusted pro forma basis. The net currency impact for the quarter on revenue was not material to consolidated results. We had just over one additional billing day in the quarter as compared to the second quarter of 2015 which contributed approximately 190 basis points of growth in the quarter on a consolidated basis. The billing day differences varied by geographic segment with the Americas and EMEA having one and two extra billing days, respectively. There was essentially no impact in the Asia-Pacific region.","Our adjusted gross profit margin was 75% for the quarter and 80 basis points lower when compared to the prior-year adjusted pro forma results, due to the impact of unfavorable foreign currency and price declines. The Company's R&D expense was 4.6% of revenue at $88.6 million.","Adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses were $732 million in the second quarter or 37.8% of sales which was 220 basis points lower than the comparable period in the prior year on an adjusted pro forma basis. SG&A leverage was again driven by our synergy initiatives, partially offset by ongoing investments in our specialized sales forces around the globe as well as additional medical training and education programs. We remain on track to deliver cumulative net EBIT merger synergies of $225 million by the end of 2016 which is ahead of our expectations at the time of the merger closing and consistent with our full year of guidance.","In the quarter, the Company recorded pre-tax charges of $430 million in special items, primarily related to the Biomet acquisition, including $307 million of non-cash amortization and inventory step-up charges as well as integration-related expenses. Adjusted second quarter 2016 figures in the earnings release exclude the impact of these charges. A full reconciliation of reported net earnings to adjusted net earnings is included in this morning's press release. Adjusted operating profit in the quarter amounted to approximately $630 million or 32.6% of sales which was an increase of 160 basis points when compared to the prior-year period.","Net interest expense and other non-operating expenses totaled $89.6 million in the quarter. Our adjusted net earnings were $407.1 million for the second quarter, an increase of 47% compared to the prior-year period. Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 27.8% to $2.02 on 201.9 million weighted average fully diluted shares outstanding.","Our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 24.7% which included approximately 70 basis points of benefit from the early adoption of a new tax accounting rules for stock-based compensation. With the early adoption of the new accounting standard we also revised our Q1 tax rate by 50 basis points which resulted in an incremental 0.01% or $0.01 to earnings per share in the first quarter. Operating cash flow for the quarter amounted to $380 million which included $101 million of cash expenditures for integration and initiatives related to our synergy program. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $118 million, including $72 million for instruments and $46 million for property, plant and equipment.","Our free cash flow in the second quarter was approximately $262 million compared to $115 million in the second quarter of 2015 and was in line with our expectations. During the quarter, the Company repaid $100 million on our term loan, reflecting $1 billion of debt repayment since the closing of the Biomet transaction one year ago.","I would like to now review our guidance. I will provide updated revenue and adjusted earnings per share guidance for the full year as well as our expectations for the second half of the year. Our guidance reflects continued accelerating sales momentum, consistent with our prior expectations plus the addition of exciting new technologies, such as the LDR portfolio which we believe positions us well for sustained above-market growth for years to come. For a full-year 2016, we now estimate revenues to be in a range of $7.68 billion to $7.715 billion or an increase of approximately 28% on a reported basis and 3.0% to 3.5% on an adjusted pro forma basis, in each case as compared to the prior year. The adjusted pro forma revenue guidance is inclusive of approximately 100 basis points of contributions related to the LDR transaction.","We now expect foreign currency translation to decrease revenue in 2016 by approximately 0.5% compared to our previous estimate of 1.0%, with the Japanese Yen strengthening against the U.S. Dollar, partially offset by the weakening British Pound. Therefore organic revenue growth, on a constant currency adjusted pro forma basis, is now expected to be in a range of 2.5% to 3.0%. Previously, the Company estimated full-year revenue growth to be in a range of 2.0% to 3.0% on a similar basis.","Turning to the full year of P&L, after updating our assumptions to reflect our recent acquisitions and planned strategic investments as well as foreign currency exchange rates, our full-year adjusted diluted earnings per share is now expected to be in a range of $7.90 to $8, the achievement of which would mark our fifth consecutive year of expanded adjusted operating margins.","Our reported earnings per share are expected to be in a range of $1.50 to $1.75 after giving us back to our year-to-date results and anticipated special items in the second half. Special items are largely associated with non-cash amortization, costs incurred to capture net targets and acquisition-integration expenses. As we look to the second half of the year, revenue growth is expected to be in a range of 4.0% to 5.0% for both the third and fourth quarter with one less billing day in Q4 compared to the prior year, a 150 basis point headwind. Foreign exchange is estimated to decrease revenue in both quarters by about 30 basis points.","Reported revenue is expected to be a dollar range of $1.830 billion to $1.850 billion for the third quarter and $2.010 billion to $2.030 billion in the fourth quarter. Constant currency growth on a day adjusted basis is expected to be in a range of 4.3% to 5.3% for the third quarter and 5.8% to 6.8% for the fourth quarter. Excluding the impact of the LDR acquisition, constant currency day-rate growth is expected to be in a range of 2.5% to 3.5% and 3.5% to 4.5% for Q3 and Q4, respectively. Working down the P&L, during the second half of 2016, we expect gross margins to be a range of 75.0% to 75.7%, consistent with the first half of the year.","R&D and SG&A as a percentage of sales are expected to increase from the first half of the year to reflect recent acquisitions and planned strategic investments. We now estimate R&D expense to be in a range of 4.7% to 5.2% of sales in the second half and SG&A expense to be in a range of 37.5% to 39.5%.","We expect higher expense ratios in Q3 and lower in Q4 to properly reflect seasonality. The effective tax rate in the second half of the year is expected to be approximately 25%. To wrap up, we expect Q3 adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $1.76 to $1.80 and Q4 to be in a range of $2.11 to $2.17. Finally, please note that our guidance does not include any impact from other potential business development transactions or unforeseen events.","David, I will turn the call back over to you.","David Dvorak","Thanks, Dan. Zimmer Biomet sales performance in the first half of 2016 demonstrated the effectiveness and coordination of our industry-leading commercial organization, reinforcing our confidence for exiting the year at above-market growth rates. In addition to promising opportunities across our portfolio, we will continue bringing differentiated new products to market in 2016, including technologies, services and solutions that represent compelling value in the evolving healthcare environment. These internal developments from our R&D pipeline will be joined at the second half of the year by new offerings from our recent acquisitions which further enhance our portfolio's leadership position.","And now I would like to ask Sara to begin the Q&A portion of our call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Mr. Bob Hopkins from Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question. ","Bob Hopkins","So congrats on the progress this quarter; nice to see. I've got a couple, first, a clarifying question just for the guidance because obviously, there's a lot of moving parts here in terms of selling days and pro forma numbers. Dan, in Q1 of this year organically, you grew 1.2% on a same-day selling basis. I think that number for Q2 is 2.6%; is that right?","Dan Florin","2.5%, Bob. Yes.","Bob Hopkins","Okay. So 2.5%. So 1.2% and then 2.5% and then the guidance for Q3 and Q4 on the same basis is 2.5% to 3.5% and then 3.5% to 4.5%; is that right?","Dan Florin","That's correct.","Bob Hopkins","Okay, so 1.2% going to 2.5% and then up from there and then up from there again. Okay. And then just on a selling day basis in Q1, just so we have it correctly, I think you said in the Americas, there was one extra day and in EMEA, there were two?","Dan Florin","In Q2, that is correct. One extra day in the Americas, two extra days in EMEA.","Bob Hopkins","More substantively, I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about U.S. hip and knees. Obviously, across the organization, you had nice acceleration in growth. On a selling day basis, if there was one spot where I thought there might be a little momentum, it was maybe U.S.-Americas business for hips. So I'm wondering, David, if you could just elaborate on what's going on in the Americas? Is U.S. strong and then maybe some of the other territories in Americas a little bit weaker? Just maybe talk about the U.S. hip market and the U.S. knee market separate from the other Americas. Thank you.","David Dvorak","Sure, Bob. We continue to make progress in closing the gap to market in both large joint categories in the United States, probably more substantial progress sequentially from the first quarter to the second quarter in hips but that stands to reason relative to some of the product launches that have already come out this year, we're finding a lot of traction with strengthening our revision line. As we talked about in the past, the Biomet portfolio greatly shores up some of the gaps that we had on the legacy Zimmer side and the commercial teams are taking advantage of that on the hip side. We probably saw an earlier recovery of the Knee business on the U.S. front and then that was sustained sequentially from Q1 to Q2.","So we feel good about the momentum. We have a lot of opportunity going forward. Both large joint categories in the United States and obviously, these are categories that have performed quite well outside of the U.S. for us, particularly the Knee business over the course of the last couple of quarters now.","Bob Hopkins","How about the tone of the U.S. market though for hips and knees, now that we have seen a bunch of players report? What is your view on Q2 market growth trends for U.S. hips and knees?","David Dvorak","I don't see there being a substantial adjustment to the pace. Obviously, these demands are consistent in the global markets, quite stable in that regard as it relates to the U.S. in particular. You have a little bit of a shift from Q1 to Q2, just on billing days and I think that everyone Bob talks about the billing days in absolute terms because that's the cleanest way to talk about it. But you have to be careful about not acknowledging that there are some shifts in billing day mix from Q1 to Q2 and if Easter hits at a particular point in time and Good Friday gets pushed from Q1, Q2, back and forth from one year to the next that can have some dynamics. So I think you're better off measuring the pace and stability of that U.S. market across the longer period rather than just isolating transition from Q1 to Q2.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Mr. Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead with your question, sir.","Craig Bijou","It is actually Craig on for Larry. I wanted to start at Medtronics Analyst Day, Medtronic talked about, for the first time publicly, introducing lower price knee and hip implants. There are also a couple of other players that are looking to go the less expensive implant route. And I know within CJR, it's been talked about numerous times that the focus is going to be on post-acute care savings.","But you're going to have these companies that are going to the hospitals with less expensive implant offerings so I did just want to get your thoughts on how that model could impact the industry and if you guys have a, would have a response to that?","David Dvorak","Sure Craig. I think that there's nothing new in that announcement. Obviously, across the globe, we compete against a large number of companies, some of whom are taking that segment of the market by way of focus and if anything, I would tell you that we're better positioned than ever because of the Zimmer Biomet combination. We have not only the capability to position our systems at a price point to meet the clinical needs and the demands of customers to match anyone but we're doing that with clinically proven products that have been out for, in the case of NexGen, 20 years and our service capabilities at the same time, with our scale, can deliver that product in a cost-efficient way, in a manner that meets the service needs of those customers as well.","So nothing new in the way of that announcement, obviously, we take any launch seriously. We pay a lot of attention to the competitive environment and do that in a very respectful manner because that leads us to running the business in a more confident fashion but there isn't anything about that particular announcement that we find to be game-changing relative to the marketplace. I would go on, I guess Craig to tell you that I think to the extent that the value-based models are going to become more significant in a U.S. market and this is the case in some of the OU.S. markets that we have operated in for a long, long time. If someone grabs a product to save a few dollars and ends up with a clinical problem and remember the patients at the same time, they're becoming much better educated and their expectations for a return to the lifestyle that they have a vision with respect to getting to, is better informed than ever.","Using the wrong product, ending up with the wrong patient result, the reputational damage and quite soon, the economic consequences of doing that are going to be dialed in at a much more significant way. So again, proven clinical technologies are going to be more important in the environment that we're going to be operating in rather than less and I think that whether it's surgeons or hospital administrators, they are going to be making business decisions in accordance with that environment in which they are operating.","Craig Bijou","And then just on the Medtech acquisition or the investment in the subsequent acquisition, I wanted to ask your thoughts about you mentioned, well, obviously spine, the spine application from Medtech and then potentially moving into other anatomical areas. So I want to ask, from a strategic point of view, why robotics works in spine and some of the other anatomical areas but may not work in hip and knee, as you've spoken numerous times about one of your competitors and the robot that they acquired. So I just wanted to understand some of the differences between the different segments within broader ortho.","David Dvorak","Sure. This is all part of a decade-long effort that we've had underway to offer the marketplace with the broadest array of intelligent instruments and as we've said all along, we're agnostic as to the form that, that technology takes but what's important to us is to create value with these technologies and think about that in three key areas. First and foremost, is to improve the quality of outcomes. Secondly, to ensure that, that technology is efficient and creates value for our customers. And then thirdly and this is going to become increasingly important in the value-based world that we're going to be operating within, is patient volume capture.","So that means the clinical outcome can't go backwards. The cost of the technology can't be positioned in a way where it doesn't provide the customer with a return and it certainly can't prolong a lot of times or the terms of those ORs in a manner that the cost of the patient volume to decline in that important service line for the customers.","So with all of that, by way of background, we obviously in Patient-Specific Instruments and iASSIST and eLIBRA, et cetera and the more traditional navigation have made significant investments and do thousands and thousands of procedures that are supported by those technologies. To the extent that robotics can augment where it is a value creator, the cases that are being done, then that is enough for it is worth putting forth and we believe that it will create value.","Now, this is a technology that is very well advanced, the better part of a couple of decades of effort that have gone into it. And it really augments and complements what we've been doing out of our Montreal operations for over a decade, what they've been doing for two decades as ORTHOsoft, the navigation of the development of the iASSIST technology. So very complementary; it will be integrated into those technologies but it has to create value. The Medtech Group has done a good job of taking that technology forward, addressing technical challenges that existed when we looked at similar technologies over the last many years and that is the difference maker to us.","So it has the potential of being leverageable across other muscular skeletal sites but obviously, at the start point, we'll focus on the current applications and the beginnings of the launch in the spine space and do that in a way where we make sure that we're getting the foundation right to ensure that we don't have hiccups or hit speed bumps as we roll out those technologies and the applications across various anatomical sites.","So if you look at spine, specifically, obviously the success rates, patient satisfaction rates are quite different than knees and hips. And this is one of the things that we can do along with LDRs, Mobi-C along with LDRs, minimally invasive technologies and implants to provide a better patient outcome. And so we will be focused in those areas first and then over time to the extent that we can create value with this technology in other areas, you should expect to see those applications get launched as well, Craig.","Operator","Mr. Mike Weinstein from JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question, sir.","Mike Weinstein","So David, when I look at your 2Q performance and the acceleration that we're seeing in the business, part of what, I think, impresses me most is what we're starting to see in the SET business this quarter and if you think about the second half of the year and the guidance for the sequential acceleration in the top line growth of the Company, is SET the number one driver; is that how we should think about it?","David Dvorak","It is broad-based, Mike. I would tell you quite literally, across every business unit, we expect and have opportunities to accelerate the growth so we would expect to sustain that level and perhaps pick up the pace even within SET because we love our opportunities there and yet we see opportunities in the other product categories, just the same. At SET side, we talked about this at the point of announcing the Biomet combination and again, these were business units where, in market subsegments where we had lower share, we had scale challenges and some product gaps, Biomet was in the exact same position and it really was a complementary fit when you brought those product lines together, the product pipelines together. And importantly, the capability given the competitiveness of that combined portfolio in each of those product categories to justify building out more specialized sales forces.","I tell you that, that is just now what you're starting to see the benefit of and that's a big difference maker so you've got this competitive bag and historically organizations that were primarily driven by generalist and are in the future and you're starting to see good results of this going to be driven by sales force specialization where appropriate. It is going to continue to be a growth engine for us. I think what you will see is, spine will take that form as we get through the LDR integration as well.","Mike Weinstein","David, the timing of creating these specialized sales forces in trauma and maybe just to clarify, so it's trauma, upper and lower extremities, sports medicine, where you going to have specialized sales forces? And what is the timing of having those in place?","David Dvorak","In all of those areas and then at a group like surgical, obviously, we're already there with spine, dental, so anything that's non-large joint, you should expect some form of specialization, whether those are product specialists or outright direct reps that are focused exclusively on those product categories. And obviously, the product category and the geography will dictate the level of specialization but they exist today.","It was one of the things that we drove, Mike, in the integration early on is to make critical decisions that would optimize our performance across all of these product categories. And since then, we've been adding more specialized reps to each of these categories and we're up on a net basis substantially in the non-large joint categories; in fact, we're up on a net basis, both Q1 and Q2 on the large joint side, too. So this is just the beginning of driving this momentum and we're really enthusiastic about what we're seeing.","Mike Weinstein","David, I think just on this topic, I think probably a lot of people don't appreciate the challenge in some those businesses historically for Zimmer of competing with companies that have specialized organizations, whether it's trauma or in extremities. Ones that were -- had larger footprints or were able to make those investments before seem to have the upper hand a lot of times in those markets relative to where Zimmer which was working off a smaller footprint in some of those markets. But obviously, this very large reconstructive presence. That moved to the specialized effort by Zimmer is a big change and should have a big impact on the business, I would think.","David Dvorak","I think that is right, Mike and I think it was something that was undervalued at the time that we announced the deal. We articulated that is a strategy but understandably, people want to see you get far enough into executing that strategy and putting some results on the scoreboard before they can fully value it. This is installment one here in Q2 for the new Zimmer Biomet for these kinds of results.","Operator","Mr. David Lewis from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question, sir.","David Lewis","Just a couple of questions, maybe I will start with Dan. So Dan, you increased guidance for operating expenses in the back half of the year. It does sound like from the commentary most of that was tied to LDR but I guess, just thinking about the accelerating revenue and the drop through to the bottom line in the back half of the year, it sounds like you certainly believe organic growth will accelerate. Are there other investments that we should be thinking about you making to grow the business in the back half that would prevent drop-through in margin progression back half this year into 2017?","Dan Florin","Sure, David. I think, first, importantly, as we said in our prepared remarks, with the Biomet integration, solidly on track and accelerating revenue growth that it really does put us in a position to make important strategic investments and certainly, the LDR acquisition being part of that effort so very excited to have LDR in our spine portfolio. It's a big opportunity for us to transform our spine business. As you know, as an independent company, LDR was generating operating losses which we're absorbing in the second half of the year and as we eliminate redundancies and integrate the back office, et cetera, we will grow that business and that will begin to turn. As we said at the time of the deal announcement, the transaction is expected to be neutral to net income in 2017.","So for the back half of 2016 and the full year of 2016, we're delivering on towards the high end of our original EPS guidance while also making strategic investments like LDR, like Medtech, Signature Solutions which David referred to on top of specialized sales forces and medical training and education. So Those are the types of investments that we're able to make while delivering on our EPS and we think that is the smart investment to make and really positions us well going into 2017 with that accelerating topline.","David Lewis","And then David, just thinking about your comments on growth, both on a conference call for LDR as well as this morning, I don't want to put the cart before the horse here, we're only halfway through the year and organic growth is moving in the right direction. It just seems like when you're talking about relative to the other businesses, first half of the year was Recon stability; second half of the year was all the improvement other businesses like SET and spine.","It just feels like if this momentum continues over the next two quarters, you should exceed the top end of your organic guidance range and I guess, I'm trying to take your qualitative momentum commentary with the guidance. You think there's a lot of momentum, I think if that carries forward, you do better than the top end of the guidance. Is this just baby steps or is there anything you can think of, either in Recon or other businesses that potentially are headwinds in the back half of the year that we may not be thinking about relative to the momentum that looks obvious?","David Dvorak","There really isn't anything that is significant in our minds. Obviously, the world's a dynamic place but we're lining up the sequential quarters of improvement. It's a big business so points of growth are meaningful numbers. I think we're being prudent about the pace of improvement, David, between now and the end of the year and what's really important to us is to make sure that we're doing this methodically so that it leads to a sustainable and durable growth rate on the topline as we exit 2016 and into 2017.","Again, you look at the clean view of the organic growth rate that we spoke about and you've got nice steps that are contemplated for both Q3 and Q4 and then that creates a nice jump off point for 2017 which is absolutely consistent with what we came into the year, articulating we would accomplish.","David Lewis","Okay and then David, just one last thing on just the environment. Relative to pricing, it was a little worse this quarter but frankly, it's still tracking at lower rates than we've seen over the last few years. Are we at a new normal level for pricing that is a little better or is it just simply too early to tell? Thank you and I'll jump back in queue.","David Dvorak","Sure, David. I think it's too early to tell, notwithstanding the fact that it is the case that over the course of the last three quarters, we've been on the lower end of the range of what we've seen for the last 2.5 years. The 2.5-year range for us, at least, has been pretty tight. It has been minus 1, to minus 2, so three quarters in a row, closer to that minus 1 but that's not a refinement that I would tell you is something that you ought to set into your thinking for the market that we're operating with and the only other thing I would tell you is, it is the case with this broad portfolio that we have a lot of opportunities to position products and technologies and proven projects and technologies that, that. meet those customer demands.","So that obviously helps us manage price and I'm optimistic that whatever the market environment takes us to, that we're going to be in a nice position to perform at a good level in that context that we're operating within.","Operator","Mr. Matt Taylor from Barclays. Please go ahead with your question, sir.","Young Li","This is actually Young Li in for Matt. I guess first on the spine business, just the LDR acquisition, is scale becoming even more important as hospitals consolidate vendors and do you now believe you have the scale to effectively compete? If not, how much bigger do you think you need to get? Thanks.","David Dvorak","Yes, we absolutely are in a position with the LDR combination to compete effectively in the marketplace. I think that scale does matter. Scale matters as it relates to the completeness of one's product portfolio. It matters relative to your capability to build out a first-class sales force on a global basis. It matters in your ability to continuously reinvest in the business, research and development and avoid product gaps and have a nice mix of the more me-too oriented products so you don't have a hole as well as some of the things that are more aggressively going after addressing unmet needs.","The Medtech acquisition would be an example of the latter, the Mobi-C products within the LDR portfolio would be a good example of the latter. So we're absolutely in a position where we're going to be able to compete effectively. I do think that it is going to become increasingly the case where, with the consolidation of customers and their desire to eliminate large numbers of vendors and consolidate themselves, that the one-stop shop provider.","And not only are we going to be to do that, but spine business, we're doing that across musculoskeletal service lines as a whole. And I think that you'll see a continuing trend towards that within the marketplace and it obviously plays to our advantage.","Young Li","Maybe a macro question just on market conditions. You mentioned it's grown at a steady pace. I heard your comments to some of the questions earlier as well but can you just maybe comment on how sustainable this trend can be?","David Dvorak","I think very sustainable. If you bump around from one quarter to the next, like I said, there can be some billing day differences, someday mix differences but look, at the end of the day, though, population globally is aging. The need for these procedures is growing, that is unmistakable. This is in the case of large joints. The only solution for someone in advanced stage osteoarthritis in these procedures work and that underlying demand is just not going to change.","You can forecast out the numbers and see how that percentage of the population that's aging and the period where there are more likely to need a total joint is going to continue to grow for years to come. So to us, that's the basis upon which we make our business decisions as opposed to bumping around from one quarter to the next with minor variations and growth rates.","The dynamics are quite stable; the union or the unit demand, the pricing environment that we've been in and to the extent that there is going to be any change in the United States market, for example, the movement towards a more value-based environment for reimbursement, we're going to have the broadest of service offerings and the most cohesive capability to come in and partner more deeply with our customers to help them address their needs across that episode of care. So we like the operating environment.","Operator","Mr. Kyle Rose from Canaccord. Please go ahead with your question, sir.","Kyle Rose","I echo the statements on a strong Q2. Wanted to touch a little bit more on a macro perspective in the U.S.. I think about two years ago, certainly less, as Zimmer launched the be Z23, the outpatient-focused programs. I wondered if you could give us updates on not necessarily that program specifically but just as the development of the outpatient market.","Where you think that could shift for the next three to five years, just from a percent of procedures moving to the outpatient. And then also saw that at CMS, in their proposed rule, is opening up commentary for potentially allowing for reimbursement of total joints in the Medicare population. So just s any thoughts on the macro overall and then what that could potentially mean if CMS does cover it moving forward?","David Dvorak","Sure, yes, the concept of that program, as you'll recall, Kyle, is healthy patient, sick knee. So if you think about it whether it's that particular setting or the broader movement towards value-based reimbursement, these are all driven by the same trends, aging population, these providers of the solutions being pushed to do it more cost effectively than ever. And I think that our Z23 Program, Signature Solutions, are specifically designed to shape that solution and we've had good success with that program.","We're ready to expand that program and do more with it and it is very integrated into our Signature Solutions offering because it is meeting the same demands that these customers are facing. So it just stands to reason that for the right patient, that the capability to get them in and out of the hospital, to avoid the potential of high-risk consequences or readmissions in the form of nosocomial infections. They can be more pervasive in an acute care setting, they got to be doing those procedures outside of the acute care setting.","There are many, many patients where you're not going to be able to do that for the foreseeable future so I think that the providers understand that, that is an opportunity. It is a message that has resonated well with the surgeons. It is a small percentage today; it's going to grow. I hesitate to predict where that lands. I think that, that really needs to be driven by the way the patients present.","And I think that's part of the work that needs to be done is to very carefully refine which patients are qualified for that setting and those that aren't but again, the data that we're going to be able to generate over a reasonable time period with our Signature Solutions effort is going to be part of what allows us to make those informed decisions and to continuously refine the model because it's end to end, so we will be building data in through the Z23 program, Signature Solutions and that's going to allow diagnosis and care pathway decisions to be made on a better informed basis than those decisions have ever been made in the past.","Kyle Rose","And then just last one on just M&A thoughts, we've seen a couple of tuck-in acquisitions and then with Cayenne and the Medtech, the Rosa deal, but some bigger ones as well with LDR, just talk about your appetite for continued investments over the back half of the year and what we should expect?","David Dvorak","We think that we've done a nice job of landing meaningful transactions to continue to execute our strategy and to us, we do that strategic planning work and identify areas where we can create value in areas of need and irrespective of whether that ends of being solved or addressed through internal or external development, that it's all part of the same program. And it just so happened that many of those efforts came together in that Q2 time period and as Q2 closed out, we moved into Q3 so I wouldn't expect that pace to be continuing into the second half of the year but we're always going to be evaluating these opportunities.","We've got terrific chances to get after building out the innovation pipeline and executing on that and I think that, that is going to carry us into 2017 nicely. And as we digest those and look forward obviously, you get past a year, year-and-a-half and the cash that we're going to be generating as a business is going to put us in a great position to go on and do more, including potentially significant ones. But I think you ought to think about us as feeling good about what we have under the umbrella right now and focused on exploiting the opportunities that have come with the deals that we've done over the last couple of years largely.","Mike Marshall","We have time for one additional question.","Operator","Mr. Joanne Wuensch from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question.","Joanne Wuensch","Two questions, actually. I just want to confirm that the change in the tax accounting adds about $0.04 to the year; is that the right way to think about it?","Dan Florin","JoAnne, this is Dan. For the first half of the year, it adds $0.03, a $0.01 in Q1 and $0.02 in Q2. We would estimate the back half to be about an incremental $0.01 so that's about right, $0.04 for the full year.","Joanne Wuensch","And then I was really interested in your commentary regarding sales force buildout, not just in your specialized targeted sales forces but also in your large joint that you've seen increases. Can you qualitatively talk about how your sales force looks this year versus this time last year, when everybody was worried about defections and departures? Thanks.","David Dvorak","Very stabilized foundationally, JoAnne, across the globe. And obviously we have a long period of time between signing and consummating the Biomet deal to do that planning work but then you're standing by aggressively until the deal closes and I think our commercial leaders did an outstanding job in the second half of 2015 of executing those plans. And it created some significant opportunities as we appointed leaders then to sort out the product portfolio and the customers being covered by reps to start to build greater emphasis in the non-large joint categories where appropriate and we took advantage of that opportunity.","And then we started to build the pipeline of recruiting of new reps that would be able to fully exploit the opportunities, particularly outside of large joints. So that pipeline got built towards the end of last year, those positions were brought on and obviously, it takes time for those reps to become productive. So I think in Q2, you're just seeing the early signs of that productivity. It's going to continue into the second half of the year but this is going to be a dynamic that is forever for us with the critical mass scale, competitiveness of our portfolios across all product categories and our innovation pipeline and capability to make a difference with service lines, like Signature Solutions, going forward, integrating all of this. We're going to continuously build out that sales force and that's going to be a real strength for the organization going forward on a global basis.","So the local leaders are going to make these decisions as to what level of specialization they need because they're closest to the opportunity and the customers and where it makes sense because it is a less populated environment for the call point is overlapping. And then we will have the same rep going after that business to the extent that the call point is more separated and it is a highly populated area. You should expect to see us with more specialization in those markets. But we've made tremendous progress in this regard in both the first and the second quarter and we'll continue to execute that plan going forward.","David Dvorak","Thanks again, Joanne. So with that, I would like to thank everyone for joining the call today and for your continued interest and support for Zimmer.

I would like to turn the call over to Bob Marshall, Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer. Mr. Marshall, you may begin your call.","Bob Marshall","Thank you, Anna. Good morning and welcome to Zimmer Biomet\u2019s Fourth Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. I\u2019m here with our CEO, David Dvorak; and our CFO, Dan Florin.","Before we start, I\u2019d like to remind you that our discussions during this call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings for a detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties. Also, the discussions during this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included within the earnings release, which is available on our website at investor.zimmerbiomet.com.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to David.","David Dvorak","Thanks, Bob. This morning, I will review our results for the fourth quarter and full year, as well as key highlights from our performance. Dan will then provide additional financial details and discuss our 2017 guidance. As we reflect on 2016, our accomplishments reinforce our confidence that Zimmer Biomet remains well-positioned to maximize long-term value creation for our stockholders.","Throughout the year, we made strategic investments to further broaden and diversify our musculoskeletal portfolio, including the introduction of more than 50 new clinical technology solutions and services. These commercial introductions have both enhanced our core offerings and expanded our presence across the full continuum and episode of care.","Investments in our spine business in 2016 have added differentiated technologies such as the Mobi-C cervical disc prosthesis, which positions us to increase our share in the $10 billion global spine market. Among other exciting additions, we also strengthened our presence in sports medicine with the strategic acquisition of Cayenne Medical, which has expanded our offering of soft tissue repair and reconstructive solutions to address the $18 billion S.E.T. market. And importantly, as we noted in mid-December, during the fourth quarter, we continued to make progress towards enhancing and improving our supply chain, and manufacturing and quality systems.","We anticipate continued progress towards the replenishment of safety stocks on key cross-sell products throughout the first half of 2017, which will position us for accelerated top-line growth during the second half of the year.","Looking ahead, we remain committed to clinically relevant innovation and commercial excellence as key drivers of our growth. We\u2019ll continue billing out our specialized global sales forces in 2017 to capture growth opportunities in attractive market categories. To that end, we look forward to extending the release of Zimmer Biomet Signature Solutions in 2017. This integrated offering is the first suite of end-to-end services, uniquely designed to enhance patient outcomes in musculoskeletal procedures while capturing pre-operative efficiencies and care episode cost savings. And as part of Zimmer Biomet\u2019s Signature Solutions, we will remain focused on the expansion and enhancement of our industry-leading intelligent instrumentation options, which in 2016 were utilized in nearly 100,000 procedures worldwide.","Before I review our performance, I\u2019d like to briefly comment on fourth quarter and full year market conditions.","During 2016, global musculoskeletal markets exhibited stability with the slight acceleration in the fourth quarter. With regard to pricing, we experienced negative price pressure of 2.0% for the fourth quarter and 1.5% for the full year, consistent with our expectations and prevailing trends over the past several years. I would also like to note that we had approximately one less billing day in the quarter, compared to the fourth quarter of 2015, which reduced our consolidated growth by approximately 140 basis points. The billing day difference is varied by geographic segment with the Americas and Europe, Middle East and Africa regions each having one less billing day. There was essentially no impact in the Asia Pacific region. The impact of this billing day difference is not reflected in the growth rates I\u2019ll be providing by segments and category.","During the fourth quarter, we drove improved top-line growth across our portfolio, finishing the year with the revenue performance more in line with our original expectations for 2016. Our solid performance was supported by the reacceleration of our core knee and hip categories, as well as the ongoing strength of our S.E.T. category in Asia Pacific sales region.","Consolidated net sales were $2.13 billion for the fourth quarter, an increase over the prior year period of 4.4%, including approximately 230 basis points with contribution from the recently acquired LDR Holding Corporation.","Our performance in the U.S. accelerated by 320 basis points on a comparable basis, relative to the third quarter, which supported a 5.3% sales increase in the Americas over the prior year period. In the Asia Pacific region, we also delivered 5.3% quarterly sales growth and our revenues increased by 1.5% in Europe, Middle East, and Africa.","Full year sales for 2016 were $7.680 billion, an increase of 3.4% over 2015 constant currency adjusted pro forma results, which included approximately 110 basis points of contribution from LDR.","Zimmer Biomet\u2019s knee business grew sales by 1.8% in the fourth quarter, reflecting positive volume and mix of 3.7% and negative price of 1.9%. These results were supported by contributions from each of our sales geographies, led by the Asia Pacific region, which delivered solid 5.2% revenue growth over the prior year period. Our Europe, Middle East and Africa region grew sales by 2.9% over the prior year period, and sales increased by 0.6% in the Americas region.","Importantly, focused execution within our knee supply chain and commercial teams during the quarter allowed us to make progress towards meeting a significant market demand for Persona, the Personalized Knee System. In addition, we continued to achieve sales growth across our complete port folio of knee solutions, highlighted by the exceptional performance of our Oxford Partial Knee System and solid results for our Orthopedic Salvage System.","Going forward, we will continue diversifying our knee offerings with differentiated new technologies to further complement this market-leading portfolio.","Hip sales increased by 2.9% in the fourth quarter, including positive volume and mix of 5.2%, and negative price of 2.3%. Our Asia Pacific region delivered noteworthy hip growth during the quarter, increasing sales by 7.1% over the prior year period. We grew sales by 2.4% in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region and by 1.7% in the Americas.","Our improved hip growth was highlighted by the ongoing strength of our G7 Acetabular System, including the successful expanded introduction of the G7 Dual Mobility Construct as well as the Taperloc Complete Hip Stem and the Arcos Femoral Revision System. We were also pleased by market demand for hip constructs to leverage our proprietary OsseoTi Porous Metal Technology and Vitamin E infused advanced bearing materials. As we continue working to accelerate our global hip performance, we remain bullish on our broad and clinically proven portfolio of personalized hip solutions.","Our S.E.T. business completed a noteworthy 2016, with solid fourth quarter results, delivering a 6.6% year-over-year sales increase. Our surgical business has continued to benefit from our growing emphasis on sales force specialization. In sports medicine, demand for our proprietary Subchondroplasty procedure and Gel-One Cross-linked Hyaluronate injection remain strong.","Our upper extremities portfolio also continued to deliver growth with increased demand for the comprehensive Total Shoulder System and the Nexel Total Elbow. And in trauma, our progress throughout the quarter and full year were supported by the steady sales performance of versatile and trusted solutions such as our NCB Periprosthetic Femur Plating System, AFFIXUS Hip Fracture Nail System and DVR Crosslock Distal Radius Plating System. We believe our global S.E.T business will continue to meaningfully contribute to our long-term growth.","Our dental category sales decrease 8.6% compared to the prior year period. We are working to improve our dental performance in 2017. The global dental implant market remains an attractive opportunity with the mid single-digit growth rate profile. We\u2019ll remain focused on innovating and repositioning our dental portfolio including the commercialization of multi-tiered offerings for the evolving global marketplace.","Spine, craniomaxillofacial and thoracic sales increased by 29.1% for the fourth quarter, with stable underlying spine performance in total, and continued growth in CMF and thoracic. Within our spine business, the Mobi-C Cervical Disc prosthesis continued to deliver excellent sales growth in the quarter. This highly differentiated product is now the most widely covered device for one and two level cervical disc replacement by commercial health insurers in the United States.","We\u2019ve also been pleased with the ongoing acceleration of our innovative Vitality Spinal Fixation System and all-inclusive pedicle screw platform for complex thoracolumbar procedures. As we finalize the integration of the commercial channel in 2017, we believe our spine teams will be well-positioned to capitalize on these and other promising opportunities among our competitive spinal offerings.","Turning to craniomaxillofacial and thoracic, this business completed the year on another quarter of solid growth. Our SternaLock Blu and SternaLock 360 primary closure systems continued to drive growth as well as the RibFix Blu Thoracic Fixation System. In 2017, we look forward to introducing differentiated expansions to our craniomaxillofacial and thoracic portfolio.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Dan, who will continue this discussion in greater detail as well as review our guidance. Dan?","Dan Florin","Thank you, David. I will review our fourth quarter performance in more detail and then provide additional information related to our first quarter and full-year 2017 financial guidance.","As David discussed, we were pleased with the sequential improvement of our global large joint business, along with continued steady performance by our S.E.T. business, which posted 8% constant currency day rate growth. While product supply constraints remain, our performance in the quarter reflects excellent coordination and execution by our operations and commercial teams to effectively deploy inventory and instrument sets to fulfill strong demand from our existing customer base. We were also able to deliver an incremental $10 million of international tenders and distributor stocking orders that had previously been forecasted for the third quarter.","Transitioning now to the balance of our fourth quarter financial performance, our adjusted gross profit margin was 74.6% for the quarter, which was 100 basis points lower when compared to the prior year adjusted results. The decrease was driven by the impact of fewer gains from our cash flow hedging program due to unfavorable year-over-year contract effective rates as well as average selling price declines, offset in part by a reduction in the medical device tax expense recognized in the quarter as compared to the prior year period.","Selling general and administrative expenses were $756 million in the fourth quarter at 37.6% of sales, a 20 basis-point increase compared to the prior year period. As anticipated, ongoing investments in our specialized sales forces, and medical training and education programs combined with the inclusion of our recent acquisitions, offset the benefit of SG&A cost synergies in the quarter. I\u2019m pleased to report that we met our commitment of delivering cumulative net EBIT merger synergies of $225 million by the end of 2016.","In the quarter, the Company recorded pretax charges of approximately $523 million in special items, primarily related to the Biomet acquisition and integration related expenses. Adjusted fourth quarter 2016 figures in the earnings release exclude the impact of these charges which include $243 million of non-cash amortization inventory step-up and brand rationalization charges; $145 million related to integration activities; a net $53 million of debt extinguishment costs; and $38 million of quality remediation expenses. A full reconciliation of reported net earnings to adjusted net earnings is included in this morning\u2019s press release.","Adjusted operating profit in the quarter was $650.7 million or 32.3% of sales, a 140 basis-point decrease when compared to the prior year period due to the lower gross margin rate as well as the expected impact from acquisitions, somewhat offset by Biomet cost synergies. Net interest expense and other for the quarter totaled $94.5 million, consistent with expectations.","Adjusted net earnings were $434.1 million for the quarter, an increase of 1.3% compared to the prior year period. Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 2.4% to $2.14 on 202.5 million average outstanding fully diluted shares. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency, adjusted diluted earnings per share increased approximately 6% in the quarter.","Our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 22% due to a favorable mix of geographic earnings and profits, as well as some discrete items. Our reported effective tax rate for the quarter was negative 103%, due primarily to favorable discrete items. The Company had approximately 200.6 million shares of common stock outstanding as of December 31, 2016, a decrease from 202.7 million shares outstanding as of December 31, 2015.","Operating cash flow for the quarter totaled $627 million, an increase of 42% over $441 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. This result includes $105 million of cash expenditures for acquisition integrations and initiatives related to our synergy program.","Free cash flow in the fourth quarter was $478 million, which was $167 million higher than the fourth quarter of 2015. Our full year of free cash flow of $1.1 billion was in line with our guidance. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $149 million including $94 million for instruments and $55 million for property, plant and equipment.","During the quarter, the Company repaid $310 million in total on our term loan and certain of our outstanding U.S. dollar senior notes, bringing the year-to-date repayment total of Biomet acquisition debt to $1.01 billion. Our gross leverage ratio at December 31st was 3.8 times.","I would like to turn now to our guidance. I will provide revenue and earnings per share guidance for both the first quarter and the full year. Additionally, I will review our guidance for operating and free cash flow in 2017.","Moving now to our market assumptions for 2017, we believe the musculoskeletal markets in which we participate will grow approximately 3%, similar to 2016 when global market conditions remains relatively stable. With regard to price, we forecast a decline of approximately 2%, consistent with the range experienced over the last several years.","As David mentioned earlier, we expect to make substantial progress in remediating supply constraints during the first half of this year as we prioritize production for key cross-sell brands, clear our back orders and restore safety stocks. As part of our effort to implement certain regulatory compliance enhancements, we are making operational process improvements in one of our major production facilities. As such, effective products may experience temporary and occasional distribution delays while we implement and validate these enhanced processes and generate the necessary supporting records.","Our continued progress towards restoring full supply expected during the second quarter will enable our commercial teams to service existing customers and also resume executing against the full potential of our broad and diverse portfolio. As such, we expect constant currency year-over-year revenue growth to improve as we progress through 2017, particularly in the second half of the year.","Now, turning to our guidance for the full year. We estimate revenue growth to be in the range of 2.2% to 3.2%. Foreign exchange is expected to decrease revenues by 1.5%, primarily driven by the strengthening U.S. dollar. Taken together, constant currency revenue growth is expected to be in the range of 3.7% to 4.7%, inclusive of 120 basis points of contribution from the LDR transaction. In dollar terms, revenues are expected to be in the range of $7.855 billion to $7.930 billion.","Regarding Biomet net EBIT synergies, we remain confident in realizing our cumulative target of $350 million by mid-2018 with approximately $310 million of cumulative net benefit achieved by year-end 2017. This reflects $85 million of incremental synergies in the 2017 P&L, compared to 2016.","As you move down the income statement for 2017, assuming currency rates remain near recent levels, we expect our adjusted gross margin rate to be approximately 75%. This takes into account, the impact of approximately 100 basis points of lower year-over-year effective rates on our foreign currency hedges, in line with our recent disclosures. This headwind is expected to be partially offset by net synergy benefits and cost of goods along with the full annual P&L benefit realization and the suspended medical device excise tax. The incremental benefit to gross margin during the year is estimated at $30 million, which we are reinvesting in R&D, our quality excellence initiative and other programs to drive longer-term growth opportunities.","We expect R&D expense for the year to be approximately 4.5% of sales to support our goal to drive differentiated innovation across the continuum and episode of care. SG&A is expected to be approximately 37.5% of sales, compared to 38.2% in 2016, as we continue to realize efficiencies from our synergy initiatives and also further leverage expected revenue growth.","Assuming interest rates remain near recent levels, we expect net interest and other expense to be in the range of $335 to $340 million. This incorporates our planned debt repayments throughout 2017 and the benefits associated with our balance sheet activity during 2016. We anticipate an adjusted effective tax rate to be approximately 22.5%, which represents a reduction compared to the 23.5% rate in 2016. This reduction is driven by projected manufacturing and sales geographic mix as well as a realization of several tax integration initiatives expected during the year.","We anticipate the full year diluted weighted average shares outstanding to be approximately 204 million shares including the impact of anticipated dilution from employee equity program. The Company is not forecasting or intending to repurchase shares during 2017.","Pretax non-cash intangible amortization is expected to be approximately $600 million for the full year 2017. Additional charges include estimated inventory step up of $50 million and special items of approximately $530 million. Therefore including these charges, our full year diluted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $4.37 to $4.67. Excluding these charges, full year adjusted diluted earnings per share is expected to be in a range of $8.50 to $8.68. This represents adjusted earnings per share growth of between 7% and 9% over 2016. Adjusting for foreign exchange, adjusted earnings per share growth is expected to be in a range between 12% and 14%, which compares to 17% growth in 2016 over 2015 results on a similar basis.","Turning to cash flow, we anticipate 2017 operating cash flows to be in a range of $1.75 billion to $1.9 billion. Significant areas of investment included in our operating cash flows are $310 million of outflows in support of our Biomet synergy program and other acquisition integration activities, as well as approximately $170 million of cost to harmonize and optimize our supply chain and manufacturing and quality systems.","Total capital expenditures for the year are expected to be approximately $500 million inclusive of instrument capital of $330 million. Free cash flow is therefore expected to be in a range of $1.250 million to $1.400 million. Our guidance assumes that we will continue to delever our balance sheet with planned repayments during 2017, exiting the year with a leverage ratio that keeps us on pace, toward our goal of approximately 2.5 times at the end of 2018. The Company anticipates that substantially all of its free cash flows will be used to facilitate our deleveraging goals alongside maintaining our dividend program.","Regarding guidance for the first quarter, we estimate revenue growth to be in a range of 2.4% to 3.4%. Foreign exchange is expected to decrease revenues by 1.3%. Taken together, constant currency revenue growth is expected to be in a range of 3.7% to 4.7% inclusive of 220 basis points of contribution from the LDR transaction. In dollar terms, revenues are expected to be in a range of $1.950 billion to $1.970 billion.","The first quarter revenue estimate contains approximately 150 basis points of headwind from our supply constraints. However, as I noted earlier, we expect this headwind to abate as the year progresses. Therefore, estimated constant currency growth rate for the second half of the year is expected to be in a range of 3% to 4.5%. Also in the first quarter, we expect gross margin and operating expense margin ratios to be similar to those embedded in our full year guidance. Our adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter is expected to be approximately 23%.","Diluted shares outstanding are estimated to be in a range of 203 million to 203.5 million shares for the quarter. Pretax non-cash intangible amortization is expected to approximately $150 million. Additional charges include estimated inventory step-up of $20 million and special items of approximately $150 million. Therefore, including these charges, diluted earnings per share are expected to be in a range of $0.91 to $1.01. And finally, excluding these charges, we expect adjusted earnings per share to be in a range between $2.08 and $2.13.","David, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to you.","David Dvorak","Thanks, Dan.","In 2016, Zimmer Biomet continued to enhance our leadership position through the execution of a consistent strategy that emphasizes growth through innovation, in addition to commercial and operational excellence, and disciplined capital management. Guided by these priorities, Zimmer Biomet is uniquely positioned to drive long-term growth and value for our stockholders, while delivering life changing clinical solutions that meet the unique needs of patients, providers, and healthcare systems.","And now, I would like to ask Anna to begin the Q&A portion of our call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll go first to David Lewis from Morgan Stanley.","David Lewis","David, I want to kind of start with the key question, which is sort of the fourth quarter performance and some of the third quarter disconnect. So, I think in third quarter, you said your hope was to stabilize your share I think in the first quarter and get back to market growth in the second quarter. But, by our math, you basically held share in the fourth quarter, but there were some tenders and maybe some third quarter pull-through. So, could you sort of talk about this notion of sort of getting back to sort of in line with market grow by the second quarter, even though you did a little better in the first quarter and your confidence in getting there over the next couple of quarters? And then I have a couple of follow-ups.","David Dvorak","Yes, we had executed well in the fourth quarter. And the communications and coordination between those supply chain operations, logistics, leaders, teams and commercial channel, David, was very well done in the quarter. That obviously led to a strong performance sequentially from Q3 to Q4 in some key areas, the large joint reconstructive business improved in a significant way, closed the gap relative to market in the case of knees, probably exceeded the market on a global basis in the case of hips. S.E.T. continued to perform very well. Asia Pacific continued to perform very well also.","There is about a $10 million tender that otherwise would have landed in our Q3 numbers, but for the supply challenges ultimately was fulfilled in Q4. So, you can adjust those two quarter numbers as well as relevant jump off point from Q4 into 2017 accordingly. And then also, it appears that the market stepped up, round number is 100 basis points in large joints; and obviously with our share of the large joint market that were daunted [ph] to our benefit in the fourth quarter. So, I would think of our Q1 guidance as being a consistent performance subject to the market and the tender adjustment that I just mentioned in Q4 as we entered 2017. And we continue to make progress on the supply front. So that\u2019s going to position us to replenish the safety stocks in some of these key cross-sell brands in the first half of the year and position ourselves for accelerated growth in the second half of the year.","David Lewis","Okay, very clear, David, and just maybe two quick follow-ups. The S.E.T.\u2019s franchise for you, that was the real highlight in the back half of 2016. Can you talk about your confidence and S.E.T.\u2019s momentum in 2017 and the perhaps ability for spine to start to show that kind of momentum. And then for Dan just on non-GAAP adjustments, a little heavier in the fourth quarter, can you just talk us about charges in 2017 relative to 2016 and the ability to generate free cash expectations? And I\u2019ll jump back in queue. Thanks so much.","David Dvorak","Thanks, David. I\u2019ll take the first question. The S.E.T. business performance, as you said, improved sequentially from the beginning of 2016 through the end of the year. And when you adjust for billing days in the case of the fourth quarter, that performance is around 8%. So, we did have a really nice performance in the second half of the year. And we think that that is sustainable as it relates to S.E.T business\u2019s strong product portfolios by virtue of the combination of Zimmer with Biomet, skilled allows us to build out specialized sales forces which we began in 2016 in earnest and will continue in 2017. And then, a strong pipeline of products, all of that augmented by some of the bolt-on acquisition deals that we did such as Cayenne in 2016. So, we like the runway.","And it\u2019s important to note that when you add up the markets that those businesses serve, it\u2019s about an $18 billion portion of the $50 billion musculoskeletal market. So, it will be a growth driver into the future for us. And we\u2019re just as optimistic as we complete the commercial channel integration in 2017 of the LDR acquisition that we\u2019re going to be in a position with a much stronger spine portfolio to position that business similarly going forward.","Dan Florin","And then, David, in terms of special charges for 2017, in my prepared remarks, I talked about just over $500 million of cash special items which should be outside of the amortization and inventory step-up. The biggest components inside of that would be continued spend related to the Biomet integration, our synergy program, as well as the integration of our 2016 acquisition. So, think of that in the neighborhood of about $300 million in 2017. That will substantially step down in 2018. And then, the other component in 2017 is tied to the quality remediation program, which has about $170 million of spend associated with it in 2017.","Operator","Next, we\u2019ll go to Mike Weinstein with JP Morgan.","Mike Weinstein","Thank you, and hope you guys have a good morning. I wanted to start if we could, just on the cadence of expectations in 2017. I think you laid it out pretty much as we were expecting. Although I think, I would say, it\u2019s a little bit better. The first quarter, effectively, you\u2019re guiding to 1.5% to 2.5% organic; and then the expectation is that you get to 3% to 4.5% in the second half of the year. So, number one, do I have that right? And then, second, on the second quarter, should we assume that the 150 basis-point headwind that you highlighted in the first quarter from the ongoing supply constraints will be fully resolved? So, how do we think about 2Q? Thanks.","Dan Florin","Okay, Mike. First, you have the first quarter, correct, so excluding LDR, 1.5% to 2.5% [indiscernible] as well. So, that\u2019s correct. And the 3% to 4.5% growth in the back half of the year does obviously reflect acceleration as a result of the supply improvement. I characterized the second quarter as having some residual supply impact, but not as much that the 150 basis points that we have in the first quarter. So, some improvement as we progress through Q2. We\u2019re not giving the sales range for Q2, but you can expect some acceleration in Q2 relative to Q1","Mike Weinstein","Understood. And then, the second topic, I think that everybody would like to touch on would be the Warsaw facility in the 483s. David, you made some indirect reference to it. Can you just talk about the efforts there including the expected spend in order to help us off some of these issues in 2017? Thanks.","David Dvorak","Sure, Mike. Obviously, the manufacture and distribution of the highest quality products is the top priority for our organization. And as part of the integration and our ongoing quality excellence efforts, even apart from the integration, we have been and continue to work to harmonize and optimize our manufacturing and quality systems. So, the observations that came out recent inspection in Q4 in the Warsaw north facility, so legacy Biomet facility, those matters are ones that we take very seriously. We have submitted our written response to the Form 483 observations and developed immediately and are already executing remediation plans to fully address those issues. That work will continue into next year. And I would tell you that the reference that Dan made to some of the expenditures include our efforts to harmonize and optimize those quality systems and fully address those observations. So that installment is part of the $170 million that Dan referenced for 2017. And as I said that work on a broad basis that facility included but not exclusively that facility, will continue on in 2018.","Mike Weinstein","So that $170 million to optimize the supply chain, how much of that runs through the P&L?","Dan Florin","So, Mike, what we\u2019re doing is to the extent we are incurring remediation expenses, that\u2019s running through as a special charge to the extent we are making permanent investments in the quality infrastructure and manufacturing overhead infrastructure; that\u2019s running through the adjusted P&L.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Bob Hopkins with Bank of America - Merrill Lynch.","Bob Hopkins","So, two questions. I wanted to follow up on Mike\u2019s question but before that I wanted to make sure that I ask David a bigger picture question, heading into AAOS this year because obviously there has been a lot of discussion in the marketplace around Stryker\u2019s make a robotic system. And so, I just want to get your updated views on robotics for total knees. Has your opinion on the knee for Zimmer Biomet to have a robotic knee, changed since last year\u2019s AAOS? I just want to get an update from you on that topic, since it\u2019s such a point of interest for investors?","David Dvorak","Yes. Bob, we continue to make significant investments and be very engaged in the development of intelligent instrumentation. We started that journey over 10 years ago with the acquisition of ORTHOsoft. And as I referenced in my prepared remarks this morning, in 2016, our portfolio of intelligent instrumentation were deployed in nearly 100,000 cases. So that includes signature, patient specific instruments, our ISS technology, our e-liver [ph] technology et cetera.","Last year\u2019s acquisition of Medtech with their ROSA robotics platform adds just another tool in technology to our kit. And to the extent that there are anatomical sites that that technology can be applied to in a manner that satisfies three key conditions in our view, improves the quality of the outcome; enhances the efficiencies from a cost standpoint; and drives throughput, patient volume through those providers\u2019 ORs, then those would be applications that we would look to develop and commercialize off of that ROSA platform. So, you can rest assure that to the extent that those conditions are satisfied through our internal development that any other anatomical site would be serviced with that technology.","And going forward, as I said, I think that these technologies are going to be big difference makers. I think the reproducibility and enhancing the patient outcomes and patient satisfaction levels are going to be well-served. And what I just described is all underneath the broader end-to-end set of services and suite that we refer to as Zimmer Biomet Signature Solutions. And I would point you to this year\u2019s academy in March because we\u2019re going to have a further unveiling of those offerings as we move into a broader commercial launch of the Signature Solutions platform.","Bob Hopkins","So, two quick follow-ups, one, just to clarify. So, does that mean that you are developing a robot for total knees? And then, as the other follow-up I wanted to ask was just back on the original question. I just wanted to get your view, David, on just generally how comfortable are you that the 483 won\u2019t lead to further regulatory action? And is that $170 million all kind of -- should we view that as all incremental capitalized spending addressing this issue or are there other things captured with that $170 million? Thank you.","David Dvorak","So, on the former, obviously, Bob, if we have an internal development project in the specific area, we\u2019ll reveal that when it make sense from a competitive standpoint, and we are prepared to begin the marketing of any application or technology. So that will come with time to the extent that there is a launch in an application in that particular anatomical site. We are comfortable that we have the right remediation plan, the right quality excellence plan that we are engaged in executing. No one can give absolute assurance as to what follow-on activities may come from any agency, but we believe in the plan, we are communicating openly with the agency, and we\u2019ll continue to do so until all those issues are fully addressed. And the spend category, it\u2019s part of a broader quality system and operational harmonization effort, but there is a significant amount of spend on that particular site within that number.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Matt Taylor with Barclays.","Matt Taylor","So, I guess the first thing that I wanted to just follow up on was looking at the spending that you\u2019re making around the programs with regards to harmonizing and optimizing the supply chain. I guess, could you just reconcile how that compares to disclosures at the end of the third quarter? And you talked about a few things that were necessary to really catch up in terms of supply and harmonize your ability to demand forecast and really prevent the issues that happened in the third quarter from happening again. I guess, I\u2019m just trying to discern sort of A, how that implementation went; and then B, kind of what\u2019s new or what\u2019s the new learning and spending area that\u2019s occurred over the last 90 days since your prior initiatives were started?","Dan Florin","Sure, Matt. This is Dan. First, with respect to Q3, the Q3 impact had nothing to do with the remediation activity and in the North Campus. So, the Q3 supply issue was in fact a combination of supply chain integration. We talked about the lack of an integrated demand planning and production planning system combined with a significant mix shift of key cross-sell brands, and that disconnect of supply and demand resulted in the Q3 miss. We\u2019ve continued to make excellent progress on implementing better processes and tools to enable a best in class supply chain. We are not complete yet, but we are making really good progress with that. So that was really the Q3 issue.","Embedded in our Q4 guidance, we did contemplate some impact from the FDA inspection. And as David has described, we have now submitted our responses; we\u2019ve quantified the cost to remediate that; we\u2019ll update our disclosures accordingly. We had disclosures back in November as well as December with respect to that FDA inspection and we\u2019ll update our disclosures in our periodic filings. So the $170 million as David just said is substantially -- there is a substantial element of that that\u2019s tied to that remediation, and that will continue into 2018.","Matt Taylor","Okay. I think that\u2019s clear. And then, I guess secondly, when you talk about the revenue progression through the year, you mentioned once you have close to full supply in 2Q, you can start to execute on the portfolio again. I guess, I\u2019m wondering after the shortage and having to service your existing customers, not go after new ones. I mean, how much does that hamper your ability to capture some of that share in future periods? And maybe, you could talk a little bit about once your supply is fully free, how you think you\u2019ll do relative to some of the other competition out there?","David Dvorak","Sure. I\u2019m highly confident, Matt, in our ability to compete as we restore those safety stocks. And some of those product lines will get to that position sooner rather than later; some of them that pushes out into deeper into Q2. And this is a general matter, we would see in the weeks and months ahead the beginnings of that prospect funnel filling back up and then ripening into competitive conversions as we enter the second half of the year. So, it really is a continuum as opposed to snapping a line at the end of Q2 and only then beginning to redevelop and refill that competitive funnel of opportunities.","So, as we look forward, Dan\u2019s references to some of the improvements that have already been implemented, that\u2019s really outside of the North Campus supply challenges we\u2019ve seen pretty significant improvement. Those product lines are already in a position where we can go after competitive business. And as we do the further work on the North Campus and restore that supply, we\u2019re going to be well-positioned for the second half of the year. And the thing I would tell you is just in a reiteration in response to your question is we have supreme confidence in our ability with this combined product portfolio as well as some of the new product launches that have taken place in 2016 and are in the initial stages of launch during 2017 to do very well in the marketplace across all these categories.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Josh Jennings with Cowen & Company. ","Josh Jennings","I was hoping you could just possibly give an update on the ability [ph] of the sales force. And just looking at just making sure that the attrition rates have been normal and that the kind of hiccup in Q3 in the supply constraint didn\u2019t lead to any abnormal attrition rates.","David Dvorak","We continue to be net adder on the sales force side, Josh, through the end of the year. So, had a lot of success throughout 2016 in building out the specialized sales forces and saw a lot of stability in those sales forces across the globe. So, nothing unusual by the way of natural attrition rates and ongoing hiring that netted to a positive position through the fourth quarter.","Josh Jennings","Fantastic, thanks for the update. And just follow-up question is just on the organic growth trajectory in the back half. I was just hoping, Dan, you could possibly parse out just the LDR contribution. And clearly there is an acceleration but with LDR turning into organic growth that\u2019s a nice contributor I assume in the second half and heading into 2018. But, if you could just talk about that LDR transition and organic growth and the contribution in the second half, that would be great. Thanks again.","Dan Florin","Sure, Josh. Certainly, the LDR portfolio has been performing extremely well and Mobi-C in particular driving solid growth. We do expect that growth to continue through -- in the foreseeable future; it\u2019s a very exciting product, it\u2019s a meaningful contributor to our spine portfolio. We\u2019ve been breaking out the impact of the acquired revenues. And we do expect that to move the needle on a combined Zimmer Biomet spine basis for many periods to come.","So, in the back half for the year that contribution is in the range of 100 basis points roughly. And I think it\u2019s a real door opener for the rest of the Zimmer Biomet spine portfolio. And we\u2019re very excited about it; we\u2019re very excited about the sustainability of Mobi-C growth, the cross-sell opportunity as we continue to integrate those sales forces, the teams are excited to have that in our bag, the full bag, and we view that as a terrific growth driver in the $10 billion spine market.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Glenn Novarro with RBC Capital Markets.","Glenn Novarro","Two questions; one, Dave, you talked about the market accelerating in the fourth quarter. Is there anything that you could point specifically that led to the acceleration? Was it just heightened seasonality? Some have thought, maybe there would be a pull forward of cases in December, because patients think they may be losing their insurance with repeal of reform; so, any specific commentary that you can give us? And does this create for example a bigger hockey stick in the fourth quarter of 2017? And then, I have follow-up.","David Dvorak","Sure, Glenn. It\u2019s yet to be determined, honestly. I think that it is the case that we saw strong demand in Q4 and if anything accelerated demand in the final month of the quarter. Only anecdotal evidence at this point as to what created that demand, I think that the full employment obviously contributes to it. I don\u2019t that -- I think it would be premature to determine that this is sort of an enhancement to the seasonality of the business as much as anything, it could be just the way the holidays fell in December, creating more productive second half of December operating weeks across the globe. And we\u2019ve seen that where the holidays fall in the middle of the week, breaking up each of those two final weeks of the year on the large showing [ph] side for these elective procedures seem to be the case on the spine side as well that led to a really robust demand in the month of December. But I think that it\u2019s smart for us all to let this year play out before we draw a conclusion about whether the seasonality is shifting even in a more profound into Q4, because of high deductibility plans and higher co-pays et cetera along with theories that are out there.","Glenn Novarro","Okay. And then, the fourth quarter of this year will just be a hockey stick, just because of the easy comps. Correct?","David Dvorak","Well, the fourth quarter of this year obviously will be up against more challenging comps to the extent that there was anything that was unique to 2016 along with the description that I just provided. I think in our case, we\u2019re going to be well-positioned, because we have replenished stock, and we\u2019re in a better position with secure cross-sell product lines and safety stocks rebuilt to go after the offensive opportunities that we have, Glenn. So, we\u2019re looking to accelerate the topline growth in the second half of the year but not so much based upon prior year comps.","Glenn Novarro","Okay. And then just lastly, pricing was very stable from 3Q to 4Q in knees and hips. And I know there is always the concern about CJR impacting pricing. So, maybe provide some color as to why pricing is staying so stable and any concerns from CJR as it continues to get rolled out over the next 12 months?","David Dvorak","We never have expressed significant concerns as to what impact CJR may have on price mix. We\u2019ve said all along, we feel like the dynamics have already been in place that lead to in instances that there is an outlier, high price regression to the mean for that price and greater transparency of pricing across the nation and frankly across the globe. So, I don\u2019t think that the CJR implementation has changed those dynamics. And if anything, our experience in 2016 seems to be consistent with that. And obviously, we\u2019re forecasting similar pricing impact in 2017, Glenn. So, we don\u2019t see any significant impact flowing from CJR in that regard.","Operator","Next, we\u2019ll go to Joanne Wuensch with BMO Capital Management.","Joanne Wuensch","Good morning and thank you for taking the questions. Couple of things; can we pull forward a little bit the impact of the FX hedges in the fourth quarter and what exactly you\u2019re guiding for, for the impact in 2017?","Dan Florin","Sure. The impact in the fourth quarter, Joanne, was 100 basis points on about $20 million year-over-year of a decline in the fourth quarter. Next year, we characterize that as 100 basis points of headwind on total gross margin rate. So, I think you can do the math on the magnitude of that impact year-on-year.","Joanne Wuensch","And my final two questions; one is, in Washington, there is a lot of interesting things going on, but as it relates to your business, is there anything you want to draw our attention to? And then, the second one also is AAOS coming up, what should we be looking for there? Thank you.","David Dvorak","Yes, I\u2019ll maybe grab a couple of topics that we\u2019re obviously paying attention to. ACA, repeal and replacement, we\u2019re paying a lot of attention to that. The obvious benefit that is out there is a full repeal of the medical device tax. We\u2019re in the second year of the suspension at this point in time. We get the question often times, Joanne, as to whether or not we would expect some kind of a volume decline to the extent that the ACA was repealed and not fully replaced, and that\u2019s in excess to care question obviously. And all along, our measurements would indicate that volume might have been positively impacted by tens of basis points. And so, we don\u2019t see that as being a significant risk to our volumes going forward. And another question that we get often times is CJR and what happens in that regard with any potential reforms or repeals of the ACA. We think that those end-to-end episode of care reimbursement models, whether it\u2019s in a public or a private setting, our innovation and the go-to market strategy that is probably here to stay in some form, one can speculate as to what the specific form might be as it relates to Medicare in the United States. But, our Signature Solutions offering is geared towards enhancing patient outcomes and driving efficiencies and in the implementation or delivery of that care across the entire episode of care.","And I would point you to that particular area of our exhibit space of the academy in reference to your second question, because we have a lot of exciting announcements and a lot of incredible progress and significant customer interest and demand for that set of offering. So, please join at the academy in March, and we\u2019ll walk you through and get little bit more granular with you about what we are intending to do in 2017 by the way of an installment there.","Dan Florin","And Joanne, maybe just with respect to tax reform, certainly the details are very limited at this point in time, but based on our review of what\u2019s being proposed, the Company\u2019s ongoing U.S. operations, we believe we experience a net tax benefit by virtue of the reduction in U.S. corporate income tax rates. And then even factoring in the border adjustment, when we look at our U.S. revenues, the sources of that production, we\u2019re a slight net exporter, meaning we produce more in the U.S. sold in the U.S. relative to what\u2019s imported for sale in the U.S.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.","Larry Biegelsen","Just two quick ones here. David, could you help or David -- sorry, could you help bridge the Q4 growth to the Q1 guidance? So, adjusting for the tender, you did about 3% in Q4, the guidance is 1.5% to 2.5%; just why the deceleration in Q1? And just to be crystal clear, you talked about occasionally some distributor delays that would end in the second quarter, just trying to understand is that due to the 483 at the Warsaw facility? And just lastly, David, how do you want us to think about dental returning to growth, how long -- how will that progress through 2017? Thanks for taking the questions, guys.","Dan Florin","Sure, Larry. On the first of those, the reconciliation to the midpoint of the Q1 guidance of 2% is just as you described, you can think about it in the big picture manner as a half point of that reconciliation relating to the tender and a point -- 100 basis points relating to the market step-up from Q3 to Q4 and a reasonable market expectation growth rate for Q1. So, 100 basis points, plus the 50 basis points is the right way to think about the 3.5 to the midpoint of 2.0% for Q1 Larry. Next question was\u2026","Larry Biegelsen","The 483, I\u2019m just trying to separate out the Q3 issues that you had and the 483 at the Warsaw facility. You talked about it in your prepared remarks as occasionally having some distributor delays, but you\u2019d have full supply in the second quarter. Those distributor delays related to the 483 at the Warsaw facility and you expect that to be completely. You don\u2019t expect any impact from the 483 on your supply after the second quarter or you\u2019ll be back to full supply in the second quarter? I\u2019m just trying to parse out the 483 from the issues in the third quarter because it sounds like they\u2019re different issues. And then, the last one David, sorry for the long question, but just dental, just the progression there. Thanks.","David Dvorak","Sure. So, as it relates to the North Campus and Warsaw operations there, our mix of matters that are contributing to the supply challenges coming out of the North Campus including remediation to fully address the observation that are articulated in the Form 483. So, your reference to the product flow, it is manufacturing, logistics, the distribution of those products that come out. And in an abundance of caution, the application of these interim controls, as we\u2019re revalidating certain processes is what leads to some of that choppiness. Now, product is flowing out of the facility. We\u2019re going to continue to be in a hyper care state in an abundance of caution until those revalidations are completely executed. That will take some time. But as the months progress in the first half of the year, we expect the distribution of those products to even out and those safety stocks to be rebuilt. And that positions us to grow those important product lines in the second half of the year.","As it relates to dental, we continue to be attracted to that market, as I referenced. We see that market as being one that has the opportunity to grow mid single digits. It\u2019s a bit higher growth in some of the so called value sub-segments of the market. We historically have not had any significant presence in that market; we need to develop one. And we\u2019re repositioning the broad product portfolio that we have by virtue of the combination to do a better job of getting after that that market opportunity. And we expect to make progress in 2017, but look for that\u2019s a show up an improved topline second half of the year and as we exit 2017.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our last question from Bruce Nudell with Suntrust.","Bruce Nudell","I\u2019m just looking at your revenue guidance. It\u2019s actually kind of tight, so from the midpoint to top and bottom is about 0.5%. And could you just put that in context of your expectations for the hip and knee market, which is about 60% of revenues and your share position in it as well as the continued strength in S.E.T.?","David Dvorak","Bruce, maybe just to clarify\u2026","Bruce Nudell","Yes. It just seems like you have a pretty tight revenue range. And it looks like, so it must presume pretty -- that almost 3% hip and knee market and maybe a little bit under market growth and continued strength in S.E.T. Are those reasonable assumptions?","David Dvorak","Yes, they\u2019re reasonable assumptions for the first half of the year with an acceleration contemplated in the second half of the year; and so, as Dan referenced an assumption that the overall musculoskeletal market roundabout 3% in 2017. And we\u2019re obviously guiding below that in the first half of the year and above that -- at or above that in the second half of the year with our 3% to 4.5% guide for the second half of the year. And so that\u2019s the progression that we see.","And I do think that with the portfolio that we have that we would expect as get into the second half of the year to accelerate even in large joints to above market growth rates and then have that further augmented by continued good performance coming out of S.E.T. in the beginnings of realization of the opportunity that we have and have described in the spine market as well, Bruce.","Bruce Nudell","Perfect. And just back to Bob\u2019s question about Mako, I mean amongst the major players worldwide, you have 40% knee share. And so, clearly, very important franchise to you guys. And my presumption is Stryker\u2019s going to do local studies where they show relative to Stryker implants done freehand with Mako, improved motion after the case, less blood loss, less pain, better stability, better discharge rates. What are you guys doing with your intelligent instrumentation and perhaps even your robotic programs to be ready to counter that kind of individual site type of data that\u2019s likely to emerge from the Stryker effort?","David Dvorak","Good question, Bruce. And I would just point you back to the Personalized Solutions and Signature Solutions efforts. And we will walk through in a very comprehensive way, the interconnectivity of early patient engagement, optimize pre-operative practices that include the use of our intelligent instrumentation devices in a manner that is consistent with the surgical philosophies that different surgeons may subscribe to and then all the way through tell a rehab service to optimize the patient outcome and drive down the cost of the delivery of care. And we\u2019re really excited about this portfolio. We think that this is the set of strategies that we\u2019ve assembled that is going to be responsive to both patient demands, provider demands and healthcare systems around the globe, and believe it\u2019s a very comprehensive response.","Bruce Nudell","Perfect. And just to sneak one, selling days in 2017?","David Dvorak","Yes. I think overall, they washed out consistent with 2016.","Bruce Nudell","Thanks so much.","David Dvorak","Thank you, Bruce. So with that, I\u2019d like to thank everyone for joining the call today and for your continued interest and support for Zimmer Biomet. We look forward to speaking with you on our first quarter conference call. I\u2019ll turn it back over to you, Anna.","Operator","Thank you again for participating in today\u2019s conference call.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, April 26, 2019.","Following today's presentation, there will be a question and answer session. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions]","I would now like to turn the conference over to Cole Lannum, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and IRO. Please go ahead, sir.","Coleman Lannum","Thank you. And good morning. Welcome to Zimmer Biomet\u2019s first quarter earnings conference call. I'm joined by Bryan Hanson, our President and CEO, and our CFO, Dan Florin.","Before we get started, I'd like to remind you that our comments during this call will include forward-looking statements. And, of course. actual results may differ materially from those indicated by forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks and uncertainties.","Please note that we assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements, even if actual results or future expectations change materially. Please refer to our SEC filings for a detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties in addition to the inherent limitations of such forward-looking statements.","Also, the discussions on this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is included within the earnings release found on our website at zimmerbiomet.com.","With that, I'll now turn over the call to Bryan. Bryan?","Bryan Hanson","Thanks, Cole. And thank you to everyone for joining us this morning. I'm going to provide a quick overview of our first quarter results, followed by an update on our short-term priorities. Dan will then provide additional color on our overall financial performance for the quarter.","First quarter results were slightly above our expectations and, probably more importantly, further supports our ongoing confidence that we are making real progress in reshaping the business and positioning ZB for success.","We delivered solid revenue growth, with another strong performance from our Europe, Middle East and Africa and Asia-Pacific region and continued improvement from our Dental business, which has been gaining traction over the last few quarters.","We also continue to meet our short-term operational goals on our roadmap to go on offense in the back half of the year. importantly, we made further progress in positioning the organization to durably deliver our weighted average market growth of 2% to 3% in 2020.","Our short-term priorities for ZB remain unchanged. They are supply recovery, shifting to supply efficiency; quality remediation, moving to best-in-class quality; new product launches, shifting to providing customer-centric solutions; and continued optimization of our talent structure; and then, finally, relentlessly driving a winning One ZB mission and culture. And I'm going to spend a little bit of time giving you an update on each of these priorities.","Relative to supply, during the first quarter, we continued to shift our focus from supply stability to initiatives aimed at increasing our overall supply chain efficiency. And as we stated, supply is not a barrier to meeting our financial commitments or stated turnaround timeline.","We see continued progress in our ability to regain the full trust of our commercial organization as we move to offense and focus on winning new business. ","Two catalysts in the quarter outside of product supply and new products that have helped drive field base enthusiasm were our 2019 sales kickoff meetings and the AAOS meeting in March.","In both of these events, it was clear that our sales team is gaining both trust and confidence in their ability to win and in the support they are receiving from the ZB leadership team.","Specific to quality, at Zimmer Biomet, everything we do is guided by our commitment to patient safety, quality and integrity, which is a primary principle of our mission.","We made good progress on quality remediation in the first quarter. We remain on track to complete our detailed remediation plan on the Warsaw North campus by the end of the year, and we will be ready for reinspection within that timeframe.","Going forward, we'll continue to shift our focus from quality remediation to building best-in-class quality systems and culture to ensure the sustainability of those changes throughout the organization.","Relative to new products, 2019 will be an important year for Zimmer Biomet's pipeline and commercial strategy. In March, we showcased our latest products and offered a preview of our next-generation solutions at the annual AAOS meeting.","We saw keen interest in both the existing and new technologies across our entire portfolio. There was a high level of energy at the booth this year from all of our key stakeholders, including surgeon customers, investors and our team members.","We even had the FDA participate in a tour of the booth, providing an excellent opportunity for us to share our newest products and solutions with one of our key regulating bodies.","The rollout of our ROSA robotics platform was clearly a major focus at AAOS. Over the past several months, we secured a number of important regulatory clearances for knee, brain and spine applications for our ROSA platform. We're now the only company that has robotic offerings across all of these areas.","With respect to ROSA Knee, although it's early in the limited launch process, we have completed cases in all three of our geographic regions, and the response has been extremely positive.","Through the surgical cases performed to date, our confidence is increasing that we can deliver all of the benefits of robotics that our customers have come to expect, while also allowing them to quickly obtain time neutrality in the surgical procedure with minimal disruption to surgical flow.","We have seen tremendous interest from physicians and institutions, and that feedback increases our confidence that we have the right platform for growth in the second half of 2019 and well beyond.","In addition to advancing our traditional products and portfolio, at AAOS, we also highlighted our integrated ecosystem of solutions. For example, and as I've mentioned previously, we have a unique opportunity to position Persona, ROSA robotics and mymobility, a digital health platform developed in partnership with Apple, to offer a more personalized and comprehensive robotic procedure and overall patient experience. ","With reference to our optimization of talent and structure, we have made good progress on our goal to become a more agile and results-driven organization.","We continue to enhance the organization with new talent, to broaden expertise across the business and are receiving very good internal feedback on our new organizational structure that supports streamlined reporting and decision-making.","Zimmer Biomet feels like a different company compared to a year ago, and you could definitely feel that at the AAOS meeting. We owe much of that success to open dialogue and transparency with the team. And as such, directly connecting with our team members will stay a top priority in 2019 as we continue to benefit from the energy and focus around the One ZB corporate mission and culture.","We will continue holding mission ceremonies around the globe and let team members at every level know that leadership is behind them, and that we are as excited about the future as they are.","These were our priorities in 2018 and will continue to be our focus areas throughout 2019. As we have consistently communicated, 2018 and 2019 are part of a two-year effort to reshape Zimmer Biomet and position us for offense and, ultimately, allow for durable weighted average market growth by 2020.","As we enter 2020, our focus will shift to our new strategic pillars, which we introduced earlier this year. First, we will become the best and preferred place to work. We will make sure that people want to come to work every day because they believe in the organization and understand their direct connection to the mission, culture and strategy. ","Second, we will establish Zimmer Biomet as a trusted partner with all of our stakeholders, including customers, regulators, team members and investors. We want all of our stakeholders to know that they can count on us to do what we say and, importantly to do it in the right way.","Third, we aspire to be a top quartile performer in terms of total shareholder return. As we continue to stabilize the business and begin to deliver consistent growth in 2020, we will be well-positioned to execute against a five-year plan that will accelerate revenue growth, drive margin expansion and increase free cash flow.","Over time, as we execute in each of these areas, we will increase our financial flexibility and our ability to maximize shareholder value.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Dan.","Daniel Florin ","Thank you, Bryan. Our financial performance in the first quarter was a bit better than our expectations. Also, as noted in this morning's press release, our full-year 2019 guidance is unchanged from what we provided during last quarter's call.","Net sales totaled $2 billion in the quarter, a decrease of 2.1% from the prior-year period, with an increase of 0.7% on a constant currency basis.","As we noted in our January call, while there is no impact on our growth rate from billing day differences for the full year, the first half of the year has about a day of headwind which is offset in the second half. The billing date headwind in the first half is spread fairly evenly between Q1 and Q2, but in the second half, the majority of the benefit will be realized in Q3.","As Bryan noted, we delivered solid results in our O-US region. Within the quarter, our Asia-Pacific team delivered another strong performance with 5.6% growth, while our Europe, Middle East and Africa team increased sales by 1.5%. Meanwhile, the Americas region declined 0.9%, which was in line with our expectations. ","Consistent with previous comments, we expect our year-over-year revenue growth to accelerate in the second half of this year, driven primarily by contributions from recently launched new products.","Moving to the income statement, we reported a GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter of $1.20. After adjusting for special items, our non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.87. A reconciliation of reported net earnings to adjusted net earnings is included in this morning's press release.","Adjusted operating margin was 26.6%, which was in line with our expectations for the quarter and gives us confidence in our full-year guidance of 27% to 28%.","Net interest expense was $58 million, reflecting continued benefits from debt paydown. In addition, gains from our ongoing cross currency swap program were particularly strong in the quarter.","The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 17.5%, which is in line with our expectations and full-year guidance range for 2019.","Operating cash flow for the quarter amounted to $284 million and our free cash flow was $182 million.","In the quarter, we paid $168 million related to a patent litigation matter, which we discussed during our fourth-quarter call. This payment was included in our full-year free cash flow guidance of $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion.","During the quarter, we paid down $110 million of debt and we continue to expect to use the majority of our 2019 free cash flow to reduce debt throughout the remainder of the year.","With that, I'll turn the call back to Bryan. Bryan?","Bryan Hanson ","Thanks, Dan. we moved into Q&A, I want to say again that I am pleased with the steady progress the team has been making, our level of confidence has never been higher and our team members are more focused and engaged than at any point since I joined the company.","This quarter, we delivered solid growth in important categories and geographies, while driving steady progress against our short-term objectives. We will stay relentlessly focused on those priorities as we continue to reshape Zimmer Biomet and position the business to drive growth in the back half of this year and into 2020 and well beyond.","And with that, I'll turn it back to Cole to get into the questions.","Coleman Lannum ","Thanks, Bryan. Before we start the Q&A session, I want to remind you again to please limit yourself to a single question with a brief follow-up if and only if needed. Feel free to put yourself back in queue. Afterwards, I promise we'll get through as many questions as possible that way.","With that, operator, may we please have the first question?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions]. We'll take our first question from Robbie Marcus with J.P. Morgan.","Robbie Marcus","Good morning. And thanks for the question. Bryan, you hit on this a bunch of times in your presentation. I think for everyone who was at the AAOS analyst meeting that you held along with you and your team, it was pretty clear that Zimmer Biomet is making progress and you feel good about the business here. Can you just run through exactly what it is that gives you confidence here? Which of the business lines do you think is making the biggest progress forward? And how much of that confidence is driven by ROSA which, by all accounts, had positive physician feedback at the unveiling? Thanks. ","Bryan Hanson","Yeah. Thanks, Robbie. Yeah, I would agree. That's why stating it \u2013 and I think to your point, if you were there at the AAOS meeting, no matter who you were, it was palpable the level of energy that we had around our booth, around our technologies and just the general energy level of the team. So, it gives me increased confidence that we're absolutely heading down the right path.","And I kind of break it down probably into two areas. The more objective side of things would be that we're delivering the financial commitments that we're making as a team. That's important, right? There was a lot of risk early on in this process. We've been burning down that risk and we've been delivering on our financial commitments. That is probably the most objective measure of whether or not the new culture that we're driving, the One ZB mission and culture is actually gaining traction. So, that would be the objective measure and that gives us confidence we can continue to do that.","More from a, I guess, objective standpoint, we've done a lot of work around our primary focus areas. And I truly do believe that that's going to start paying dividends and we're feeling it already. You could feel it at the AAOS meeting. We are, every quarter that goes by, retiring risk associated with supply stability, with quality remediation and launching our new products. Obviously, you saw that again at the AAOS, ROSA being a big part of that.","One ZB mission and culture, I know I talk about it a lot, but it's gaining traction. And I think it was very apparent at AAOS. People are feeling energized beyond a year ago. And I think the new talent and the structure that we put into place is making people feel better about the energy level in the leadership team, particularly the connection between the leadership team and the commercial organization, which I think was very apparent at AAOS. So, those are softer side of things. A little more subjective, but you can just feel it. People are ready to win.","And I think what's important \u2013 and again, some people kind of laugh at me when I say this, but there is a real belief that we are going to win. People truly do believe it's going to happen. And there's this kind of mantra that's going around, and it was very heavy at AAOS from our team that this is the year that we prove everybody wrong that doubted that we could return as an organization to where we used to be. ","You just picture that in a locker room heading out to a game where you're going to prove everybody wrong, and that's basically what we have right now across this entire organization. And it just feels good. It feels right. And the plan is coming together.","So, the energy you felt at AAOS is real, and it's taking us down the path that we thought it would. But we're just as excited either way.","Robbie Marcus","Thanks a lot.","Coleman Lannum","Thank you, Robbie. Next question please. ","Operator","We'll take our next question from Matt Taylor with UBS.","Matthew Taylor","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. So, Bryan, I wanted to get some of your updated thoughts on ROSA. There is a lot of investor focus on that. You had a good showing at AAOS. And talk about a lot of leads that you generated. So, I don't know if you can comment on how some of those leads are converting or the interest you're seeing or any color on how we should expect this to roll out during 2019 would be helpful?","Bryan Hanson","Yeah. Absolutely, Matt. So, we did receive a lot of leads. That was one of the things we're most excited about at AAOS. It was a dramatic change from a year ago at AAOS. We had less than 100 leads a year ago. And the AAOS this time, we had basically 2,000 leads.","Now, the hard work begins. Once you get the leads, you've got to actually do the disciplined work to make sure that you're segmenting those leads and getting on top of them, which we are. And a decent portion of those were, as one would expect, on Rosa.","So, I would just say, on ROSA specifically, since that's your question, it's obviously very early in the game. We just launched the product. We're just in limited launch. But I can just tell you, the initial response and just general interest level in the system is very positive, as positive as I've ever felt in a product launch. It's not necessarily a surprise to us. We had a specific development process that allowed significant engagement with surgeons along the way. I don't know if people are familiar with it, but it was the Agile method of development for the system. What this basically means is you do quarter sprints from a development perspective and each quarter you're bringing in surgeon partners to be able to look at what you've done, basically beat you up on what they don't like, and then could do another quarter sprint to make those corrections.","What I like about it is you're getting constant surgeon feedback and you're also creating urgency every quarter because you're in a sprint every quarter. So, it's a great development process. ","So, I guess, what I'm saying here is it's not a surprise to us that it is being well received because we had surgeon engagement throughout the entire development plan.","What I would tell you, though, now that it's being used and used across all of our geographic regions, in real-world, we're getting same feedback around the design principles that we put into place. Some of the things that we're hearing consistently is that people do like the fact that they do not have to use CT for preoperative planning. Let's face it, you don't have to have CT in the patient journey today unless you're using certain robotic systems. So, it disrupts the patient journey and people would prefer not to do that if they can help it, while still getting the accuracy which is again the feedback that we're getting.","Others have told me in that CT area that they don't want to expose patients to unneeded radiation. So, they like it for that reason.","Big one that I'm hearing is on surgical flow. This is one of the design principles. We wanted to make sure that high-volume surgeons could use robotics in every procedure and it would not slow them down. And we're hearing that real-world. It's happening. In a very short order, using the robotic system, they're getting to time neutrality in the procedure, which is a big deal. Remember, we want to focus on high-volume surgeons because we get that mix benefit every time a surgeon uses the robotic system.","Other things that we're hearing is around the accuracy data that we're sharing with our surgeons, extremely accurate system even using x-ray imaging for preop planning. And we don't talk much about it, but you think about the genesis of the robotic system, it started in brain, which has intense need for accuracy. So, we have something called dynamic tracking which allows the robotic system to stay registered with the patient even when the patient with a robotic system is moving. That's a big deal. Because if the knee moves in a procedure, our robotic system knows where it is versus the knee and still provides the accuracy in the cut.","Other systems don't do that. So, we're getting feedback on that now as well. People didn't recognize the value of it, but we're clearly hearing that. Probably the biggest one that was obvious to us is that surgeons get to use any system they know and love. So, they can keep the knee system they love, they've been using forever, they have trust in and use the ROSA robotic system with that.","So, again, my enthusiasm is pretty high probably hearing it. You certainly heard it at AAOS. It's growing as a result of the feedback that we're getting. ","I do want to couch it, though. I'm a pretty enthusiastic person when I talk about new technologies. You're going to hear the same thing from my people. I've already seen some of you go out and talk to surgeons. You're hearing that from surgeons. But this was expected. It was expected. It's good to know that we're validating that expectation, but that enthusiasm, that response from our surgeons was assumed in whatever guidance we've provided in that turnaround time line we're talking about in 2020. So, I want to make sure you're not mistaking my enthusiasm for something that says we're going to change our guidance or we're going to change our view of the turnaround. It was already incorporated into it. But out of the gate, couldn't be happier.","Matthew Taylor","Thank you for all the color. ","Coleman Lannum","Thanks, Matt. Next question please. Our next question comes from Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank.","Pito Chickering","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. You talked about having sort of price and mix issues relative to some competitors. If you look into 2020 and get back to 2%, 3% market growth, how much of that revenue is coming from positive mix shifts from new products like cementless knee or ROSA and how much of that cut [ph] is coming from capturing lost market share?","Bryan Hanson","You want to make sure that I understand your question. You're asking how much of the revenue growth that we see on a go-forward basis would come from share gain, actual volume, procedure gain or mix shift? In other words, getting higher price points. Okay, I got you.","Without getting too specific, what I would tell you is that when we think about the turnaround of the business, it's, obviously, multifactorial. We're going to have a bunch of different things that will drive it. But, definitely, one of the big variables associated with our driving revenue growth will come from revenue mix shift as a result of bringing new technologies into the market that are higher price point than previous technologies and\/or add incremental disposable cost to the procedure because of the value that they bring. So, I'm not going to get into the specifics of what level of penetration we're going to get in robotics or cementless or those types of technologies and not even talk about the percentage of the overall growth. But just know that will be a material part of our growth on a go-forward basis. That mix benefit you get when you bring new technologies in.","What we love about this is, with these technologies that bring real value for our patients and our customers, you don't have to have a new patient, you don't have to have \u2013 convert a new surgeon. You just need to have the same surgical procedure, with the same patient, with the surgeon you've always had upsold to better technology. And when that occurs, you get more share of wallet. You get more revenue per that procedure. And that is absolutely something that we're going to concentrate on.","At the end of the day, it is the path of least resistance. There is less change that needs to occur in that path. So, it will be something that we concentrate on.","At the same time \u2013 as I said, it's multifactorial \u2013 we're definitely going to pursue converting business. We're going to try to convert the other guy's business. But even if we stayed \u2013 I guess, the point is, even if we stayed in our swim lane, which is a pretty wide swim lane, by the way, we have a real opportunity to drive revenue growth just through that mix of revenue shift.","Pito Chickering","Great. Thanks so much.","Coleman Lannum","Thank you, Pito. Next question please.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. ","Vijay Kumar","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Bryan or Dan, I just want to go through the guidance, the first half versus second half. Some helpful commentary here. So, the guidance for the year, on a constant currency basis, 50 to 200 basis points. That's the range. You just did 70 basis points in Q1, inclusive of [indiscernible]. That includes 100 basis points of impact from days, the one half versus second half. Just looking at the comps, it feels like first half is going to be flattish organic. The days itself should give you guys, back half, at least 150 to 200 basis points, the first half versus second half. And should we be thinking about new product contribution over and above that. And as we think about new products, would you be giving us a system placement numbers on ROSA, et cetera, going forward? Thank you.","Bryan Hanson","So, we're not going to give \u2013 just the last question first, I guess, we're not going to give a lot of detail relative to surgeon training, system placements, those types of things. Not because we don't want to divulge it to you, but more than anything, we just don't want to send any clear messages to our competition on the level of traction we are or not getting with that system. So, I just wouldn't expect that level of disclosure from us when we talk about robotics.","When I think about the back half of the year, there's a couple of things that are happening when you move from first half to second half. The first half of the year, we have a negative headwind on the billing day, which we've talked about which is pretty evenly split between first quarter and second quarter that reverses in the back half. And as Dan mentioned in the prepared remarks, there's probably a little more benefit in the third quarter than the fourth quarter. But, certainly, that's a positive movement as we come into the back half as you referenced.","We're going to continue to have bone cement headwind in the first half and we'll have that in the second half as well. Should start to wane more in the fourth quarter because you're going to have some of that already built into the comps from prior year, but that would be another element that we would consider in the back half.","And then, when we move from limited launch to more full launch in the back half, that's obviously a benefit. So, yes, all three of those things, particularly on the billing day change and the limited launch moving to full launch, should be thought of, and included in, the expectations for the back half of the year.","Remember, though, that all of this is captured in a very clear message that we're sending that, by 2020, we expect all these things to come together and allows us to deliver 2% to 3% which is our weighted average market growth in a consistent way.","So, you can just kind of work the math on what we would need to be doing when we exit the back half of the year to be able to make that more predictable.","Vijay Kumar","Thanks.","Coleman Lannum","Thanks, Vijay. Next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steven Lichtman with Oppenheimer. ","Steven Lichtman","Thank you. Good morning, guys. Bryan, again, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the shift to manufacturing efficiency that's underway. What are the opportunities that you see to gross margin expansion? I know that you're targeting that more so in 2020 as the benefits flow through COGS.","Bryan Hanson","What I might do is maybe just kind of hit the top-end view of the activity around it and then, Dan, if you want to provide color beyond that, no problem. We've talked a lot about this as an organization. We have not had a lot of focus unfortunately over the past few years on cost down, real discipline in margin expansion in our manufacturing facilities because we've been over-indexing on quality remediation, we've been over-indexing on making sure that we have supply. So, unfortunately, that's where the energy is going, not on disciplined cost-down in manufacturing. ","Now, as we brought the new leadership in to operations, we've been building that muscle and the function, actually adding people around operational excellence, to be able to get after those types of projects. That team really just got put into place at the end of 2018, just starting to get traction and get a pipeline of projects in the first quarter here in 2019. ","And the real goal is to look at the obvious \u2013 look at the obvious areas of opportunity to drive margin expansion. That's what they're focusing on. Just regular, good old fashioned cost down, looking at our suppliers to be able to drive efficiencies there. Eventually, we'll get into footprint consolidation, but that takes time. We'll get into value engineering and those types of elements as well.","But we are finally getting more discipline around the team in place, the pipeline of projects to put in place to be able to get after margin expansion and the operating mechanisms to ensure that it occurs.","Now, just to set the right expectations, this will take a while for those projects to get in to play, start to materialize and then capitalize into the gross margin impact that we have. Remember, it's a year or so of capitalization for us. But I'm excited to see the momentum. I'm excited to see the team in place. It's just going to take a while.","First and foremost, we need to make sure that these projects begin to offset the headwinds. We have pricing pressure every year. We have raw material increases every year and these projects need to begin to offset those first and then get after actual margin expansion.","Daniel Florin","This is Dan. I guess what I would add to that, as Bryan was saying, gross margin is multifactorial, right? You've got pricing. You've got cost. You've got mix benefit. And in my prepared remarks, I talked about, in Q1, the foreign currency hedge gains that we experienced. So, when you think about our gross margin rate in 2019, we are going to see some benefit to that rate as a result of our foreign currency hedging program. You should expect, really because of that, to see our gross margin rate in 2019 to be slightly higher than 2018, again, really driven by that FX hedge gains. And we've talked a lot about investing in SG&A on the other side of that. So, it kind of offsets that elevated gross margin rate.","With respect to \u2013 as Bryan was saying, the manufacturing cost, our manufacturing costs remain under pressure. Have a lot of confidence in the new team for getting after it. It will take time to spin up those programs and execute to those. And then, it will take time to come through the P&L. ","But, again, the message is the team is managing through that, and all of that is inside of our guidance.","Steven Lichtman","Thanks, guys.","Coleman Lannum","Thanks, Steve. Next question please.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Josh Jennings with Cowen.","Josh Jennings","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to follow up on Steve's questions just on margin expansion, but kind of moving down the P&L. I think, Dan, you committed to some level of margin expansion in 2020. I know we're a little bit early here to talk about 2020, but I was hoping you could just help us understand some of the puts and takes with that commitment as we get into next year. And just how dependent on volume growth is margin expansion in 2020 in terms of getting back to that average weighted market growth rate of 2% to 3% on the top line? Thanks for taking the questions.","Daniel Florin","Sure, Josh. We're obviously not going to give 2020 guidance here. We are confident that our operating margin expansion for 2020 is as real today as it was at AAOS when we mentioned it in prior quarters.","And just know it will be a full program that looks at operating margin expansion. There is opportunity to continue to invest in the business, while driving margin expansion. So, I wouldn't get too hung up on the geography of that in the P&L. Just know that it's an area that we're focused on and we don't see it as mutually exclusive with growing the business either.","Based on what we're telling you about top line acceleration back half of this year and our growth expectations towards our WAMGR in 2020, that gives us an opportunity to drive some leverage, but at the same time taking some productivity initiatives and driving those through 2020.","I think the last piece I would say is there is a real opportunity in the spirit of the portfolio management that we've talked about of taking existing spending and just making sure it's pointed at the right places to drive our WAMGR out. And there is a nice opportunity to do that. So, we're focused on this in a big way as well as growing the business and delivering on our new product launches.","Coleman Lannum","Thanks, Josh. Next question please.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Chris Pasquale with Guggenheim.","Chris Pasquale","Thanks. Bryan, I was curious how the reception has been so far to Persona cementless. And is that a product that you guys expect to ramp relatively quickly because of the increased comfort surgeons have gotten with cementless implants over the past few years or do you think your customers are going to want to see more of a track record with that specific implant?","Bryan Hanson","Yeah, thanks. So far, so good, I've got to tell you. Again, it's relatively early on still, but we're getting great traction. And I can think the fact that cementless is taking off with other companies, that's leading the path, if you will, and the confidence level is higher and the acceptance is higher as a result of that. Sometimes, it's okay to be second to the party because you get to take advantage of who got there first. And that is exactly what is happening.","I do believe that people have immediate confidence with our cementless option because, remember, it's Persona, which they have grown to know and love, it's one of the best, most personalized knee systems you can get at a reasonable cost, is giving the anatomical correctness and the size options that you've got, but it also has Trabecular Metal, which has just been studied and known to have some of the best bone in-growth you're going to get with the material on an implant. So, it's a combination of those two things in the Zimmer Biomet that is giving people the confidence to move in that direction. So, we're as excited as we've ever been with cementless and we expect to continue to move down the path of getting conversions there. ","We haven't given specifics relative to the expected penetration of our cementless versus just the total knee, but we certainly believe that we've got a lot headroom there still.","Chris Pasquale","Thanks.","Coleman Lannum","Thank you, Chris. Next question please. ","Operator","Up next, we'll go to Craig Bijou with Cantor Fitzgerald.","Craig Bijou","Great. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Appreciate your comments on the supply side. And then, Bryan, looking ahead to 2020 and as the business continues to accelerate, I wanted to ask you, what's your level of concern or how should we think about potential risk that you'll have enough supply to meet the demand for, say, the four new products \u2013 four new knee products? And maybe, more specifically, as the industry is trending towards cementless, do you have any concerns if cementless ended up being 10% of your knees in 2020 that you can actually meet that demand?","Bryan Hanson","So, I would tell you, just given some of the supply issues that we've had in the past, our discipline and operating mechanisms around ensuring that capacity planning is done appropriately is probably never been more acute or more focused. I personally have a weekly call with my team to talk about where we are with capacity planning, with the processes and how we're doing relative to certain metrics that we have in place on improving our service levels to customers.","So, there's an intense focus, as one would imagine, on ensuring that we get it right relative to the forecast, that we get the demand planning signal correct in manufacturing facility and, ultimately, the capacity would be there.","I feel very confident that we have the capacity planning in place with all new products to ensure that we can deliver on the financial commitments that we've talked with some headroom. We're not going to take the chance of not having that headroom.","What I would tell you is that we still need to move to a better, more automated process. It's still pretty manual. That's one of the things from a systematic standpoint that we're doing this year, rolling out a more integrated business development planning process that will create a more automated, end-to-end demand planning process that we don't have today. But the level of work, attention from the senior-level parts of the organization on this demand planning process is probably more aggressive than I've ever seen anywhere for good reason, obviously.","Craig Bijou","Thanks.","Coleman Lannum","Thank you, Craig. Next question please.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Larry Keusch with Raymond James.","Larry Keusch","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Bryan, I just wanted to touch on one item here sort of bit strategic. So, now that the business \u2013 there are signals in the business that is beginning to stabilize and I know you guys are always looking at all facets, but when is it appropriate to start thinking about getting active in M&A or portfolio pruning. Just trying to calibrate sort of expectations for when that really becomes a major focal point for you guys as I assume you're really not focused right now on just sort of stabilizing the business, getting supplied, getting new products out there. ","And then, just quickly, secondarily, I was just trying to get a sense of the impact of the bone cement in the first quarter. Really just trying to understand what the underlying constant currency growth of the business is.","Bryan Hanson","I got you. So, I'm just going to hit the bone cement first because it's a shorter of the two. Bone cement was pretty much \u2013 even though the other category looked a little better than I think what some people expected, bone cement was right in the sweet spot that we had referenced, between that $10 million and $15 million. It was on the lower end of that, but it was in that range. The only reason why other looked a little better than that is because we had some literally other categories of other do a little better and offset it. But I would want you to continue to think about bone cement headwind in that $10 million to $15 million range. That would be an important key message there.","When I think about this idea of more active portfolio management, I just want to make sure that I continue to say this because it's for me personally from a discipline standpoint and to my organization and a good reminder for you guys as well. We will be, what I always like to say, maniacally focused on our near-term objectives throughout 2019. We've laid those objectives out very clearly, that they are a part of 2018, part of 2019. I just don't want the organization to lose focus in those areas. It's very easy to start chasing other things because they're exciting, but we just need to be back to the basics, disciplined, delivering on supply, making sure that we get the quality movement that we need, transitioning the new products to more total solutions, driving that One ZB mission and culture, and ensuring that the talent structure begin to gel. Those will be the focus areas.","At the same time, Dan alluded to this, we're not just sitting and waiting to drive our weighted average market growth up. Even in areas that we already play in, like knee, that is a relatively low growth area, we're already shifting resources, focus and mind share to the fastest growth submarkets of knee. Robotics as an example, cementless as an example. If I take the same view of spine, spine overall is not an overly attractive space, but if you look at MIS, you look at robotics, you look at cervical disc, those are very attractive submarkets. ","So, as we become more disciplined, which we're already doing, not just selecting markets, but also selecting the more attractive submarkets and then move R&D, commercial infrastructure, commercial focus, training and education and, eventually, business development because that's where we want to go.","My preference would be to focus on stability of the core and then begin to move more aggressively into business development in those areas that are going to be attractive to our WAMGR.","So, I guess, short story is, we're going to make sure we stabilize the business, but as we continue to do that, particularly as we come into 2020, you're going to see us be more aggressive in business development to be able to drive WAMGR up with a precursor that we need to make sure that anything we pursue is strategically relevant to us and we can bring good returns for you and for us.","Larry Keusch","Great, thanks.","Coleman Lannum","Thanks, Larry. Next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bob Hopkins with Bank of America.","Bob Hopkins","Thank you very much. Just one quick question on ROSA. Really on the capacity front. I'll limit it to kind of 2019. So, I guess, the one question is, how much of a limiting factor is capacity. Just maybe qualitatively, can you give us here a sense of where you are on capacity for ROSA broadly. I am speaking for both total knee and for spine.","Bryan Hanson","Yes. I would say that you are the best at extracting information that I don't want to give. I've got to prevent you [ph] ask a question. You've asked me this a few times. What I would tell you is that I probably \u2013 you said more than I already should relative to capacity on ROSA Knee, in particular. So, I probably won't speak any more to it because I don't want to send any clear messages to my competition.","I think the simplest way to say is that I feel very confident that we have the capacity required to deliver the financial guidance we provided and absolutely to be able to deliver what we have provided you for 2020. And believe me, with the level of interest that we're getting in the ROSA system, particularly on the knee side right now, just given where we are in that launch process, we're putting a lot of effort into making sure capacity is not something that's going to keep us from taking advantage of that technology.","Same thing for spine, by the way. The beautiful thing about the robotic platforms that we have is that they're very similar, whether it be brain, whether it be spine, whether it be the knee application, they're coming off the same line. So, we have the opportunity as we scale up to ensure that we have the capacity for all three of the robotic solutions that we provide. So, I guess, short story, robotic capacity is not going to be something \u2013 let's hope we're complaining about robotic capacity. That will be a good signal.","Bob Hopkins","Great. Thanks, Bryan.","Coleman Lannum","Thank you, Bob. Next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rick Wise at Stifel.","Frederick Wise","All right. Good morning, Bryan. Can you maybe give us a little more color on the ortho market as a whole? I was curious, was first quarter \u2013 we have three big players reporting so far. Was first quarter market growth worldwide as you expected generally? Our read is that worldwide hip\/knee market was in the 2-percent-ish range, maybe a tad slower than a year ago. So far, it seems like hips are growing faster than knees. Just wondering what that says about your view of the 2019 market backdrop as a whole and as you're thinking about the rest of the year. Thanks.","Bryan Hanson","Yeah, absolutely. I've said it a lot and it is because I truly do believe it. I don't really put a lot of weight into what happens in a single quarter. There's just too many moving variables. It could be \u2013 for any organization, positive or negative comps, they could be running through with billing day differences. There's just a lot of things that could happen inside of an individual quarter. ","But just if I break it down based on the way we've analyzed it, I don't really see any material impact, up or down, to the quarter so far, the first quarter. And certainly, from our assumptions that we built into 2019 as we put on our guidance, we pretty much expect 2019 to look a lot like 2018 and 2017. There is always slight variation, obviously. But we're expecting 2019 to look pretty similar to 2018 to be honest now. Hoping we're wrong and the volume is better than that. That would, obviously, be a positive for us. But I'm not seeing anything that would indicate to me that we're going to see any kind of a material increase or decrease to volumes. They look pretty consistent to me.","Frederick Wise","Thanks.","Coleman Lannum","Thank you, Rick. Next question please.","Operator","We'll take our next question from David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.","David Lewis","Thanks. Just one question from me. Bryan, I want to come back to ROSA. And I think you've been very clear that, competitively, we're not get the information we want as it relates to utilization, system number, things like that. I wonder if you could just share with us how you're going to sell the system, whether it's going to be usage based or capital sale? And I'll tell you the reason I ask. I think there is a lot of enthusiasm around ROSA. And to the extent that investors believe you're going to sell this as a capital sale, that's going to drive near-term revenue expansion for the business a lot faster than potentially a usage-based agreement and that's going to lead to a disconnect towards the back half of the year and into 2020. So, of all the details I think we need, the one that would be most helpful is how you're going to sell the system, capital versus usage, and any mix dynamics you can give us as it relates that or early feedback you're getting from customers as it relates to how they want to purchase the system would be super helpful. Thanks.","Bryan Hanson","Yeah, absolutely. And, obviously, it's dynamic. It depends on the customer that you're speaking to. And we've been a little more transparent here, obviously. It's been pretty well noted that when you look at the robotic pricing, the list pricing that we have, it's over $1 million. That's been very clear. It's out there. At the same time, we're going to be \u2013 we're going to give a number of options for our customers to acquire a system. We're going to be flexible based on the business needs or requirements of that customer.","You've got to remember that our primary focus is really to drive the robotic procedure. The capital sale is fantastic. Love to get it. Anybody would like to have that. It's a nice pop in the beginning. But driving robotic procedure adoption is the annuity that all of us want, right? It should be. It should be the most important thing. By doing so, I actually believe that we're going to increase the accuracy of the procedure for the patient and the surgeon, which is the obvious mission-centric reason for doing this. And then, we'll automatically, as a result of that, benefit from the mix benefit associated with the robotic case because of the disposable pricing and some of the halo effect you get on your implants. So, again, that will be our primary focus, is to push robotic procedure adoption. So, we're going to be flexible with our customers when it comes to making robotics attractive.","At the same time, we're going to ensure that we capture the fair return for the value that we're providing. Let's face it, again, there's a benefit to coming second to market here. The market is clearly speaking to us. And it is clearly indicating that a premium is expected, should be expected for the value that robotics brings. And we're not going to let that premium go. We may be second to advance here, from my perspective anyway, but we have a great robotic system that's getting great reviews from our customers and we are going to make sure that we don't come in at a discount to the market. So, when you think about capital purchases from us and the price point that we have, we shouldn't be thinking about us because we're second coming in at lower than the market premium that already exists.","I'd say the same thing for the disposables. We haven't given specifics here, but we truly do believe there is value in using robotics. The market is speaking to us, saying that they're willing to pay a premium. And one should expect that our disposable premium would be similar to what the market is bearing right now. We don't see any need to come in at a lower price point. We think we've got a competitive solution and we don't have to do that.","Coleman Lannum","Thanks, David. Next question please, operator.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.","Lawrence Biegelsen","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Bryan, I wanted to ask about a business that I don't think has come up on the call yet. That's the S.E.T. business. The questions around that are, one, what's the status of the Sidus stemless shoulder rollout and what are your expectations for that business? That's a higher growth segment of orthopedics. So, what are your expectations for that? Thanks for taking the questions.","Lawrence Biegelsen","Yeah. We've been happy with some of the progress that we're making in S.E.T. as a whole. Obviously, when you think about S.E.T., not all the subsegments of S.E.T. are created equal in our mind. One of the more attractive subsets of S.E.T. would be that upper extremity shoulder is \u2013 obviously, it's an area that we focused in the past. We have good market share and we expect to continue to focus. And the stemless shoulder that we have is an attractive option.","We talked a lot about in the knee looking at robotics or cementless as an opportunity to increase share of wallet or get that revenue mix benefit even with the same patient, even with the same surgeon. The Sidus stemless shoulder is the exact same thing. We've got an opportunity to bring a unique solution or a better solution to our patient and to our customer and, as a result of that, get an increase in price point for that stemless shoulder. And, certainly, that is what we're doing. And the response so far to our technology has been very good. It's one of our major focus areas in the shoulder area and overall set and we're going to continue to focus on it.","We're not going to give specifics relative to the penetration of it, but just know any area that we have that we can sell to get an upsell relative to the share of wallet we get in the procedure will be a concentration for us.","Lawrence Biegelsen","Thank you.","Coleman Lannum","Thank you, Larry. Next question please.","Operator","We take our next question from Kristen Stewart with Barclays.","Kristen Stewart","Hi. Thanks for squeezing me in and really excited that the call had no drops so far. Hope I don't jinx this. But I was wondering if you could comment at the outcome of the pricing dynamics in the quarter. It did look like pricing did dip down a little bit below the levels from 2018 that we saw. And I appreciate that there's always this volatility in price quarter to quarter. So, I don't want to make too much of anything over one singular point. But how do you just think about pricing going forward for the overall business? And how do you kind of think about that as you're looking ahead? At what level of gross margins do you think you can kind of come back at since \u2013 the hope would be, with all the cost initiatives that you're starting to work on, that obviously margins could potentially move higher. I just want to make sure that that's kind of how we should be thinking about it or is it just kind of running to standstill because of the price environment? Thanks.","Daniel Florin","Kristen, it's Dan. Pricing in the quarter, frankly, was right in line with what we expected. 2.6%, very consistent with where we've been in 2018 and 2017. 2018, in the fourth quarter, we did have that rebate adjustment in Europe that \u2013 so if look solely at Q4 of 2018, it's little bit of an artifact inside of that that lowered the price decline. But 2.6% for total ZB, very consistent with where we've been. So, there was nothing across products or geographies that was really out of trend. And we continue to view that as the price erosion going forward. Certainly, as Bryan was describing, the new products that we're launching come at price points. So, we're clearly going to be looking for positive mix on a go-forward basis. There's clearly that opportunity. But in terms of like-for-like price declines, in the aggregate, very consistent.","I think with respect to pricing and gross margin, just a brief comment there. That is an annual headwind against gross margin. So, as Bryan was referring to, just to keep gross margin flat, you need to be taking aggressively cost out of your manufacturing cost base or you're losing ground. And as we get further into 2019 and start talking about 2020 and beyond, we'll provide more color. But the point there is you have to be aggressively taking cost out just to stay even. And we're going to look to drive positive mix as a benefit to gross margin over the long run.","Coleman Lannum","Thanks, Kristen. Next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Johnson with Baird.","Jeff Johnson","Thank you. Good morning, guys. Bryan, maybe back on geographical comment. Asia-Pac has been solid now for three years running for you guys. Just how do you feel about the consistency of that going forward? And is the way to think about the improving growth rate overall for the company that that holds steady and then the Americas growth is what kind of improves over the coming quarters as a mix driver of the improved growth? Thank you.","Bryan Hanson","Yeah. So, what I would say, I'd like to see all geographies, all businesses improve. I don't care how good they are right now. I think there's an opportunity for us as we roll out new products, as we change the culture of the organization, as we change the discipline of the organization and kind of this accountability \u2013 extreme accountability culture we're trying to try drive. I think everybody can go up. So, I'll just state that right out of the gate.","I think what I love most \u2013 and I'm just going to give a shout out to the Asia-Pacific team. That's the mentality of that team. Even with the performance that they have had, they're happy about it, but they're never satisfied. They've never satisfied with what they're delivering. It doesn't matter if it's over market growth. They're always looking for ways to be able to drive it even further. And that gives me confidence that that Asia-Pacific team will continue to deliver. ","You're always going to have quarters that are up and down, anomalies in the quarter. When I think about that APAC team, the leadership capability, their proven track record, I have confidence they're going to continue to deliver for us.","At the same time, I have confidence that we're seeing that same level of traction across all of our businesses and regions. I truly do believe we're getting into a place now that gives us an opportunity for any one of our businesses or regions to be able to perform. And that's when success occurs when we have that durability across the businesses and we have that ability for one to help the other in a specific quarter. It's that balanced selling that will really drive the durability of our overall growth. So, I truly do believe that Asia-Pacific will continue to do what they've been doing, but I fully expect the other regions and businesses to do the same.","Jeff Johnson","Thank you.","Coleman Lannum","Thanks. Operator, we're getting close to bottom of the hour. Let's see if we can get at least a couple more quick ones in please. Next question.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Kyle Rose with Canaccord Genuity.","Kyle Rose","Great. Thank you very much for taking the question. I just wanted to circle back on ROSA here. And, I guess, just starting off, I guess, how would you characterize the low-hanging fruit, meaning interested accounts that want to buy a robot in the near term? And then, secondly, the other major robotic player that's frequently talked about robots in a competitive account, presumably at 40% market share for Zimmer. Some of those accounts that the competitive robots have gone into are probably historical Zimmer accounts. So, when I think about your first second year robot placements, you expect to see more de novos or new robotic customers? Do you expect to see competitive swap-outs or just accounts buying multiple different types of robots? How do you expect this market to evolve over the course of the next one to two?","Bryan Hanson","Sure. What I would tell you, just first of all, our strategy is going to be, first and foremost, as we've done better account segmentation, is to focus on what we're defining as platinum accounts. And a platinum account would be \u2013 and there's more than 700 of them that we have just in the US alone, for instance. Platinum account is where it's a high-volume account. So, it's got be a very high-volume account where we have the largest share position in that account. Those will be the accounts that we go to first to be able to get a robotic position because, in the past, those very accounts, if they wanted to move towards robotics, it couldn't be us because we didn't have that solution set.","So, when you do hear our competitor talk about placing in competitive accounts, those are probably the types of accounts that they're talking about. Our first goal is to make sure that we stabilize those accounts, we bring robotics in. And even where we have the lion's share of the business, there's still upside, we make sure that we get after that additional upside as well. So, the platinum accounts where we have high-volume, we have high share will be where we go first. Once we get through the limited launch and get into full launch, deeper into full launch, we'll be looking at gold accounts which should be high-volume accounts where the other players have more share than we do. And certainly be looking particularly in those accounts where the high share players don't have robotic solutions, that will be the next tier of our focus.","The beautiful thing that we have here is that we've got very low penetration of robotics in overall surgical procedures today. So, anyone who has a good robotic solution and the implants to surround it, really has an opportunity to benefit from increased adoption of robotics. We think we're going to be able to differentiate because we're not just bringing robotics, we're bringing robotics with mymobility, which is that digital health platform backed by Apple. We're connecting that with Persona, which is a more personalized implant. So, we really do believe that kind of this connected ecosystem that we're providing is unique to us and will continue to benefit us or will start to benefit us.","Coleman Lannum","Thanks, Kyle. Let's see if we can squeeze two more in here really quickly, operator. Next question please.","Operator","We'll go to Richard Newitter with Leerink. ","Richard Newitter","Thanks for squeezing me in. Bryan, just a quick question to follow-up on the last one on robotics. How can you leverage your ROSA Brain robotic platform footprint, particularly on the spine side, now that you're approved in spine to kind of target accounts? Can you remind us what the installed base is for brain in the US and worldwide? And how does that potentially provide you leg in the door for robotics in spine in particular?","Bryan Hanson","First of all, thank you for asking about ROSA Brain because that's where it all started. And it absolutely is a benefit and a catalyst to us when we think about the spine side. I was just in an account two nights ago having dinner with some folks. They were looking at bringing in three robotic solutions for the spine side of their business. We're not even thinking about us because we just got approval. They were thinking about two other players that are out in the marketplace.","But I also found out that they were looking at bringing in a brain system as well. And so, when they found out that we have one unit that provides both the brain application as well a spine application, with small hardware changes and software changes, but one unit, it became very attractive to that individual. And they kind of stopped in their tracks, are now going to look at our solution to see if it's something they might want to move forward with, so this idea of leveraging ROSA Brain and its percent penetration in the neuro area is a real opportunity for us. I truly believe that we have over 100 units placed around the globe, something like 140 units placed around the globe. It is the gold standard when you're talking about robotics inside of neuro.","And again, the beautiful thing about this is it was actually designed, the ROSA system, for brain. And the intense accuracy you need for brain is now also applying to the accuracy that we're getting because it was designed for that for both spine as well as for knee.","When you think about spine in particular, active tracking in a spine procedure is really important. You're placing a pedicle screw in a spine procedure. And for whatever reason, that robotic system somehow gets unregistered with the patient, you put that screw in places you don't want it to go. With active tracking, whether you move the patient, whether you move the robotic system, the robotic system always knows where the patient is and you're going to place the screw where you're supposed to place it. That's a big deal. ","When I talked to this guy about this at dinner the other night, he was surprised to hear about the two applications and one robotic system and loved this idea of active tracking. ","So, again, I think we can absolutely take advantage of the fact that we have a combined system between brain and spine, and that's obviously the intent of the organization is to do that.","Coleman Lannum","Okay, Rich. We're going to try to get one more question in even though we're past the bottom of the hour. This will be the last one. Last question please.","Operator","And our final question comes from Mike Matson with Needham & Company.","Michael Matson","Hi. Thanks for squeezing me in. Looked like spine and CMF growth improved a little. Just wonder if you can comment on that. Is it spine? Is it CMF? Is it both? Thanks.","Bryan Hanson","Yeah. Absolutely. If I look at that overall business, clearly, over the past few quarters, we've seen a little bit better strength. Strength is relative, obviously, given some of the performance previously, but certainly improvement. What I would tell you is that we still have work to do in the spine side of that group, still work-in-process is the way that I would define it. We're very enthusiastic about the new team, the new channel structure that we have in place. Some of the new technologies that we're going to be launching to differentiate ourselves would be spine, robotics, the ROSA robotics program and Walter which we have not talked a lot about today. But the combination of robotics in ROSA form and in the mini robotics in Walter, combined with our implants in devices, really does provide a unique solution for us. And we're excited about that.","But the real driver of the growth that we've seen in that business has been CMF or craniomaxillofacial business. They've \u2013 just across the board. That team continues to execute. Very excited about what they're doing. But a big part of it, kind of the leading pieces in the cranial business is the ROSA Brain. I think people do forget that we have platforms across all three applications for robotics. And we are getting traction there. And the fact is, even though we have 140 units or so placed throughout the world, it's still significantly underpenetrated. ","And just to describe the benefit here, when you get a ROSA Brain procedure for an epileptic patient, you're going to place depth electrodes to find out where the seizure is happening in the brain. If you don't have a robotics system, if you don't have ROSA, that's a six-hour-plus procedure. It's extremely tedious. It's very complex. With ROSA, it takes it down to two hours or less. So, it is a dramatic change for patients and surgeons. That's why it's getting the adoption and we still have room to go. So, we're excited about that system. And as you previously referenced, it does give us a foothold in once we get a ROSA system in, the one ROSA unit to be able to leverage that to get spine in as well. ","Coleman Lannum","And thanks for that, Mike. And thanks for everyone. Like I say, we went a little bit over today because we had a lot of stuff we wanted to get out. I know it's been a long earnings week for all of you, so we appreciate your patience. So, thanks for joining us.","Just a quick reminder, a replay of this call will be available later today. You can review it on our website at zimmerbiomet.com. And we'll be available to take questions. It will be a busy day. So, best way to reach us is via email.","Have a great day. Have a great weekend.

I would like to turn the call over to Bob Marshall, Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer. Mr. Marshall, you may begin your call.","Bob Marshall","Thank you, George. Good morning and welcome to Zimmer Biomet's third-quarter 2015 earnings conference call. I'm here with our CEO, David Dvorak, and our CFO, Dan Florin.","Before we start, I'd like to note that our results reflect the same number of billing days in the current-year quarter as in the prior year. During our call, we will be comparing revenues on an adjusted pro forma basis. This means that the revenue per prior year period has been adjusted to reflect the inclusion of Biomet revenue, and the impact of previously announced divestiture remedies. Additionally, expense ratios and related margin analysis through operating profit will likewise be compared to pro forma financials, as revised, which include Biomet results for the same period in the prior year adjusted in both year periods for inventory step-up and other inventory manufacturing related charges, certain claims, special items, intangible asset amortization, financing, and other expenses related to the Biomet merger and certain tax adjustments.","I would also like to remind you that our discussions during this call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by forward-looking statements, due to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings for a detailed discussions of these risks and uncertainties.","Finally, the discussions during this call will include other certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included within the earnings release, which is available on our website at investor.zimmerbiomet.com.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to David.","David Dvorak","Thanks, Bob. This morning, I will review our third quarter financial results and highlights from our performance. Dan will then provide additional financial details, as well as discuss our updated guidance. I'll state all sales in constant currency terms measured against prior year adjusted pro forma financials and all earnings results on an adjusted basis.","Let me begin by highlighting some of our important achievements during the quarter. The company made great strides across all geographies by accomplishing significant commercial integration milestones. We largely completed the appointment of our global sales leaders during the quarter, and we expect to substantially complete all commercial integration efforts by the end of this year. As evidenced by our sequential sales improvement in the Asia-Pacific and Europe, Middle East, and Africa regions, as well as in several product categories, we have already begun to see the benefits of the progress we have made on our sales channel integration.","Going forward, we will continue to execute our detailed cross selling plans, in order to leverage the depth and breadth of our musculoskeletal portfolio of solutions. During the quarter, we also began to execute our well defined road maps to capture the net operating synergies inherent in this merger. Our progress to-date is reflected in our adjusted earnings out performance, and continued delivery of expanded operating margins.","I would now like to comment on market conditions and pricing during the quarter. Musculoskeletal markets in general continue to demonstrate stability, consistent with the prior two fiscal years. In terms of pricing, Zimmer Biomet experienced modestly negative pricing pressure, consistent with our prior expectations. Our resulting price decline in the third quarter was 2.1%.","In this context, Zimmer Biomet accelerated revenue growth in several geographies and product categories. Consolidated net sales for the third quarter were $1.76 billion, an increase of 59.3% reported, or 0.7% against strong prior year adjusted pro forma results. Our Asia-Pacific business delivered 4.7% growth in the quarter, and our sales increased by 1.7% in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region. Revenues in the Americas decreased by 0.7%, reflecting flat sales in the United States, and the impact of macroeconomic issues in Latin America.","Turning to our product categories, sales from Zimmer Biomet's knee business increased in the third quarter by 1.7%, reflecting positive volume and mix of 4%, and negative price of 2.3%. The strength of our combined knee portfolio is already evident by this quarter's robust performance in key overseas geographies. Our Asia-Pacific business delivered strong 9% growth over the prior year period. Our Europe, Middle East and Africa region grew sales by 6%, and our Americas segment recorded a sales decrease of 1.8%.","Our sales growth continued to be led by Persona, the personalized knee system, and the clinically trusted Vanguard complete knee system, as well as our Vanguard 360 revision knee system. We also drove sales of our bicruciate preserving arthroplasty options, including the clinically proven Oxford Partial Knee and our new Vanguard XP Total Knee System.","Sales from our hip business decreased by 0.3% in the third quarter, including positive volume and mix of 2.3%, and negative price of 2.6%. Our Europe, Middle East and Africa sales increased by 1.2%, compared to the prior year period. Our Asia-Pacific region sales decreased by 0.3%, and our Americas segment recorded a sales decrease of 1.1%.","We're encouraged by our consolidated sequential revenue improvement, supported by the solid growth of our multi-bearing G7 and Continuum Acetabular Systems. In addition, the ongoing performance of our Taperloc Complete Microplasty stem and Avenir Hip System demonstrates how our comprehensive hip portfolio meets the rising demand for contemporary surgical techniques, such as the anterior supine approach.","Turning to our SET product category, sales increased 1% over the prior year period. Our extremities business achieved high single-digit sales growth with solid performances in all geographies, due primarily to steady demand for the comprehensive Total Shoulder System. This growth was partially offset by the performance of our Surgical business, and to a lesser extent, trauma.","We continue to be excited about the promising growth of our sports medicine business, where we're achieving ongoing traction with our Gel-One hyaluronic acid offering, and our minimally invasive Subchondroplasty joint preservation treatment. In the quarter, we announced the release of this innovative biologic solution for foot and ankle indications, representing our expansion into an attractive new clinical market.","Worldwide dental sales decreased by 0.9% in the quarter. Our positive performances in the United States and Asia-Pacific region were offset by slower sales in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region, and the balance of the Americas. Looking to future quarters, our dental sales channel will remain focused on bringing critical scale and improved execution to all segments of this category, with a product portfolio that offers a breadth of implant systems and best-in-class regenerative solutions.","Zimmer Biomet's Spine, CMS, and Thoracic category revenues increased by 0.3% over the prior year period. Our Spine sales teams continue to prepare to exploit our cross-selling product opportunities, which include the Timberline Lateral Fusion System and the PathFinder NXT Pedicle Screw System. We expect these commercial opportunities will help to offset anticipated sales to synergies inherent in our U.S. Spine integration in particular.","In the quarter, a healthy double-digit growth rate for our craniomaxillofacial and thoracic business was driven by demand for our TraumaOne and SternaLock Blu Systems, as well as growing market acceptance for our recently launched RibFix Blu System.","With that, I'll turn it over to Dan, who will continue this discussion in greater detail, as well as review our guidance. Dan?","Dan Florin","Thank you, David and good morning. Our total revenues for the third quarter were $1.762 billion, a 59.3% increase as reported, compared to the third quarter of 2014. On an adjusted pro forma basis, total constant currency revenues increased 0.7% over the prior year, reflecting sequential growth from Q2. This is despite a relatively tough comp of 4.7% adjusted pro forma growth in the prior year quarter.","Net currency impact for the quarter decreased revenues by 6%, or $113 million. The negative currency impact for the quarter related principally to our Japanese yen, euro, and Australian dollar denominated revenues. Our adjusted gross profit margin was 76.2% for the quarter. The margin ratio improved 70 basis points when compared to the third quarter of 2014. Ongoing but consistent price declines were offset by continuing gains from our cash flow hedging program, along with positive results from our manufacturing network.","R&D expense in the quarter was $83 million or 4.7% of net sales. Our R&D teams have made good progress in reviewing and prioritizing projects within the combined portfolio, while also redirecting redundant project dollars towards innovative programs that address unmet customer needs. Selling, general, and administrative expenses were $692 million in the third quarter, and at 39.3% of sales, were 200 basis points below the prior year period. This reduction in SG&A as a percentage of sales is primarily reflective of cost savings from our synergy program, and to a lesser extent, efficiencies currently embedded across a number of spending categories, which provide future opportunity to fund additional organic growth initiatives.","The cost synergy savings realized in the quarter included the benefit of certain actions that were implemented earlier in the quarter than previously projected. As such, we are updating our net synergy target for the first 12 months post close to $155 million, compared to the previous amount of $135 million. Approximately $15 million of the $20 million in accelerated year one savings were realized in Q3, with the remainder expected in Q4. The accelerated timing of these year one synergy initiatives does not impact our year three EBIT run rate synergy commitment of $350 million.","In the quarter, the company recorded pretax charges of $439 million in special items, which primarily consist of amortization expense of $123 million, inventory step up charges related to the Biomet merger of $127 million, and approximately $140 million in integration related costs. Our adjusted third quarter 2015 figures in the earnings release exclude the impacts of these charges. Our adjusted operating profit in the quarter amounted to $567 million. At 32.2%, our adjusted operating profit to sales ratio was 270 basis points higher than the prior year third quarter.","Net interest expense for the quarter amounted to $89 million, which was higher than the same prior year quarter, and reflects the incurred debts associated with the Biomet transaction. Adjusted net earnings were $338 million for the third quarter, an increase of 35.5% when compared to the Zimmer standalone adjusted net earnings from the prior year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 13.1% to $1.64 on 205.7 million average outstanding diluted shares. At $0.11, reported diluted earnings per share decreased 89.1% from the prior year third quarter reported EPS of $1.01.","Our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 28.2% and 30.2% on a reported basis. The company had approximately 203.7 million shares of common stock outstanding as of September 30, 2015, an increase as compared to the 169.3 million as of September 30, 2014. The increase is due primarily to the 32.7 million shares issued in connection with the Biomet transaction.","Operating cash flow for the quarter amounted to $151 million compared to $256 million in the third quarter of 2014. The decrease was driven primarily by integration expenses tied to our synergy program of $102 million, and final expenses related to the merger transaction of $225 million. Free cash flow in the third quarter was $15 million, reflecting CapEx spending of $136 million, which was comprised of $82 million for instruments, and $54 million for property, plant and equipment. During the quarter, we repaid $150 million on our term loan from funds on hand in the United States. The outstanding balance on the term loan as of September 30th was $2.850 billion.","I would like to now turn to our guidance for 2015. In our earnings release this morning, we updated the company's expectations for full year 2015 revenues and earnings. Implicit in this guidance is a stable to slightly improved revenue performance in the fourth quarter, relative to our growth rate in Q3 after adjusting for billing day shortfalls expected in that quarter. Revenue growth for the fourth quarter is expected to be in a range of 0.5% to 1.5% on a constant currency adjusted pro forma day rate basis.","I would remind you that the fourth quarter will have one-half less billing day, in consolidation, which is inclusive of two fewer billing days in the EMEA region, due to an accounting change that we made earlier this year for certain of our international entities. Adjusting for the one-half less billing day difference, which negatively impacts the growth rate by approximately 75 basis points, our adjusted pro forma constant currency growth is expected to be in a range of negative 0.25% to positive 0.75%.","Taken together with an expectation of foreign exchange impact of negative 4.5%, our reported revenue for the fourth quarter is expected to decrease between 3.75% and 4.75%. The company now forecasts full year revenues to increase between 1% and 1.5% constant currency, on a comparable adjusted pro forma basis when compared to 2014. The resulting full year revenues would therefore be approximately $6.01 billion.","We now expect the gross margin ratio for the full year to be at the high end of the previously guided range of 75% to 75.5% and within that range in the fourth quarter. Our guidance for R&D is now approximately 4.5% for both the fourth quarter and the full year. We now expect SG&A as a percentage of revenues to be below the low end of the previous range of 38.5% to 39% for the full year and between 37% and 37.5% for the fourth quarter.","Moving down the income statement, net adjusted interest expense guidance remains unchanged, while the estimated full year tax rate is now expected to be approximately 26.5%. Our previous guidance had been in a range of 26.5% to 27%. Taken together with year-to-date performance, the fourth quarter's adjusted tax rate should be approximately 25.5%. We expect fully diluted share count for the fourth quarter should be approximately 206 million shares, and approximately 190 million for the full year.","I would like to note that given the significant movement in fully diluted share count during 2015, the full year adjusted earnings per share results will differ from the simple arithmetic sum of each quarter's adjusted earnings. Our full year adjusted EPS guidance range reflects cumulative adjusted net income, divided by the full year diluted share count of 190 million shares.","Turning now to capital allocation, as noted in our press release this morning, the company is reinstating its previously suspended share repurchase program. The program that authorized the repurchase of shares up to $1 billion was temporarily suspended in April of 2014, when the Biomet merger was announced. As a reminder, the company has $599.5 million of share repurchase authorization remaining as of September 30, 2015.","Full year 2015 adjusted and fully diluted earnings per share guidance has been updated, and exceeds the high end of our previous range of $6.65 and $6.80. We now forecast adjusted fully diluted earnings per share to be in a range of $6.83 to $6.87 on the 190 million fully diluted share count. Our adjusted EPS for the fourth quarter is expected to be in a range of $2.02 and $2.06, again using a 206 million fully diluted share count.","Before turning the call back over to David, I want to inform you that late in the quarter, we identified errors in legacy Zimmer's accounting for certain accruals, and our Q2 accounting of product line divestitures. The errors impact several prior operating periods. The company assessed the applicable guidance issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Financial Accounting Standards Board, and concluded that these misstatements were not material to Zimmer Biomet's historical consolidated financial statements.","However, due to the low Q3 reported net income of $22.2 million, the company concluded that correcting these prior period errors in the current quarter would have been material to the Q3 consolidated statements for GAAP earnings. As a result, the company is revising prior period financial statements to reflect the proper timing of these adjustments, along with all previously determined immaterial adjustments in their respective periods. To be clear, we are not restating any previously issued filings, rather we are making immaterial revisions to the prior periods.","The most notable revision is a downward adjustment of $0.05 of adjusted earnings per share recorded in the first half of 2015. Importantly, the impact of this revision on 2015 adjusted fully diluted earnings per share has been considered within today's updated guidance. Further, it has no impact on our view of the performance of the business. A reconciliation of the revision amounts and timing from 2013 to 2015 is available on our Investor Relations website, and is included in Form 8-K that we filed today. Lastly, as a reminder, we will be providing detailed 2016 financial guidance during our fourth quarter earnings call in January.","David, I'll turn the call back over to you.","David Dvorak","Thanks, Dan. As a global leader in musculoskeletal innovation, Zimmer Biomet is uniquely positioned to anticipate and serve the needs of an evolving healthcare environment. We're excited about the progress of our teams and the course of our global integration and we will remain focused on capturing the synergies of this merger at every level. Together, we're accelerating the company's growth strategies, while generating attractive stockholder returns.","And now, I would like to ask George to begin the Q&A portion of our call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Bob Hopkins with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Bob Hopkins","So David, it looks like you're doing a really good job on the cost side. I wanted to focus my question on kind of sales growth and sales force retention and integration progress. So I guess the way I would ask the question is, when you look at the Q4 guidance, adjusting for days, it looks like the sales growth in Q4 is maybe a little lighter than Q3. Can you just talk a little bit about why that is? And more broadly, how are things going in terms of sales force retention and turnover? Are the turnover rates what you expected? Just a little more color in what is going on with the integration so far.","David Dvorak","Sure, Bob. Obviously in the third quarter, our focus was on appointment of sales leaders out in the field. These were steps that we were unable to take prior to close, although we had very detailed plans. And so it's been an execution quarter where we have done a lot across the globe to clarify future leaders and then allow those individuals to form their teams all the way down to the rep level. So some of that second half piece that is clarification of territories, compensation plans, product bags, is work that is ongoing and we expect to be substantially complete with all of that work by the end of the year. Now, that said, we're already seeing positive traction, having made these leadership appointments and that's evident in our performance, in the OUS markets in particular. There are pockets and product categories within the United States market where that is already evident. Retention rates have been consistent with expectations. Obviously, when these decisions are made, one expects a little bit of an impact in that regard, and so we did see an expected uptick. But we're also seeing a pipeline of new sales positions and hiring activities picking up and so all of that bodes very, very well as we finish out 2015 and move into 2016.","This positions us extraordinarily well to take advantage of the cross-sell opportunities, and so we expect to see a bit of that retrieved in the fourth quarter here, and then sequentially throughout 2016, more and more of that will be realized on the cross-sell opportunity. What we're forecasting really is stability, Bob, sequentially, from Q3 to Q4. There's a billing day impact that causes three-quarters of a point headwind in our constant currency growth rate. But when that's factored in, our sales guidance range contemplates stability to potentially a little bit of an uptick from Q3 to Q4.","Bob Hopkins","Okay. Thank you for that. Then as a follow-up, I realize this is a slightly shorter-term oriented question, but can you walk us through, relative to the guidance that you gave last quarter, why the revenue growth guidance is down a little bit this quarter? Maybe just put that into context for us, just what changed? For Dan, I was just wondering, you guys previously had said, regarding 2016, that earnings growth would be 15% to 20% higher than 2015, I believe. And so does that still hold, relative to this higher 2015 number? Thank you.","David Dvorak","Sure, Bob. Let me take the first of those. The consistency expected in Q4 and what we saw in Q3 across all the primary businesses is noted and I think that the only significant change that exists relative to our view of the market falls in the category of emerging markets. And I think that this is something that others have seen. It is macro economically driven. It obviously impacted our Americas performance most prominently, because we saw the biggest downturn in our Latin America business out of the emerging markets. Frankly, we saw less of a downturn in Asia-Pacific and hence the stronger performance was contributed in that regard. And then more of a flattish emerging market performance in the EMEA businesses, consistent with our overall performance there. So that headwind, particularly in Latin America, but across the various emerging markets, is the reason for the tweak to the guidance from Q3 to Q4. Everything else is tracking absolutely consistently with our plans and expectations.","Dan Florin","And, Bob, with respect to 2016, certainly our performance in 2015 gives us strong confidence with respect to 2016. As I mentioned, we will provide detailed guidance in our January call. Importantly, our 2016 operating plan is well underway, and within that context, we will make decisions about resource allocation and funding of growth initiatives. And as you said, we have express confidence in EPS, 15% to 20% off the prior EPS range of $6.65 to $6.80. The analyst community has collectively construed that as 15% growth off of the high end of that range of $6.80, which yields something in the $7.82 range. I would say that's probably a good way to think about it for where we are right now and we will provide the detailed guidance in January. And, again, as we have spoken about, as 2016 progresses, the cross-sell opportunity is realized. We will be working towards achievement of market growth rates, as we progress through 2016.","Bob Hopkins","Very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Mike Weinstein","Thanks. And just a quick follow-up there, is that basically you're comfortable with the current Street consensus for 2016?","Dan Florin","That's correct.","Mike Weinstein","Okay. David, the -- I've been trying to track what some of the actions you guys have taken to-date and it feels like a lot of what you have done on the sales front is consolidate sales management, while leaving the actual sales personnel intact. Is that -- A, is that accurate; and B, my question is, as you go into a distributor or go into a territory where you're direct, particularly on the distributor side, and you say to the distributor, hey, the Biomet distributor or in the other case the Zimmer distributor has a better presence in this territory, better market share, we're going to give responsibility for this territory to this other distributor, but we're going to keep your sales people, we're going to keep your reps. How does that work? And how is that not immediately disruptive to that business in that territory? If you can just walk through those conversations, that would be great.","David Dvorak","Mike, those decisions are unique and very fact and circumstance oriented. It can be a situation where you end up continuing to work with each of those sales leaders, but generally speaking, the scenario that you paint is a true one. You have two sales leaders. You're going to select one, configure a territory that is going to be historically the strongest sales leader performance wise, their growth track record, their capability to select talent and execute the commercial plans has been superior. I will tell you, in the case of those leaders selected, that differential is between them and the non-selected. In the U.S. recon SET channel is about a 300 basis point difference. So it's substantial. And it's really a benefit of the combination to be able to select from a pool of competent sales leaders and select the best-of-the-best to take the organization forward. Now that said, we said from the beginning that we were continuing to preserve the sales representative positions, and that holds true through our integration plans. The comprehensive product portfolio puts us in a position where we need all of those sales positions to fully realize the opportunities that we have out in the marketplace. These were obviously sales positions that were busy and fully occupied, and servicing customers prior to the deal and they continue to do so.","So it's a matter of transitioning over those sales reps into the go forward structure, whether that's a hybrid or an independent sales model, and it's different in different geographies, and take those sales reps, integrate them into one team, cross train them on the other company's products bag and start to go after running the execution of the offense. So that's the state we're in now. And I would tell you, it's going very well and probably the overarching reason is we had good plans, we had good sales and other leaders executing those plans. But at the sales rep level, they're enthusiastic about the product portfolio. As they get exposed through these cross-training efforts and gain deeper knowledge of that product portfolio, they see their opportunities going forward to grow their businesses and continue to make a good living. So the execution has gone very smoothly, and the pipeline build for the cross sell opportunities is creating nice visibility, and we believe it will be expressed on the scoreboard as we move into 2016.","Mike Weinstein","Okay. Just one follow-up for Dan. The reinstatement of the share repurchase authorization, can you just help us with how you want us to think about that, given the debt on the balance sheet from the acquisition? How aggressive do you want to be? And obviously recognizing as well that you will have access to a fair amount of OUS cash shortly. How aggressive should we think about a buy-back over the next 12 months?","Dan Florin","Sure, Mike. In December, we will have access to -- we will complete the intercompany loan transaction, which opens up the access to our OUS cash. That has always been a necessary step, so we're on target for that in December. We have reinstated the program. So the table has been set. I would tell you, certainly in our January guidance we will give explicit details on what our plans are in 2016. But I would just ask you to think broadly about our capital allocation policy as it has always been, which is being very disciplined in the deployment of that capital, considering the returns and our weighing options for the best use of those excess funds. I would say that our priorities include funding our organic growth initiatives, funding our synergy program given the return profile of that, maintaining our dividends in proportion to earnings, and deleveraging the balance sheet that meets our leverage goals. M&A that meets our financial hurdles, and then share repurchases to the extent we have excess cash, and those returns are attractive at that point in time. So that's how I would think about it, and that's how we're approaching it as we come into 2016.","Mike Weinstein","Okay. Great. I'll let someone else jump in. Thanks, guys.","Operator","The next question coming from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.","Craig Bijou","Actually it's Craig on for Larry. First question, I wanted to talk about the Americas business. I appreciate the color on the Latin American weakness, but I did want to talk about the flat U.S. growth. How does that compare to the pro forma growth you saw in Q2? And then, how do you see that progressing sequentially, relative to some of your comments on the whole company growth?","David Dvorak","Sure, Craig. That sequentially from Q2 to Q3, that's a slight decline in Americas and a substantial contributor to that decline again, were the Latin American markets. But we would expect that core Americas business and the U.S. business in particular to show stability to slight improvement as we move into the fourth quarter.","Craig Bijou","And then, I mean in terms of 2016, is it a similar -- I guess the question is, do you expect increased disruption, at least in Q4, or maybe early 2016, or do you see a sequential improvement like you do on the worldwide growth?","David Dvorak","Yes. Sequential improvement throughout 2016 is the way to think about it at this point in time and it can be different in different product categories. As we noted, the expectations for this synergy is because of the inherent nature of the integration on the U.S. Spine side is more profound than it is on the large joint or SET business. But certainly the large joint SET business having clarified roles and responsibilities down to the rep level by the end of this quarter and moving into 2016, we would expect thereafter to realize the cross sell benefits, and show sequential improvement throughout that year.","Craig Bijou","Okay. Thanks. That's helpful. Just as a quick follow-up, Dan, is there any preliminary P&L color that you can give for 2016? Maybe relative to the guidance that you provided for 2015?","Dan Florin","Craig, I would go back to the earlier comments relative to our previous comments of 15% to 20% off of the prior guidance. Our earnings performance in 2015 increases our confidence with respect to earnings in 2016, but I would point to what seems to be the Street consensus that is out there as an area that we're comfortable with, currently.","Craig Bijou","Okay. Thanks, guys, for taking the questions.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joanne Wuensch with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Joanne Wuensch","You said in part of your prepared remarks that there were certain regions that you're seeing the benefits of the combined organization. Can you talk about what those regions are, what you're seeing, and then how do you leverage that to the places that not happening in yet?","David Dvorak","Sure, Joanne. I think, most prominently you can see the sequential improvement and strong performance, likely market share gain performance, already in the overseas markets, both Asia-Pacific and Europe, Middle East and Africa. And what's noteworthy there is, in a big business with a leadership position, we grew our knee business in Asia-Pacific upper single digits, and in Europe, mid single digits and those are share gain numbers in both of those markets. So some of that opportunity is dependent upon the channel structure and the cadence of the integration plans, we're able to get after those opportunities sooner. I think what it does though, is validates that the combined company product offering is extraordinarily strong. And as we get deeper into the integration and moving towards a more offensive execution mode as a company in other jurisdictions, most importantly the United States, among the geographies, then we're going to start to realize those benefits in that important market, as well.","Joanne Wuensch","That's helpful. As a follow-up, we've been spending almost all of the last year and a half talking about the merger between the two companies and the benefits, and worrying about the dis-synergies. If we look forward next year, can we think about new products, or is there something that you can start to highlight to frame that out for us? Thank you.","David Dvorak","That's a good point. The short term opportunity, and it's the reason that we have all probably been over indexed on it is, the existing product offering really represents the mother of all launches for both sides, the legacy Zimmer and the legacy Biomet side because they're picking up new products that are innovative. They may be gap filling for that respective sales rep and so there's a lot of energy around that to get that moving. But I would tell you it's equally exciting to us as we have come together and prioritized the pipeline of innovative products, to look ahead and see what we have to launch. We're extraordinarily excited about how that comes together. I think you're going to see an incredible cadence of new offerings, by virtue of the combination. What it allows us to do in the intermediate to longer term is to repurpose dollars into more differentiated innovation, and get after it in a more aggressive way addressing unmet clinical needs because of the scale that we have as a business, not just in large joints, but in the other product categories that are oftentimes faster growing markets.","So we will highlight for you, as we move into full commercialization of some of those products. There are a few of them that are really important that are on a more limited release at this point in time. And we will come back to you, Joanne, and highlight those as we move those into full launch. Don't want to get out of that process for obvious competitive reasons, but it's a powerful pipeline, and it's going to be a quick pace of cadence, and sustain that top line growth as we get that restored in the intermediate and long-term.","Joanne Wuensch","Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question is from David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","David Lewis","David, it sounds kind of reading through all this commentary, that you're starting to see stabilization in your core business here in the early days of the merger. But obviously EMEA is a bit slower. So we have heard this comment from several orthopedic providers. Do you have a sense of whether this EMEA slowdown is tied to distributor destocking and what I'm specifically asking is do you have decent enough visibility on underlying demand to feel decent about your fourth quarter assumptions?","David Dvorak","Yes. We do. And we have very good visibility in those markets, David, as to what was happening in Q2, with the pending close moving into Q3 and the stabilization appointment of sales leaders irrespective of the channel structure in those geographies. As it relates to the emerging markets that market did slow down in EMEA and I would tell you it moved more towards a flattish growth number. We continued to have nice growth coming out of Asia-Pacific, and we can disaggregate what of that is integration related versus seemingly market. And then there's no doubt that when it comes to the Latin American emerging markets, that there was a substantial slowdown, and we would expect that to continue because of the macroeconomic underpinnings to it.","David Lewis","Okay. And then just going back to the buyback here for a second. Dan, a lot of -- what I heard in response to Mike's question was more of a tempered approach to the buyback. Not all companies, but a lot of companies kind of look at two factors in thinking about the buyback. Business visibility, and obviously relative valuation of the stock. I think most people would agree that the valuation is somewhat compelling. It sounds like from David, the business visibility is sort of returning. So am I reading you correctly that the approach to the buyback is more tempered because it seems like a more opportune time to be less tempered and more aggressive? Thank you.","Dan Florin","David, I would say that we are looking at that within the context of the 2016 operating plan. And we'll -- as we look at excess funds, we get that cash access to OUS creates that opportunity. We will be disciplined, I guess is the right way to think about it and opportunistic, when it makes sense. I would leave it at that. The table is set, and we will proceed accordingly.","David Lewis","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question is from David Roman with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","David Roman","I want to maybe just to go into some of the details of the businesses and go back to the SET franchise. I think in your prepared remarks, you said extremities grew in the high single digits. So maybe you could help just dissect for us in a little bit more detail what is happening in the Trauma and Surgical franchises? And then specifically what are some of the factors we should be monitoring to bring the growth rate of that business up, perhaps to something closer to what you're seeing in the extremities franchise?","David Dvorak","Yes. A lot of that is just germane to the cadence of our integration efforts in general, David. But we did see a strong performance, and some pretty substantial sequential improvement, as it relates to the extremities business. That's a leadership position business for us, so obviously very, very important. And it is an early sign of how powerful the combined product portfolio is going to be in that category. Executing on some of those opportunities in the other categories embedded within SET, we're expecting to take a bit more time. But I would tell you that we have good visibility in the coming quarters to improvement in those categories, too. And our expectation here is to work that business from where it is to up to mid single digits, and ultimately to high single digits in growth, because of the nature of those categories.","So, right now we have to improve our performance in categories like Surgical and Trauma in particular, and those businesses were slightly down. More so in Surgical's case than Trauma. But, again, I think that as we move through and develop a more focused sales force effort at the sales rep level on a global basis, we have got the scale and the comprehensive nature of the product portfolio justifies those specialized sales forces across the globe to exploit the opportunities and bring more focus to those markets. And it's a major premise to the combination itself.","David Roman","Okay. That's helpful. Maybe just a follow-up on R&D spending. I know you have talked about in the past taking the two companies' R&D dollars and combining them and reallocating resources to higher-growth areas, which you talked about in your comments. But if I just simplistically take the R&D in the quarter and multiply by 4 that is $40 million on a run rate basis lower than where the combined entities were doing, I think it's something close to $370 million or so. Is that more a factor of timing, of allocating those dollars, or are you seeing opportunities within R&D to see some cost savings as you kind of go through the integration plan? And to what extent could that represent upside to the three-year synergy targets that you have provided?","David Dvorak","Yes. It is not a targeted area for synergy, David. It really is an area that we would expect to be more at that prior combined run rate that you noted, as opposed to what's reflected in Q3. That said, this is an area where obviously we were walled off from open sharing of pipeline projects until the close. So those teams are just getting into the hard work to examine those projects, and so as a consequence, there just is a moderation of spend that you ought to expect to see step back up and reflect something more towards the sum of those two line items pre-close.","David Roman","Okay. Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Glenn Novarro with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Glenn Novarro","I wonder if you could elaborate a little bit more on the accelerated cost savings that you saw in the third quarter. I'm assuming this is mostly headcount, but was this mostly in SG&A? And as a follow-up to that, do you think that you can accelerate the cost synergies and savings entering year two? And then I had a follow-up on the gross margin.","Dan Florin","Sure, Glenn, this is Dan. With respect to the synergies this quarter, importantly these were programs already on the road maps. We were just able to pull the trigger on those earlier than contemplated. So that brings an incremental benefit to calendar '15 and the first year post closing. I think maybe by way of example, think about a duplicate office lease agreement that was in place and our original projections perhaps had that termination of that lease set for October, but we were able to terminate that in August. And that couple of months of savings, by virtue of that lease was pulled into 2015. So that's why it doesn't affect the run rate. That lease is worth a certain amount on an annualized basis. That's unchanged, as we move forward.","So it really was a timing issue, an acceleration of planned for initiatives on the synergy front. I would also say -- we're very confident in the $350 million year three run rate synergies. I would also say to the extent that there is further opportunity to exceed on the synergy side, we're going to be very smart about reinvesting that over performance on synergies into growth initiatives. Back to the theme of getting the top line accelerated, getting back to market growth rates, above market growth rates, we will invest in those areas, and make prudent decisions about what we drop through versus invest on any over performance on the synergies moving forward.","Glenn Novarro","Thanks. And just quickly on the gross margin, it looks like 4Q guide, the gross margin sequentially may be down from the third quarter. Is that purely a function of the less selling or less billing days in the fourth quarter, or was 3Q elevated because of currency? I'm just trying to understand the slight down tick in the gross margin from 3Q to 4Q.","Dan Florin","Sure. In the fourth quarter, the gross margin is expected to come down slightly, primarily due to less gains on our foreign currency hedge contracts. So as those gains will start to step down from the Q3 level as we progress in Q4 and into next year. And that will put some pressure on the gross margin rates, beginning in Q4, and then progressing through next year.","Glenn Novarro","Okay. Great. Thanks, Dan.","Operator","Our next question is from Matt Keeler with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Matt Keeler","I guess just a follow-up on the last question. Can you give us a sense of what the magnitude of FX benefits has been year-to-date, and what that implies for a drag next year?","Dan Florin","Sure, Matt. From an earnings per share perspective, foreign currency has been a significant headwind in 2015. So when you account for the translation loss of revenue, and the impact that has on reported earnings in U.S. dollars despite our hedging gains, there is still a significant FX impact at the EPS line and that impact is in the neighborhood of 7% of EPS headwind. That's the magnitude from an EPS dollar perspective. From a rate -- a margin ratio perspective, less impactful. But on a dollar basis, it's that type of significant. So if rates were to hold where they are today, and we look out through 2016, and we will provide more color in January on this. As I just mentioned, the dollar benefit of our FX hedge gains does decrease in 2016 relative to 2015 and that will create some pressure at the margin rate line, as well as from an EPS dollar perspective. And that will all be fleshed out in January in that detailed guidance.","Matt Keeler","Thanks. That's helpful. And just back to LatAm, I'm wondering, were there businesses that were affected more than others, or was it broad based? And then could you give us a sense of combined Zimmer Biomet, sort of what the Americas exposure is to LatAm?","David Dvorak","Yes. The business is not a large business in the scheme of things. But the downturn was significant in the context of the quarter, and is anticipated to continue in Q4. So it really is across all product categories within the Americas unit, so you can't isolate any single product category and its influence. I would tell you that the emerging market as it represents our total consolidated revenues, is somewhere in the 7% to 8% range, and it's probably less significant just by sheer size, in the context of Americas relative to the other two geographic segments.","Matt Keeler","Okay. Thanks. That's helpful. Thanks for taking my questions.","Bob Marshall","George, we have time for one additional question.","Operator","And our final question comes from William Plovanic with Canaccord Genuity. Please go ahead.","William Plovanic","Just a clarification, I think a lot of people have tried to circle around this Latin America issue. If you looked at your U.S. total joint business, just the U.S., separated out from the Americas, would that have been flat up or down year-over-year? And then my second question is really more of a broad based question with the CCJR in mind and bundling long-term. Do you see any advantage to becoming a more vertically integrated player in orthopedics, adding call points, distribution into the office or rehab channel, given the size of the product offering at this point? Thank you very much.","David Dvorak","Sure. If one disaggregates the revenue source within Americas and backs out Latin America, our business would have been on the U.S. front, flat to slightly positive in the quarter. And let me come back to CCJR. I do think that there's a lot of opportunity, and we've been innovating in a manner to exploit those opportunities. Thematically, we believe that finding innovations that address unmet clinical needs and help providers, payors, HCPs deliver care in a way that enhances the quality of the outcome, at the same time that the costs are managed more efficiently, is where the world needs to go. And we think that proposals like CCJR are just expressions of that reality. So we feel like, if anything on a combined basis, we're uniquely positioned to address those demands in that evolving health care environment. And rest assured that both from clinical as well as service and solution innovations, that we would look to be an integrator and a more comprehensive provider of solutions in that context.","William Plovanic","Great. Thank you. And just for clarity, it was total joint, so knees and hips in the U.S. was flat to slightly positive year-over-year?","David Dvorak","Yes. Large joints would have been slightly negative.

And Welcome to Zimmer Biomet First Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, April 26, 2018. Following today's presentation there will be a question-and-answer session. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions]","I would now like to turn the conference over to Cole Lannum, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and IRO. Please go ahead, sir.","Cole Lannum","Thank you and good morning. Welcome to Zimmer Biomet's First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Joining me today is our President and CEO, Bryan Hanson as well as our CFO, Dan Florin.","Before we get started, I'd like to remind you that our comments during this call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Please note that we assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements even if actual results or future expectations change materially. Please refer to our SEC filings for a detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties, in addition to the inherent limitations of such forward-looking statements.","Also, the discussions during this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is included within the earnings release found on our website zimmerbiomet.com.","In addition to the earnings release issued this morning, we have posted a quarterly presentation on our website to supplement the content we'll be covering on this morning's call.","With that, I'll now turn the call over Bryan. Bryan?","Bryan Hanson","Thanks, Cole, and thanks to everyone for joining us on the call this morning. Since joining Zimmer Biomet, one of my highest priorities has been keeping a robust dialogue with all of our key stakeholders.","That's why I've spoken with roughly 5,000 of our global team members through a number of valuable forums, including meeting with almost 20% of our regional distributors in the field.","In addition, I've had pleasure of sitting down individually with more than hundreds of our surgeons and other customers around the globe. These discussions have highlighted our present opportunities, helped to clarify some of our key challenges and have helped to confirm our priorities for 2018. A lot of my takeaways for these interactions have been positive.","I feel better, for example, about this daily progress we're making on supply recovery and quality remediation. Though we still have more work to do in these critical areas in order to further mitigate risk.","In addition, I'm even more confident in the enthusiasm and commitment of our global teams, including our best in class sales organization, along with the continued commitment that our customers have to Zimmer Biomet.","That said, I'm also gaining better clarity on our inefficiencies, as well as a much deeper understanding of where the organization needs to improve. Some examples of this include gaps in our demand planning, portfolio management and resource allocation processes, as well as a lack of manufacturing automation. Addressing these and other areas of potential improvement represent a critical priority for the entire Zimmer Biomet team.","Based on all the input I've received over the past four months, it's clear to me that Zimmer Biomet is well positioned to move back into positive market share growth. That said, it's also clear to me that this will likely be a two year turnaround.","As an organization, we will define success in this process is consistently delivering topline growth at market rates or better with the ability to expand margins commensurate with that growth rate. We believe our end markets are currently growing at approximately 3%.","My interactions with our stakeholders have also highlighted their capability gaps we need to address within the organization. I've raised this important issue with the board on behalf of the entire leadership team to ensure Zimmer Biomet has the right capabilities in place at all levels of the company.","To that end, I'd like to discuss some of the recent additions and changes I've made to the leadership team since I joined. Since I'm sitting across Cole right now, I'm going to start with him. We've welcomed Cole Lannum as Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, as I'm sure many of you know.","In addition, Ken Tripp recently joined Zimmer Biomet from Cardinal Health and has assumed the role of Senior Vice President of Global Operations and Logistics. I'm also pleased to announce that Rachel Ellingson, the former Head of Strategy for St. Jude, will be joining us as the Senior Vice President of Strategy.","I've also been augmenting our reporting structure to encourage a more inclusive and responsive organization that is more deeply in tune with the needs of the business. Consequently, the following individuals now report directly to me.","Aure Bruneau, who is Group President of our Spine and CMF businesses, Pedro Malha, who is the Group Division Head of our Dental business, and Angela Main, our Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer. I'm excited about the changes we've made over the past four months, and I will continue to focus on ensuring that we have the right capabilities and leadership in place.","I would now like to provide you with an update a number of the priority areas I've outlined in our fourth quarter call. These include enhancing Zimmer Biomet's culture, our ongoing quality remediation, our supply recovery efforts, new product launches to complete our portfolio and our investments to drive growth.","Turning first to our culture building efforts. We want to ensure that Zimmer Biomet is and will continue to be a great place for our team members to work. We have, therefore, continued to conduct a strong cadence of engagement activities over the course of the first quarter, which will positively impact both our corporate teams, as well as our global sales organization.","As an example, during the quarter, we redrafted the company's mission and guiding principles, which define our collective goals and values as a combined company. These will be rolled out to our entire global organization as part of our ongoing efforts to drive stronger culture of one Zimmer Biomet.","As part of that effort, during the first quarter we conducted a comprehensive workforce survey to give us insight into how we performed in many areas of employee engagement. This information will allow us to focus our attention on areas that matter most to the organization, and importantly because we want to be a metric-driven organization in everything we do, this will provide a baseline to ensure the actions we take are actually improving engagement.","We recognize that building a cohesive company with winning culture is a continuous process, and we are committed to receiving feedback and taking action to improve in this area.","On the quality front, while we don't usually provide this level of detail regarding FDA inspections at our manufacturing sites, I can confirm that earlier this week the FDA concluded an inspection at our Warsaw North Campus.","By way of background, the FDA last inspected this facility in late 2016 and we're currently in the process of executing against our approximately two year remediation plan.","As a result, we were expecting the FDA to conduct this re-inspection to evaluate the progress we're making in addressing these previous From 483 observations. In this latest inspection, the FDA issued additional observations and will submit our formal response over the coming weeks.","As part of our ongoing quality remediation efforts at the Warsaw North Campus, we'll focus intently on addressing these new observations. This latest inspection confirmed that quality remediation progress has been made, but we still have work to complete, and we're obviously, not satisfied with the current state of our quality system at the Warsaw North facility.","Unfortunately, there is no quick fix, but our team is working tirelessly to make the necessary improvements. We take these matters very seriously and remain fully committed to the comprehensive quality remediation effort at the Warsaw North site and we'll continue to keep the FDA updated on our progress. This will remain a top priority for the company.","In the areas of supply recovery, we remain focused on restoring appropriate supply of key brands within our knee, hip and S.E.T. categories. Our operations teams continue to increase production levels of these brands and we remain confident that we have the right activities in place.","At this time, we believe we're still on track with our goal of restoring supply in substantially all of our key brands by the beginning of the third quarter.","On our fourth quarter call, I commented that I believe these supply recovery milestones represented more risk than opportunity. Sitting here today, I'm more confident in that time line that we do need to continue to execute at a high level. As I monitor our progress, my confidence comes from three important factors.","First, our supply recovery efforts have continued on-schedule and without interruption over the past quarter second. Second, we've also de-risked some of our key recovery milestones as time has progressed. And finally, we will benefit from the recent additions of high level leadership and operations.","That said, there's still a number of critical risk elements we absolutely need to manage. These include ensuring we receive consistent volumes from external automated suppliers in the second quarter and beyond, continued talent retention and stability at our Warsaw North Campus facility and very importantly, successfully executing our ongoing quality remediation plan at the Warsaw North Campus, including fully addressing all observations from the FDA inspections.","In summary, on a supply momentum [ph] thus far and my confidence level is higher than a quarter ago, but we clearly still have risk and have to sustain our intense effort.","In the area of new product innovation, we have been focused on addressing gaps in our portfolio with products such as the Persona Partial Knee, the Persona TM Tibia Knee and the Persona Revision Knee.","Earlier this month, we are also pleased to receive the FDA clearance of the next generation ROSA robotics Brain application. This clearance represents the first in a series of regulatory and commercial milestones in the rollout of the ROSA robotics portfolio, including a total knee application we plan to introduce via a limited launch by the end of this year.","Additionally, in the important shoulder reconstructive space, during the quarter, we announced the first surgical case utilizing our recently FDA cleared Comprehensive Augmented Baseplate. In addition to the first U.S. surgery utilizing our Sidus Stem-Free Shoulder.","We have been receiving positive feedback on the products we have already launched and we are confident that the commercial introductions plan for the second half of the year will be drivers of future growth.","And at this time, absent any unexpected development, we believe we are on pace to meet our time to market projections for those products. As a reminder, we do not expect to have full launch of these products, including the Persona Revision Knee and the ROSA Total Knee Application until mid 2019. At which time, our sales team should be able to truly go on offence.","Finally, we have mentioned to you before, we have taken proceeds from the U.S. tax reform legislation and have begun making investments into areas that will drive growth in the business. Generally these investments fall into two major categories.","First, we have made specific investments in R&D, both in terms of new product development, as well as enhancements to the commercialization efforts of new product launching this year. The second area of investment is in the commercial organization, where we continue to invest in the expansion and specialization of our sales channel.","Clearly there is still a lot of hard work in front of the Zimmer Biomet team, but I am very proud of the team's efforts to date and its daily progress that we have made in executing against our key priorities thus far.","In a moment Dan will review our first quarter results, as well as our full year 2018 financial guidance. Broadly speaking, I want to emphasize that although we are currently seeing negative year-over-year sales growth, we do expect to accelerate our topline performance to market growth rates or better over the next 18 to 24 months. We will continue taking the necessary actions to close our gap to market and drive sustained shareholder value.","Again, this include successfully driving our ongoing quality remediation efforts, restoring the supply of impacted products, equipping our sales force with a new products to get back on the offensive and executing on our ongoing investments to drive revenue growth.","Now I'm going to turn the call over to Dan. Dan?","Dan Florin","Thank you, Bryan. Net sales totaled $218 [ph] billion in the first quarter, an increase of 2.3% over the prior year period, with a decrease of 1.5% on a constant currency basis. These results reflect the impact of one less billing day in the quarter.","On a similar basis, in the Asia Pacific region, we increased sales by 2.6%, while our America sales decreased by 2% and our Europe, Middle East and Africa sales decreased by 3%.","As expected, our adjusted gross profit margin came in at 72%, which was 320 basis points lower than the prior year period due to continued incremental manufacturing and inventory costs primarily at our Warsaw North Campus facility, as well as the impact of price declines and the negative year-over-year impact of foreign currency.","In the quarter, we recorded pretax charges of $267 million in special items, which included approximately $100 million of cash outflows for quality remediation, business integration and other items. The non-cash charges primarily related to intangible amortization.","Our diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.85. Adjusted first quarter 2018 figures in the earnings release exclude the impact of the special items that I previously mentioned.","Our adjusted operating profit in the quarter amounted to $572 million or 28.3% of sales. Our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 20%. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $1.91 on 204.6 million weighted average fully diluted shares outstanding. A reconciliation of reported net earnings to adjusted net earnings is included in this morning's press release.","Operating cash flow for the quarter amounted to $490 million, inclusive of the previously mentioned cash special items and our free cash flow was $403 million. Free cash flow exceeded our expectation, primarily due to the timing of certain capital expenditures and accounts receivable collections.","Please note that in March, we borrowed $400 million under our revolving credit facility and issued $750 million of senior notes. The $1.150 billion in proceeds were used to repay senior notes on April 2. Due to the timing of these events, we have temporarily higher-than-normal cash and debt balances as of March 31. Our net debt of approximately $9.3 billion at March 31st is approximately $270 million lower than December 31, 2017.","I'd like to now turn to 2018 guidance. In our press release this morning, we highlighted a number of guidance items, which should help you and your modeling as you think through 2018 and beyond.","We expect full year reported sales to increase between 1.5% and 3.5%. Note that these numbers include a positive impact from foreign exchange of between 200 and 300 basis points, which will be more favorable in the first half of the year compared to the second half. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, we expect our operational growth to be approximately flat, turning slightly positive in the back half of the year.","Looking at profitability, we expect operating margin to be between 27.5% and 28.5%. It is important to note that while we are pleased with the progress we are making in the consistency and volume of production from our Warsaw North Campus facility, we continue to incur increased levels of manufacturing and quality cost in that plant.","As a reminder, a significant amount of these costs become capitalized into the inventory base and released to the P&L as that inventory is sold, meaning that the gross margin headwind will continue for about a year after those costs are incurred.","Further, over the past 18 months, the operations team has been solely focused on quality remediation and supply recovery and not focused on driving productivity initiatives.","Other items impacting our operating margins include the growth investments funded by U.S. tax reform and the incremental expense from our incentive compensation programs compared to the prior year. It is important that you take these items into account as you model 2018 and beyond.","We expect our adjusted tax rate to be between 18.5% and 19.5% for 2018, and we expect adjusted diluted earnings per share to come in between $7.67 and $7.80 per share. For 2018, we expect free cash flow generation to come in between $1.1 billion and $1.3 billion with the majority of that being used for debt repayment in 2018.","As you think about your models, I want to help you with a couple more items. You should expect interest expense to come in at approximately $300 million, significantly below last year as we are benefiting from the continued reduction in our debt levels. In addition, weighted average fully diluted shares outstanding should be slightly above the average levels you see in the first quarter.","To summarize, our focus in 2018 is on continued progress and quality remediation and supply recovery, as well as launching several key new products and investing in programs to drive topline growth.","While our operating margin is pressured this year for the reasons I've outlined, we expect modest margin expansion in 2019 and we are committed to further expansion in the future as our topline accelerates.","With that, I'll turn the call back to Bryan.","Bryan Hanson","Thanks, Dan. While our first quarter performance continues to reflect supply related headwinds, as well as our ongoing quality remediation work, we remain deeply confident in the foundation of our business. And while there is some ongoing risk and much work remains to be done, we continue to be pleased with the steady progress we are making in these areas.","With that, I'll turn the call back to Cole, who will take us into Q&A.","Cole Lannum","Thanks, Bryan. Before the Q&A session, I would remind you to please limit yourself to a single question with a brief follow up if needed. Feel free to put yourself back in the queue if you have further questions and that will us to get to as many people as possible.","With that, operator, may we please have the first question?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs.","Isaac Ro","Good morning, guys. And thank you. Wanted to focus on the gross margin commentary, could you give us a sense of trajectory, you know, your prior quarter guidance had called for, I think, 72% to 73%. You're at the low end of the range of that prior guidance range this quarter.","Should we expect the gross margin trajectory to decline as the year progresses, because I just want to make sure we reconcile that to score up with the EPS guidance that you just gave us? Thank you.","Dan Florin","Sure, Isaac. So in January, we did give a range of 72% to 73% on the gross margin. So today, while we're not providing specific gross margin guidance, we did provide guidance on operating margins, which does provide some indication that the gross margin rate remains under pressure throughout 2019 and that's really due to two factors, as I said on the prepared remarks.","The first one is we've been incurring the elevated production costs in the North Campus since early 2017, and these elevated costs will continue through this year even after supply is fully recovered.","These costs are capitalized into the inventory base and flow through the P&L as the inventory is sold. So we began seeing these costs in the P&L in the second half of 2017 and will continue through this year and also into next year.","The second element is the lack of productivity initiatives that I described, so we're not getting any offset against pricing declines, for example. So those headwinds will continue through the year and I think that it's fair to assume that the gross margin will stay under pressure relative to the - what we posted in Q1.","Isaac Ro","Okay. I understood. Thank you.","Cole Lannum","Thanks, Isaac. Next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Amit Hazan with Citigroup.","Amit Hazan","Great. Thanks, good morning. So just curious what's your assessment of the U.S. hip and knee market in the quarter? So far I realized not everyone has reported, but just in terms of growth and more importantly what are you assuming for U.S. market growth in hips and knees in your 2018 guidance? Thanks.","Dan Florin","Sure, Amit. This is Dan. So consistent with our expectations based on what we've seen from one competitor and ourselves, we believe the U.S. large joint market decelerated by about 100 basis points relative to the Q4 growth rate.","Of course, we won't know the full market model until everybody reports. I would characterize it as the U.S. market was down a bit more than we expected. The U.S. hip market declined a little less than expected, but in the aggregate about what we expected. So we pegged the U.S. hip and knee market about 1% during Q1 compared to just over 2% in Q4.","I think that it's important not to get too concerned about quarterly fluctuations. If you look over the past three years the U.S. knee market has average about 3% growth and the hip market about 2% growth. So nothing in Q1 surprised us and we continue to view the market as quite stable.","Amit Hazan","So just to confirm then on that second part\u2026","Dan Florin","Go ahead.","Amit Hazan","Yeah, on the second part of my question then, are those the growth rates that you're assuming for the year basically in your guidance. Is it the last three year trend?","Dan Florin","At this point, Amit, we're assuming similar growth rates to what was seen in 2017.","Amit Hazan","Thanks.","Cole Lannum","Thanks, Amit. Next question please.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Glenn Novarro with RBC Capital Markets.","Glenn Novarro","Hi, thanks. Good morning, guys. Bryan, can you provide a little bit more color on the new 483 observations at the North Campus received. And do these new observations in any way impact the supply recovery that sounds like you're still on track to get back to normal by the beginning of 3Q? Thanks.","Bryan Hanson","Yeah. I mean, no problem, Glenn. So first of all, what I would say is I doing want to get into obviously too much detail relative to the 483s. But I will tell you this. Obviously, this is brand new. We just got the outcome this week, so this is hard off [ph] to press. And we're still working through the information where we see from the FDA. And believe, we're not just looking at this internally, we also have our external advisers taking a look at it with us as well.","But what we know now, based on what we see today, we obviously felt comfortable giving you the FY '18 guidance that we just gave you. And inside of that guidance, obviously, we have some assumptions around when we're going to see supply recovery and we feel comfortable with those.","That said, I think this is really important that I say this, you know, for us the primary focus will always be patient safety. If at any time, we think that we're putting patients at risk, which, obviously we don't, but if we do, that we're going to take the right actions to make sure we take care of those patients.","I do want to just maybe take a second though and just pull up a little bit. When I think about our FY '18 guidance and really the color we're putting in place for 2019, it's not just quality remediation, it's a variable. That is clearly one of the variables we considered, but it's also just supply recovery for any reason.","Timely product launches that we need to have and get those to scale, which we define as full launch is very important. And I really do believe we're going to need to see a shift in the culture and the engagement of this organization.","So just no, it's not just the quality remediation we're taking into account. All of those variables, risks and opportunities and that really has what guided us through the guidance we just gave you.","Glenn Novarro","And can you just as a follow-up, can you give us at least a number of observations you received. Were they less than the last time, any additional color? Thanks.","Bryan Hanson","I think the only the color I'd provide is really we want to work through these and keep in mind it's fresh. It is less than the previous time the FDA was in. But to me it doesn't matter, In fact is we have observation, at any level of observations I want to take them extremely seriously.","We don't mess around when it comes to quality. Any observation is not a good thing, and we are going to tackle it as aggressively as we would even if that was more. It doesn't matter if it's less or not to me, I want to tackle these things extremely aggressively.","Glenn Novarro","Okay. Great. Thanks, Bryan.","Cole Lannum","Thanks, Glenn. Next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kristen Stewart with Deutsche Bank.","Kristen Stewart","Hi. Thanks for taking my question and thanks for the updated schedules within the press release, they are really helpful. I just wanted to touch on some of the color that you had from the 2019 comments. I want to make sure I understand those correctly.","So if I'm hearing you are right, we should continue to see gross margin pressure extending into 2019 as some of the capitalized costs are realized through the P&L. And then you had also commented, I believe that you do expect to see some operating margin expansion.","So maybe just touch on how much - how you're thinking about the reinvestments there and the commitment towards seeing operating margin expansion in 2019? Thanks.","Dan Florin","Kristen, this is Dan. So we're obviously not giving guidance here for 2019, I want to make that quite clear. But I do think it's fair to assume that cost of goods productivity is not a driver of operating margin expansion in 2019 for the reasons that I described.","So the drivers of modest operating margin expansion as we think about them today really starts with acceleration and sales growth, particularly our expectation that U.S. sales growth would accelerate. And with that sales growth acceleration we would expect to see some favorable product mix impacting gross margin.","We also expect while we're making the investments here in 2018 that will start to bear fruit on the topline and we should be able to drive slight SG&A leverage without hurting our ability to invest into the business for growth.","So given the potential of modest operating margin expansion, some financial leverage, I would tell you that we would be disappointed if we didn't have some amount of earnings per share growth in 2019.","Bryan Hanson","And Kristen remember too though part of the message today on 2018 for which we are giving guidance is that those operating margins need to come down from where the street is right now. Once the street gets those into the appropriate realm, that's based off of which Dan is talking about we think we're going to expand.","Kristen Stewart","Okay. That's helpful. I'll jump back in the queue.","Cole Lannum","Thank you very much Kristen. Next question please.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Larry Keusch with Raymond James.","Larry Keusch","Okay. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Bryan, you mentioned in your prepared comments that you've been out on the road meeting stakeholders. I guess I just wanted to get some impressions of sort of what you're hearing from customers you indicated you met with surgeons. And I guess, along with that, how do you set the sales force morale and retention at this point and things that needs to be done to make sure that, that organization stays in place?","Bryan Hanson","Yeah. I'd say - I've been really pleased with the amount of connections that I have been able to make in a relatively short period of time, not just with the customer base and surgeons, but also with the commercial teams as I've already referenced.","And I got to say, of course, it could be who my sales organization is spending to, but the surgeons that I'm talking to and there is been quite a few of them as I mentioned feel very confident about our business. They are frustrated that we're in our own way, obviously. But there's a real commitment to this business. There is a real sense that we do have the right product portfolio as we've combined Zimmer and Biomet with the new products coming as well.","So I get this real desire to seize Zimmer Biomet win in a real comfort level and confidence in the product that we already have. So that's what I'm feeling from the surgeon customer base.","I don't want to diminish the fact that we're disappointing them, and we are, and I hear about that as well. But what my general sense is that people are committed to us, and we are not seeing more churn than we would typically see from our surgeons.","Now we're also not on the offense because we have the product supply issues, so even though we're not losing as many more surgeons than we typically would, we're also not feeling the funnel with new surgeons because we're not in the offense. So I just want to be pretty clear on that.","From a sales perspective, I'd say just a fact that I've been in the field around the world visiting with our either direct reps or distributor reps, there is a comfort level that I'm going to be paying attention in the senior leadership team, as a result of that will be paying attention to them.","And even just that attention alone seems to have an extra skip in the step of the commercial organization. And I do get a lot of emails, a lot of text messages when the folks that I talked to, they are saying that they are energized more than they have been in the past.","I also do believe from our retention standpoint, we're so close now to supplier recovery. We're so close now to this new culture that we want to bring to Zimmer Biomet. It would be crazy for people that have hung this long to leave now. So that's just my general feeling on it.","Larry Keusch","Okay, great. Thanks very much. I appreciate the thought.","Bryan Hanson","No problem, Larry.","Cole Lannum","Thank you, Larry. Next question please.","Operator","The next question comes from David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.","David Lewis","Good morning. I got two related questions, both kind of around cost and levers. The first thing is for Dan, the second for Bryan. So Dan, for us today the single best biggest incremental information, sort of incremental investment, I wonder if you just talk about what's new over the last three months from either the operating investments or reinvestment of the business and non-GAAP spending and sort of the pacing of the next several quarters?","And then for Bryan, thinking about the profile this business, I think your commentary base suggest you get back to market growth around 3% by 2020, 18 to 24 months from now. When you get there, what's the commitment to leverage earnings for this business? What's your philosophy around leverage earnings and what investors can expect? Thanks so much.","Dan Florin","Okay, David. First on the investments, so I think you're referring to taking the benefit of tax reform and reinvesting in the business. So, really two categories of investments, and I can tell you that there's really not much of that in the Q1 results. So part of the margin, the operating margin pressure on the back half is because we're investing above the line, but we're getting our benefit below the line.","And the investments in the business, as Bryan said in his prepared remarks, our focus really in two areas. The new products, so both products that are in the pipeline, as well as the new products that we're launching and making sure that we get the full value as we launch those new products.","And then the second investment is in the commercial organization. And for competitive reasons, we're not going to get into the specifics of what those investments are, but just know that we're going to invest in the commercial channel.","I think the second part of your question really has to do with the cost of goods and as I described before, we continue to incur those elevated costs in the North Campus. Those began in 2017. And as I said in my prepared remarks, that will continue to be a drag in the P&L through next year.","And it is not the case that one supply is fully restored, as those costs go away. I think it's important to people understand these are mainly variable cost to produce parts out of the North Campus. And those variable costs are elevated because of what we had to do in terms of interim process controls and additional inspection because of the 483s.","So those costs are there in the North Campus, and over time, we're going to drive productivity initiatives. Certainly, the addition of key operations talent from Ken Tripp who has a track record of delivering productivity across the network, and be very focused on that. The first and foremost, of course, is quality remediation and supplier recovery.","Bryan Hanson","And I think on that just - kind of draft of what Dan just said. Just recognize that when supply recovery occurs, it doesn't mean that we get an immediate drop in cost in Warsaw, I just want to make sure if that's clear because to continue to operate in Warsaw in any way, shape or reform even when supply recovery is in place is still going to be elevated.","As we said, we're going to get to tackling those costs and reducing them but because of the capitalization, you don't get full effect of those cost reductions for 12 months. But we will be something we're absolutely going to be concentrating on, but I just want to make sure it's clear. Those elevated costs don't go away just because of supply recovery happens.","So David, on your second question, I just want to be clear, absolutely. I mean, we're in the game to drive leverage in the P&L. At the end of the day, we have aspirations to be a top quartile performer and total shareholder return. And to do that, you've got to have revenue growth for a certain level and you absolutely got to be able to tie leverage in the P&L. That will be a focus for the organization.","I do want to make sure that I provide some clarity though around - when I talk about 18 to 24 month turnaround, what does that mean? I think first and foremost, is I've already said, it means we will consistently, I think, consistently is a really important word here, deliver growth rates at or above the market that we're playing. Our weighted average market growth, we say right now is about 3%.","Now to me consistently means I want to do it for the full year. So 2020 is that fiscal year that I feel we're going to get that accomplished. Two things kind of inside of that that I think are really important takeaway.","First one is, if everything goes right and our job as leadership team is to try to make sure it goes right, we will absolutely have the opportunity to have quarters before 2020 at or above market growth. I just wouldn't consider that consistently until we get it for full year and I think that first full year, as I said, is 2020.","I also want to say that once we do these short term things to stabilize the business, I want to quickly get to active portfolio management. Hiring Rachel is the first step in that direction, but believe me, it is high on my mind, I'm not a very patient person around the type of thing.","So I don't want to make sure that we get to active portfolio management with the intent of acquiring businesses or potentially divesting businesses that will allow us to increase our weighted average market growth.","First and foremost, those decisions have to be supportive of our mission, they have to - need all the financial metrics that we have, but we're going to be very focused on increasing the weighted average market growth of this business. So you can think about what I would say for sure, if we do the things that I want to do that 18 months to 24 months from now, the portfolio will not look the same.","And guaranteed one can assume that the moves that we make will increase our weighted average market growth and give us the potential to grow above 3% when we do that turnaround.","So I just wanted make sure I am very clear on that, that we've got the remediation stuff done, we've got to make sure that we get in place, but portfolio activity will be something we're going to be concentrating on.","Cole Lannum","Thanks, David. Next question please, operator?","Operator","We'll take our next question from Bob Hopkins with Bank of America.","Bob Hopkins","Thanks very much for taking the question and good morning. So I've got two questions. First, Bryan, sorry to harp on this, but I just wonder if you could explain a little bit more detail why you are confident the supply will be coming back beginning of third quarter despite the fact that you're talking today about additional FDA observations in the North Campus? Just what specifically increases your confidence?","Bryan Hanson","Yes, Good to talk to you, Bob. I would say, let me think if I am half ready, I absolutely feel more confident than a quarter ago and I'm really trying to gauge what I'm saying here versus the last time that I talked to everybody publicly on this. I do feel more confident, and there is basic reasons why and it sounds simple.","But every day that goes by that we don't have a mishap [ph] in the facility, it takes us off our schedule. And I'm going to say a material mishap because it happens all the time. But if we don't have a material mishap that gives me more confidence that we're moving in the right direction.","And just to put this into context, face value, every day that goes by that we don't have an issue, we burn down risk associated with the project time line, with the complexity of the project. And so just getting through the days without an issue burns down risk just by the very nature of moving through time because it reduces the complexity of the project and it gets us through these major project milestones.","I also feel and not that it has happened yet, because it's brand new, but I also feel that having key talent like Ken Tripp and the other people that will be coming into the organization is going to help us in this area.","And I would say not just with supply recovery, but I also think that as was mentioned before, really moving to that next phase, which is a very disciplined approach to removing costs from the entire footprint that we have in operations. We need to see that.","Now unfortunately, as we've already referenced, once you get to the point, there is a delay in realizing that benefit because the way it was capitalized. But the fact is we got to get moving. And so that new talent is going to help us with stabilization, but also get to the point we start to cost reduce.","And I would say this inside as well, I'm very pleased that Adrian Furey who was running operations with us before is staying with the organization. This is big win. Ken Tripp coming in, Adrian's moving with his family after an [indiscernible] back to Ireland. He's staying at a high level position within the organization with all the brainpower and capability that he has that is a big win for the organization.","Now the risk to this, right on the supply recovery piece and which you're calling out is not done yet, right. We've gotten the external suppliers moving. We've gotten through B&Bs. Remember before I was very worried about the process, the zero process of B&B, we're through that. But I still need to see consistent volumes coming from those automated suppliers.","And so far they are there, but every month that goes by that we have those, my confidence level grows. We've stabilized the workforce in Warsaw. But I'd say right now, we can't take our eye off the ball. Crazy as it sounds, this is a very difficult place to hang on the talent, the talent war in Warsaw is real and we need to make sure that we keep our eye on the ball and continue to keep folks in that factory.","And you just mentioned, the biggest thing that we've got to keep an eye on here is quality remediation. And although we're making progress, we're absolutely not there yet. The fact that we got additional observations tells us that.","So we need to be very vigilant in absorbing what the FDA has given us, ensure that we get on top of it and remediate. But that is a single biggest risk at this point, obviously, supply recovery. So I feel better about our position, there's no question about it, but I'm absolutely not naive around the risk that is still in front of us.","Bob Hopkins","Very helpful. Thank you so much for the detailed response. And then one quick product question as a follow-up, can you just talk a little about what happened to hips in EMEA this quarter and maybe a little bit on the shoulder launch side. Hips in EMEA seemed to be a little light, just - was there anything particular going on there?","Bryan Hanson","Not really, to be honest with you. As we have mentioned before, we thought we'd see a little bit of lightness in the U.K. That came to fruition. In general, we feel pretty confident. The fact is whenever we see after the first quarter and beyond is built into the FY '18 guidance we just gave. So our confidence level in the EMEA business is still there.","Bob Hopkins","Great. Thank you very much.","Cole Lannum","Thanks Bob. Next question please?","Operator","Our next question comes from Matthew O'Brien with Piper Jaffray.","Matthew O'Brien","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I'll ask both together, primary and then a follow up together here. So first of all, on the revenue guidance for the year, you just came off of your toughest comp of the year. And then as I look at the rest of the year on a two year stack basis, you're actually assuming things get even worse than what you saw here in Q1 constant currency.","Can you help us understand why that would get worse, given the new launches, et cetera? Are you just trying to ultra conservative, is there something on the sales force side that we need to be paying attention to?","And then as a follow-up, Bryan, you mentioned portfolio management given your background, bringing somebody from St. Jude, are you interested in going outside of the traditional musculoskeletal space as Zimmer Biomet has really focused on historically? Thank you.","Dan Florin","Matt, I'll take the first one. So first with respect to the constant currency revenue trajectory, in Q1, we had the billing day impact which was just over 100 basis points. So embedded in our guidance is some acceleration on a constant currency basis as we progress through the year.","I mentioned back half of the year turning positive. I think the main issue there as we talked about before is as the supply gets healthy in July, you know, that delayed effect of revenue acceleration. So our guidance assumes full supply by July, the impact of - a delayed impact of revenue acceleration and continued momentum in hips and then we get the cementless [ph] benefit as well.","So there is - our expectation is acceleration in the back half of the year. It is quite modest because of that delayed acceleration. Just know that we're driving hard to continue to outperform that, but we feel good about how the year is set up.","Bryan Hanson","I just want to just comment on that too. You mentioned is it just conservative, we really don't believe that. We think it properly balances the risk and reward that we have as we move into the back half.","Dan is 100% right, the more that I travel with our sales reps, I can definitively tell you, there is a lack of trust even with me and they feel connected to whatever may be. There is a lack of trust what we say relative to supply recovery.","And there is kind of objectivity and subjectivity. So objectively, we're improving array and we get supply recovery. We're going to be objectively be there. Subjectively, any slight miss that we've been normal course of businesses in supply is going to be exacerbated in mind of sales representatives, they're going to slow down.","So this risk of delay in driving revenue once the supply recovery comes is absolutely real. I've seen it every time we're talking to sales reps, just want to make sure that you hear that for me.","On the portfolio management side, here is my thoughts on this and I'll let train if it goes through here. We are going to do two things. Number one, we're going to concentrate on getting deeper position in areas that we already play that happen to be a more attractive from a market growth perspective, where we think we can bring value, and where we think we can bring value","So there's no question we're going to double down on areas we're already in, that are more attractive from the market growth standpoint and continue to increase our position there.","But we will certainly look at if the opportunities are right and if I feel the mission will hit the financial metrics areas that are outside of the spaces that we play to diversify business and bring our weighted average market growth rate up. I'm not solely committed to either one of those, we will do both.","Cole Lannum","Thanks Matt. Next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.","Larry Biegelsen","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. So Bryan, I wanted to focus my question on the new product introductions. So you're launching a lot of important new products, I think five to six new ones. So from your perspective, which of the most impactful and why? And I had specific questions on ROSA which the streets obviously hyper-focused on the total EMEA [ph] application.","So what's your confidence in the second half 2018 limited launch, what are the steps you need to get there? And I don't think you guys disclosed kind of cutting mechanism. Are you ready to kind of disclose at this point? Thanks for taking the questions.","Bryan Hanson","No, obviously, I'm not going to provide any more information on ROSA's feature set that Dan already provided for competitive reasons. But I do feel confident right now. I mean, there's nothing that's indicating that we won't get to limited launch by the end of the year.","Obviously as I referenced before, with an assumption that we do hit the time line there would be a time lag between that limited launch and full launch which should be more in the mid-'19 time frame. But we're feeling good about where we are in the process.","And let's face it, we have some history here. It's not like this is our first robotics system. We had one in the brain, we're going to move into the spine and also in the knee. So there is a theme that is confident in the area and has the history of being able to get products to market on time. So that's specific to ROSA.","So just in general, I don't want to pick a specific product out and say this is the most important. I think it is the combination of the products that we have and I kind of think about it when I pull back and give the product development and we spend a lot of money in R&D. We need to be productive with that money.","And I first like to look at do we have the right portfolio mix that we're going to bring into market. And I can tell you firsthand, as I've been out talking to our sales reps, as I've been out talking to our customers. I'm hearing directly from them that what's coming in the pipeline is exactly what they're looking at - looking for and we're going to delight our surgeon customers with this, but very importantly we're going to fill the product gaps that we have particularly in the knee space.","So when I think about knee I'm very excited about launching things like Partial, cementless, revision, all in Persona family, which I personally believe is the best knee implant in the marketplace. It really does give you an option to personalize the knee size for the patient. And that's just the whole premise behind the technology. So once we round that line out, will not only have the best implant, but we're going to have the full portfolio, particularly when ROSA key application comps.","I think the thing that I always wanted to squeeze and pause on is that you know, fact is we're not going to have that full portfolio because I really do think the full portfolio is what's important here, ready to go, fully and offense someday 2019 with an assumption that we had time line that we currently have with product launches.","I also don't want to discount the steps we're doing at S.E.T. now our S.E.T. business is a focus for us. So the Comprehensive Baseplate, Sidus Stem-Free Shoulder, jogger stitch in sports I mean, people aren't talking about that. That's an exciting product in sports and other products that we're going to launch, plus the specialization of that of our sales organization is going to be an opportunity for future growth for us as well.","So I'm excited about the product launch and activity we have in front of us. I just want to make sure that everybody enthusiasm is properly focused on that kind of mid 2019 as that real offense of goal mode.","Larry Biegelsen","Thank you.","Cole Lannum","Thanks. Next question please.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Richard Newitter with Leerink Partners.","Richard Newitter","Hi. Thank you. I'm not sure if I missed it, but can you just update us on where you are with the ROSA robot on spine applications and the launch there? And then free cash flow into '19, you talked about earnings growth and some operations and capitalize cost that are going to flow through the P&L and take a little longer to materialize.","I guess, we should still though from a free cash flow standpoint, see some acceleration ahead of that kind of leverage to earnings growth. Is that the right way to think about it? And can 2019 be a meaningful free cash flow, kind of acceleration here? Thanks.","Dan Florin","Rich, let me take the free cash flow question first. So as I said, the guide for 2018 free cash flow is between $1.1 billion and $1.3 billion and our intention today is to use the majority of that to pay down debt. With that, what it will enable us to do is take our leverage ratio down from the year-end 2017 level.","Looking beyond 2018, our financial flexibility will increase as we continue to make progress and our free cash flow yield, particularly in the back half of 2019 and certainly, into the 2020, just based on earnings growth, but also based on a decrease in cash special.","So for example in 2017, our cash flows were about $0.5 billion. That comes down slightly in 2018 and then we expect that to come down even further in 2019. So I'd say the combination of earnings growth, better working capital management, we're already seeing that in the accounts receivable side and then a reduction in cash special, it's a combination of all that will increase our free cash flow yield.","Bryan Hanson","Great. And on the second question relative to the spine application of ROSA. First of all, you should think about it. What I'm excited about is being able to leverage the ROSA platform, not just in brain, not just in spine, but also in knee and potentially other places as well.","Knee is important because we're making significant investments in the robotic platform, and we will continue to do that. And as you have applications off of that platform that you can use, there's real value in return invested capital on that. So that excites me.","Brain, we just said was proved that activity right now. The community there couldn't wait for that. I'm very excited. It's a relatively small, but it is an important application of the technology.","Spine is pretty similar time frame to the knee application that I referenced. We're looking at around fourth quarter where we get limited launch as we move in 2019, will move into full launch and then I already talked about the knee application.","But again, I think the key takeaway here is each of these applications we believe will be beneficial in their individual areas with the fact that eventually, we can leverage the same platform for multiple applications is a real benefit.","Richard Newitter","Thank you.","Cole Lannum","Thank you. Next question, operator, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan.","Robbie Marcus","Great. Thanks for taking the question. Bryan, as I hear your comments about whether or not you have the right portfolio going forward, the two businesses that stand out to me is underperforming are dental and spine.","So maybe you could give us your latest thoughts on how the dental business fits in at Zimmer. And then what you're seeing in terms of integration for LDR and spine and your outlook for the 2018 market? Thanks.","Bryan Hanson","Great. Thanks, Robbie. So first of all, let me just talk about dental. Obviously, when we think about any kind of portfolio moves, I'm sure that you know that we wouldn't talk about anything that's active or even contemplated, so I'm not going to speak specifically about dental as being the target or not being a target for divestiture.","I will say just broadly speaking, as I mentioned before, I'm very eager to move into the phase of active portfolio management. Rachel, again, being on the team is a perfect example of my aggressiveness to try to move in that direction. She is fantastic, by the way, if you haven't met her, I'm sure you will meet her over the coming months or a number of you will.","Our goal is to move into that active portfolio management and I don't want to give specifics on where we're going to go. But the whole intent is to drive initially the organization forward, is to ensure that we have the financial metrics that we need to jump, make sure we have jump those hurdles.","And we need to increase the weighted average market growth of this business, period whether this new divestiture or acquisition with the ultimate goal of driving increased shareholder value. That's really where we are. So I won't say anything more about any specific targets or anything else.","Relative to the spine business though, I'm committed to spine, I'm committed to spine. Do I like the performance that we have right now? No.","55:37[Audit Start]Here's what I would say, we have a great new team. I'm not just talking about Lori running that business now collectively spine and CMF and Thoracic.","We have a lot of leadership changes that we've seen in spine, all the way down to the sales leadership a number of new people have come in at a senior level of sales that are extremely capable and have a lot of history in spine that I think they're going to bring value.","So now not only do we have the right portfolio, I truly believe we have the right team. There's a lot of stuff we need to the right now with channel strategy, typically with the LDR acquisition, we're moving rapidly through that right now and any disruption that we think that will come from that is built into the guidance that we already gave you. But make no mistake, we are committed to spine, we have the right portfolio, we now have the right team, we have opportunity there.","Robbie Marcus","Thank you.","Cole Lannum","Fantastic. Thanks. Next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joanne Wuensch with BMO Capital Markets.","Joanne Wuensch","Good morning and thank you for taking the question. Can we revert back to S.E.T. a little bit? This strikes me as a business where the end markets are growing faster than hip and knee and yet I would love to understand how you get sort of back to that market growth rate and how much of the pressure that we're seeing right now is products versus sales force versus maybe something else?","Bryan Hanson","Yes. I mean, what I would say just, specifically is S.E.T., Sports, Extremities, Trauma subcategories of that are very attractive. We want to land on of those areas what are going to be a primary growth engines that we have as a business to make sure that we're doubling down relative to investment. We already see a lot of investment going into those businesses.","We're already seeing commercialization changes to be able to specialize, and we are fully committed to driving growth in those more attractive areas. So in don't want to give any more color than that. I don't think that there's any reason at all that in the areas that we concentrate, we can't get market and quite frankly, I don't see - because of our low penetration in those spaces any reason why we can't be above market growth in those areas.","Dan Florin","Yes, Joanne, I would just add that S.E.T. is a product group that has been impacted by the supply issues out of the North Campus. So inside of that, there's a number of fast-growing key legacy Biomet sports Medicine, Extremities, Trauma products that come out of that facility.","The good news is, as Bryan has said, we're restoring to full supply on those products as well and I think that bodes well for the future growth rate. But the end markets are very strong, supply is recovering, we're investing in specialization and good things to come in S.E.T.","Bryan Hanson","And really, even in certain categories today, growth rate is pretty good.","Dan Florin","Yeah.","Joanne Wuensch","As my follow-up, how do you define the market growth rate?","Bryan Hanson","For S.E.T. you mean?","Joanne Wuensch","Yes, please. Your hips and knees is 2% to 3%. Is S.E.T. 5% to 6%?","Dan Florin","Yes. I'd peg it in that 5% to 6%. It's unlike hips and knees given the number of players on S.E.T., it's less precise market model, but that's how we think about it, about 2x the growth rate of large joints.","Joanne Wuensch","Terrific. Thank you so much.","Dan Florin","There's certain categories in that, that are even higher, some lower, some higher, but in aggregate, I would agree to that by mid single-digits.","Cole Lannum","Thanks, Joanne. Operator, we're coming close to the bottom of the hour. We're trying to get two more questions and really quickly if you guys can go fast. So next question, please.","Operator","We'll take Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI.","Vijay Kumar","Thank you guys for squeezing me in. So maybe my two quick ones are, one, may be when you look at the organic growth guidance for the fiscal year, can you comment on the cadence because we had negative 150 bps in Q1 and I believe that has a days impact as well. So should we be thinking about positive organic by Q4 and that offset sort of what we're seeing in Q1?","And second assuming the positive organic, that continues into fiscal 2019. Should we be expecting margin expansion in 2019? Thank you.","Dan Florin","Vijay, with respect to the organic or constant currency growth rate projection for the balance of the year, I did comment that we do expect positive growth in the back half of the year compared to the negative growth in Q1 even on a day adjusted basis. That's the first point.","Second point, I commented that we do expect some modest operating margin expansion in 2019. And with that, our expectation is to see some amount of earnings per share growth in 2019 as well.","Vijay Kumar","Thank you, guys.","Cole Lannum","Thanks, Vijay. And operator, one last question, please.","Operator","And we'll take our final question from Raj Denhoy from Jefferies.","Raj Denhoy","Thank you. Bryan, maybe high-level question for you. As I'm sure you can appreciate the last couple of years is kind of been death by a thousand cuts for investors on Zimmer in terms of the earnings side, right? Now you've given us guidance, $7.60 to $7.80 this year, kind of modest operating margin expansion next year.","And so, I guess, what I'm trying to get at is your level of confidence in those numbers, in terms of this the bottom year? Can investors now expect that this is the base upon which are going to build or there's some risk in these numbers?","Bryan Hanson","Yes. Thanks, Raj, for the question, number one, and good to talk to you on the phone. Here's what we really try to do, this is the reason why we delay giving you guidance until now versus the beginning of the year. We really wanted to take the opportunity to go through all the things that need to happen to be able to get the 2018 guidance to be materialized.","And I think even more importantly than that, the things that need to happen to eventually to get to the turnaround that we referenced. And we're trying to be as balanced as we possibly can in that calculus.","I mentioned it before, you got to have quality remediation comp, you've got to have supply, can't have slippage on that if you do have slippage it can't be by much you got to translate that into revenue recovery as well. You've got to have new products on time and that scale and you've got to make changes in culture.","All those things have variability to them. And we've really try to take into account what level of variability we can have, theI impact those things will have on the business and then give you a balanced view of what we think we can do from a guidance perspective.","So it's a level that we can, we've given you what we truly do believe is a realistic view of what this business can do, not just in 2018, but also with the color we've given you in 2019.","Dan Florin","And Raj, let me add something, I think it's important we try to give you a lot of color on this. On the revenue side, we think people are pretty close, there might be some sequencing issues as Dan discussed on some of his color upfront, it is going to be accelerating throughout the year. We need to get some of the - these things behind us before we'll see some of that acceleration.","But the real thing that I think people need to work on and the reason, quite frankly, why the range was below where current consensus is on EPS was on the profitability side and operating margin.","I think we've given you a lot of color there, but there are at least some people on the street that are just too optimistic on the operating margin numbers, and they need to come down. Hope that helps.","Raj Denhoy","That super help. That's helpful. Appreciate. Thank you.","Dan Florin","Thanks, Raj.","Cole Lannum","Okay. With that, folks, we're going to wrap up. I just want to say, first of all, I really appreciate the cooperation. We were able to get, by my count, 14 questions in on the call and I appreciate everyone cooperating and then trying to be quick on this, so we can get to as many as possible. From our standpoint, there will be a replay of this call later on today on our website. And if you have any follow-up questions, we will be travelling. But the best way to reach Derek, Bob, and myself is by email, so send us an email throughout the day. Enjoy the rest of your week. Talk to you soon. Bye-bye.","Operator","Thank you, again, for participating in today's conference call. You may now disconnect."],"23164":["Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc.

I would like to turn the call over to Matt Abernethy, Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer. As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded. ","Mr. Abernethy, you may begin you call.","Matt Abernethy","Thank you. Good morning and welcome to Zimmer Biomet\u2019s Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. I am here with our Interim CEO and our CFO, Dan Florin.","Before we start, I would like to remind you that our discussions during this call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings for a detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties. ","Also, the discussions during this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation to these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, are included within the earnings release found on our website. ","In addition to the earnings release issued this morning, we have also posted a quarterly presentation on our website at investor.zimmerbiomet.com, to supplement the content we will be covering this morning. ","With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over Dan.","Dan Florin","Thank you, Matt. Our third quarter results fell short of our expectations, driven by external and internal factors. These factors included softened domestic market conditions, the impact of the hurricanes and the Indian knee price reduction, as well as the pace of our supply recovery and the related delay in sales recapture within our U.S. business. We know that Zimmer Biomet can and must perform at a higher level and significant work continues to ensure that we deliver on our commitments to our customers and our stockholders. ","During today\u2019s call we will provide our insight into what drove the sales and production shortfalls within our U.S. business. In addition to our detailed plans to get our performance back on track, we will also provide an update on our production and sales recapturing initiatives to improve our near and long term results with respect to our U.S. business. Finally, we will discuss U.S. market conditions and our global performance by product category.","First, I want to take a moment to acknowledge the communities affected by the devastation of hurricane Harvey, Irma and Maria. We are thankful to report that all of our team members in the affected regions are safe. During the third quarter our revenue was impacted by these storms, resulting in approximately $5 million of headwind. ","Regarding our production at our Puerto Rico facilities, where we primarily manufactured some hip and trauma products, like many, we have encountered problems of mainly consistent power causing a more gradual return to full production than originally anticipated. Given the continued instability of infrastructure in Puerto Rico and current safety stock levels, we now expect some minor sales disruption in the fourth quarter and into 2018. ","Additionally, the government of India initiated a significant knee price adjustment during the quarter. This action has caused much disruption in the India market, resulting in a headwind of $5 million for the third quarter. ","Turning to our results, we achieved net sales of $1.818 billion excluding approximately 30 basis points of contribution from the LDR Holding Corporation acquisition. Third quarter 2017 revenues decreased by 1.1% from the third quarter of 2016, representing a decrease of 1.5% on a constant currency basis. ","Our results were negatively impacted by approximately 130 basis points due to having one less billing day through the quarter. On a constant currency basis, our Asia Pacific sales increased by 5.2%, while sales in the Europe, Middle East and African region decreased by 0.4% and sales in the Americas decreased by 3% compared to the prior year quarter. ","Let me now take you through our plans in greater detail. During the third quarter we made good progress in the execution of our quality remediation plan at the Warsaw North Campus and we remain on track to achieve the key milestones laid out in our Form 483 responses provided to the FDA in December 2016. These efforts will continue through 2018 as we have previously highlighted and will remain a key focus of our entire company. ","On the production front at our Warsaw North Campus, we achieved lower than anticipated production output of several key brands due to inconsistent yields from certain more complex manufacturing prophecies, as well as increased attrition beginning in August among our temporary direct labor workforce in Warsaw. This resulted in third quarter output being below our targeted level. . ","Reaching targeted and consistent output for certain manufacturing prophecies has proven difficult due to the added quality compliance measures, including in-process monitoring implemented as part of our remediation plans. Given these challenges we have accelerated our planned dual sourcing strategy for the previously mentioned manufacturing processes, which we expect will provide additional capacity starting in the second quarter of 2018. ","Within the current manufacturing environment we continue to make ongoing engineering process improvements, including targeted investments into equipment and key technical expertise to improve process constancy and output. ","As it relates to staffing, we have implemented new strategies to provide resource stability for the Warsaw North plan, including temp to direct hiring, to ensure we attract and retain the required skilled labor in Warsaw. ","We remain intently focused on resolving these challenges. For brands not impacted by the previously described process complexity, we expect to clear back orders and replenish safety stock consist with prior expectations, resulting in full supply by the end of the fourth quarter. For those brands attached to the more complex processes, we expect both backorders and safety stock levels to improve over the coming quarters, achieving full supply on all products during the second quarter of 2018. ","I would now like to turn to our sales recapture program in the United States. The production shortfall is directly impacting our ability to fully meet case demand and go on offence. During the third quarter we continued to experience low inventory levels across key brands within our knee, hip and S.E.T categories. Supply is the foundation to enable our sales recapture program and as supply improves, we expect the logistical burden on our sales forces to decrease, allowing us to better serve all of our customers and go back on offence. ","During the interim, our sales forces has focused on products that have not been impacted by temporary supply challenges, such as our market leading Persona Knee System, which recorded strong growth during the quarter. We also launched our Persona Partial Knee System, which is realizing positive momentum due to encouraging market acceptance. ","In addition, we have enhanced our customer engagement and responsiveness with chartered internal teams to ensure customers are bring appropriately communicated with as we work through production and supply initiatives. We also continue to make investments into our specialized sales forces and sales rep incentive programs to accelerate growth. ","Our global commercial organization and team members worldwide have shown tremendous resiliency and I am proud on their hard work and dedication. We know what we need to do and our team is working diligently to achieve our objectives. While the pace of our production and sales recovery has not met our expectations, I am encouraged by my interactions with many of our surgeon customers who continue to place their confidence in our portfolio, our pipeline and our people. ","As I alluded to earlier, a number of factors in the Musculoskeletal Market have impacted our results, including the previously mentioned effect from the hurricane and the knee price action by India. Further, we saw moderate step-down in knee and hip procedural volumes in the United States. Based upon those who have already reported, we estimate that third quarter U.S. Knee and hip market to be flat to positive 1% on a day adjusted basis, which was lower than our expectations.","These quarter-to-quarter market fluctuations appear to have driven by U.S. insurance dynamics causing more variability in the timing of procedural volume and contributing to our lower than anticipated third quarter sales. We view these market fluctuations as temporary and believe underlying market demographics point to a sustainable global knee and hip market growth rate up between 2% and 3%. With regard to pricing, we experience negative pressure of 2.1% during the third quarter. ","Turning now to performance by product category, as a reminder the growth rates I quote are on a constant currency basis and have not been adjusted for the 130 basis point impact from one less billing date during the quarter. ","Our third quarter knee sales decreased 1.7% from the prior year quarter, reflecting positive volume and mix of 0.8% and negative price of 2.5%. We continue to drive strong knee growth in the Asia Pacific region, where we generated approximately 4% constant currency sales growth, inclusive of the effects of the price action in India. We were also pleased with our sales results in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region. ","In the Americus our knee franchise was impacted by a softened U.S. market, as well as the headwinds I mentioned earlier related to supply shortfalls, which limited our ability to accelerate revenues. As we continue to work aggressively on resolving these near term challenges, we remain focused on a number of important development products to drive future growth. ","As I mentioned earlier, in September we announced the launch of the Persona Partial Knee system, which provides us with the ability to participate in the important fixed bearing segment of the partial knee market and complements our clinically trusted Mobile Bearing Oxford Partial Knee. ","The Persona Partial Knee also represents our first significant jointly developed new products since the Zimmer Biomet combination. We also continue to make steady progress towards the planned launch of our Persona TM Tibia Cementless Knee and the clinical evaluation of our Persona Revision system in the second half of 2018, as well as the clinical evaluation of our ROSA robotics platform for knee replacement application. ","In addition to these development projects, after reaching the milestone of over 500,000 Persona Knee procedures, our knee teams showcased the clinical success and versatility of our Persona Knee system to hundreds of surgeons at a global webcast surgical education event. The webcast was very well received and provided continued optimism for the future success of our Persona platform. ","Third quarter hip sales decreased 1.7%, reflecting positive volume and mix of 0.8%, a negative price of 2.5%. While we continue to achieve solid sales of our G7 Acetabular System, our Taperloc Complete Hip Stem and Arcos Modular Femoral Revision System; our hip performance remained challenged by supply constrains. As we focus on fully restoring production levels and closely engaging with accounts impacts by the temporary supply disruption, we will continue to pursue improved growth across our comprehensive hip portfolio, along with several important development projects. ","Now turning to our S.E.T product category; revenue increased by 1.1% over the prior year quarter. Our specialized sales forces delivered solid sales of our Gel-One and Subchondroplasty treatments, as well as our Quattro Link Knotless Anchors, the A.L.P.S. Total Foot System and our IntelliCart System for fluid waste management. ","Our surgical team had another quarter of strong execution and sales growth as a result of their dedicated sales channel and broad product offering. However, our overall S.E.T sales growth was challenged due to supply constraint that limited our ability to drive offense within our Sports Medicine, Extremities and Trauma portfolios. We remain focused on restoring supply levels across the entire range of our S.E.T offerings. In addition, we plan to introduce several new products in 2018, including our comprehensive Shoulder Augmented Baseplate, as well as a Stemless Shoulder offering, which we expect to be important growth catalyst. ","Our third quarter dental sales decreased by 4.4%. We continue to restructure our dental sales organization, specifically in some key Western European markets, which we expect to positively impact sales performance in 2018. Our dental business remains focused on executing both commercial and portfolio initiatives to shape the business for sustainable long term growth. ","Revenue from our Spine, Craniomaxillofacial and Thoracic category increased by 0.3% over the prior year quarter. We continue to belief from sales of our market leading Mobi-C cervical disc, however our spine performance came in below our internal exceptions due to near term revenue dis-synergies related to the commercial integration of our U.S. spine sales force. We are working diligently to mitigate these disruptions and to enable optimal cross selling through increased training and investment into working capital. ","Among our Craniomaxillofacial and Thoracic offerings we achieved another solid quarter of growth, supported by sales of our Trauma One Plating System and SternaLock Blu and SternaLock 360 primary closure systems, as well as our RibFix Blu Thoracic Fixation System.","I will now turn to our third quarter financial details before providing additional information related to our fourth quarter sales and earnings guidance. Our adjusted gross profit margin was 73% for the quarter and was 210 basis points lower than the prior year period, due primarily to lower gains from our cash flow hedging program, additional manufacturing costs at our Warsaw North Campus manufacturing facility and the impact of price declines. ","Gross margin was lower than anticipated, due primary to regional and product mix of our third quarter revenues. Our R&D expense was 5% of revenue at $91 million, a slight decrease from the same period in the prior year. We continue to prioritize R&D spending on what we believe are the most impactful programs, including our important knee programs, our robotic applications novel case fulfillment approaches and Zimmer Biomet Signature Solutions among others.","SG&A expense was $695 million in the third quarter or 38.2% of sales, 150 basis points lower than the comparable period in the prior year and consistent with 2017 trends. ","In the quarter we recorded pretax charges of $328 million in special items, which include $188 million of non-cash amortization, inventory step-up and a good will write-off related to one of our small non-core businesses. Special items also included $50 million of quality remediation expense and $90 million of integration expense and other items. ","Our diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.48 versus $0.78 in the prior year period. Adjusted third quarter 2017 figures in the earnings release exclude the impact of the special items that I just mentioned.","Adjusted operating profit in the quarter amounted to $542 million or 29.8% of sales, which was 40 basis points lower when compared to the prior year period, driven by the previously described gross margin decline, partially offset by SG&A improvements.","Our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was in line with our expectations at 23.2%, an increase of 210 basis points from the third quarter of 2016. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the quarter decreased 3.9% from the prior year period or negative 0.6% excluding the impact of foreign exchange to $1.72 on 204 million weighted average fully diluted shares outstanding. A reconciliation of reported net earnings to adjusted net earnings is included in this morning\u2019s press release.","Operating cash flow for the quarter amounted to $463 million, which reflects $111 million of cash expenditures, primarily for quality remediation initiatives and integration activities. Free cash flow in the third quarter was $344 million, $142 million higher than the third quarter of 2016.","During the third quarter the company paid down $490 million from our term loan and increased our borrowings by approximately 21.3 billion yen for our Japanese loan vehicle. Therefore when combined with our activities for the first half of 2017, gross debt reduction during 2017 has been $950 million.","I\u2019d like to turn now to our updated guidance. As a result of the previously described pace of supplier recovery of certain key brands manufactured at our Warsaw North Campus facility and the related impact on sales recapture, primarily in the U.S., we are adjusting our fourth quarter and full year revenue and earnings outlook. ","For the fourth quarter we expect revenues to be in the range of $2.10 billion to $2.50 billion, which includes approximately 175 basis points of favorable foreign exchange impact. On a constant currency basis, our growth rate is expected to be in a range of negative 1.8% to positive 0.2%, inclusive of a 20 basis point contribution from selling day impact compared to the prior year period. Therefore, our billing day adjusted constant currency growth rate is now expected to be in the range of negative 2.0% to 0%. ","For the full year 2017 our estimated revenue growth is now expected to be in a range of 1% to 1.5% over the prior year. Foreign exchange is now expected to increase revenues by 0.1%. Taken together, constant currency revenue growth over 2016 is expected to be in the range of 0.9% to 1.4%, inclusive of 120 basis points of acquired revenue from the LDR acquisition. ","In dollar terms, our full year 2017 revenues are expected to be in a range of $7.760 billion to $7.800 billion. Our expected dollar range is down from our previous guidance range of $7.800 billion to $7.870 billion, with favorable foreign exchange partially offsetting the reduction in our constant currency growth rate.","Turning to EPS, the earnings flow-through from our lower sales expectation will again have a disproportionately negative impact on our fourth quarter profitability due to the regional and product sales mix, which is only partially offset by favorable currency adjustments versus our previous outlook. Additionally, we continue to invest in critical areas such as specialized sales forces, sales incentive programs, core R&D initiatives, including the knee and robot projects previously mentioned and sales support cost to maximize customer engagement.","We will also continue to incur incremental manufacturing and distribution costs, primarily in the Warsaw North Campus facility. These increased manufacturing costs are expected to continue to have a negative impact on gross margin throughout 2018, until we implement our dual sourcing strategy and more efficient and automated manufacturing and quality control processes.","Our fourth quarter projected EPS is in the range of $0.94 to $1.08. After the elimination of amortization, inventory step up in special items, our adjusted EPS is expected to be in the range of $2.08 to $2.14. This guidance assumes the fourth quarter effective tax rate of approximately 23.5%. As a result, full year earnings are now estimated to be within a range of $3.80 to $3.93. ","Special items for 2017 are estimated at approximately $1.260 billion. This is an increase of $25 million from our previous guidance, which is driven by the previously mentioned goodwill write-off, partially offset by lower integration costs. We expect investments in our quality remediation program for 2017 to be consistent with previously stated amounts. We expect our full year adjusted effective tax rate to be approximately 22% as we continue to execute important initiatives that will benefit our future effective tax rate.","Excluding the impact of amortization, inventory step up and special items, we are reducing our full year 2017 adjusted earnings per share guidance to a range of $8.01 to $8.07. This EPS range represents approximately 0.5% to 1.5% growth over the prior year or 4% to 5% growth when excluding the impact of foreign exchange. ","We expect free cash flow to be in the range of $1.125 billion and $1.225 billion. We expect to continue prioritizing our free cash flow in the fourth quarter towards debt repayment, continuing our path towards reduced leverage. Finally, please note our guidance does not include any impact from other potential business development transactions or unforeseen events.","Before we move on to our Q&A, I want to provide an update on our board search to select our next CEO. The process is ongoing and our board continues to make good progress, as it is committed to a thorough and timely search process.","In closing I\u2019d like to reiterate that we are not satisfied with our current results. Looking forward, we are focused on addressing our production challenges, to allow for greater sales recapture and to enable our sales teams to go back on offence. We will also continue to leverage Zimmer Biomet\u2019s diversified portfolio and a strong pipeline. The new products scheduled for release over the coming 18 months provides further optimism for getting our performance back on track and improving our growth profile.","With that, I\u2019ll open it up to questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Bob Hopkins with Bank of America.","Bob Hopkins","Thanks and good morning. So it seems to me looking at this release these are our two big changes. One is the remediation supply issues taking longer and the second one is just that the U.S. market is weaker. Before I get to those two, which will be my two questions, I just wanted to clarify, in the third quarter what was your organic growth, organic revenue growth adjusting for selling days, LDR and weather. I just want to make sure I have that number, because it\u2019s not 100% clear from the release.","Dan Florin","Sure Bob. So on a constant currency day adjusted basis backing out the LDR contribution its negative 0.2% and we described in the release or in my prepared remarks rather, that the impact of the India knee price cut and the hurricane impact is about, call it 50 basis points. So adjusting for that, call it a 0.3% Q3 performance.","Bob Hopkins","Okay, great, thank you. I\u2019m sorry if I missed that in the slide or something. So the two things I really wanted to focus on was one, on the remediation supply side, your pushing back your guidance for when you think it will be completely behind you. What is the one main reason why you are doing that? One main reason for the adjustment and can you quantify what you think the supplier issue, how much its impacting growth right now? ","Dan Florin","You know Bob as I said in my prepared remarks, the production output in the third quarter fell below our expectations, which means we did not make progress on reducing the backorder that we expected to, and really as I said, the drivers being a level of process inconsistency in certain core manufacturing or complex manufacturing processes, as well as the increased attrition in the temporary workforce. So a combination of those two factors led to the shortfall in [Audio Gap] production output. ","So I described what we\u2019re doing about that and in terms of the impact of that on the Q4, you know the point I would make is that our prior Q4 guide assumed we\u2019d be entering the quarter in a healthier supply situation and we had order of magnitude 200 to 250 bps of comp adjusted acceleration in the fourth quarter, really predicated on the assumption of having the supply to go on offense. So that\u2019s the biggest driver of the takedown in Q4.","Bob Hopkins","Okay, I\u2019m sure someone will follow-up on the attrition question, but I wanted to get your views on the U.S. hip and knee market. Most of the folks that have reported so far has seen a little bit of weakness, but your calling out a couple of specific things and reasons why you think the market is slower and I was wondering if you could just develop that a little bit more, because some of the growth rates we\u2019re seeing are you know growth rates that are, the week as its seen in sometime. So could you just kind of go in a little more detail on what you think is going on with the U.S. hip and knee market. Thank you.","Dan Florin","Sure. So based on what\u2019s been reported we estimate the Q3 U.S. knee and hip market was somewhere between flat to 1% on a day adjusted basis in Q3, which was below our expectations. Our expectations had been more in the 2% to 3% range.","Q3 is always the slowest from a seasonality perspective and has been the least predictable over the past several years. So we view this as more of a quarter-to-quarter demand dynamic as opposed to any systemic change in the outlook for hip and knee performance and market growth in the U.S. So we continue to believe that 2% to 3% global knee and hip market growth rate is sustainable and you know based upon underlying demographics. So we\u2019re not concerned about the ebb and flow quarter-to-quarter. We still believe in the long term tail of demographics and 2% to 3% global U.S., global hip and knee market growth rate.","Bob Hopkins","Okay, great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan.","Mike Weinstein","Thank you, and maybe I\u2019ll just pick up of where Bob left off there. So the comment in the prepared remarks about U.S. insurance dynamics impacting the end market growth, what are you referencing there?","Dan Florin","Well, I think it\u2019s just what we\u2019ve seen Mike is a lot of volatility quarter-to-quarter and I am referring to you know the higher prevalence of high deductable plans, which tends to cause people to have elective procedures on later in the year. It\u2019s just more difficult to predict. I don\u2019t think we have enough data points.","Mike Weinstein","This is nothing, but [Cross Talk] impacting the third quarter.","Dan Florin","That\u2019s correct.","Mike Weinstein","Okay. And then could you spend Dan just a couple of minutes on the dual sourcing strategy and what you\u2019re doing there?","Dan Florin","Sure. So I\u2019m referring to a number of more complex manufacturing processes that are in the North Campus, where despite a lot of excellent work by the engineers and that work continues, it\u2019s obvious that we need more capacity on these particular production lines. For obvious reasons I don\u2019t want to get into the weeds on what exactly those processes are, but in fact what we are doing in addition to optimizing inside the four walls of the North Campus, which we\u2019ll continue to do, we\u2019re also looking on the outside, a combination in our current network or with vendors, they add capacity for those particular production activities. So that\u2019s what we mean by dual sourcing. ","So we\u2019re accelerating that timeline to look for additional capacity that we need and that increased capacity should also as we continue to make improvements on the processes lead to more process and output consistency.","Mike Weinstein","Okay, and then last item on your comment on the CEO search, I recognize there is a limitation just to what you can say. You wanted to add anything relative to your thoughts on timing?","Dan Florin","No Mike, I would just say that you know as you can appreciate, I am not going to provide specific detail on the board\u2019s process, just that the process is ongoing and our board continues to make good progress and as we\u2019ve always said, we\u2019re committed to a thorough and timely search process. ","Mike Weinstein","Understood, thank you.","Dan Florin","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.","David Lewis","Good morning. Dan you just \u2013 a few quick ones here. Just starting this kind of fourth quarter guidance and getting a sense of how conservative you think that number is, it still implies by our math some acceleration in the momentum in the business into the fourth quarter and that has not happened in several quarters. So can you just give us a sense of what drives that underlying momentum acceleration into the fourth quarter and I have a couple of quick follow-ups.","Dan Florin","Well as I said before David, the prior guidance assumed much more significant acceleration predicated on full supply. What our Q4 guidance is not assuming is any of the Q3 market softness spilling into the Q4. In other words, our Q4 guidance is assuming a U.S. hip and knee market based upon historical seasonality Q3 to Q4, so we\u2019ve not layered that expectation on top. ","So I think the underlying guide in Q4 is assuming similar production levels to Q3, a market that\u2019s tied to historical seasonality and the type of progress on these non-affected brands that I described in my prepared remarks. In other words we are making progress on certain products coming out of the North Campus, which helps \u2013 put that in the hands of the sales force to drive some growth and then the last part would be, you know we\u2019re very excited about the Persona Partial Knee and that will continue to have impact in the ensuing quarters.","David Lewis","Okay, but if the market does not get better in the fourth quarter, this guidance theoretically could be at risk, said another way.","Dan Florin","Well, our assumption about the U.S. hip and knee market for Q4 is a 2% to 3% type year-on-year market growth.","David Lewis","Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. And then Dan, just two questions around earnings. The first question is cost dynamics in the quarter. If I take your revenue reduction for the fourth and I assume a pretty good drop through, you know you get kind of \u2013 you know $0.20 is the reduction for the fourth quarter roughly. I get kind of half that from a high margin product sales drop through. Is the other half coming from the cost of higher employee wages to keep them in their seats and the dual sourcing? Is that a decent way of thinking about it. It\u2019s sort of half increased cost and half about the top line drop through.","Dan Florin","You know the drop through on the sales is more than what your modeling, you know because the take down from the prior guidance is focused on the U.S. market, so that EBIT drop through on the mix of sales is more significant than the half that your describing. You know I\u2019d probably put of the takedown between the organic sales and the FX change. You know inclusive of the mix I just described that\u2019s about in the neighborhood of $0.12 of the take down and the balance being tied to incremental cost of goods, the combination of higher production costs and inventory charges tied to the North Campus performance. ","Matt Abernethy","Let me clarify the organic component of the take down David is around $65 million, but the offset of the FX benefit around $20 million.","David Lewis","Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. And then Dan I know its early, but if we think about it, there\u2019s a lot of consternation about what the 2018 could be last quarter and is it a decent way of thinking about next year? Do you still believe this business; you know A can grow modestly in 2018. Can you leverage the business growths 1% next year? Is that a decent way to think about core earnings growth? One way I am thinking about it is if the core business grows 1%, you lever earnings 1% and you get currency, you kind of come out at $8.20, $8.30 for next year. I just wondered if you just think about how this business can grow over the next 12 months. Thanks so much.","Dan Florin","You know David, I\u2019d say that we are going to provide 2018 guidance in early 2018. We have to see how the year closes and then go through our normal process, taking into account production, sales trends, gross margin etcetera and the investment needs and form thoughts more fully on 2018. ","I think it\u2019s important to point out that gross margins will continue to be pressured until we increase our U.S. sales growth and optimize the production of the products that are currently produced in the North Campus. So we have planned to do both of those things, but in terms of the gross margin profile, you know if you look at the gross margin profile in the back half of this year as revised, I think that\u2019s the right way to think about gross margin rate for next year. We\u2019ll continue to drive value creation programs across the enterprise. First and foremost top line growth is at the top of the list.","David Lewis","Okay, thank you very much Dan.","Dan Florin","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","We\u2019ll go to Chris Pasquale with Guggenheim.","Chris Pasquale","Thanks, good morning. Alright Dan, you never mentioned the close of the deals during the quarter but the legacies in your portfolio continues to struggle a bit there. How close do you think we are seeing that segment turnaround? Is it just a matter of lapping the impact of some rep turnover or do you need something else like new product flow to get it going in?","Dan Florin","Sure Chris. You know first we\u2019re very excited and continue to be very excited about the Mobi-C product line. In addition we expect the recent enhancements to our vitality system and the future robotic spine application to be key enablers to future spine momentum.","Certainly the recent results have been impacted by the market on the one hand, but probably more so the sales disruption and the channel integration. So you know at this point in time we continue to evaluate and I would say fine tune our sales structure to make sure that we\u2019re positioned for long term spine success. I think we have the portfolio that we need. We have a lot of talent in the sales channel and we\u2019re going to continue to look to fine tune that and make sure that we\u2019re getting that type of performance that equals the potential that we have.","Chris Pasquale","Okay. S.E.T. was such a bright spot last year and has taken a couple of steps back. I know that the Warsaw North issues are a big piece of that. But can you talk about the outlook for the business heading into next year and maybe in particular focus on that stem of shoulder launch. How that compares to the competitive product that\u2019s on the market today and how you think about that market opportunity?","Dan Florin","Sure. So year-over-year growth slowdown was attributable to more difficult comps, but also really for the first time seeing the cumulative impact on momentum due to supply constrains. So we\u2019ve been describing that from the North Campus. There is certain Biomet Sports Medicine, upper extremities and trauma products that come out of the facility. ","Importantly Chris S.E.T. remains a strategic growth driver for the company. It\u2019s a very important exciting market for us. We\u2019re clearly focused on improving supply first and foremost in shoulders, sports med and trauma. We\u2019re continuing to invest in specialized sales forces in the S.E.T. category. I think the results of surgical are an excellent proof point of what that can do from a performance perspective and then you\u2019re right, the launch of the new products in 2018, that includes the Stemless Shoulder, as well as the Comprehensive Augmented Baseplates. ","So you know we\u2019re the market leader in shoulders and getting the Comprehensive Augmented Baseplates out into the markets, an important addition, and we\u2019re very excited about the Stemless Shoulder. We think that\u2019s going to compete very nicely with the other stemless products that are out in the market.","Next question.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Kristen Stewart with Deutsche Bank.","Kristen Stewart","Hi, thanks for taking the question. Just going back to the gross margin question and gone looking ahead to 2018, how long do we think that or how long do you think that the gross margins will continue to be pressured by some other costs?","Dan Florin","Kristen, sure, sure. The gross margin pressure, the two contributors here in 2017 relative to prior guidance are the sales mix that I was describing earlier, less U.S. sales than expected and then secondly the production costs and related inventory costs out of the North Campus. ","So the sales mix will improve as we accelerate U.S. growth. The cost of goods from the North Campus as I described is going to persist through 2018 and frankly until we\u2019re, as I described, until we\u2019re into a more automated environment with validated processes and more process consistency in combination with the added capacity. Those are the elements that are needed really to drive improved costs and more consistent output.","Matt Abernethy","And to add on that, you know our expectations on what we have communicated previously, that program and the positive benefit on gross margin would start translating into benefit in 2019 and 2020.","Kristen Stewart","Okay, and I appreciate you don\u2019t want to give any sort of color on 2018 in terms of the specific guidance, but are there any other puts and takes that you can give us just to help frame 2018 at this standpoint?","Dan Florin","Kristen as I said, I really want to see how we close Q4, see what kind of momentum we have exiting the year and then monitor the progress that we\u2019re making on our dual sourcing strategy and the engineering improvements inside the North Campus. That will inform our view on production output, which is so critical to getting full supply into the hands of our great sales force to drive growth. So I\u2019d rather wait until our guidance early next year.","Kristen Stewart","Okay, that\u2019s fair. Thank you.","Dan Florin","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steven Litman with Oppenheim.","Steven Litman","Thanks. Hi guys. First of all, I was wondering if you could just frame for us about what percent of the recon business falls into the more complex products that are still supply constrained versus those that you feel that you are in a better position from a supply perspective?","Dan Florin","Steve I \u2013 you know without getting into the exact quantification of that, I would tell you that a lot of the brands that come out of the North Campus, which of course is you know a Biomet facility, a lot of those brands were in fact faster growing product lines and it stands knees, hips, sports extremities and trauma. ","So it\u2019s a significant facility for Zimmer Biomet. The complex processes without getting into the weeds on what those exactly are do impact a significant number of those brands and I think that the quantification of that is apparent in the impact it\u2019s having on our performance and our revised guidance.","Steven Litman","Okay, got it. And then Dan just a couple of products for next year. Can you talk to how much you think not having cementless has also impacted knee growth and how that may be important for the back half of next year? And then I know on Rose, obviously a lot of talk about getting into knees, but you\u2019re not really fully rolled out in spine yet. Is that also targeted for mid to back half of next year?","Dan Florin","Sure. We\u2019re very excited about the pipeline for 2018 and we\u2019re excited about what percent of partial knee will do for us in 2018, we\u2019re excited about getting the cementless Persona out and we\u2019ve had a competitor talk about cementless being as much as 20% of their knee mix that comes at a nice price point, so we\u2019re very excited about getting that out into the market middle of next year and we think that product will perform very well and then we\u2019ve also talked about getting the Persona revision system out into the market. So a lot of really important Persona product launches next year.","On the ROSA side we\u2019re on the knee application. Continue to make progress in accordance with the timeline that we\u2019ve described before and then keep in mind that the Medtech where the platform is currently approved for brain and you know we\u2019re very excited about that opportunity. So our craniomaxillofacial business, which is one of our best performing divisions in the company continues to drive good growth. It\u2019s under very capable leadership and that same leadership is overseeing the brain and spine ROSA development program. ","So on the ROSA Spine, the expectation is middle of next year to be out in the market. We think that product and application will compete very favorably with the other spine robotic systems that are currently in the market. ","Steven Litman","Okay, thanks Dan. ","Dan Florin","You\u2019re welcome. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Matt Taylor with Barclays. ","Matt Taylor","Hey, good morning, thanks for taking the question. I guess the first thing I wanted to circle back on was when you are talking about normalized 2% to 3% market growth here in Q4, can you comment on whether you are seeing that through the first month of the quarter or are you seeing any continued insurance dynamics or other soft spots that would cause the Q4 market growth to be lower? ","Dan Florin","Matt, our 2% to 3% U.S. market assumption is based upon historical norms. So what I was describing before is that we stuck with that assumption about the market and did not add on top of that the softness in Q3. So I\u2019m not going to comment on inter-quarter months, but I\u2019d say at this point the 2% to 3% U.S. knee and hip growth is the right way to think about it based on historical norms. ","Matt Abernethy","And just to add to that Matt is usually the big bowl of some procedures pushes into November and December, so near term read is obviously difficult, but there is no indication that we are aware of that, that\u2019s pointing to something other than what we communicated. ","Matt Taylor","Okay and then when we think about the improvements that you can make going forward to your ability to produce some of these key brands, you talked about 2Q \u201918 as being really the turning point when you\u2019d be able to have full supply. So can you just clarify it, does that mean that if you are going to really take until the third quarter for you to go back fully on offence or can we see that kind of early in the second quarter? I just wanted to get little bit more specific on the timing. ","Dan Florin","Yeah Matt, from a timing and recovery perspective, it\u2019s a rolling recovery okay. So during Q4 here we\u2019ll be making continued progress on certain brands; Q1, Q2 we\u2019ll continue to make progress and that incremental progress is critical and meaningful, because what means is that our sales force can then gradually move away from being the case logistics people that they have been to more higher trust that the products will be there and then going on offence and not only servicing existing accounts, but going after new business that we know is out there for us. ","So it\u2019s a rolling improvement. Some brands will continue to get healthy through Q1. My comment about Q2 was in the vein of having full supply ready to go on offence across all brands with our engineering improvements and duel sourcing strategy contributing to that pace of recovery. So you know, that\u2019s the comment relative to Q2 and that sets us up well for thereafter. ","Matt Taylor","Okay, thanks very much guys. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Kaila Krum with William Blair. ","Kaila Krum","Hey guys, thanks for taking our questions. First, I got this to start off; what percentage of your surgeon customers today would you say are waiting on the sidelines sort of prior to a complete supply recover here? Is it 20%, is it a third, is it as much as half; just any sense for that would be helpful. ","Matt Abernethy","Sure. You know I spent a fair bit of time in the field over the past quarter and continue to be impressed by the talent of our sales force, the belief of our sales force and our surgeons with respect to Zimmer Biomet. That\u2019s critical and gives me confidence that over time as supply recovers, that we are going to get the accelerated growth that we know is out there and I\u2019m confident that we are going to deliver on that. ","It is the case that surgeons are frustrated. They believe in Zimmer Biomet, they believe in their sales rep and you do have instances where we are able to fully supply surgeons and it is the case that you have other surgeons that are sitting on the sidelines waiting for the full range of SKUs available across our product family before they entrust their business act to us. So that\u2019s where our focus is. ","I\u2019d also add that the lack of full supply tampers our ability to bring on new surgeons at the top of the funnel so to speak. So we know the ticket is full supply, that\u2019s why we are focused on it and as that supply picture improves I have no doubt that our sales team will run with that and make good progress. ","Kaila Krum","Okay, thanks, that\u2019s helpful. And I guess just, you said we are going to reach supply stability by the end this year with a portion of the products and the rest by the second quarter of \u201918. I guess what sort of visibility do we have into that recovery at this time, and what gives you confidence in that statement made? ","Dan Florin","Well, with the guidance takedown that\u2019s embedded in our Q4, it tells you that production is the biggest barrier. So our assumption about production output for Q4 is that production is similar to Q3 levels and what gives us confidence on the recapture, which again is more of a exiting this year and gradually through next year, is tied to what I was describing before in terms of the interactions with surgeons and our sales force and their beliefs in the portfolio.","So we know what we need to do. Its tied to production of the North Campus, but it\u2019s also you know our team is executing very well with Persona and I mentioned good growth in the quarter on Persona; I mentioned the educational event that we did on Person where we had hundreds of surgeons attending that, demonstrating the versatility of both the implants and the instrumentation of Persona. So I know that our sales team is going to make a lot of progress with the Persona platform. ","And then on the production side of the house, the key is really as I described process consistency. So reducing the variability in those processes, getting redundant capacity out to either vendors of elsewhere in our network as duel source capacity; that\u2019s a combination of those two areas. ","Kaila Krum","Thanks guys. ","Dan Florin","You\u2019re welcome. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Matthew O'Brien with Piper Jaffray. ","Matthew O'Brien ","Thanks for taking the question and good morning. Just for starters on the guide down for Q4 by my math, you know net of currency its about $40 million guide down. I\u2019m assuming a majority of that is related to these complex products that you can\u2019t manufacture. So first of all, is that math about right and then secondly, is that roughly what we should expect in Q1 as far as the headwind that would will face in that business, maybe tapering down a little bit and then tapering down even more into Q2 next year. ","Dan Florin","So Matt, the Q4 takedown, you have the right net number. I think organically the number is north of that. The organic takedown as Matt mentioned before is more like $65 million with some favorable currency in the range of $20 million. So it\u2019s the organic takedown is north of the 200 basis points. ","And you know I\u2019d say the organic take down of 300, call it, call half of that being tied to supply and lack of offence. We also had dialed in Q4 guidance, prior guidance and acceleration in spine and as I mentioned before, we\u2019ve removed that from the guidance based on current performance as we need to drive improved performance in the sales channel and then to a lesser extent the impact being the India knee price, which we expect that to be a drag on Q3 as well. ","Matthew O'Brien ","And as the manufacturing push out goes, Dan how comfortable are you with you know the timeline that you\u2019ve laid out now of Q2 next year being you know completely finished with this issue and how, you know all inclusive or how broad is the plan that you put in place to ensure that that will be the definitive moment where all this issue is behind you from a production perspective, be it the duel sourcing etc. and then how does FDA fit within that timing? ","Dan Florin","Well Matt, we as I said in my prepared remarks, we continue to make good progress on the quality remediation in the North Campus. So we are very much on track with the remediation plan that we laid out for the FDA at the end of last year. So we feel really good about our progress there. You know it\u2019s been roughly a year since the FDA inspected the facility. We don\u2019t know exactly when FDA will come back in, but we will be prepared for them when they do. ","With respect to the production recovery and the timeline, you know operating this plant under the manual interim process control environment leads to greater variability and inherent risk that\u2019s associated with the output and it is what it is. What I am confident about is that the engineers are focused on the right areas for improvement. We brought in technical experts from the outside to help in that regard and we are also working closely with outside vendors who have certain capabilities, speculative confidence that they are going to be able to help drive that added capacity. So that\u2019s what gives us the confident to lay out the timeline that I just laid out Matt. ","Matthew O'Brien ","All right, thank you. ","Dan Florin","You\u2019re welcome. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Bruce Nudell with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Bruce, we are unable to hear you. Please check your mute function. ","Bruce Nudell","Hi Dan, could you hear me know? ","Dan Florin","Yes Bruce, good morning. ","Bruce Nudell","Yeah, good morning. You know post the Zuk divestiture, you had about 39% just in share. It looks to be about 36% now. Just given any lingering issues with supply that caused permanent customer defections, and perhaps sales force defections as well as a lack of a robot, where do you think you guys will add some tone, and you know how much of that is due to the lack of a robotic solution? ","Dan Florin","You know Bruce I would say that based on the early, well both the limited release and now the full release of the Persona Partial Knee systems, we are extremely confident in that platform and I personally talked to surgeons who have used the makeover for Uni Knees and are excited to use the Personal Partial Knee system. Those are surgeons that have had excellent success with the Personal Primary System and our excited about using the Personal Partial Knee. So we believe that we will win back market share that we lost as a result of this divestiture. ","Bruce Nudell","And you know but just more broadly, where do you think you know knee share will stabilize and where will you kind of \u2013 how much of that 39% did you get back. ","Dan Florin","Well our efforts, you know we have internal goals to recover all of the loss business of Zuk. We have again \u2013 the feedback is very positive on the Persona Partial Knee. So as we have full supply across all of our knee systems, we are in a good spot with Personal Primary, but as we get healthier on Vanguard and as we launch the cementless Persona and the Revision knee, our goal is to first and foremost get back to market growth. ","You know we\u2019ve been seeding share; that needs to stop. Supply in the pipeline into the hands of the sales force will enable that and first and foremost we are focused on closing the gap to market, then putting up a string of quarters at market growth and then above market growth thereafter. So it\u2019s a whole string of things that we know we need to execute on better and that will lead to market share gains. ","Bruce Nudell","And I guess my follow-up is, you know this is the first time I\u2019ve heard the company talk about expectations for the worldwide major joint market at 2% to 3%; it was always closer to 3%. I\u2019m sure that wasn\u2019t taken lightly, and how does the impact the boards perceptions, the necessity to move away from hips and knees?","Dan Florin","Well, to win Bruce for Zimmer Biomet we need to perfume in hips and knees and that, you know our performance in hips and knees in the Asia Pacific region has been excellent and that performance in Asia Pacific is really driven by the team and they\u2019ve not been as dependent on the North Campus products as much as the U.S. markets. But the team has done extraordinarily well and we expect them to continue to do so. The EMEA growth in the quarter for knees was quite good. ","So the 2% to 3% I would just tell you that we are still of the belief this is an attractive market. The demographic tailwinds are real, so we are committed to growing hips and knees. For us to win, we need to perform really well there. At the same time, we\u2019ve talked a lot about the S.E.T category; you know 21% of our sales mix today, why we are very excited to continue to perform there. ","It was hampered by supply this quarter, that will improve over time and we\u2019ll look to continue both organically and inorganically to add to the S.E.T bag. It\u2019s a critical driver for us and last piece being spine, so my comments about spine and our potential to drive accelerated performance there. So it\u2019s really across the portfolio where we need to perform. ","Bruce Nudell","Thanks so much. Bye.","Dan Florin","All right Lauran, we have time for one last question. ","Operator","We\u2019ll go to Joanne Wuensch with BMO Capital Markets. ","Joanne Wuensch","Thank you very much for talking the question. Could you qualitatively discuss what\u2019s going on with the sales force? How you are thinking about keeping them in place motivated and making sure that they see there is a turning point in this process?","Dan Florin","Absolutely Joanne. I mentioned the amount of the time that I\u2019ve personally been spending in the field and that includes direct time with our sales leadership for the orthopedics business and as well as a good piece of our spine sales force. ","So in a nutshell, we continue to post them regularly on the updates with respect to supply. On top of that, we are placing a tremendous focus on all of our team members on supporting our sales channels globally. I think importantly we\u2019ve seen relatively stable levels of attrition; so a net neutral performance from a headcount standpoint of the channel in the United States here in Q3. ","So I think that is indicative of a sales force that continues to believe in Zimmer Biomet, continues to believe in our products and our pipeline and a lot of high touch with them and communication will be necessary as we continue to move forward. So I believe we got the best sales force in the industry. We need to fully equip them with all the tools they need to win, that\u2019s where our focus is. ","Joanne Wuensch","Thank you and as for my second question, it\u2019s going to sound so mundane given everything going on. SG&A was nicely down as percentage of revenue year-over-year. Are there still expense synergies to be had by the combination of these two companies?","Dan Florin","Joanne, we\u2019ve described here in 2017 synergies in the neighborhood of $225 million, and leading to $310 million cumulative, okay. So you know that, the integration synergies are on track through 2017. So as I described we\u2019ll continue to look at other value creation opportunities across the enterprise. We know that first and foremost it starts with top-line performance and acceleration. And then last bit on SG&A, you know our SG&A percentage includes the depreciation of our instrument placements, which is part of obviously a growth investment for us, so we continue to invest in the working capital and instrumentation necessary to drive growth. ","Joanne Wuensch","Okay, thank you very much. ","Dan Florin","So, thank you everyone for your attendance today and we look forward to speaking with you on the fourth quarter call. Thank you.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, July 26, 2019. Following today's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions]","I would now like to turn the conference over to Cole Lannum, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and IRO. Please go ahead, sir.","Coleman Lannum","Thank you, operator, and good morning. Welcome to Zimmer Biomet\u2019s second quarter earnings conference call. I'm joined by Bryan Hanson, Suketu Upadhyay, and Dan Florin.","Before we get started, I'd like to remind you that our comments during this call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks and uncertainties.","Please note that we assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements, even if actual results or future expectations change materially.

Reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is included within the earnings release found on our website at zimmerbiomet.com.","With that, I'll now turn over the call to Bryan. Bryan?","Bryan Hanson","Thanks, Cole. Before we actually get into the quarter and any news of the back half of the year or beyond when don\u2019t we just go ahead and address the elephant in the room. I'm sure we have had a lot of people talking about the CFO transition. People have been writing quite a bit about it, even some people thought that may be the CFO transition might signal that we didn't have confidence in our guidance. This morning has already proven that's not to be the case.","This truthfully is just Dan's intent to spend more time with his family and who are we to get in the way of that aspiration, really that truly is what it is. Dan was kind enough to give us enough notice, me specifically, to be able to really set this up in an orderly way. Without that time you can't have a proper transition. You can't plan to organize this thing in a way that is not disruptive, and Dan gave us that opportunity. That's really what this is all about.","You know, the good news is, because we have done this an orderly fashion, I get the great opportunity to have an earnings call with two CFOs by my side and my IR guy. So I'm pretty much don't even need to be here today. So I'm looking forward to this call. I think I can actually relax on this one.","Suketu, I just want to say to you, welcome to the team, brand-new on the team. This is your first call obviously as CFO of Zimmer Biomet. Important day for us and important day for you. I can tell you that Suketu I had a feeling he would during the interview process, but the guy's jumped right in. It's just been a handful of weeks, but he is already getting to know the finance team and the broader leadership team. He is digging into the short-term financials to make sure that he feels comfortable with where we are, so a lot has been done in a very short period of time. I'm pretty confident the guy doesn\u2019t sleep.","I know that he is going to be a great cultural fit as a result of that, fitting in quite well with leadership team. I know that through the interview process and it's playing out already. Again, early days, but strong so far, and I think everybody knows that this guy brings a wealth of experience to our organization. He has been a finance leader and just general leader for many years and clearly has a lot of experience in the healthcare space, which is going to be extremely applicable Zimmer Biomet.","Given that you've had a few weeks, why don\u2019t we give you an opportunity maybe to just say a few words on your first impressions and that will start the business.","Suketu Upadhyay","Thank you, Bryan. I'd like to thank you and the rest of the team for all the introductions over the last couple of weeks and all the support in bringing me up to speed. My early observations are all very positive and if anything I think surprises to the upside. One, I think we've got a leadership team and more broadly than that an organization that has an aligned view of the strategies and the priorities of the company. Two, I've seen an organization that has a bias for action and that's really around patient centricity and value creation. And I think third, what I've seen is we clearly have a very strong corporate conscious to do things the right way operationally, from a compliance standpoint, and with the patient always in the center of deal.","So far the transition with Dan is going really well. I want to thank him for his counsel and his support. He has built some very high quality teams within the company and beyond that he is leaving a very positive and enduring legacy in many areas and many aspects of the company. I look forward to reconnecting with many of you and for those of you that I have not had the chance to work with me yet I hope to do that in the very near future. And all I can say is, I really look forward to driving value and being part of the team.","Bryan Hanson","Excellent, first words spoken as CFO is a [indiscernible] to the investment community. Welcome again to the team and we're looking forward to some big things from here. And it would remiss if I didn\u2019t say a few words about my man Dan sitting across me right now. I'd just say first of all this guys, I think everybody knows is a phenomenal leader. He has done so much for this organization over the years and truthfully from the very beginning, even in the interview process quite frankly, this guy has been there for me. Truly has been what I would just define is my right hand from the very beginning.","I think it's important not just to look at the capability as the finance leader and the leadership that he has provided ZB, but also the fact that this guy has high integrity. He is an authentic leader and he proves that to me every day. I would say Dan, we've made some pretty difficult decisions over the past year and a half, anywhere from talent decisions to structure, to culture, I mean you name it across the board some of these quite frankly were not easy decisions, not for me and certainly not for you. I know that they were probably more personal for you than they were for me because you've been with the business longer, but what I would say is you never let that get in the way.","This guy through and through has made the right decisions for the right reasons for the organization and I am 100% confident we would not be where we are today without your leadership. So I want to thank you again on behalf of all of ZB for your leadership over the years as CFO, as interim CEO and I want to personally thank you for the counsel that you provided me over the last year and a half. This is officially, I'll put in here quotes \"your last call as CFO of Zimmer Biomet.\" I'll be a little emotional for you, it is for me, and I want to give you an opportunity to say a couple of words.","Daniel Florin","Thank you, Bryan and really thank you for your kind remarks, very humbling. And I really want to thank you for your friendship and your incredible leadership of this great company. It is palpable [ph] the difference that you have made and your leadership has made. And it's evident in the turnaround progress that we're making. So thank you for all that you have done for me and for the broader ZB community. It's been a real privilege working side-by-side with you over the past year and a half and I look forward to helping you and the management team in the coming months on some critical projects. So thank you from the bottom of my heart, thank you. I appreciate it man.","Bryan Hanson","And the good news is, just to make sure we calm everybody down, although Dan does want to spend time with his family and again I'm very supportive of that, he is being gracious enough to give us time to make sure this transition goes well, the pass off responsibilities in an orderly way to Suketu and to stay on and as you just said, work on some key projects that we have. So anyway, again Dan, thanks so much, I appreciate it.","Why don\u2019t we go ahead and jump into the quarter now? So looking then at Q2, the team delivered another quarter of improving financial results with revenue growth driven by better performance in all geographic regions, as well as across most of our businesses. This morning we updated our guidance to reflect our increasing confidence in the ZB turnaround and our commitment to investing for growth.","Our people are focused and engaged at a level that I personally haven't seen since I joined the company. We're seeing real progress in the business and while we still have work ahead of us, I'm truly excited by our momentum. In terms of supply, we continue to drive efficiency throughout our supply chain to ensure that we meet increased demand for our products and drive confidence in our sales team. Our quality remediation efforts at our Warsaw North Campus remained on track and we continue to keep the FDA updated on our progress. We are highly confident in our progress and path to full remediation.","Additionally, we have now rolled out our culture program called \"Quality Begins With Me\" at all of our sites and we are building a sustainable quality culture as a result. We're excited by several key new product introductions this year and we are seeing the benefits of our engineering teams turning from quality remediation back to innovation to support what is becoming a robust pipeline in 2020 and beyond. Inside of these new product introductions, we are executing against our strategy to deliver an ecosystem of customer centric solutions, including our ROSA robotics platform and mymobility our digital health platform developed in partnership with Apple and our flagship Persona Partial and Cementless, as well as Knee System offering a more personalized solution for our patients.","We've also increased accountability and strengthened ZB spirit across the organization as a result of our new structure, new leadership team, and through our relentless focus on culture and connection to our mission. This is evidenced by a recent team member survey were more than 80% of respondents feel confident or very confident in Zimmer Biomet's future, strategy and leadership and feel the company is much better positioned today than a year ago.","Moving to our second quarter results, we benefited from continued strength in the Asia-Pacific region, another solid quarter in EMEA and improved performance in Dental, S.E.T., in the Americas particularly in the knee business. We are excited to report the best growth rate we've had in knees in the last three years. This is the result of continued strength in Asia-Pacific and improving growth in EMEA and most notably in the Americas. We are beginning to see the benefits of increasing confidence from the sales organization, better sales execution driven by more disciplined and rigorous operating mechanisms and our new product launches, particularly with critically with persona partial and Cementless, as well as ROSA Knee.","Specifically related to ROSA Knee even though we are in limited launch, system revenue did provide a benefit in the quarter, which we are confident will be further enhanced as we enter Q3 and beyond. Importantly, even when excluding ROSA sales in the quarter, our global knee business delivered positive growth, accelerated growth sequentially, and further narrowed our gap to market and it did all of this despite a tough comp in the quarter.","Speaking of new product launches, all the launches are delivering as planned or better. Since everyone is highly interested in ROSA, I'd like to take a minute to tell you how the limited launch is progressing. The ROSA knee system is receiving very high marks out of the gate and feedback from surgeons is very positive. While the overall number of placements in the second quarter remained relatively small, it's clear we have a solution that is attractive to our surgeon partners as evidenced by the surgeon feedback we received from the hundreds of procedures that we've performed since launch.","Most importantly though, demand is strong and it is growing daily. As expected, the internal and external energy around robotics is clear and as a result we intend to increase our investment in robotics as it relates to both research and development and commercial infrastructure. This increased investment will begin in the second half of the year which Dan will discuss later in the call.","Our S.E.T. business showed solid growth in the quarter as a result of supply stability which continues to grow sales force confidence, increased traction in the specialized sales channel that we've invested in and new product launches across the business. Moving into the back half of 2019 we will accelerate the expansion of the investment in our specialized sales channel in order to further increase our focus on these high-growth S.E.T. markets.","We also saw continued improvement from our dental business which has been gaining traction over the last few quarters. In fact, this is the best quarter for Dental since the Zimmer Biomet merger four years ago. Though there is still much work to accomplish, the focus on strategy, investing resources in priority areas, operational improvements and enhanced culture, have brought new energy to this business. While we saw broad improvements across our organization, we continue to see pressure in Bone Cement in line with our expectations, albeit at the lower end of the 10 million to 15 million per quarter we referenced in the past.","We also experienced growth deceleration in our Spine & CMF business in the quarter. Although we're not happy with our growth rate here, much of the sequential deceleration from Q1 is due to difficult comps. As we begin to retire some of the comp challenges, work through the final steps of our channel consolidation in spine, and fully launch a number of new products including ROSA spine and Walter, which will occur in the first half of 2020, we certainly expect to see improvement across this business.","So as you can see, we have a lot going on and we are making strong and steady progress. We have built a solid foundation over the last 18 months and have dramatically reduced the risk in the business. As a result, we have updated our 2019 full-year financial guidance to reflect our believe that we will achieve our weighted average market growth rate six months ahead of schedule beginning in the third quarter of this year. We intend to build on the momentum and execute against our plan to accelerate revenue growth, drive margin expansion and increase free cash flow, all with an eye toward significantly increasing shareholder value.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Dan to go through the numbers.","Daniel Florin","Thank you, Bryan. I will provide highlights on our second quarter financial results and go into a bit more detail on the updated 2019 guidance provided in this morning's press release. Net sales totaled $2 billion in the quarter, a decrease of 0.9% from the prior year period with an increase of 1.2% on a constant currency basis. As we noted previously, while there is no impact on our growth rate from billing day differences for the full-year, there was about a day of headwind in the first half which was spread fairly evenly across the quarters.","During the second quarter, we have solid results across all geographic regions. Our Asia-Pacific team delivered strong performance with 4.7% sales growth, while our Europe, Middle East, and Africa team increased sales 1.9%. Americans increased 0.1% reflecting improved performance across the majority of our product categories. Importantly, despite tougher comps, this represents sequential improvement of 100 basis points compared to our first quarter growth rate in the Americas region.","As Bryan noted, we saw improved performance in several product categories during the quarter. Our Knee franchise grew 2.5% on a constant currency basis with solid performance across all geographic regions. In addition, S.E.T. and Dental businesses on the same basis grew 4.3% and 1.7% respectively.","Moving to the income statement, we reported a GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter of $0.65. After adjusting for special items, our non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.93. Reconciliation of reported earnings per share to adjusted earnings per share is included in this morning's press release.","Included within special items, we recorded a $70 million one-time non-cash charge in the quarter related to the termination of certain in process R&D projects. This reflects the progress we are making to prioritize our internal R&D portfolio and focus our engineering resources on the opportunities that are most closely linked to our mission and have the greatest market potential with the highest financial return.","Adjusted operating margin was 27.4% for the quarter and in line with our expectations. The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 17.5% as expected. Operating cash flow for the quarter amounted to $301 million and our free cash flow was $161 million. During the quarter we paid $49 million in dividends and paid down $115 million of debt.","Moving to our updated 2019 full-year guidance, starting with revenue, we now expect 2019 reported growth to be in a range of flat to positive 0.5%. Included in our reported growth range is a negative impact of foreign exchange which we now expect will reduce reported sales between 125 and 175 basis points at current rates. The impact of FX on sales should be much smaller in the second half compared to the first half of 2019. We expect to deliver growth in line with our WAMGR on a constant currency basis during the second half of this year which is six months ahead of schedule and we also expect to see sequential improvement in every product category versus the first half of 2019.","To help you with your models, there are two factors that will impact the quarterly revenue phasing for the second half of 2019. First, the majority of the headwind from billing day differences in the first half which was about a day will be offset in the third quarter of 2019. Again, there is no impact from billing day differences on the full-year. Secondly, remember that in the fourth quarter of 2018 we received a one-time revenue benefit from a rebate adjustment in our EMEA region which creates a tougher comp for overall revenue growth in the fourth quarter of this year.","Turning to EPS we are narrowing our full-year 2019 adjusted diluted earnings per share expectations to a new range of between $7.75 and $7.90 per share. Included in this updated range we now expect our adjusted tax rate to be between 16.5% and 17.5% as we continue to execute on certain tax planning activities. The upside from tax will allow us to increase our investments in the areas that Bryan highlighted during his prepared remarks. Specifically, enhance sales specialization in our S.E.T. business, expanded and accelerated commercial infrastructure to support the launch of ROSA Knee, as well as additional investments in R&D.","As you look to update the components of operating margin for the second half, while operating expenses will increase for these investments, you should expect our gross margin rate in the second half to step up in over the first half. This improvement in gross margin was assumed into our original guidance and is driven primarily by anticipated refunds of prior period medical device excise taxes which will impact the third quarter. Therefore we are updating our operating margin for the full year 2019 to be between 27% and 27.5%.","With that, I'll turn the call back to Bryan. Bryan?","Bryan Hanson","All right, thanks Dan. And before we move into Q&A, I want to say again that I'm pleased with the significant progress the team has been making. Compared to early last year when we began this journey, Zimmer Biomet truly feels like a different company. The energy inside of our organization is real. I'm excited that our second quarter results, as well as our updated 2019 guidance demonstrates the progress of our turnaround and our enthusiasm for the future.","And with that, I'm going to turn it back to Cole to get into the questions.","Coleman Lannum","Thanks Bryan. Before we start the Q&A session I want to remind you again to please limit yourself to a single question with a brief followup if and only if needed. Feel free to put yourself back in queue afterwards. I promise we'll get through as many questions as possible that way. With that operator, may be please have the first question?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Raj Denhoy with Jefferies.","Raj Denhoy","Great, thank you and good morning and Dan I just want to add my congratulations on the next phase here. You know, I want to focus on the U.S. Knee growth if I could. You know, obviously it was the best growth we've seen in a couple of years here. You mentioned a couple of drivers there, ROSA, some mixed benefit from new products, but what I wanted to get at was underlying volumes and where you think you are from a share perspective and have you sort of stemmed the share losses you've seen or where is that tracking in your mind?","Daniel Florin","Yes, Raj. So what I would say is we definitely closed the gap to market in the quarter. You know the momentum was real pretty much across the board and we're excited about closing that gap and at the same time we still feel like we've got real headroom here. You know, 2.5% may be the best we've had in a few years, but we really do believe there is even more potential in the knee arena. So we had a number of things go right. I mean I just kind of walked through them.","You know, we don\u2019t want to discount the value of increasing confidence and morale in the commercial organization. When I think about supply, if you look at our current position in supply, it's significantly better than when were at our worst. I would say we had somewhere in the neighborhood of four days of backorder at the worst of this supply issue, we're down to a day. And as I said in the past, the organization would have a delayed response to getting back to steady-state supply would take a while for the organization to feel confident after some of the posttraumatic stress disorder they had at the beginning, but I do believe we're there.","The organization confidence level is high and their posture around offenses is good as I've seen. So that was a major contributor in the quarter and that's the gift that keeps giving, so that's an important one. Also we're seeing increased discipline in the way that we manage the commercial focus of our organization, particularly in the Americas. We're really making sure that we have an increased operating mechanism discipline focusing the organization around segmentation better than we have in the past, really being data-driven as a result of that and driving increased accountability. That also played a role and that is also a gift that will keep giving.","And there's the new products as you mentioned, I mean obviously we've got ROSA Knee coming out of the gate pretty strong, still limited launch, but feeling really good about it. Persona family of launches is doing quite well also. So it's a combination of those things that that are really driving the momentum and that is allowing us as a result to close the gap to market, but we may be happy about that, but we're not going to be satisfied until we're above market.","Coleman Lannum","Thanks for that Raj. Next question please? ","Operator","Our next question comes from Joanne Wuensch with BMO Capital Markets.","Joanne Wuensch","Good morning and thank you for taking the question. Your commentary on the second half of the year would imply increased confidence. What is giving you that increased confidence and how do we think about that then rolling into 2020?","Bryan Hanson","Well, it\u2019s a number of things actually that I just talked about. I mean, if I'm going to break it down into its simplest form, the thing that gives me most confidence and the things we need to see happen in the back half and beyond, I really - I\u2019ll make very simple, two things, we need to see the knee franchise continue to improve, you know that is the number one most important thing. But we also need to make sure that if that occurs we don't let things slip from our focus perspective and S.E.T. So if we get the knee franchise continuing in the progress that we've got and we make sure S.E.T. continues with the traction it\u2019s getting, those are the things that need to happen to have the confidence we do in the back half and into 2020.","Couple of the sub-elements of that that make me confident that we're positioned well, for both of these, whether it be knee or S.E.T., one of the primary things is this confidence that I just talked about. The confidence level is high in the organization, supply is where it needs to be, people are more confidence that if they need a product they are going to get it. And again, as I said before, that hasn\u2019t always been the case in this organization and it means a lot.","The second one is that, discipline. You know that operating mechanism discipline that we have to drive accountability. You say something, you will do something in this organization, you will accomplish it and that operating mechanism also ensures that we have the discipline to stay focused in S.E.T. even when large joints start to do well. And the final thing which is kind of obvious for both of these is new products.","We have new products across both platforms and we are going to take advantage of those and then the thing in S.E.T. that is different is we are increasing or doubling down in our specialization in sales organization. And you know, on top of that you've got to be more than just specialized. You also have to make sure that you have the compensation structure to ensure that the focus remains in S.E.T. even when large joints takes off.","And so, those are the things that need to happen in the back half. We have confidence they are going to happen and those will be the areas that we focus most heavily on, both in the back half of 2019 and into 2020.","Coleman Lannum","Thanks for that Joanne. Operator, next question please?","Operator","We'll take out next question from Matthew O'Brien with Piper Jaffray.","Matthew O'Brien","Good morning, thanks for taking the question. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll get a bunch of ROSA questions here in a minute, but I was curious about the commentary on investments in the back half. I think beyond which you had been anticipating, can you, without giving away too much to your competitors, talk a little bit about where that may be allocated between maybe more sales reps, more marketing and R&D, and are those incremental investments designed to get you above the WAMGR in 2020 and beyond? Thank you.","Bryan Hanson","Yes, you know, it's interesting because when we think about increasing our weighted average market growth, you know, we've talked a lot in the past and people always asked questions about when are you going to do active portfolio management to drive your weighted average market growth up? What we\u2019re saying is, eventually we'll get to that, but right now there are opportunities for us to do that in the businesses we are playing in by shifting resources. As an example, if you look at overall knees it's not that exciting of a growth business or growth market. But when you look at the sub-elements of certain categories like robotics, like cementless, there's clearly opportunity for outweighed growth.","So we want to make sure that revising our investment to those areas, that\u2019s number one, right? So the whole goal of this is, choose those submarkets that are most attractive, bias investments to those which would be R&D, commercial investments and others, and that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re doing. The second piece of it is though, we\u2019re actually getting better feedback even than what we expected.","And as a result of that, we want to lean into the investment and make sure that we are increasing investment in research and development, to be able to fill some of the gap areas that we have in robotics, but I think more importantly to move ahead. You know, we don't want to just fill gaps that exist in robotic applications today. We want to be able to bring a more integrated ecosystem of robotics that will differentiate us beyond what other players have. And so that\u2019s where some of that R&D money is going.","In addition to that, to be able to be prepared for the demand that we\u2019re seeing, we want to make sure that we have the right commercial infrastructure. That\u2019s not just sales teams, that service, that\u2019s education, that\u2019s everything that we need to be able to rollout ROSA in an effective manner. That\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing, we\u2019re seeing an opportunity to invest in a higher growth submarket, and we\u2019re seeing an opportunity to respond to better demand than what we expected.","Coleman Lannum","Thanks for that, Matt. Next question please?","Operator","Our next question comes from Matt Miksic with Credit Suisse.","Matt Miksic","Hey, good morning. Thanks for the question. I just wanted to followup on the Raj\u2019s question on the knee business in the quarter if I could. You mentioned a lot of things went well and the numbers clearly, you know the best you've delivered in a long, long time. But just a couple of things in that list of things that went well is, maybe just clarification on closing the gap versus narrowing the gap to market, and you know where you wound up with press fit [ph] mix that was a bigger driver you talked about the past, and then just this 8% average of that you\u2019ve been delivering in APAC growth has been very, very strong and just in the overall knee business if you could maybe elaborate on those that would be super helpful?","Bryan Hanson","Yes, so I'd just first say on Asia-Pacific, it is a juggernaut in our business for sure and the thing is every time I get out to the Asia-Pacific region and spend time with that team, they continue to give me confidence that they can continue that type of performance. So I truly do feel that that is in fact the case. They\u2019ll continue to drive strong performance in their business. But we\u2019re also seeing and probably most importantly, when you look at the knee franchise the Americas pick up you know, we\u2019re seen some good life in the Americas and that needs to continue. It needs to actually grow, but we haven't been able to say that for a very long time and that's an important part of this equation. And same with EMEA, I mean, right now we've got all of our regions improving. Asia-Pacific is staying where they have always been and I would assume that all three will continue that momentum.","When I look at cementless, clearly this is a focus for our organization. Robotics and cementless, two of the most important areas of focus for us in knee, they are great because they give us an opportunity to be able to get a mixed benefit as you referenced. I\u2019m not going to get into the specifics about the percentage that we think we\u2019re going to get penetration of cementless or robotics, I\u2019m not going to get into specifics relative to how much of our growth is going to be dependent upon that. But guaranteed we will be heavily focused on making sure that we get that mix benefit leveraging those technologies.","And not just those, mymobility fits into that category as well. So we have cementless, we have robotics, we have mymobility. These are all technologies that are very attracted to our surgeon partners and our providers. And as a result of that, we can get an up-sell in the procedure without having to get a new customer, a new patient and truly just upgrading the procedure. So we bring real value to the patient and the surgeon and we get to get the uptick and mixed benefit for the organization.","At the same time, I\u2019m feeling more confident that those same values that we can bring to the surgeon also give us an opportunity to take competition as well right? To truly take competitive share. So I\u2019m going to go after that mixed benefit for sure with friends and family, but I truly do think we\u2019ve got an opportunity to leverage those same technologies to be able get competitive share as well.","Coleman Lannum","Thanks for that Matt. Next question please?","Operator","Our next question comes from Matt Taylor with UBS.","Matt Taylor","Hi, thank you for taking the question. I just wanted to ask about your decision here to reinvest or double down in S.E.T. and make some investments with the savings that you got from tax. And the question I want to ask is, is this just something that we\u2019re going to see in the second half or can you talk a little bit about how those investments will play out into 2020, and when do you start to see more of the payoff from them? Any color on those investments and what we should expect from them would be super helpful?","Bryan Hanson","Yes, it\u2019s - they\u2019re really, most of the investment on the S.E.T. side will be around commercial infrastructure, specialization of the sales organization, not as much in this situation on the R&D side of the equation. We do feel like we've got a good portfolio of products being launched in the category, but we want to make sure that we have that disciplined specialization to help drive it. So that\u2019s; where you\u2019re going to see most of the investment.","Now the good news is, that type of investment typically has a much shorter turnaround from a payback perspective. So I would say relatively quickly we could start to see the dividends associated with that investment and we\u2019re already seeing it with the specialization that we have. The key piece to this though and I referenced it a little bit, is we need to make sure that we also have the compensation structure and the operating mechanisms in place to ensure that the 'specialized resources' don't all of a sudden do a stage left and go to large joints when that business is taking off.","And I seen that, but we've put specialization in place and we find whenever large joints moves that specialization starts to move towards large joints, because that\u2019s where the money can be made. We have to make sure that we don't just put phase 1, specialization in place, we have to put the operating mechanisms in place to hold that group accountable and we got to put the compensation scheme in place to make sure that they're dedicated to that specialization.","So, net-net, when you put an organization in place the expense doesn't go away. I mean, it\u2019s going to continue into 2020 obviously. But the dividend associated with that expense should also come pretty quickly.","Daniel Florin","I would also add Bryan that the improvements in supply that we have had in S.E.T., you know, S.E.T. was hit pretty hard with supply as well, gives us confidence that the supply will be there. So it\u2019s the right time to add to that specialized sales force. You combine that with the new products that are coming and it is the right time to do that.","Coleman Lannum","Thanks for that Matt. Next question please?","Operator","Our next question comes from Ryan Zimmerman with BTIG.","Ryan Zimmerman","Thank you, can you hear me?","Coleman Lannum","Yes Ryan, go right ahead, we can hear you.","Ryan Zimmerman","Thank you. So you\u2019ve changed over, I wanted to talk about spine for a second, you\u2019ve changed over the sales force a little bit within spine and recognizing that you anniversary in the fourth quarter Bryan, what is your assessment of that spine sales force today and how do you see that segment performing upon the completion or the lapping of those comps? And you know if spine is going to be dilutive to your WAMGR over time and how should we think about that? Thank you.","Bryan Hanson","Well, what I would tell you is, I feel good about the leadership team changes that we've made in spine. I feel good about the decisiveness of that newer organization relative to what we should do on channel, those are tough decisions. I think anybody who knows this space, when you're making a significant decision to consolidate channel there's always risk associated with that, but truthfully I\u2019d rather take the risk, do the right thing for the channel and make sure that we take advantage of it in the future. So I feel good about all the decisions that have been taken. I feel good about the fact that we\u2019ve moved through a lot of the channel consolidation. Now it\u2019s just making sure that that channel jells and ensuring that we\u2019ve chosen the right distributive partners to double down on and that will just take some time to determine whether that is in fact the case.","The bigger things from my perspective to be able to see a change in momentum in this business is as I referenced, we really do need to get past some of the tough comps that we have. We've got to see this channel begin to jell. And I think that's going to take another couple of quarters for that to happen and we got to launch, from a full launch perspective some of the key products. You know, ROSA Spine is there, but to be honest we put that a little bit on the backburner to make sure ROSA Knee is ahead of the game. But now we've got to redouble our efforts to get ROSA Spine moving in the first part of 2020.","Walter, I think is a great application that we can use to complement ROSA or by itself for spine applications which is a bionic arm that is independent of ROSA, but allows a kind of a mini robotics platform for spine procedures. And then we've got some gap filling products that we\u2019re going to be launching as well that will come into full launch in the first part of 2022.","So to me, do I feel good about the decisions and the team? I'm going to need to see the results as we get into 2020. You know, the variables are in place for a successful equation. If they can deliver on that equation and solve the equation, we should see positive momentum in 2020. I fully expect that that business can absolutely be a positive to our growth rate, but they have to prove it and until they do, it\u2019s still a \u2013 you know we\u2019re still testing it.","Coleman Lannum","Thanks for that Ryan. Next question please?","Operator","Our next question comes from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.","Larry Biegelsen","Good morning, thanks for taking the question. Dan, congratulations on your retirement and Suke, I look forward to working with you. So I\u2019ll ask a ROSA question. Bryan, maybe if you could give us some color on some of the early feedback on ROSA total knee, who were the early adopters, the demand of that you're seeing, and your ability to meet that demand? Thanks for taking the question.","Bryan Hanson","Yes, it\u2019s, you know, I\u2019ll tell you, part of the equation of having the confidence now to say that we\u2019re going to be at that weighted average market growth six months early does come from the feedback that we\u2019re receiving on ROSA. It is one variable in the equation. I don't want to put everything on ROSA, but it's a pretty big variable in the equation. And it\u2019s early. We've had, as I said, hundreds of procedures that have been completed and the feedback that we\u2019re getting from those procedures is very positive. So, I would just say the people that are actually using this system are feeling very good about the capability of the system and reliability of the system. That to me is one of the most important inputs that we\u2019re going to get.","Any time you launch a new product, you are going to get feedback. You are going to get positive feedback and you're going to get constructive feedback. I would just say that the positive is significantly outweighing the constructive in this situation. And any of the things that we\u2019re seeing relative to constructive are more around training, making sure they have a more robust training platform so that people are ready to use this system. That's why you do a limited launch right? To learn these things, get the feedback, and adjust. But pretty much across the board every day that goes by the more feedback that we get the higher the confidence level is that we have the right system.","So, again I feel, I feel very confident that we're heading down the right path and that the things are moving in the right direction. Ultimately, we still have to make sure that we commercialize effectively and move from this limited launch to full launch, but all our systems are positive at this point.","Unidentified Analyst","Thank you.","Coleman Lannum","Thank you, Larry. Next question please?","Operator","Our next question comes from David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.","David Lewis","Good morning. Maybe just a question for Dan. Dan, there was - two dynamics have been weighing on investors here the last couple of quarters. One is obviously growth and we clearly gained growth acceleration this morning. The second is actually earnings. So I guess, Dan, when I think about reinvestment in 2019, how does that alter the picture for '20 can you deliver leverage earnings next year or are there additional investments not captured by Street numbers needed to get to that 2% to 3% top line number next year? And congrats as well to both of you.","Daniel Florin","Thanks David. Well first, if you just look at our performance on gross margin in the second quarter, the second quarter gross margin was in line with our expectations, a little bit better than the first quarter. I've talked about the foreign currency hedging gains that are in the P&L this year. In 2018 we had FX hedge losses. We got gains this year, so that creates a tailwind here in 2019. We're obviously, Dave we're not going to give guidance for 2020.","We've talked in the past qualitatively that gross margin in 2020 will remain under pressure and when you think about what the manufacturing and quality teams have been through over the past two or three years, the focus clearly has been on quality remediation and supply recovery and you're seeing the benefits of that focus as we're describing on the top line acceleration.","So the offset to that is, that same team has not been as focused on cost takeout in COGS. So the good news is, we're now pivoting towards that and going to sustain quality remediation and service of course. We've built a very strong operational excellence team in the manufacturing organization. Ken Tripp and his leadership team are doing an excellent job of implementing much more rigorous operating mechanisms through the plants.","All of that says, we're starting to build up the momentum to get after cost reduction in gross margin, but that will take some time to materialize and then come through the P&L. So again gross margin, the takeaway is, it's going to remain under pressure.","Now the flip side is, as that revenue accelerates, it does give us the opportunity to make the investments that we're describing, but that incremental growth, particularly in Knees is a very positive mix and we believe creates enough dry powder to help us think about 2020. And as we've said in the past, sitting here today, we remain committed to some level of operating margin expansion in 2020.","Coleman Lannum","Thanks for that, David. Next question please?","Operator","Our next question comes from Bob Hopkins with Bank of America.","Bob Hopkins","Oh great, thanks and hi, good morning. I wanted to ask my question about U.S. knee growth, such a critical driver and obviously nice to see the improvement. And I realize that both capital and volumes contributed this quarter, but I'm just curious to hear whether the improvement in U.S. Knees in Q2 over Q1 was driven more by capital or by volumes? I'm just wondering, directionally, can you give us a sense as to which was the bigger contributor?","Bryan Hanson","Well, I don't know that I'm going to get into specifics about the percentages or anything else, but as I said, ROSA is still in limited launch. So, we only placed a limited number of systems in the quarter, but it did play a part in the performance. But I think probably the most important takeaway Bob on this one is, even though it did play a part in the overall growth, even if I took it completely out, this was a really strong quarter in knees.","It really was, and the fact is we accelerated versus Q1 even with the tougher comp. We definitely had positive growth and as I mentioned before we closed the gap without capital to the market growth and again this is all despite a tougher comp coming into the quarter.","And I think most importantly on the ROSA side is, the fact is, our confidence in the system as I said, is growing and I fully expect because of that confidence in what we're seeing from our customers that it's going to play a bigger part, more material part in Q3 and Q4.","And I think you know this, Bob because you asked the question before, the real benefit of the ROSA placements isn't necessarily the capital injection you get in that moment, it's the revenue annuity that you get as a result of the disposables, the service arrangements that we have, and also the implant pull-through.","And so, as we begin to place these, we're going to be able to put more of an algorithm around net revenue annuity and build our confidence in what the future revenue growth of knee should look like. And so, that's the thing that gets me most excited about this. We can bring real value to our customers and patients and obviously increase the ability for us to get that revenue annuity as a result of placing ROSA.","Coleman Lannum","Thanks for that Bob. Next question please?","Operator","Our next question comes from Amit Hazan with Citigroup.","Amit Hazan","Good morning. Thanks very much. I wanted to maybe kind of focus a little bit more on specific surgeon feedback. You talked about it in general a couple of times, but I'm curious what aspects are doctors most interested in so far on ROSA? And where are the areas of push back, if you can be honest about that from a surgeon perspective on the technology side, so far in the learning curve that would be - some color on that would be great? Thanks.","Bryan Hanson","So what I would say, I'll start with the areas of pushback, which we have been relatively limited. They've been around the education needed to ensure that somebody understands how to get the registration correct on the patient, right? So you've got to get the patient registered to the system. So the system knows where the patient is and we need to make sure that the training allows people to do that effectively. Where we've had slip ups is where that training wasn't effective enough and as a result of that, someone didn't understand how to do the registration and because of that they had to go back to doing the procedure, the good old-fashioned non-robotic way, that's an easy fix for us truthfully.","On the positive side of things, we knew out of the gate was that people would like the fact that they can use our implants. We are the preferred implant of any other company. We have the number one share position. Persona is a very attractive implant and people want to gravitate to it. So being able to use the implant, they know and love with the robotic system is very important to them and it is meaningful in the decision that they make on which robotic system, they're going to buy.","The other pieces is, as we've said before, we've really wanted to in the design characteristics of the system to be able to allow people to really keep the surgical flow that they're used to. And so, as a result of the way we set the design of the system up, we were able to keep a very similar surgical flow and as a result of that in very short order, be able to do a robotic procedure in the same time that they were able to do a non-robotic procedure. That's really important for high volume surgeons. And by the way, that's exactly who we want to go after. The highest volume surgeons you could get on robotics is better for everybody.","The other thing is, we have this dynamic tracking, which once you do have the patient registered with the system, if for whatever reason that patient or robotic system moves, our system can actually track the movement and keep you in line with where you need to be. Other systems can't do that. That's a really important feature.","And then the final one is, a lot of the surgeons, don't want to have to do CT scans to be able to do the pre-surgical plan. It's more radiation than is needed for the patient. It's another step that isn't typically needed and it's costly for the system. We don't have to have that when we do pre-surgical planning for our robotic system. You can use regular 2D x-rays. We then use an algorithm and turn it into a 3D image and as a result of the 3D image you can do your pre-surgical planning with typical x-ray.","So, those are pretty big differences that we have that the competition doesn't have. I've heard a lot of people say, and it does frustrate me that, well, it's not quite as good as the market leader, but it's a good enough system. I think it's completely the opposite. The feedback that we're getting is that it is a better system than what's out there and people are excited about that. And so, I truly do believe these variables that I just referenced do absolutely put us in a position to compete well.","Dan Florin","Yes. There will be an opportunity over time for more of you to see ROSA in action and then you will be able to draw your own conclusions about some of the things that can really do it. I'm looking forward to that timing.","Bryan Hanson","Yes. And I would just say one other thing too is, people are questioning whether or not with x-ray technology using this algorithm for 3D presurgical planning, so that we get the accurate cuts without controlling the saw-blade and in fact we're seeing is, we're getting more accurate cuts and people are pretty excited about that. At the end of the day, again traction feels very positive right now, and it gives me more confidence that even though we're going to have a great opportunity to get this mix shift in our own swim lane with surgeons that are using our implants today, I also truly believe that ROSA gives us an opportunity to go after competitive business. So we're going to get that mix benefit. We're going to make sure that our surgeons have access to robotics, but 100% guarantee we're going to go after competition here as well.","Coleman Lannum","Next question please?","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike Matson with Needham & Company.","Mike Matson","Good morning, thanks for taking my question. Bryan, you've talked about your desire to pursue M&A to increase your WAMGR over the longer term, but it just seems like given the growth in a lot of the orthopedic markets and segments, there may be sort of a limit to how fast you can really grow if you still stick within orthopedics. So I guess I just wanted to take your temperature on your willingness to diversify and maybe do deals that are outside of orthopedics? Thanks.","Bryan Hanson","Quickly, I would say on that, and then I'll get into little more of this, my preference would be to stay into the categories we already play and begin to try to double down in near adjacencies type plays, tuck-in type acquisitions to be able to build scale in areas we already play that are faster growth. So, I would be less interested at least in the short term to completely get into a new space right now. I think we have plenty of opportunity to be able to build scale in areas that we already play in and have a right to win and improving ourselves.","So that will be the first thing. But just before I even get into to this idea of M&A, we will stay focused and I'd just say, yes I would like to use the word maniacally focused on ensuring that we do drive the near-term priorities. We are beginning to see stabilization in the base, we cannot lose that, as stabilization in the base has to be, there has to be our number one priority. But we're feeling better about that, there's no question.","We are also working down our debt leverage now as we said that we would. We're being very focused on getting that debt leverage in the right place. Combination of those two things, more confidence in the core, getting the debt leverage where it needs to be, gives us better position now to be able to think about active portfolio management than in the past. But I don't want people to think that we're waiting to go buy companies to be able to drive our weighted average market growth up.","As I've said before, we're already doing this. We're selecting the fastest growth submarkets that we play in today and we are systematically moving dollars to those growth drivers. That means, research and development, that means patient education, that means commercial infrastructure, and eventually when the time is right and asset is attractive from a returns perspective and it fits our strategy BD&L will file that as well.","Coleman Lannum","Thanks Mike. Next question please?","Operator","Next question comes from Richard Newitter with SVP Leerink.","Richard Newitter","Thank you. I just wanted to ask another followup on ROSA, but more specifically what exactly is the - I don't want to use the word delay, I'm not sure if you had always intended to move into a full launch more in the first half of '20. But it feels like the ROSA one Spine product is getting pushed out a little further. Can you elaborate on what exactly, the prioritization issue was there and how we should be thinking about that rollout from either a sales force expansion ramp or is there a technological component to this that you need to redo on the system? Thanks.","Bryan Hanson","Yes, it's a good question. What I'd say, first of all, is that we, from a commercial standpoint, we're leveraging the same commercial organization. So, we're building this robotics sales organization, it would have a component of it that would sell spine, brain or knee. So, we're able to leverage some of the brain infrastructure that we already had in robotics and we're just expanding that to be able to service each of these platform, so it's not so much on the commercial side.","But the fact is, we did the, the limited launch, we came out with ROSA Spine and in that feedback process we received information on things that we could do to enhance the system, not necessarily the system itself, but the instruments around the system, and so we've been working on those enhancements and that's part of the reason for the delay.","The other part is, when you're looking at getting these off the line, it's one line, whether it's a ROSA Brain, or ROSA Spine or ROSA Knee, it's coming off the same manufacturing line and we have biased our focus and resources to ensuring that ROSA Knee gets out of the gate strong. So that's just, we really have, we made sure that we, for all the right reasons focused a lot of our attention and getting those systems out first,","But believe me, we have every intention of taking advantage of ROSA Spine and we truly do believe ROSA Spine is going to be an element of the turnaround of that Spine business, and we look at the first part of 2020 to start to move into that full launch.","Richard Newitter","Thank you.","Coleman Lannum","Thank you, Rich. Next question please?","Operator","We'll take our next question from Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan.","Robbie Marcus","Thanks for the question. Maybe just to followup on Richard's question here on Spine, this was one area of the business that came in a little weaker than expected this quarter. Can you help us understand some of the trends that are going on there, geographic differences, and how you expect this to trend for the balance of the year? Thanks.","Bryan Hanson","Yes, truthfully, when I look at the overall Spine & CMF business, no one can be happy with the growth rates that we saw in the quarter. The only thing that gives me a little solace on this and should you as well, is that that deceleration as I've said from Q1 to Q2, was really a big portion of it was comps. I'm certainly not happy with the performance. We need to make sure that we do a better job there, but comps did play a pretty big role in that deceleration from Q1.","That said, the thing that I would be most concerned about and I'm sure you are is, when are we going to see this thing turnaround. And as I've said before, I think first and foremost, we have to make sure that that commercial organization is gelling and that we have selected the right distributor partners. We made \u2013 we know the algorithmic decision and tribal knowledge decision on which distributors should be the ones that we land on, now we've got to make sure those are the right ones, and that's going to, that's going to take a little bit of time.","Second piece is, we just talked about ROSA Spine, but we have applications in Walter, which is a mini robotic solution that can be by itself or it can be a complement to ROSA. We need to make sure that we launch that effectively as well and then we have some gap filling technologies, that we just haven't had in the bag, which has hampered our ability to be successful here that we're going to be launching as well towards the back half of 2019 and full launch into 2020.","So, those are the things that need to come together for us to have success. And we're making the investment to do these things. We've got the team in place that says they can get it done. I've got to see it happen. And I wouldn't expect to see any inflection in this business that would necessarily say that you should expect as negative as Q2, but I wouldn't expect to see any inflection in this business until we get into that first part of 2020, probably even into the second quarter.","Coleman Lannum","Thanks for that Robbie. Operator, we're going to try to get two or three more questions in for the part of the hour. Next question please?","Operator","Up next we have Rick Wise with Stifel.","Rick Wise","Good morning, everybody. I have a question for Suke. Good to speak to you again, welcome. Dan is a tough act to follow. He has done a lot of the heavy lifting in this initial turnaround phase. Maybe Suke you could just talk to us, one about to your initial impressions coming in? But more importantly, your priorities, the opportunities for this next phase, if you will, of the relay race to turn them around, get them up back on track, whether it's growth, or margins, or cash, what are your priorities? What should we be looking for from you as you stepped into the job? Thank you so much.","Suketu Upadhyay","Yes, good morning, Rick. Thanks for the question. It's good to hear from you again, and you're right, there are big shoes to fill with Dan. He has done a lot as part of the overall turnaround and I feel fortunate to be joining at this inflection point. And as you said, Dan, along with the rest of the team under Bryan's leadership they have done a lot of heavy lifting already, but there is more work to do. And if I think about where the priorities are going forward, for me, just very tactically and acutely, there is a lot to learn about this business as well.","It's a complex business with a lot of moving parts, especially in the backdrop of continuing to move beyond stabilization to growth. Two, I've got to get deeper into the organization to learn more about the teams and continue to build that relationship with the leadership team and more broadly into the organization, and really start to understand the culture, but then start to shape the culture as Bryan has been doing for the last several months.","From a priority standpoint, the company has already gotten a number of initiatives in flight, and those initiatives, as Bryan has talked about, are hyper-focused on what I see is the key value driver of the company. One is around revenue growth across all the franchises. Two, it's around driving a leveraged P&L and margin expansion. Three, I think it's around making sure we have a top quartile free cash flow margin, as it relates to sales over time. And fourth, continuing to prioritize things that drive a very high and improving return on invested capital.","So, I'm going to be spending my time on those initiatives that are aimed towards those four key metrics and we'll continue to evolve those as the market evolves and as our priorities evolve. But, I'm really excited and that's kind of how I see it, it's pretty basic, it's about blocking and tackling, and as I said, I think many of these things are already in flight, and that's where I'm going to spend my time.","Coleman Lannum","Thanks, Rick. Operator, I know all the attendees have to get off at the bottom of the hour, they probably have a lot of oars to put in. So, let's just have one more question please and then we're going to wrap up.","Operator","Up next we have Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI.","Vijay Kumar","Congrats guys on a nice quarter. A quick one from me, the investments that you've mentioned on the capital sales force, can you maybe qualitatively comment on is that, is that capital of sales force, is it doubling or tripling from these levels? Thank you.","Bryan Hanson","I wouldn't get into specifics there, but I would just say that it's a significant increase in commercial infrastructure to make sure that we feel that we have the capacity, not from a manufacturing standpoint, but the commercial capacity to handle demand. And we will - again the beautiful thing about adding commercial infrastructure, if you've got your demand signal, right, which we think we do, there is a very quick payback on that. Also I want to make sure that I clarify that the capital sales organization is solely focused on getting the capital sold and placed and they are not going to have to be on an ongoing basis in the procedure.","We truly believe that through the design requirements of our system that we have a system that does not have to have a separate representative in the operating room to run the system. We can use the implant rep to be able to do that. So the capital organization will be expanded to be able to drive the capacity for supporting the demand of the capital and our implant rep will be the one that will take over once the capital has been placed to make sure that this system runs well inside the procedure.","Vijay Kumar","Thanks, Bryan.","Bryan Hanson","Yes, thank you.","Coleman Lannum","Thank you, Vijay. And with that, we're going to cut it off. I know there are number of other people in queue. As we've always done, if you didn't get a question in today because of lack of time we'll get to you at the top of the list for next time.","Really, I want to appreciate your joining us. I know it's a Friday and it's been a long earnings week. As a reminder, you can listen to a replay of this call. It will be available later today for review. You can see that or listen to that on our website at zimmerbiomet.com. Have a great day. We will be talking to some of you later on today. Have a great weekend. Bye-bye.","Operator","Thank you again for participating in today's conference call. You may now disconnect."]}}
