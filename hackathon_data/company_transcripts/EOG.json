At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Chief Financial Officer of EOG Resources, Mr. Tim Driggers. Please go ahead, sir.","Tim Driggers","Thank you. Good morning, and thanks for joining us. We hope everyone has seen the press release announcing second quarter 2017 earnings and operational results. This conference call includes forward-looking statements. The risks associated with forward-looking statements have been outlined in the earnings release in EOG\u2019s SEC filings, and we incorporate those by reference for this call.","This conference call also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation schedules for these non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures can be found on our website at www.eogresources.com.","The SEC permits oil and gas companies in their filings with the SEC to disclose not only proved reserves, but also probable reserves as well as possible reserves. Some of the reserve estimates on this conference call and webcast may include potential reserves or other estimated reserves not necessarily calculated in accordance with or contemplated by the SEC\u2019s reserve reporting guidelines. We incorporate by reference the cautionary note to U.S. investors that appears at the bottom of our press release in the Investor Relations page of our website.","Participating on the call this morning are Bill Thomas, Chairman and CEO; Gary Thomas, President and Chief Operating Officer; Billy Helms, EVP, Exploration and Production; David Trice, EVP, Exploration and Production; Lance Terveen, Senior VP, Marketing Operations; Sandeep Bhakhri, Senior VP and Chief Information and Technology Officer; and David Streit, VP Investors and Public Relations.","An update of our presentation was posted to our website yesterday evening, and we included guidance for the third quarter and full year 2017 in yesterday\u2019s press release. This morning, we\u2019ll discuss topics in the following order: Bill Thomas will review second quarter highlights followed by operational results from Gary Thomas, Sandeep Bhakhri, Billy Helms, Lance Terveen and David Streit.","I will discuss EOG\u2019s financials and capital structure, and Bill will provide concluding remarks.","Here\u2019s Bill Thomas.","Bill Thomas","Thanks, Tim, and good morning, everyone. Over this last quarter, the question we received most often from the investment community was, how does EOG plan to respond to lower oil prices. Obviously, that question isn\u2019t unique to ask as the entire industry is being asked to demonstrate capital discipline in the face of extended lower commodity prices. EOG is a return incentivized company and it has been since its founding. So our commitment to capital discipline is our core value and the fundamental driver of EOG\u2019s history of peer-leading returns. From the beginning of the downturn in 2014, we have consistently executed a disciplined plan to return to industry-leading ROCE and industry-leading U.S. oil growth. This morning, we\u2019re pleased to report that EOG\u2019s second quarter results are right on target to achieve those goals. Our premium drilling strategy is the key. We continue to add low-cost premium reserves, driving down our DD&A rate and improving our ability to earn net income over time. Premium well results are the reason we returned the strong U.S. oil growth in 2017.","Furthermore, during the second quarter, we exceeded all U.S. production targets. As a result, we increased 2017 U.S. oil production growth guidance from 18% to 20%. Our goal remains delivering cash flow, covering capital and the dividend. As outlined on Slide 7 of our investor presentation, premium drilling is already having a substantial impact on our production, finding costs and DD&A. Compared to 2016, oil production is forecast to grow 20%, while our DD&A rate is forecast to decrease 9%.","In addition to strong growth this year, we continue to execute our robust exploration program to capture low cost acreage in plays that we believe could contain premium quality rock that would add to our growing 10 year inventory of premium drilling locations. With everywhere we drill, we collect new data that we incorporate into our big data systems. We are constantly learning how different types of tight rocks respond to horizontal technology. And we apply this knowledge to capture new acreage in exploration plays and to drill better wells in our existing plays. As we\u2019ve said many times before, the key to great wells is high quality rock. Our multi decade database and the learning curve gives us a huge lead in identifying the best rock to add new and better drilling potential to the company. Each one of our 7 U.S. exploration teams is generating new prospects that make the company better. The exploration potential is a key sustainable advantage for EOG.","Disciplined capital efficiency, returns, exploration and growth are EOG hallmarks, and our second quarter performance continues to demonstrate the outstanding results. Looking forward, regardless of where oil prices go from here, EOG will respond accordingly. We are committed to returns, delivering within our means and a strong balance sheet. We believe production growth should be the result of investing in high return drilling, and have never been fans of outspending cash flow to pursue growth for growth\u2019s sake. We are doing all the things that keep us marching towards our ultimate goal of delivering sustainable, long term shareholder value.","Now I will turn it over to Gary Thomas to discuss our second quarter production and cost achievements in more detail.","Gary Thomas","Thank you, Bill. The second quarter of 2017 marks EOG\u2019s fourth consecutive quarter of domestic oil production growth. We delivered this high return oil growth, balancing CapEx with cash flow at an oil price roughly half of the peak in 2014. That accomplishment is a direct result of our permanent shift to premium drilling.","Furthermore, second quarter production exceeded expectations, with 243 of our planned 280 net wells completed during the first half. We produced more than the high end of our U.S. production forecast for all commodities due to the outperformance from premium wells drilled throughout the first half of the year.","On the capital side, we continue to see fantastic cost reduction in all our active basins. At the start of the year, we expected well costs in 2017 to at least remain flat as we were confident we could offset any exposure to inflation. However, we were also optimistic we could further reduce costs, so we establish stretch targets. Year-to-date, we\u2019re on track to reach those targets in every major basin.","During the first quarter, we met and reset our 2017 Delaware Basin well cost target, which we now met again during the second quarter. We\u2019ve also met our Powder River Basin well cost target. And we exceeded our DJ Basin cost target by 10-plus percent. These cost savings are not a result of any one thing; they are a combination of everything. With our pleased but not-satisfied culture, EOG records are broken regularly.","We all -- we are also keeping tight control of our operating expenses. We\u2019ve offset any exposure to service cost inflation as well as increased costs associated with higher levels of activity. Ongoing cost reductions driven by the scale of our operations and other efficiencies have kept lease operating expenses flat quarter-to-quarter and down on a per-unit basis as we have successfully controlled LOE while increasing production.","For the remainder of the year, we expect per-unit LOE will decline reflecting the sustainable nature of the cost savings and efficiency gains EOG realized over the last 2 years. As a result of well outperformance, we are increasing our forecast for 2017 U.S. oil production growth to 20% without increasing the number of wells completed or our capital expenditure forecast. Our performance year-to-date truly reflects the power of our premium drilling strategy.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Sandeep Bhakhri for a technology update.","Sandeep Bhakhri","Thanks, Gary. In our last earnings call, we highlighted how real-time data from our proprietary black boxes and our custom-developed mobile applications are a major productivity game changer. Last quarter, we showcased our proprietary real-time geosteering app, iSteer. This morning, [indiscernible] two new recentric [ph] apps we recently rolled out to our team in the Delaware Basin, and how they\u2019re already making an impact. These tools were designed and customized with input from the entire drilling team, from the engineers in the office to the rig personnel on site. The entire team has access to more than 80 real-time data streams from advanced downhole instruments alongside instant access to data from previously drilled offset [indiscernible]. Drilling engineers and on-site rig personnel can analyze performance of bits and motors, as well as results from real-time predictive algorithms that project bit location and orientation to make real-time decisions. The whole team can look at real-time drilling projects in terms of days versus depth, depth versus cost, et cetera. It\u2019s like having a real-time report card. The bottom line is that our drilling engineers and rig personnel are in lock step evaluating drilling performance versus their best offset wells. And all this analysis then goes into making the next well even better.","Furthermore, the apps allow access to all these features anytime and anywhere. As an example on the New Mexico Wolfcamp [row] we recently drilled last month. Our company man on location called the well\u2019s drilling engineer requesting to pull a drill bit. The drilling engineering who was out of the office at that time used his mobile app to quickly analyze their plan and determine that [tripping] for a new bit wasn\u2019t needed in that particular interval of rock and would only add extra cost. With both the company man and the drilling engineer viewing the analysis real time, they decided not to [trip]. They drilled a vertical with one less assembly saving a day of drilling time and an estimated $100,000 for the interval. This improved performance in the vertical contributed to a drilling record for the New Mexico Wolfcamp, 17,000 feet in 10 days.","Given the [indiscernible] of [80] off the rocks in the Delaware Basin, the ability for our drilling team to react instantly to changes compared to the initial plan is critical for the superior well results that Gary just spoke about.","I can\u2019t emphasize enough that EOG\u2019s quantity, quality and breadth of data drives our information technology advantage. First, we believe we have multiple times more data on horizontal oil wells than anyone in the industry. More importantly, the data is proprietary. The type and granularity of data and the frequency of collection is customized to our needs. Second, we are constantly experimenting and applying and learning to the next well. EOG\u2019s cultures is to always question and push the envelope on what can be done. The result is terabytes of differentiated data capturing results of thousands and thousands of experiments. The application they\u2019ve built in-house analyzed and delivered all the data real time better than any other comparables suite of applications in the industry. However, these applications are virtually useless without the big data and the culture of experimentation and innovation you need to drive data science in the first place.","Thank you, and I\u2019ll turn the call over to Billy Helms who will update you on the Eagle Ford and Delaware Basin claims.","Billy Helms","Thanks, Sandeep. In the Eagle Ford, the average 30-day initial oil production rate from the 51 wells completed during the second quarter was about 1,500 barrels per day. This well performance marks a return to the productivity levels from last year before we began completing the older drilled but uncompleted wells or DUCs remaining in our working inventory. Many of the DUCs completed during the fourth quarter of 2016 and the first quarter of this year were drilled in 2015 prior to our more recent advancements in targeting. These latest Eagle Ford wells really demonstrate the impact that precision targeting makes on well performance. Successfully steering the lateral into the 10 or 20 feet of the highest quality pay of any given target can significantly enhance the well\u2019s ability to achieve EOG\u2019s premium drilling hurdle.","From an operations perspective, this was a quarter of solid execution. We maintained and in some cases continued to lower completed well costs averaging just $4.5 million for a 5,300-foot lateral during the first half of this year. We are well on our way to reaching our year-end target of $4.3 million per well. The Delaware Basin continues to deliver outstanding well performance in multiple target horizons. In the second quarter, we completed 25 wells in the Wolfcamp and 19 wells in the Bone Springs. In the Wolfcamp, we are delineating in three different areas, two in the oil window and one in the combo area and testing various spacing distances between wells. Our first highlight, a four-well package drilled in Southern Lea County. The Rattlesnake wells are 660 feet apart and average 30-day IPs over 2,500 barrels of oil per day each from laterals that averaged about 6,700 feet.","These wells complete a full section developed with eight wells per section in this Upper Wolfcamp interval. While early in the productive life of these wells, we are encouraged about the performance of the spacing pattern. A second four-well package, the Whitney Bronson wells was drilled in the oil window in Loving County with 440 feet between wells. These wells averaged 30-day IPs at 2,250 barrels of oil per day each from laterals that averaged about 9,500 feet. The third package is a three-well pattern in the combo portion of the play. The State Street 20-29 wells in the State Apache 57 number 1610H. These wells averaged 30-day IPs of 3,250 barrels of oil equivalent per day each, with a 49% oil cut and laterals that average 7,200 feet. In total, the average 30 day production rate from the 25 wells completed in the Wolfcamp is over 1,900 barrels of oil per day or 3,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day including both the oil window and combo portions of the play.","Like the Wolfcamp, we continue to test longer laterals in the Bone Springs. We completed a three well package, the Neptune 10 State Com 503H-505 H that averaged 30-day IPs at nearly 2,800 barrels of oil per day each with laterals of 9,700 feet.","In total, the 19 wells completed in the Bone Springs in the second quarter averaged over 1,500 barrels of oil per day. Our development plan includes delineation of our acreage along with determining the proper wells spacing for the various target intervals. Our program continues to deliver results that exceed our reasonable expectations. We are still in the early innings of determining the full long-term potential of this world-class play. While early at this juncture, we are seeing that the sweet spots for each target interval are highly dependent on the stratigraphic nature of the intervals and not laterally extensive across the entire basin.","Next up is Lance Terveen to provide details of our plans for takeaway capacity in the Delaware Basin.","Lance Terveen","Thanks, Billy, and good morning, everyone. The industry has been focused on Delaware Basin takeaway for crude oil, plant processing and residue gas. Securing access to multiple markets and capacity options in 2018, 2019 and 2020 has been a key focus for our team. We\u2019ve been successful diversifying our transportation options and sales points, so that marketing our Delaware Basin production will be as flexible as the optionality we built for our Bakken and our Eagle Ford production.","Starting with crude. EOG capacity on a new third party Delaware Basin oil gathering system and terminal is on schedule for start-up in early 2018. This new system will deliver substantial cost savings and more importantly will give us three direct connections to takeaway pipelines with access to Cushing, Corpus and Houston markets along with the option to export our crude oil. Between our oil transportation agreements in place and our recent Mid-Cush Basis Swap positions, we\u2019ve created security to market and minimized Mid-Cush Basis exposure.","For natural gas, our Midland team has done a tremendous job, building out EOG-owned gas gathering and compression infrastructure. Our systems tie directly into multiple plants throughout the entire Delaware Basin. As we added to our plant processing capacity, we also ensure we have multiple options for residue gas take away from the Permian Basin. Through our existing agreements and soon-to-be-executed transactions with our strong midstream counterparties, EOG will be well insulated and protected during the most at-risk years of capacity concerns and volatility.","Now here\u2019s David Trice.","David Trice","Thanks, Lance. We continue to drill very prolific highly economic wells in the South Texas Austin Chalk. In the second quarter, we completed nine wells with a 30 day average IP rate of over 2,600 barrels of oil equivalent per day each from an average treated lateral of less than 4,000 feet. The average well cost for these short laterals was just $4.6 million. Spacing varies but, in general, the recent wells average about 600 feet between laterals. We continue to test tighter spacing and lateral placement within the various Austin Chalk targets we are testing. More to come on this in the future.","In our Bakken and Three Forks asset, well performance during the second quarter improved significantly. Much like the Eagle Ford towards the end of 2016 and into the first half of this year, we completed the remaining well inventory from 2014 and 2015. Those pre 2016 DUCs did not benefit from the more recent advancements in precision targeting used on our current working inventory of wells. Going forward, we have essentially depleted our Bakken DUC inventory, but the newly drilled Bakken wells will have the benefit of the latest precision targeting.","Our 30 day average oil IP in the Bakken this quarter was almost 1,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day. The Clark\u2019s Creek package and the Antelope Extension Area is particularly notable. The top-performing Bakken well in this package posted almost 3,200 barrels of oil equivalent per day for the first 30 days. Also included in the Clark\u2019s Creek package was the Three Forks well. Its 30-day IP averaged over 3,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.","In the Powder River Basin, we completed 8 Turner wells during the second quarter. These wells came online with 30 day rates of over 1,700 barrels of oil equivalent per day each from an average treated lateral of 8,700 feet. We continue to see upside in our large 400,000 acre provision on the Powder River Basin and are pursuing block up trades throughout the basin.","In Trinidad, we\u2019re happy to announce we finalized an agreement with the National Gas Company of Trinidad and Tobago. The NGC and EOG agreed to a multiyear gas supply contract that will support a substantial drilling program and EOG\u2019s ongoing exploration efforts. As mentioned last quarter, we recently completed a newly joint venture seismic survey and are planning to acquire another proprietary seismic survey next year. Both of these surveys are state-of-the-art and will greatly enhance our exploration and development activities in offshore Trinidad. In the second quarter, we drilled one new well in Trinidad and anticipate drilling at least three more wells in the second half of the year. With the new gas supply contract and new seismic data, we expect future EOG Trinidad projects to be economically competitive with our best onshore U.S. assets.","I\u2019ll now turn it over to Tim Driggers to discuss financials and capital structure.","Tim Driggers","Thanks, Randy. We are maintaining a full year 2017 capital expenditure guidance at $3.7 billion to $4.1 billion. During the second quarter, we are on track, investing approximately one half of that amount. Total exploration and development expenditures in the second quarter were $1 billion including facilities of $161 million and excluding acquisitions, non-cash property exchanges and asset retirement obligations. In addition, expenditures for gathering systems, processing plants and other property plant and equipment were $56 million. Capitalized interest for the second quarter was $7 million.","At quarter end, total debt outstanding was $7 billion for a debt-to-total capitalization ratio of 33%. Considering $1.6 billion in cash at hand, June 30, net-debt-to-total capital was 28%. In the second quarter of 2017, total impairments were $79 million. The effective tax rate for the second quarter was 63%. And the deferred tax ratio was 87%.","Now I\u2019ll turn it back over to Bill.","Bill Thomas","Thanks, Tim. In closing, I will leave you with a few important points. First, our premium drilling strategy is delivering better than expected well results. In the Permian, Eagle Ford and Rockies, EOG\u2019s wells are some of the best in the industry allowing the company to exceed production targets with record capital efficiency. Second, we continue to lower well costs and operating costs. EOG\u2019s cost-reduction culture leveraging sustainable technology and efficiency gains coupled with self-sourced materials and services continues to offset upward industry service costs. Third, EOG remains committed to capital discipline. We are on track to deliver cash flow at or above CapEx and the dividend into 2017. ","Fourth, we are engaged in a robust exploration effort using our extensive historical database and experience. We are focused on capturing high-quality rock and the sweet spot of new premium plays with strong leasing efforts underway this year.","And finally, we believe we\u2019re generating the highest investment returns in the U.S. and adding the lowest cost reserves. Our number one goal is getting ROCE back to our historical average of 13% or better, and creating sustainable long-term shareholder value. Thanks for listening, and now we\u2019ll go to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll go to Evan Calio of Morgan Stanley.","Evan Calio","Maybe I\u2019ll start off with the incremental update in the Bakken and the Eagle Ford where you witnessed a normalized IP, 30 IPs, up by 30% in the Eagle Ford, and you doubled them in the Bakken. Can you provide color on what drove the change? Is it the shift away from DUCs, I think, you alluded to in the Bakken and into premium inventory or completion design specifics?","Billy Helms","Yes. Evan, this is Billy Helms. I\u2019ll start and maybe David Trice can add some color also. For the Eagle Ford, in particular, it was driven largely by our moving towards new drilled wells, getting away from the DUCs and taking advantage of our new steering technology that we kind of developed to identify the best rock and then steer the well in the best 10 or 20 feet of that rock. As we mentioned in all these plays, the rock quality makes a huge difference in the productivity of each play. And we\u2019re taking the advantage of that this year. In the previous quarters -- the previous two quarters were driven largely by drilling or completing wells that did not take advantage of this new steering technology. So moving away from those and moving into a more -- a program more focused on the new advances in steering is what led to the improvements in the Eagle Ford. David?","David Trice","Yes. This is David Trice. The Bakken is a very similar story. So we -- like I mentioned, we did, in the first half of this year, finish off pretty much all the DUCs in the Bakken. And a lot of these DUCs were drilled going back as far as 2014. So we\u2019ve come a long, long way in the last 2 or 3 years on both targeting in the Bakken and in completions. And just understanding the interaction between the geology and the completion in the Bakken, because it is a -- you do see variations across the Bakken in the geology. And so you have to be able to match your completion and the timing of your completions to the geology. So that\u2019s the biggest thing that we\u2019ve seen as we\u2019ve finished off those DUCs and starting completing some of the new drill, like the package that we announced that had such prolific results of -- in the Clark\u2019s Creeks. So those are some new drill wells and so that shows the potential [indiscernible] return in the Bakken.","Evan Calio","My second, if I stay on the Eagle Ford, on a normalized basis here, Austin Chalk wells are performing -- outperforming Eagle Ford wells by over two times in the last three quarters, it sounds like that outperformance is representative of development spacing. Just given what you\u2019ve seen, what\u2019s the consideration to progressing the Austin Chalk to full development mode? Or can you talk about kind of considerations there?","David Trice","On the Austin Chalk, the main driver for the outperformance there is the reservoir quality. The reservoir quality of the Austin Chalk is superior to that of the Eagle Ford. And -- but a lot of the information we\u2019ve collected over the years in the Eagle Ford that\u2019s been applied to the Austin Chalk. So we\u2019ve been able to basically take better rock and apply more advanced completions to better rock. As far as any updates on resource potential or anything like that, we\u2019re still testing spacing patterns and various targets. We do see multiple targets in the Austin Chalk, similar to what we see in the Eagle Ford. But the geology is a little bit more complex. These aren\u2019t -- the Austin Chalk is not exactly the same as a shale-type resourcing play. So we need to continue to collect more [indiscernible] data and get some additional target tests and as well as spacing tests before we can come up with any sort of resource update.","Operator","And we\u2019ll next go to Brian Singer of Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer","With your recount higher -- with the recount higher across shale, not just for EOG but for industry, expectations from many are that we\u2019re seeing -- or we\u2019re going to see industry cost inflation. But as you highlighted, you\u2019re still expecting well costs to fall in areas like the Eagle Ford. Are you not seeing the inflation? Or are you seeing it and more than offsetting it? And in a place like the Eagle Ford, can you talk to what represents the $0.2 million in well cost reduction you expect? And if there\u2019s any offsetting impact in terms of what that well and its productivity look like?","Gary Thomas","Yes, we\u2019re seeing some inflation on costs and not different than maybe we mentioned last quarter. It\u2019s in that 10% to 15% range. A large part of our costs are pretty well fixed. We\u2019ve got our drilling rigs probably 60% locked in. We\u2019ve got our frac fleets about close to the same. We\u2019re very fortunate to have these state-of-art rigs. And we are just offsetting the cost inflation with improved technology and the design of bits, design of motors. We have our engineers doing both of those. We\u2019ve got our own mud systems and mud engineers. So we\u2019re working those as well. So that along with [indiscernible] just these proprietary systems that Sandeep\u2019s highlighted, that\u2019s just given us greater confidence in further reducing our costs. We reduced our costs last year in that 15% to 30%, maybe an average of 20%. We think we\u2019ll get to that 10% reduction again this year.","Brian Singer","Great, great. And then my follow up is with regards to well performance. As you see wells outperform, and the improvement in 30 day rates in the Bakken and Eagle Ford was already noted, to what degree should we expect higher EURs from these wells, i.e., if we see that, hey, you\u2019ve got almost double your 30 day oil IP in the Bakken, what type of EUR improvement should that lead to based on the knowledge in your reservoir modeling?","Billy Helms","Yes, Brian, this is Billy Helms. Yes, we\u2019re seeing that -- really the shift to premium has made a huge difference on not only initial production rate but the ultimate recovery we expect from each one of these plays. So you\u2019re right, in general, as time goes on, we\u2019re pleasantly surprised at the uplift we\u2019re seeing in both production and EUR from the plays. And it all gets back to, as Bill and Dave described earlier, the quality of the rock. And of course, all that is driving our finding costs lower, which will ultimately lead to driving our DD&A rate down over time, which is the focus, as Bill mentioned, the focus of the company is getting back to our double-digit ROCEs. So that\u2019s the focus. And it really ties back to focusing on the quality of the rock. That makes all the difference in the world.","Brian Singer","I guess, is there a portion of the increase in 30-day well performance that represents greater depletion as opposed or quicker depletion as a result to it\u2019s all EUR? Or should we assume the same percentage improvement in EUR as we see improvement in 30 day well performance?","Billy Helms","Yes, Brian. This is Billy Helms, again. Yes, I think it\u2019s not always directly proportional, the IP and the EUR. What we\u2019re seeing is longer laterals oftentimes have a little bit suppressed IP relative to shorter laterals just on a length basis. But ultimately the EUR is increasing proportionately to lateral length, and that was a big focus for the company earlier in the year as we tried to go to longer laterals to make sure that our EUR per foot stayed pretty much the same as our previous wells. What we are seeing is just to take that to a next step further, I think by focusing on the quality of the rock and the steering and keeping it in that best rock, in general, the EUR is improving with time relative to the previous non-steered wells. So you\u2019ve got multiple factors there that are working together to give us better results. It\u2019s hard to give you an exact percentage of uplift on IP to EUR, because each plays is a little bit different. But in general, they are going up.","Operator","And we\u2019ll next go to Doug Leggate of Bank of America.","Doug Leggate","Bill, I wonder if I could just start off, actually, with something of a macro question. You\u2019ve kept Slide 26 in your deck, which talks about the new marginal cost of oil at $65 to $75. And I think, obviously, there\u2019s probably some question marks around that right now. What I\u2019m really getting at is your $50 to $60 range for your 15% to 25% growth rate in oil, how are you thinking about that longer term given that, I\u2019m guessing, you\u2019re probably thinking about resetting that Slide 26 deck as well as everybody else? And I\u2019ve got a follow up, please.","Bill Thomas","Yes, at this moment, Doug, we\u2019re not ready to change that guidance. We want to get more well -- well results and see how we line up here. But in general, we feel like our capital efficiency is going up, so we\u2019re able to add more oil with lower cost all the time. And certainly, our breakeven costs are continuing to go down. On that chart you mentioned we\u2019re at 10% -- to get a 10% return, it would take a $30 oil price. And over time, we\u2019ll reevaluate that as we get better.","Doug Leggate","So I guess, it was probably a little bit obtuse question because I guess, what I was really hoping to get out of it was it seems to us that because your well results continue to get better, particularly in Eagle Ford, that 15% to 25% range, the $50 to $60 number has probably come down some. I guess what I\u2019m really trying to get at is are you ready to give us the new deck where you can still achieve that 15% to 25% at $5 lower, for example?","Bill Thomas","Doug, Yes. No, we\u2019re not ready yet to do that. We want to get more data and more time and really make sure that we\u2019re not jumping the gun on that. And -- but certainly, our exploration effort is a big focus for the company. And we\u2019re continuing to look for better and better rock all the time. And as that plays out, as we continue to increase productivity in the existing plays, et cetera, et cetera, we\u2019ll take all that in consideration and update when we feel the right time is.","Doug Leggate","So hopefully that was my first mission. My follow up is, hopefully, a bit quicker. I\u2019m going to take advantage of the fact that you were talking a little bit about the big data again on the call this morning. And really it relates to your exploration efforts. And my question is really about, can you kind of characterize for us, just at a fairly high level, when you\u2019re entering a new play, to what extent is your data set and your data analytics allowing you to almost explore in a play before you drill the well? In other words, high grade the assessment before you actually go in and spend some real money. And I\u2019m just -- in the context of business development because you mentioned that on the call again this morning, I know it\u2019s pretty high level, but I\u2019ll leave there.","Bill Thomas","Yes, that\u2019s certainly an important point. We have multi decades of trial and error and multi decades of core data. And of course, we\u2019ve developed our own proprietary petrophysical models to go along with that core data and multi decades of experimentation with the different types of completion technology. So we have all that data. We incorporate that into each kind of rock type that we\u2019ve tested. And we have learned probably more about how horizontal technology affects tight rocks, particularly in plays of rocks that are non shale, in the last couple of years than we\u2019ve learned in the last 10 years. ","So it\u2019s been a very steep learning curve in the last few years. And that preparatory knowledge we were taking this year in a very robust manner to look for new plays. And we believe we have a lead on the industry. And we have a unique opportunity window, particularly this year, to add additional acreage in those kinds of plays. And so we\u2019re -- we have increased exploration spending this year to do that. And so the whole process of gathering that data, collecting that data and analyzing that data has been a huge part of that, and we\u2019re taking that advantage and using it this year.","Operator","We\u2019ll next go to Paul Sankey of Wolfe Research.","Paul Sankey","You\u2019ve got loads of good charts there showing how you\u2019ve got great production growth and cost gains and all the rest of it, but I do notice that your return on capital employed graphic doesn\u2019t have a scale. And further to that I was wondering, and I think my preference is, if I could give you one, would be that you had a rapidly rising return above, perhaps, a little bit less growth, So just a couple of things. First, I\u2019m a bit bewildered by the sheer number of premium locations you\u2019re adding because the inventory is now getting so long, I\u2019m not sure why you would keep adding them unless you\u2019re going to tighten the definition of premium location. And secondly, could we get to a point where you actually begin to aggressively pursue returns growth at $50 a barrel?","Bill Thomas","Yes, Paul. The Slide 7 that I referred to in the script is, I think, an attempt to kind of address some of the questions that you\u2019ve brought up. The premium finding cost is roughly half of what the non-premium is. And so as we continue to focus on premium, we\u2019re about -- last year, we were 50%, this year, we\u2019re 80%. Next year, we\u2019re projecting that 90% of our wells will be premium. And adding that premium finding cost as quickly as possible is very, very important to changing the cost basis of the company. And so higher growth with premium wells will drive the DD&A rate down quicker and help us to generate ROCE numbers more quickly over time. And so that\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on, and we\u2019re focused on doing that with a disciplined cash flow -- spending within cash flow. So we\u2019re adding the premium well reserves as fast as possible within cash flow and that -- and we\u2019re also, of course, focused on cash operating costs. Those are a big part of earnings, too. So -- but again, adding those premium and adding that to the cost basis as quickly as possible within cash flow is the focus, and that\u2019s the way we\u2019re going to get there.","Paul Sankey","I guess, my question is, what is there? So are we looking at a double-digit return on capital employed by 2020 at $50 oil? Can you be more specific?","Bill Thomas","Well, we believe that you can get to double digits at $50, but it will take a bit of time. And we\u2019re a bit hesitant to project the amount of time. It will do that but certainly, directionally, that\u2019s possible, and that\u2019s where we\u2019re headed.","Paul Sankey","Yes, I just think it would be very differentiated if you could achieve that because we haven\u2019t had a history in this industry of returns priority at the same time as the kind of growth that you\u2019re offering. And I think for a company of your scale, once you get to 15% and 20% compound growth in volumes, I\u2019m not sure why you would want to go faster than that. Is that fair?","Bill Thomas","Well, I think the important part of growth now within cash flow as fast as possible is adding those low cost reserves as fast as possible -- so within cash flow. And so that\u2019s what we\u2019re really focused on. I think it\u2019s very important to note that these finding costs for these premium wells that we\u2019re drilling are quite substantially much, much better than the rest of the industry. So if we\u2019re growing faster than the industry, and these are the best wells, the lowest finding costs in the industry, then our ROCE should recover much quickly than the industry.","Paul Sankey","If you don\u2019t mind, there\u2019s a tremendous amount of controversy. If we could look back a little bit at the performance of your wells and the decline rate. Today, there\u2019s a lot of controversy and a new buzz phrase is bubble point. Are you seeing more gas and anything in the decline rates that you\u2019re getting that give rise to any kind of concern about the base that you\u2019re dealing with? And I\u2019ll leave it there.","Billy Helms","Yes, Paul, this is Billy Helms. Yes, let me first start off by reminding everybody that we drilled over 5,000 horizontal oil wells in multiple basins, different plays, different target intervals and, more importantly, different rock types. As we\u2019ve mentioned, the quality of the rock is extremely important, not only in their recovery but also in how the gas breaks out of solution. So there\u2019s a lot of things that go into determining the GOR -- lifetime GOR for the play, and we take a particular note of that. And with our history and all the data we\u2019ve collected, we have a lot of insight into what drives that. Of course, in particular, in the Delaware Basin, it\u2019s highly over-pressured. And -- is one point, but also the type of rock we drill in and the core size that each rock type has also drives the GOR. So those are important points to make. Having said all that, what we are seeing is that the performance of our wells is adhering very well to the type curves that we use to build our forecasts on. And we\u2019re not seeing a degradation in reserves or break out of gas over and above what we\u2019ve already forecast. So I\u2019d say, our wells are performing as we built our type curves, either performing or exceeding our type curves in most cases.","Operator","And we\u2019ll next go to Charles Meade of Johnson Rice.","Charles Meade","I wondered if I could go back to some of Gary\u2019s prepared comments and make sure I heard them correctly and interpreted them well. Gary, did I hear properly that, for the first half of \u201817, you completed 243 wells versus the plan of 280? And if that is right, I guess it would make your first half performance even more impressive. And is there a catch up that you have planned in the back half of \u201817?","Gary Thomas","No, Charles. Sorry, but I didn\u2019t speak clearly. We\u2019ve completed 243 net wells of the planned 480 net for 2017. So we\u2019re about halfway there.","Charles Meade","And then a second thing, if I could ask about the Neptune wells that Billy Helms spoke about. And I guess, the question is, are those the same Neptune wells that made the appearance on your list of the top 16 of the 20 wells by peak oil month. And if they are, those are Bone Springs wells, does that indicate a possible step change in what you\u2019re seeing in the Bone Springs?","Billy Helms","Yes, Charles. This is Billy Helms. Those Neptune wells are the Bone Springs wells. And we are seeing some really outstanding performance in Bone Springs. And as you know, generally, we\u2019ve typically been drilling the Wolfcamp intervals first, mainly because it\u2019s deeper. It\u2019s also highly productive but deeper. And it gives us a lot of the insight into geologically what\u2019s happening in the Bone Springs. And these wells are drilled using that knowledge, but also the targeting technology that we\u2019ve gained. So we\u2019re getting some outstanding results from those wells.","Charles Meade","Does that change? I mean, I think everything else on that list of those top wells is all -- I think most impressive is Wolfcamp. Is this a step-change that Bone Springs could maybe be half [indiscernible]?","Billy Helms","Yes, I think the Bone Springs is meeting or exceeding our expectations. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a step-change in what we thought. We\u2019ve always recognized the Bone Springs as a highly prolific zone. I think what you\u2019re seeing is, this year, we are completing more than we had in previous years. And it does get down to the rock quality and how you select your targets, and those improvements that we made in that. So I don\u2019t think it\u2019s anything that we didn\u2019t expect to have happen. I think the Bone Springs is highly prolific. But having said that, I think the Bone Springs -- important to also say, the Bone Springs is a highly stratigraphic play. And it\u2019s not going to be the same everywhere. So you can\u2019t extrapolate the results across the entire basin. And I think I made that point in the opening comments is every one of these play intervals are unique to a certain area. And you can\u2019t expect results across the entire basin similar to these wells.","Operator","We\u2019ll next go Bob Morris of Citi. With no response, we\u2019ll move on to Paul Grigel of Macquarie.","Paul Grigel","Focusing in on the takeaway comments you made, specific on the Delaware Basin, starting with natural gas there. Can you provide more detail on what some of those key takeaway points are that you\u2019re looking at outside of the basin once you\u2019ve gathered the gas on your system?","Lance Terveen","Paul, its Lance. To us, the most important thing is diversification. So we hold some legacy transport that goes to the Southern California and Arizona markets. We\u2019ve also [indiscernible] in capacity to the Gulf Coast. So as you think about the capacity, and we talked about the plant capacity, we\u2019ll have transportation that goes all the way kind of into the Waha Hub. And then from there, we have takeaway that can go into either one of those the markets, whether it\u2019s in the Sou Cal, Phoenix markets and also into the Gulf Coast.","Paul Grigel","And that\u2019s firm capacity that you guys actually either have ownership or have control over?","Lance Terveen","Yes, sir.","Paul Grigel ","Okay. And then, I guess, turning onto oil on the takeaway capacity from the Permian as well. A two part one, just one, as you guys look at new options coming on? Do you see it happening in, you mentioned early \u201818? Is there a continued growth through \u201818 that you see you can get on? And then second, with the addition of the mid Cush differentials that you guys examined there, how does that fit into both the broader takeaway strategy, but then also into a broader hedging strategy, given 2018 doesn\u2019t have any oil hedges at this point in time, what would you guys need to see there?","Lance Terveen ","Yes, I mean, the President mentioned in the prepared comments, we\u2019re going to have the optionality to go to all the markets on the Gulf. Whether -- we have transportation and we\u2019re going to hum going through Corpus, going through Cushing and also into the Houston markets. But what you\u2019re seeing with the Mid Cush Basis Swaps, that\u2019s really just complementing our transportation capacity that we have. So the way we think about that, we\u2019ve got a certain amount of production that we sell at the lease. We also sell to local refiners that are in that area. They\u2019re very good customers. So we\u2019re going to always continue to have sales in Midland kind of based off the Mid-Cush index. So we just felt that the Mid Cush Basis Swaps were just very complementary to our transportation. And really, when you think about it, I mean, a dollar back of WTI, what you\u2019re starting to even see today, even when you look at September, it\u2019s trading more than $1.50 back. So -- which is [Indiscernible] as being very prudent to have some protection on a portion of the volumes that we\u2019re going to have left in the Midland market.","Paul Grigel","Okay, and how does that -- and maybe this is for Tim, but how does that fit into the broader hedging strategy just on crude overall for you guys? Or how do you think about that at this point in time?","Gary Thomas","Yes, Paul. We always just look at that on a going forward opportunistic basis, and we\u2019re -- fundamentally, what we see in the numbers is the market is still too bearish and the forward curve is flattish at best. So we\u2019ll just continue to watch it over time. We would love to have up to 50% of our oil heads going into 2018, but we\u2019ll just have to kind of look and see what the fundamentals are telling us and then make those decisions as we see opportunities arise.","Operator","We\u2019ll go to James Sullivan of Alembic Global Advisors.","James Sullivan","You guys went through this kind of basin by basin in the prepared remarks, but are you -- could you just, kind of a housekeeping, quantify the percentage or the number of total wells turned in line in the first half that were vintage DUCs. Just trying to figure out the percentage of not -- of wells those are not drilled with the new technology that were contributing to first half?","Bill Thomas","The number of completions that we brought on were 233. It\u2019s probably roughly 25% of the wells in the first half were DUCs.","James Sullivan","Okay. Great. That\u2019s perfect, just what I was looking for. And then second question was a little bit of a macro topic, I was wondering if I could pick your brain on this, given your market knowledge. And the topic is the average API gravity will be produced, especially out of these growth, unconventional basins and this kind of hasn\u2019t been talked about much. You guys talked about it back in 2013 to make the point that you were producing black oil, while others in the Eagle Ford were largely producing condensate-range material. That issue has kind of gone away with the up and down in unconventional budgeting since the oil swoon here and with the lifting of the export ban. And I know you guys don\u2019t produce -- participate really in the crude export market, but can you characterize whether you, at all, foresee a problem marketing, and let\u2019s just choose a gravity like incremental 45-degree API gravity oil, in the Gulf Coast in the next 2 years? Is this a problem that\u2019s on your radar at all? Or are you not worried about it?","Lance Terveen","James, this is Lance. We feel like we\u2019ve always been a first mover, whether in the Bakken and also in the Eagle Ford, segregating our crude. But when you look at the Delaware Basin, what we\u2019re seeing with the gathering system and the terminal that we\u2019re going to have, we\u2019re going to be able to keep our crude segregated or move it. And what you\u2019re seeing from a lot of the midstream companies is end segregations. We\u2019re not going to see any degradation that we\u2019re seeing today in terms of how you think about it an API quality, whether it\u2019s a $45 to a $50, we\u2019re not seeing any of that downstream.","Operator","We\u2019ll go to David Heikkinen of Heikkinen Energy Advisors.","David Heikkinen","We\u2019ve been thinking a lot more about how investors can see your results flow into really upstream financial reporting. You just kind of hit on the capital employed that\u2019s holding back double-digit returns because of the base. Can you talk about, maybe by the end of \u201818, how much of your base will be premium locations with those lower [F&B] and better return?","Bill Thomas","David, the I don\u2019t think we have a number that we can give you other than to say that, as oil prices and cash flow improve, we\u2019ll be able to drill more wells. And as our capital efficiency improves, we\u2019ll be able to drill more wells. And then next year, the percent of premium wells goes from 80% this year to 90% next year. So we\u2019ll just have more and more premium wells every year as we go forward. And that isn\u2019t really, as you noted, that\u2019s important to changing our cost basis, getting those low-cost finding cost reserves into our base.","David Heikkinen","Maybe another way to look that we\u2019ve been thinking about is in your reserve report. The 2016 and 2017 premium locations, will we see an improvement in additions and revisions or mainly additions?","Bill Thomas","Mainly, yes. David, it will be mainly in additions. I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll see a lot of revisions. We don\u2019t expect any major revisions. I think you\u2019ll see mainly additions from the new adds continuing to increase. I think the other way to think about that, too, is the overall company production base will become larger, made up -- more largely made up of the volume from the new programs and certainly that\u2019ll help drive returns as well.","David Heikkinen","Just one more question on this, I really do appreciate it. And then on the future development costs given you guys have had a trend of sustainably lowering well costs, should we see a downward trend on future development costs on your reserve report?","Bill Thomas","Yes, I would think so. I think you would see that start to affect our reserve report over time as well.","Operator","That concludes today\u2019s question-and-answer session. I will now hand back to Mr. Thomas for any closing remarks.","Bill Thomas","Thank you. In closing, our second quarter results were outstanding due to the excellent work by every EOG employee, and we certainly thank each one of them. And we look forward to continuing to lowering costs, improving well productivity and testing new plays in the second half of this year. We\u2019re laser focused on adding low cost reserves within cash flow to improve EOG\u2019s bottom line and to create long-term shareholder value. So thanks for listening, and thanks for your support.","Operator","And that does conclude today\u2019s conference call. We thank you all for participating. Have a great day."],"8351":["EOG Resources (NYSE:EOG) Q2 2012 Earnings Call August  3, 2012  9:00 AM ET","Executives","Mark G. Papa - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","William R.

As a reminder, this call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I'd like to turn the call over to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of EOG Resources, Mr. Mark Papa. Please go ahead, sir.","Mark G. Papa","Good morning, and thanks for joining us. We hope everyone has seen the press release announcing second quarter 2012 earnings and operational results.","This conference call includes forward-looking statements. The risk associated with forward-looking statements have been outlined in the earnings release and EOG's SEC filings, and we incorporate those by reference for this call. This conference call also includes certain non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation schedules for these non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures can be found on our website at www.eogresources.com.","The SEC permits oil and gas companies in their filings with the SEC to disclose not only proved reserves but also probable reserves, as well as possible reserves. Some of the reserve estimates on this conference call and webcast may include potential reserves or other estimated reserves not necessarily calculated in accordance with or contemplated by the SEC's latest reserve reporting guidelines. We incorporate by reference the cautionary note to U.S. investors that appears at the bottom of our press release in Investor Relations page of our website.","With me this morning are Bill Thomas, President; Gary Thomas, Chief Operating Officer; Tim Driggers, Vice President and CFO; and Maire Baldwin, Vice President, Investor Relations. An updated IR presentation was posted to our website last night, and we include third quarter and full year 2012 guidance in yesterday's press release.","This morning, I'll discuss topics in the following order: I'll initially review our second quarter 2012 net income and discretionary cash flow, then Bill, Thomas and I will provide operational results and our second half 2012 and preliminary 2013 business plan. Tim Driggers will then discuss financials and capital structure, and I'll follow with our macro view and hedge position and finish with concluding remarks.","As outlined in our press release, for the second quarter 2012, EOG reported net income of $395.8 million or $1.47 per diluted share. For investors who focus on non-GAAP net income to eliminate mark-to-market impacts and certain nonrecurring items as outlined in the press release, EOG's second quarter 2012 adjusted net income was $312.4 million or $1.16 per diluted share. For investors who follow the practice of industry analysts who focus on non-GAAP discretionary cash flow, EOG's DCF for the second quarter was $1.4 billion.","I'll now address our operational results in key plays. During the second quarter, all 3 of our production components approached or exceeded the high end of our 8-K guidance. Our total crude and condensate production was up 52% year-over-year, and total liquids were up 49% year-over-year. Total EOG second quarter year-over-year production growth was 16.5%. North American gas was down 7%, as predicted, but Trinidad gas was up 21% due to higher contract takes. Our aggregate unit costs were below projections.","As we did on the first quarter call, we are again increasing our full year 2012 total company liquids production growth target, this time from 33% to 35%, consisting of 37% crude and condensate growth and 31% NGL growth. Our total company growth target has also increased again from 7% to 9%.","As we've previously stated, because of the value imbalance between crude oil, NGLs and natural gas, EOG's focus has been primarily on oil growth, which will continue to drive year-over-year increases in EPS, adjusted EBITDAX and DCF. The current imbalance between oil and gas is a 33:1 ratio. In the second quarter, our year-over-year increase in GAAP EPS was 34%, adjusted EBITDAX growth was 19% and DCF increased 20%.","During the last 3 years, EOG has proven to be the large-cap independent E&P with the highest annual absolute organic crude oil growth rate, with increases of 35%, 52% and projected 37% for this year. This growth is more amazing when you consider we've sold $3.2 billion of assets during this period. A chart in our most recent IR presentation shows EOG is the industry leader in horizontal oil production by a 2:1 ratio over the #2 producer.  Additionally, we have quite a substantial amount of North American natural gas reserves in large resource plays, which we've inventoried until market conditions improve.","I'll now discuss the plays driving our extraordinarily high organic oil growth rate, starting with the Eagle Ford. On our May earnings call, I described EOG's Eagle Ford position as our 800-pound gorilla. Based on the results in the past 90 days, we still continue to believe our acreage is the largest domestic net oil discovery in the past 40 years and generates the highest after-tax reinvestment rate of return of any current large hydrocarbon play. We're the largest crude oil producer in the play, with 103,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day net production for June, 76% of which was oil and 14% was NGLs.","I'll now discuss 5 key points regarding the Eagle Ford. First, this has been our strongest quarter ever for completion of what I'll call monster oil wells, which I'll define as wells having IP rates of 2,500 barrels of oil a day plus gas and NGLs. Our press release lists several of these, but by my count, we had 16 wells with initial production rates between 2,500 and 4,800 barrels of oil per day plus gas and NGLs this quarter, all in which EOG has 100% working interest.","The 16 monster wells in one quarter is particularly startling when we haven't seen any announcement by other Eagle Ford operators of even one such monster well to date. This is a testament to both the quality of our acreage and our completion expertise.","During the quarter, we set a new record for the best single well, the Boothe 10H, which IP-ed at 4,820 barrels of oil per day with 7.5 million cubic feet a day of rich gas, which is the upper limit of our testing facilities.","Second, our rate of learning on optimizing oil recovery from this asset continues to dramatically improve. During the quarter, we made excellent technical progress in understanding how to get more oil out of the Eagle Ford, and the results are showing up in improved well quality. For proprietary reasons, I'm not going to go into specifics here other than to let you know I'm directionally very pleased with the results, and they're showing up in our well results like the Boothe #10H.","Third, we plan to drill 330 net wells this year, up from the 300 we previously indicated. Because our drilling time per well has declined from 21 days in 2009 to the current 14 days, but dropped from 23 to 20 rigs during the second half of the year. We also front-end loaded our 2012 Eagle Ford completion activity. So consequently, our rate of production growth will moderate in the second half. In the first half of the year, we brought 179 wells to sales and plan to bring 145 wells to sales during the second half. These nuances have been taken into account in our second half guidance.","Fourth, we're now connected to the Eagle Ford -- or excuse me, to the Enterprise oil pipeline and the new Enterprise natural gas processing plant and pipelines. So the go-forward concern regarding takeaway bottlenecks is considerably reduced. Essentially all of our Eagle Ford oil is currently priced off an OIX index.","And fifth and finally, our logistics regarding our self-sourced Wisconsin frac sand have performed smoothly all quarter, and our frac cost savings are still $0.5 million a well. However, I will note that we are now pumping bigger fracs, and this has offset our cost savings. Combined with the higher cost of gel, our average well cost is about $6 million per well, higher than our $5.5 million target.","We've previously given you typical economics, noting we expected an 80% direct after-tax reinvestment rate of return or a $5.5 million well cost. For the first half of this year, our actual direct after-tax reinvestment rate of return exceeded 80% using the actual well cost, so our impressive economics are still intact.","To summarize the Eagle Ford, it continues to improve better than expected, and I expect to see further improvements in well quality and reserve recovery. We continue to test hydro-spacing in the play.","I'll now turn it over to Bill Thomas to discuss the Bakken, Wolfcamp and Combo plays.","William R. Thomas","Thanks, Mark. Last quarter, we advised you that we were more optimistic about the Bakken and Three Forks as growth vehicles than in the past several years for 3 different reasons. I'll give you some updates regarding these reasons. First, 320-acre infill drilling in the Bakken Core continues to generate positive results. The press release shows several new infill wells. The reason we're so excited about EOG's core area down-spacing is that our 90,000 net acre core is the sweetest spot in the entire Bakken, and it's where 22 of the 30 best Bakken wells in the entire play have been drilled. So this is a rich hunting ground for down-spacing. With our Bakken acreage now held by production, we are shifting our focus to increasing the recovery factor with down-spacing and improved frac technology.","Second, we continue to have great results in our Antelope Extension area, which is 25 miles southwest of the core area. Typical recent wells here are the Riverview 100-3031H and 04-3031H, which tested at rates of 1,834 barrels of oil per day and 1,863 barrels of oil per day plus rich gas from the Three Forks and Bakken, respectively.","Third, the third growth area is our Stateline area, where we recently completed the Stateline 08-3328H in Eastern Montana at 1,260 barrels of oil per day. With confirmed success, we estimate 200 potential locations in this area. As you can see, we have plenty of room to run in the Bakken and Three Forks. Additionally, we continue our Bakken Core waterflood pilot project, and we expect to have preliminary results by year end.","Shifting to our Permian Basin, Wolfcamp and Leonard horizontal plays, our results continue to be consistent with previous quarters. The recent Wolfcamp completions are the Munson #1001H, #1002H and #1003H and the University 43A-#0807H wells, which IP-ed at 1,110, 856, 1,015 and 760 barrels of oil per day, respectively, plus rich gas from the middle interval. We are currently completing a couple of Wolfcamp wells in the upper zone and expect results later in the year.","In the New Mexico Leonard, the Ross Draw 8 Fed #2H and  Ross Gulch 8 Fed Com #1H tested at 722 and 540 barrels of oil per day, with 270 and 145 barrels per day of NGLs and 1.9 million and 1 million cubic feet per day of natural gas, respectively. We have 88% and 91% working interest in these wells, respectively.","Also a significant Leonard step-out, the 100% working interest Pitchblende 29 Fed Com #1 was successful and tested at 1,026 barrels of oil per day, with 120 barrels per day of NGLs and 650 Mcf per day of gas. This well sets up a lot of additional locations.","To summarize, our Permian Basin program is generating excellent results. We continue to test spacing in multiple targets in both plays, and we believe our 240,000 acres has significant upside for EOG.","In the Barnett Combo, our results are consistently good. In the second quarter, we completed a 4-well pattern on our Tatum and Tatum A units with initial full well rates of 400 and 600 barrels of oil per day, with 100 to 140 barrels per day of NGLs and 700 to 900 Mcf per day of residual gas.","Our drilling times continue to improve, allowing us to drill more wells with fewer rigs, and we expect to complete 200 net wells this year. We've also been able to avoid any gas processing pinch points that we were concerned about earlier in the year.","In addition to our big 4 oil plays, we continue to have smaller levels of horizontal oil activity in the Mid-Continent, Powder River Basin, southern Manitoba, et cetera, and we continue to test new horizontal oil play concepts.","Now I'll turn it back to Mark.","Mark G. Papa","Thanks, Bill. Outside North America, we still expect our 100% working interest in East Irish Sea Conwy crude oil development project to start up in the second half of 2013. We recently installed the platform and expect to commence drilling in the first quarter 2013.","In Argentina, our first horizontal Vaca Muerta oil well has been completed and is under evaluation. We hope to have some definitive results on next quarter's call. In Trinidad, recent gas takes have been higher than expected due to higher indigenous gas demand. We expect some methanol and ammonia plant maintenance downtime in the second half, and our full year guidance projects only slightly higher full year 2012 Trinidad gas production compared to 2011. There's nothing new to report on the Kitimat LNG project.","I'll now address 2 other key EOG differentiators, crude-by-rail and sand plants. Our St. James, Louisiana crude-by-rail facility has been operational since mid-April, and the impact showed up in our overall second quarter U.S. crude oil realizations versus WTI. The terminal construction cost is already paid out. Now that the Eagle Ford oil pipeline is operational, we've moved a number of rail cars to the Bakken, and we're primarily using the crude-by-rail system to move our Bakken crude to Louisiana, capturing the current $20 differential between Clear Brook, Minnesota and St. James, Louisiana.","During July, we're selling about 20 -- excuse me, about 50,000 barrels gross at St. James, and we expect this volume to increase to approximately 80,000 barrels of oil a day by year end as more tank cars become available.","Our Wisconsin frac sand system is also working as planned. The first sand shipments began late last year and, in combination with our Fort Worth plant, is currently providing our frac sand needs for more than 700 wells this year. Most importantly, the sand cost savings to our Eagle Ford program is still $0.5 million a well.","We've recently had several investor questions regarding NGLs and ethane rejection. In the second quarter and also in July, we experienced only minor NGL curtailments. Most of our NGLs are processed at Mont Belvieu and not Conwy. During the past few weeks, we've seen ethane prices rise as ethylene plants have come online after the planned maintenance shut-ins of the first half of the year. As a reminder, in the second quarter, only 9% of EOG's North American revenue emanated from NGLs, with 78% emanating from crude oil.","Now I'll discuss our second half 2012 and preliminary 2013 business plan. Because we're happy with our first half results, we're making only a few minor changes to our original 2012 plan. In the Eagle Ford, we plan to shift part of our drilling activity to the west, and we'll be drilling a number of lower working-interest wells. We've also reduced the number of rigs due to the increased drilling efficiencies.","On the natural gas side, the changes to our plan involve dry gas drilling. As previously disclosed, we plan to spend about 10% of our CapEx this year or about $750 million on dry gas drilling in the Haynesville, Horn River and Marcellus to HBP on our acreage positions. Essentially, all of these gas resource plays will be in good shape by year-end 2012 as far as acreage holding.","We also noted we would likely spend 5% on dry gas drilling next year. We now feel that our natural gas expenditures this year will lock up essentially all of the dry gas acreage we plan to keep and that unless 2013 gas prices rise dramatically, we will spend very minimal CapEx in 2013 on dry gas drilling. We will likely run only one dry gas rig next year. This will allow us to concentrate 2013 on oil and rich gas reinvestment opportunities while holding all of our quality multi-Tcf North American gas acreage.","We expect to sell between $1.2 billion and $1.25 billion of properties this year, and through the end of July, we've closed on $1.2 billion of sales. Our single biggest sale involved our outside-operated Bakken properties, which closed in the second quarter. Even with these sales, many of which involve oil or NGL production, we've increased our 2012 crude oil and liquids production growth target.","We are considering doing a joint venture on at least one additional horizontal oil development play, but it won't be 1 of our big 4; in other words, not the Eagle Ford, Bakken, Permian Basin, or Barnett Combo plays.","Our current net debt level is 26%, and for 2013, we anticipate living within our self-imposed 30% max net debt-to-cap guideline and not issuing any equity.","I'll now turn it over to Tim Driggers to discuss financials and capital structure.","Timothy K. Driggers","Thanks, Mark. Capitalized interest for the quarter was $12.1 million. For the second quarter 2012, total cash exploration and development expenditures were $1.9 billion, excluding asset retirement obligations. In addition, expenditures for gathering systems, processing plants and other property, plant and equipment were $145 million.","Year-to-date, total cash exploration and development expenditures were $3.8 billion, excluding asset retirement obligations. Expenditures for gathering systems, processing plants and other property, plant and equipment were $316 million. Total acquisitions for the quarter were $108,000 and $435,000 for the first half. Through June 30, proceeds from asset sales were $1.1 billion and, as Mark mentioned, through the end of July proceeds were $1.2 billion.","At the end of June 2012, total debt outstanding was $5.0 billion and the debt-to-total capitalization ratio was 27%. At June 30, we had $280 million of cash on hand, giving us non-GAAP net debt of $4.7 billion or net debt-to-total cap ratio of 26%. The effective tax rate for the second quarter was 39%, and the deferred tax ratio was 67%.","Yesterday, we included a guidance table with our earnings press release for the third quarter and the full year 2012. For the third quarter and full year, the effective tax rate is estimated to be 35% to 45%. We have also provided an estimated range of the dollar amount of current taxes that we expect to record during the third quarter and for the full year. Regarding price sensitivities, with our current hedge position for the second half of 2012, for each $1 move in crude oil prices, net income will be impacted by $14 million and cash flow will be impacted by $20.5 million. For each $0.10 move in natural gas prices, net income will be impacted by $4.3 million and cash flow will be impacted by $6.4 million.","Now I'll turn it back to Mark.","Mark G. Papa","Thanks, Tim. Now I'll provide our views regarding macro hedging and the concluding remarks. Regarding oil, we still think the global supply-demand balance is tight, and we expect prices to strengthen throughout the remainder of the year. Two recent concerns I've heard from oil bears involve horizontal shale oil. One concern is will the U.S. create enough shale oil to affect global supply. EOG's forecast is an increase in the U.S. of 2 million barrels of oil per day by 2015, which, we believe, will not impact a 90 million barrel of oil a day global market. We think there are only 3 consequential horizontal oil plays in North America: the Eagle Ford, Bakken and Permian, and that all other alleged oil plays are either inconsequential on a national scale or really NGL plays. A picture is worth a thousand words, and Slide 7 -- if you take a look at Slide 7 on our website, it makes this blindingly obvious that there's only 3 plays that are meaningful in terms of U.S. oil impact.","The second concern relates to possible international horizontal oil shale plays and their potential impact on supply. My answer there is maybe it will happen, but it's not likely for another 10 years at least. Remember, it's been 10 years since horizontal drilling unlocked shale gas in the Barnett, and no one yet has found commercial shale gas outside North America. Also, the key to commercial shale oil or gas is the ability to drill thousands of wells at low per-well cost, and whether this can be done internationally is likely problematic.","For August to December 2012, we're approximately 22% hedged at $106.69 price. We've recently begun to layer in 2013 hedges and currently have 16,000 barrels a day hedged at $98.12 for the first half 2013.","We continue to have a cautious long-term view regarding North American gas, but we do believe that 2012 marks an aider [ph] for natural gas prices.","We're comfortably hedged for the second half of this year, 45% at $5.44 per MMBtu. For 2013, we have 150,000 MMBtu hedged at $4.79. We recently closed out our 2014 150,000 MMBtu natural gas hedge position. Please see the table that was included in our earnings press release for the details of our hedging contracts.","In summary, I want to leave you with 2 thoughts. First, how does an investor decide which company to own when it seems like every independent E&P is trying to become a liquids-rich company? How to decide when every company is touting new, often unproven, or marginal liquids-rich plays upon which they allege they'll drill thousands of wells. It's really simple. Go with the company that's generating results quarter after quarter, year after year. In this business, there's a lot of hype. Results matter, and they're easy to measure.","And second, there's been a slight change to my retirement timing. The original plan was that I would keep the Chairman and CEO jobs until midyear 2013, when I would retire and hand over both these jobs to Bill Thomas. The new plan is that in midyear 2013, I'll hand over the CEO job to Bill and I'll remain Chairman for 6 additional months until midyear 20 -- excuse me, until year-end 2013, when I'll retire. The only read-through on this change is that psychologically, after 31 years, it's a little harder for me to walk away from EOG cold turkey than I originally thought, so this plan provides a more gradual approach and orderly transition.","Thanks for listening, and now we'll go to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Brian Lively from Tudor, Pickering, Holt.","Brian Lively - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Mark, on your commentary about potentially doing a JV in one of the other non-4 big plays, I'm just thinking about it strategically in 2013. Are you saying that basically that, in combination with just no \u2013 essentially, no gas drilling is going to kind of fund that gap for next year and allow you to continue with the high liquids growth?","Mark G. Papa","Well, we're just -- our 2013 plan is obviously not specific yet, and we'll furnish a much more detailed plan, as we do every year, on our year-end earnings call in February that'll have specific growth targets for both the liquids and gas. But the predicates of the plan are clearly that the amount of dry gas drilling we're going to do next year is going to be pretty close to nothing, only one rig, really, which is just going to be holding acreage primarily in Bradford County, in the Marcellus. And basically, we're going to attempt to hold to the 30% net debt. We'll consider selling some additional properties, and we're going to heavily fund the oil plays, and the NGL plays will be more -- we'll just see what happens to NGL prices. But the oil plays are going to get the vast majority of the funding. And the big plays there that are going to get the funding will be one, Eagle Ford and two, the Bakken because they're primarily oil. The Permian Basin, even though people think of it as an oil play, it's really a combo play, as, of course, is our Barnett Combo. So both the Wolfcamp and the Leonard have -- about 40% of that production is oil, and the rest of it is NGL. So what you can look for are those 2 plays, the Eagle Ford, first, Bakken, second, are going to get the lion's share of the money. And then we'll look at some plays other than our big 4 plays. And if it makes sense, we may bring in a JV partner depending on what our cash flow, what our property sales balance is. So all we wanted to do, really, Brian, is just signal to you that at this stage, the plan is clearly, there will be a further ramp down of dry gas drilling and there'll be a definite shift of capital even more heavily likely toward the Eagle Ford and toward the Bakken and at some additional plays which -- we may look at the oil or combo plays other than the big 4. We may look at bringing in some outside capital.","Brian Lively - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Mark, that's helpful. Just my follow-up question, and it sort of fits in that context, we saw a pretty attractive, at least in my view, valuation done on a JV in the Pearsall. It looked like that acreage overlapped on your position probably more so than anyone. Could you provide a little bit of an update in terms of what you're seeing in the Pearsall and what you're testing there?","Mark G. Papa","Yes. We really -- I would just say that in relationship to the Eagle Ford acreage, we realize there are multiple zones that are potentially pay zones above and below the Eagle Ford, and it's not particularly likely that we would be splitting horizons, vertically splitting horizons in that area. That's not our first choice. So that particular area is not one that directionally, we're looking at carving out some other interval other than the Eagle Ford and a JV there. That's kind of a little bit messy in our opinion.","Operator","Moving on, we'll take our next question from Leo Mariani from RBC.","Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Obviously, you've detailed some very strong results here in the Eagle Ford. I realize that, that kind of represents your sort of best results in terms of what you guys have discussed. Just wanted to get some color on how the overall average results in the Eagle Ford, if you take into account all of the wells, has changed from earlier this year.","Mark G. Papa","Yes. I mean, Leo, we haven't changed at this juncture from the average reserves per well, which we provided to people earlier, which is the 450 Mboe per well, net after royalty. Now obviously, some of these or most of these wells that start out at north of 2,500 barrels of oil per day are considerably better reserves than 450. But over the entire acreage position, we're still sticking to that number. Now obviously, we've made some improvements, and it's possible that, that number could go up with time. But as you know, we're pretty conservative. And as we've done with volume growth projections this year, we'd rather be on the conservative side. So all I can tell you is the numbers we provided you earlier that come out to the 1.6 billion barrels and the average reserves, 450 are still the numbers we prefer that you use. But hopefully, some of the comments we provided on the call would convey our enthusiasm that the Eagle Ford is a very unique rock in that the more time we spend with it, the more enthused we are about the recovery factors and the ultimate potential of that rock. But it's just going to take some time, some time for us, technically, to get our arms about that. But we are very enthusiastic about that asset, and that's why we have 0 interest in JV-ing that asset.","Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","That's great color. That makes a lot of sense. I guess obviously, it's a little too early to discuss 2013, per your prepared comments here. But just hypothetically, if we're at kind of a $90-plus WTI environment next year and with gas drilling coming down and cash flow going up, I mean, there should be materially more cash available to fund the oil play. So should we certainly at least expect in that environment to have significantly more oil-directed drilling activity next year?","Mark G. Papa","Yes. I really don't want to get into 2013. Yes, I mean, as a percentage of our total CapEx, more -- a higher percentage will be oil-directed. But beyond that, I don't want to get into any specifics until we really get to our February earnings call.","Operator","Moving on, we'll take our next question from Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Following up on that last question, last couple questions there, when you look at the techniques on the frac-ing side that have really driven some of the improved well results that you're seeing in the East, what's the applicability that you may have or may not have as you move and shift activity more to the West? And is getting more wells completed in the West the main impediment or the main catalyst needed to take up that EUR, or are you seeing underperformance elsewhere?","Mark G. Papa","I mean, the reason we're shifting a bit more of the rigs to the West is mainly just an acreage earning issue. We've got all this acreage to hold, and so we just have to -- we're driven a bit where we locate the rigs by our acreage earning calendar, and that's why we're -- and some of the well -- a higher percentage of the wells we drilled in the second half will be at a lower working interest than, generally, most the wells we drilled in the first half year are 100% working interest, and we won't have that benefit in the second half of the year. So that's why our overall production growth is going to be tempered. Total company oil production growth will be tempered a bit, as well as just a slowdown in our overall CapEx. In terms of the West, the wells in the West, as a rule, will not be quite as good as the wells in the East. They'll still be wildly economic. But it's -- on average, you're not going to be getting 4,000-barrel-a-day IP wells typically in the West as you're going to get in the East. So we're just -- we're not expecting those kind of well profiles out there, but we expect quite good wells, for sure. So we're just going to have to see. With our recent frac improvements, we expect to see better wells this pass in the West, and we've got a year or 2 going to West, so we'll see. And we've done some drilling in the West all this year, and we found some quite good wells out there. So all this is ground into the plan, Brian. So what we're trying to do is not let you guys on the sell side take our first half results and extrapolate them to the second half and say, \"EOG's sandbagging, and their oil growth in the second half is going to be off the charts again.\" So that's my advertisement I hope I can get across to you guys.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Yes, I guess on the topic of quarter-on-quarter kind of noise, we can look and see the Eagle Ford number that you reported for June, up 26,000 Boe a day versus what you had in April. Now I guess we don't technically know or maybe you could help us with what the real average was during the quarter. But that type of growth should look like you're well on your way in Q3, but I know you always like to say there may be other factors that may be more one-off. But can you talk a little bit about the quarterly trajectory and whether you see any temporary -- beyond shifting your wells West, any other temporary hiccups to the pace of the Eagle Ford growth?","Mark G. Papa","Yes. I'd just say the number of monster wells that we got in the second quarter that I bragged about, that was an extraordinarily high number of monster wells. We don't expect that we're going to see that in the third quarter. So to that degree, second quarter was maybe a little bit anomalous on there. So we're -- I'd say that there definitely is going to be a slowdown in the Eagle Ford growth, third quarter versus second quarter, because of the working interest issues and also because of the number of completions. I quoted the number of completions in the second half versus the \u2013 on there and number of rigs we're running. So as you noticed, our burn rate in the first half on CapEx was at $4.1 billion, and we're trying to limit ourselves, just from capital discipline, to spending $7.5 billion or $7.6 billion for the full year. So we are consciously slowing down our CapEx. And our biggest CapEx consumer is the Eagle Ford. And the analogy I would give you is right now, EOG is like a coin-operated machine. You put in a lot of coins, and we are an oil-producing behemoth with 100% efficiency. You put in less coins, we don't produce as much oil. But we have 0 inefficiencies, no exploration inefficiencies or anything like that. And we're going to be putting in less coins in the second half than we put in, in the first half, and so the rate of oil growth is going to slow down a bit. So it's just that simple.","Operator","Moving on, we'll take our next question from Joe Magner from Macquarie Capital.","Joseph Patrick Magner - Macquarie Research","I appreciate that you're not necessarily getting into details on 2013 spending yet. Can we expect that you will, and I apologize if I missed this earlier, maintain the commitment to keeping your net debt-to-cap below 30%? Is that still a goal for next year?","Mark G. Papa","Yes. That's our target, Joe.","Joseph Patrick Magner - Macquarie Research","Okay. And I guess as we think about some of the spending that's taking place this year, you've mentioned that $750 million of dry gas spending is taking place to hold leases and whatnot. How much of that might occur again next year, or will you be mostly through a lot of that activity by the end of 2012?","Mark G. Papa","That'll probably go from $750 million to maybe like $100 million or $150 million, so it's going to drastically drop.","Joseph Patrick Magner - Macquarie Research","Just getting into one of the plays, there's just some differences in terms of how companies are referring to the Wolfcamp Shale, horizons that are being targeted. Can you, I guess, maybe remind us how you think about the upper, lower and middle Wolfcamp and how that might compare to some of the other industry norms that are being discussed?","William R. Thomas","Yes, Joe. Ours might be a little bit simpler nomenclature. We divide the 3 -- the Wolfcamp, it's about a 1,000-feet dig, so we divide it into 3 zones: the upper zone, the middle zone and the lower zone. And those are defined stratigraphically, there's shalier, more, really, clay, intervals that separate the 3 zones. So they're kind of distinct zones that we can map around the basin. And we're not real sure and we know some have broken them up into 4 different zones and things like that, and so I'm not sure exactly what the difference is between us in EOG. But ours is a pretty simple thing. And our focus right now, of course, has been on the middle zone. It's been really -- it's got really good consistent pay quality, and we're consistently making really good wells in that. And then we are currently completing a couple of upper wells now, and we'll have some results on those later down the road. But that's how we're doing it.","Operator","Moving on, we'll take our next question from Pearce Hammond from Simmons.","Pearce W. Hammond - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Could you give an overview of how you see service cost trending right now in your 4 core areas?","Timothy K. Driggers","Yes. We've seen the drilling rig rates drop. They've been negotiated, probably only 10% lower. The tubulars, they're dropping also. They're probably down about 10%. But as you'll recall, most of EOG's services are pretty well contracted. We've got about 40% of our rigs, drilling rigs under long-term, and then about 2\/3 of our frac fleets are contracted. And then yes, EOG provides our own sand. We buy our mud wholesale. We provide our own sources of acid gel, that sort of thing. So our costs are pretty well locked in. So we wouldn't see much additional change other than, yes, we'll continue to drive efficiencies into our operations. And that's how we've reduced our costs, both on the number of stages per day and then dropping the number of days per well.","Pearce W. Hammond - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","And then of the Bakken and the Eagle Ford and the Permian, which 1 of those 3 would be the tightest right now on services in general?","William R. Thomas","Probably the Permian, the tightest right now. But we're not really having any problems there. That's probably our lowest activity area. Of course, we're busiest in the Eagle Ford and then next, in the Bakken.","Operator","Moving on, we'll take our next question from Bob Brackett with Bernstein Research.","Bob Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I had a question on the impact on production on the various disposals of the non-operated properties. What sort of scale is that, and when will that hit? Did that close in the quarter, or will it come later?","Mark G. Papa","Yes, Bob. In terms of when it'll hit, it closed late in the second quarter, so when it will really hit is in terms of third quarter. So that's another reason that the growth of second half oil production will be a little bit tempered because of that impact. In terms of the scale of it, we typically, on the assets we sell, which is $1.2 billion this year so far, we haven't released who's been the buyer and we haven't released what volume we've sold, and it's because we don't really want to get into all this stuff about as adjusted volumes or pro forma or anything like that. We're not an as adjusted company. So we'd just say it was the biggest single sale of our $1.2 billion that we sold, but that's as far as we want to go on any disclosure on it.","Bob Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. And then do you have much in the way of non-op production left in the Eagle Ford or Bakken?","Mark G. Papa","In the Bakken, no. I don't think we have any. It'd be just a tiny, miniscule amount, really. In the Eagle Ford, we do have some -- we are partners with PXP on some, where we operate some and they operate some on a 50-50 basis. So it's not a big amount relative to our Eagle Ford position. As just a guess, Bob, wow, 95%, maybe a little bit more than that of our Eagle Ford we operate, maybe 97%, something like that, we operate. But there is a little bit that is joint outside operated.","Operator","And moving on, we'll take our next question from Biju Perincheril from Jefferies.","Biju Z. Perincheril - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Going back to the Pearsall question earlier, have you drilled any wells to test the Pearsall? And drilling Eagle Ford, does that hold your Pearsall rights?","Mark G. Papa","Second question first. Yes, drilling an Eagle Ford well generally does not hold the Pearsall rights because the Pearsall is deeper than the Eagle Ford. And generally, most of the leases, you only earn to the depths drilled. In terms of -- we have done a little bit of testing of the Pearsall and really haven't disclosed any results yet on it. So you can take that as either a positive or negative. What we will say again are there are 3 or 4 zones both above and below the Eagle Ford that have the potential maybe to be productive, and we're kind of testing them in time. But they're really so secondary or almost tertiary to the potential of the Eagle Ford that they're -- not given it a very high priority relative to optimizing the Eagle Ford. In other words, if we can figure a way to improve our recovery factor by 2% or 3% in the Eagle Ford, it dwarfs whatever we might find in some of the other intervals in terms of magnitude. So that's kind of what's driving our priorities.","Biju Z. Perincheril - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then in the Eagle Ford, it looks like you've recently jumped over to, I guess, further Northeast in Madison County. Are you looking at the Eagle Ford, or is that a different play like the Woodbine there? Can you share any color on that?","William R. Thomas","Yes, we have drilled a well. It's called the Eaglebine play, generally, by the industry. And so we're testing some concepts over there. But we've really not thought much about that, and are not really prepared to talk much about that kind of play at this point.","Operator","And moving on, we'll take our next question from Bob Morris from Citigroup.","Robert S. Morris - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","When you mentioned potentially doing a JV in another oil play, I assume that's separate from the JV you did with Mitsubishi in the Tuscaloosa Marine Shale and is a play that you've not disclosed or talked about yet.","Mark G. Papa","Yes. Don't try and pin us down too much. We're really -- what you ought to take directionally out of that is our inventory in -- out of our big 4 plays is -- and our success rate there is so high that we could easily push essentially all of our cash flow into those plays next year. And so in any of our other oil plays, horizontal oil plays, we may elect to push our capital away from those and use JVs and allow us to funnel more money, particularly into the high rate of return Eagle Ford. So that's kind of the thinking behind what we're talking about.","Robert S. Morris - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then on the joint venture with Mitsubishi in the Tuscaloosa Marine Shale, what has been your activity under that joint venture to date?","Mark G. Papa","Yes. Well, currently, we've commenced drilling, and probably, by year end, we'll have first wells results on there. So I guess on the February earnings call, we'll know something from the first well.","Operator","Moving on, we'll take our next question from Irene Haas from Wunderlich Securities.","Irene O. Haas - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","I have actually 2 questions for you. Firstly, I wanted to find out, second half, looking into the Bakken and also the Eagle Ford, how should we think about the differential versus WTI or LLX, however you want to express that, and then also within your U.S. portfolio, percent of Bakken crude and Eagle Ford? So that's my first question. My second question is in light of the recent activity in Midland Basin, specifically to the Wolfcamp and Cline Shale play, are you still thinking with your 430,000 barrels per day EUR? Because one of your competitors have sort of raised that bar.","Mark G. Papa","Yes. Okay. Thanks, Irene. I'll fill the question about the differentials, and then I'll ask Bill Thomas to fill the question about the reserves in the Wolfcamp there. Our plan -- in the Eagle Ford, we're selling essentially all our oil now in the Houston market. And currently, in the Houston market, we're getting the same price essentially as if we were selling that oil in St. James, Louisiana. So we're getting pretty much St. James price. And then the Bakken, we continue to move a little bit of the Bakken oil on pipeline and selling it at Clear Brook just to keep some pipeline access, and that little bit of oil is getting -- suffering a severe discount, like the Bakken oil does up there. But the majority of our Bakken oil is getting moved by rail and sold as St. James. So essentially, the majority of both those areas, Bakken and Eagle Ford, is being sold at St. James prices. As to the question on the Wolfcamp reserves, Bill?","William R. Thomas","Yes, Irene, there's a couple things, comments on that. Yes, we're sticking -- I mean, right now, we're holding to our 430 Mboe per well on the Wolfcamp. And then it's the same, really, on the Wolfcamp or the Eagle Ford. When we're in the early stages on these wells, we're doing 2 things. We're trying to make better wells but we're also downspacing. So as we drill wells closer and closer together, we're trying to measure what the EUR per well is going to be. And so we're very cautious on increasing the EUR until we really get the proper spacing. And that goes for, really, any of these plays. And the other thing I would say about the Wolfcamp is it's not -- it's clearly in third place as far as rock quality. And it's cleared us -- we've completed, I think, 72 wells so far to date. And it's going to be more difficult in the Wolfcamp play to get the recovery factor up. It's not certainly as easy as the Eagle Ford play or the Bakken play to get really high recovery factor. So we're being very prudent. We're doing everything we can, technically, to make the play better. And it's a really good play, and we're very, very satisfied with our results there. But I would just be somewhat cautious on trying to extrapolate that we're going to get 6% or some really high number recovery factor out of the Wolfcamp as we've done in the Eagle Ford and some of these other plays just because the rock quality and the difficulty there has got a higher degree of difficulty.","Operator","Moving on, we'll take our next question from Doug Leggate.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Regarding the guidance, if I could go back again to the north of 100,00 barrels a day in the Eagle Ford, I got to tell you I'm struggling to get to your guidance for the year, Mark. Could you just walk us through -- I know you've already gone through it, but how many of the 145 completions are planned to be in the lower working interest areas? And if you could help us with the delta between your 100% working interest to what the actual difference is, order of magnitude, basically. And I have a follow-up, please.","Mark G. Papa","I don't know if we have that data right at hand here, Doug. Maybe Maire can get some of that information to you later on. I'd say again, the best way to look at it is probably the -- we've got more rigs moving to the West. We have less monster wells that are going to be completed in the third quarter versus the second, and some of them are lower -- clearly, some wells are going to be lower working interest, and there's just less capital going to be spent in the second half of the year. And then you've got the effect of, in the first half, we sold $1.2 billion worth of assets, and the effect of the liquids that we sold are going to bite in the second half of the year. So that's kind of the way to get to it, and that's the best explanation I can give you.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Maybe I can try the same question slightly differently. You would still expect Eagle Ford to grow from June levels in the second half? Is that a fair assertion?","Mark G. Papa","Yes.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. My second question's also on guidance. It's on the operating cost this time because it seems you had a pretty phenomenal second quarter on costs. But your guidance again has it moving right back up again in the second half of the year. Can you just walk us through why that would be the case? And I'll leave it at that.","Mark G. Papa","Yes. One piece of that guidance relates to Trinidad. If you notice, Trinidad, we had very high volumes in the second quarter, and then we're toning down those volumes for the second half. Trinidad has quite low operating costs. And so to the degree that those volumes are going to come down in the second half, that's going to skew the average operating cost back up a bit. So that's one piece of it. And a lot of it is, again, the growth in the -- the volume growth in the second half is going to just average -- the rate is going to be a bit lower across the whole company. So that's why we're expecting it to go up a little bit more. So we hope we can beat on the operating cost for the second half, but we'll just see.","Operator","And at this time, that will conclude our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Papa for any additional or closing remarks.","Mark G. Papa","No additional remarks. Thank you very much for listening.","Operator","And thank you. That will conclude today's conference. We thank everyone for their participation."],"8517":["EOG Resources, Inc.

Please go ahead, sir.","Tim Driggers","Thank you. Good morning, and thanks for joining us. We hope everyone has seen the press release announcing first quarter 2015 earnings and operational results.","This conference call includes forward-looking statements. The risks associated with forward-looking statements have been outlined in the earnings release and EOG's SEC filings, and we incorporate those by reference for this call.","This conference call also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation schedules for these non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures can be found on our website at www.eogresources.com.","The SEC permits oil and gas companies in their filings with the SEC to disclose not only proved reserves, but also probable reserves, as well as possible reserves. Some of the reserve estimates on this conference call and webcast may include potential reserves or other estimated reserves not necessarily calculated in accordance with or contemplated by the SEC's reserve reporting guidelines.","We incorporate by reference the cautionary note to U.S. investors that appears at the bottom of our press release and Investor Relations page of our website.","Participating on the call this morning are, Bill Thomas, Chairman and CEO; Gary Thomas, President and Chief Operating Officer; Billy Helms, EVP, Exploration and Production; David Trice, EVP, Exploration and Production; Lance Terveen, VP in Marketing Operations; and Cedric Burgher, Senior VP, Investor and Public Relations.","An updated IR presentation was posted to our website yesterday evening and we included guidance for the second quarter and full-year 2015 in yesterday's press release. This morning we will discuss topics in the following order. Bill Thomas, will review our 2015 plan and first quarter highlights; David Trice and Billy Helms will review operational results. I'll then discuss EOG's financials, capital structure, and hedge position, and Bill will provide concluding remarks.","Here is Bill Thomas.","Bill Thomas","Thanks, Tim, and good morning. Our strategy this year is to remain laser focused on returns and position EOG to resume peer-leading oil growth when oil prices recover. We laid out a plan two months ago on our year-end call and I am pleased that our first quarter results are right on track. We are quickly transforming the company to be successful in this low price environment. There are four basic objectives to our 2015 plan.","Objective number one, maximize 2015 return on capital invested and position the company to resume strong growth when oil prices recover. As we discussed earlier this year, our drilling operations are focused on our top three plays: the Eagle Ford, Delaware Basin, and Bakken, where 85% of our 2015 capital is directed. We generate a direct after-tax rate of return of 35% or greater, with a flat $55 WTI oil price in each of these plays, and returns improve as we lower cost and improve well productivity.","We have also stated that we have no interest in accelerating oil production at the bottom of the commodity price cycle. Instead, we are drilling but deferring completions on a significant number of wells known as DUCs until oil prices improve. A $10 increase in the price of oil, with a six month deferral adds about $300,000 of net present value to a typical well. This amounts to a significant value creation from our drilled but uncompleted well inventory. It is the right business decision to drill the wells and defer completions, instead of buying out drilling contracts or growing oil in a low price environment.","By deferring completion, and accelerating oil growth in a better price environment, we maximize 2015 return on capital invested and build momentum as we head into 2016. We plan to enter 2016 with approximately 285 DUCs. If oil prices recover and stabilize around $65 WTI, EOG can resume strong double-digit growth for the balance CapEx to discretionary cash flow program.","Objective number two, focus on improving well productivity and operational efficiencies to position EOG to exit this downturn stronger than we entered it. There are two primary drivers that will improve our per well and total asset returns. The first is well productivity enhancement, and the second is well cost reductions. For well productivity, we are expanding our use of high density completions and testing down spacing to maximize to NPV per section. For the next productivity game changer, we are beginning to look at ways to improve horizontal target selection. It's still early but initial results have been promising.","On the cost side, the slowdown in activity is giving us more time to focus on efficiency improvements. While much has been made of service cost reductions, we expect, we will gain the most long-term benefits from efficiency gains. Our efforts of driving down both well cost and operating expenses. Currently well costs are already running at or below 2015 plan levels across all our major plays. You will hear more specifics on cost reduction and productivity gains in a few minutes, as we discuss individual play highlights.","Objective number three, protect our balance sheet by meeting our cash flow and CapEx expectations for the year. As a result of existing service contract commitments, and projects set in motion in 2014, capital spent for this year is front-end loaded. We outspent discretionary cash flow in the first quarter. But for the remainder of the year we expect discretionary cash flow and CapEx to be balanced, if oil price remains near recent level. Capital discipline and the strong balance sheet are key to our long-term strategy. This allows us to manage our company through a low commodity price environment, such as today's, in addition that strength allows EOG to continue to make smart long-term rate of return driven operational decisions, such as infrastructure investments and acreage additions that will pay dividends for years to come.","Objective number four, take advantage of opportunities during the down cycle to add acreage. We are using our exploration skills to define high quality acreage and are having good success capturing leasehold interest in emerging plays. Competition is down, acreage is available, and leasing costs are low compared to previous years, and we are optimistic more opportunities will materialize as the year progresses. We are also evaluating tactical acquisition candidates.","Now let's take a moment to discuss our production performance and the outlook for the remainder of the year. We are not interested in growing oil at the bottom of the commodity price cycle. While oil production did come down sequentially in the first quarter, it was slightly over the high-end of our guidance. The driver of our outperformance was primarily improved well resorts. Our integrated completion technology, which combines improvements in target selection, and geo steering, with our latest techniques and high density completion decision is providing the next step change in our well performance. The best rocks respond best and big fields keep getting bigger. EOG's combination of sweet spot acreage and industry-leading technology enables us to continue to outperform expectations.","As we described on our February call, our production profile will be U-shaped this year. If the current forward oil curve continues to improve, our plan is to increase well completions in the third quarter. Therefore, we expect our oil productions to return to growth in the fourth quarter, building momentum as we head into 2016. We are right on track with this plan.","Now let's turn our attention to a discussion of our three high return oil plays. I will start by discussing the Eagle Ford; then David Trice, will discuss the Delaware Basin; and Billy Helms, will follow with a discussion of the Bakken and the Rockies plays.","In the Eagle Ford this year, we are reducing drilling rigs from 23 at year-end 2014 to an average of 15. We plan to complete about 345 net wells which is a 35% reduction in completions compared to 2014. As we reduce activity, we have a full court press to continue to reduce well costs and improve oil productivity. And I'm happy to report that excellent progress in both areas is underway.","Year-to-date, we have reduced total completed well costs by 10% from an industry-leading $6.1 million average well cost in 2014 to a current well cost of $5.5 million. The reduction is driven by combination of efficiency gains and lower service costs.","For 2015, increased pad drilling and fewer drilling requirements for lease retention have contributed to the efficiency gains. This year, approximately 75% of the wells will be drilled and completed on pads, and over 80% of our acreage is currently by production. At year-end, we expect to have more than 90% of our acreage held by production. We are targeting $5.3 million well cost by the end of this year, which if accomplished, would be 7% below our 2015 plan for the Eagle Ford.","In addition to cost reductions, we continue to make significant improvements in our integrated completion process, which combines target selection, geo steering, and high density completion designs. Identifying the best lot to drill the lateral, keeping the lateral in that lot longer, using the latest completion technology is making a significant difference in well productivity and decline curves. When we compare wells with high density completions versus wells with low density completions, we see a 23% increase in cumulative oil production in the first 90 days. We also see that that production rates are holding up longer.","With this success, we plan to complete about 95% of our 2015 Eagle Ford wells with high density completion designs. With lower declines, production growth will be easier to achieve than in previous years, and returns on investment will continue to increase as we move forward.","Finally, we're still experimenting with various techniques and spacing patterns such as using enhanced target selection methods and experimenting with W patterns within the lower Eagle Ford. We are optimistic this process will continue to increase our drilling inventory in the future. This slowdown in activity is allowing us to further evaluate this world-class asset. With better wells and lower costs, EOG's Eagle Ford asset is in great position to deliver strong growth and returns for many years to come.","I will now turn it over to David Trice to cover our Permian basin activity.","David Trice","Thanks, Bill. If you recall, we increased capital spend this year in the Permian, but we are still in the early innings of evaluating ultimate potential of our Delaware Basin asset. As we ramped up activity in Delaware Basin, we've made quick progress using our integrated completions process. We identified the best drilling targets within the best reservoirs, while making sure we keep our laterals in these discrete intervals. This, combined with our use of advanced EOG completion techniques, has resulted in dramatically improved wells.","During the first quarter, we were most active in the Second Bone Spring Sand play, where we are testing various targets as well as different well spacing patterns. Microseismic data we have gathered throughout the play indicates good pressure containment within the individual Second Bone Spring Sand targets. For example, we drilled three wells in Lea County, New Mexico, on the Jolly Roger 16 State Lease. The wells tested three different Second Bone Spring Sand targets at 600 foot well spacing. All three targets are very productive with IP rates ranging from 1,030 to 1,315 barrels of oil per day. And the technical data we collected does not indicate any production sharing between these wells. Going forward, we will continue to push spacing limits and test new targets.","Another notable Second Bone Spring Sand well we brought on in the first quarter was the Brown Bear 36 State Number 502H, which IP'd at a rate of 1,700 barrels of oil per day. We are very pleased with these results and expect our individual well performance and recoveries to continue to improve as we refine our drilling targets and implement high density conclusions.","In addition to impressive well results, we are pushing down cost. Our current well cost is $6 million, which is down 22% from 2014. We expect this trend to continue and have a target cost of $5.7 million by year-end.","The overpressure oil window and the Wolfcamp continues to deliver excellent results and rate of return. The Brown Bear 36 State Number 701H was drilled in Lea County, New Mexico, and came on at 3,165 barrels of oil per day. We are planning to increase our activity on this play throughout the remainder of the year. And we are confident we can achieve increased well performance and lower cost as we move toward development mode.","In the Leonard Shale, we completed a 300 foot spaced; four well pattern during the first quarter. The Excelsior-12 number 3H, 4H, 5H, and 6H, were brought on line producing from 955 to 1,165 barrels of oil per day. The Leonard Shale is the most mature of our current plays in the Delaware Basin.","The well economics continue to improve as we tighten spacing and lower cost. In fact, much like the Western Eagle Ford, we made better returns at $65 oil now than we could in 2012 at $95 oil. We are optimistic, similar trends will emerge in the Wolfcamp and Second Bone Spring Sand in the coming years. Even as EOG increases activity in the Delaware Basin, overall industry slowdown is helping us lower well cost, add additional acreage, and optimize long-term infrastructure needs, such as water handling and takeaway capacity.","We are very excited about the potential of the Delaware Basin and its key role in EOG's future growth.","Billy Helms will now discuss the Rockies plays.","Billy Helms","Thanks, David. As we previously stated, most of our 2015 capital in our Rockies plays will be focused in the Bakken, with minimal activity in the DJ Basin and Powder River Basin. Each of these are well established plays with significant remaining potential. And now, all are benefiting greatly from the pull-back in activity. Plans are in place and steady progress is being made in lowering cost in each phase of our operations.","In the Bakken, the slowdown in activity is allowing us to focus on three things. First, we have made tremendous progress on operational efficiencies and lowering well cost. Our typical 10,000 foot lateral is now drilled in just over 10 days. And the well cost is currently 14% less than the 2014 well cost. We anticipate this year's well cost will be as much as 20% below 2014 levels with a target of $7.4 million.","Second, we are using new technical data from our integrated completion process to further adjust and tailor our high density completion designs to specific formation properties. Understanding and using this data gives us insight into to how to adjust the completion along the lateral to effectively optimize each stage. These modifications are leading to improved results.","And third, we're able to maintain a more stable production base with minimal downtime associated with offset competition interference. This allows us to better evaluate the production from various spacing patterns to determine our ultimate development plan. In the first quarter, we began producing eight wells in two 500 foot space patterns in the partial area. Initial per well production rates from a five-well pattern averaged 1,235 barrels of oil per day and a three-well pattern averaged 1,345 barrels of oil per day.","We are encouraged by the results from these down spacing patterns and are confident in our ability to maximize the recovery and ultimately, net present value of this asset.","In the DJ Basin, we continue to refine our targeting in the Codell and experiment with modified completion designs. Recent examples of improved targeting and completions are two Jubilee Wells that each had initial production rates of over 1,000 barrels of oil per day. Further, 2015 activity in the DJ will be limited to drilling wells nearly to maintain leasehold and finishing completion operations on a few wells.","In the Powder River Basin, activity will be focused on delineation and target selection of this profitable stacked resource play. The Turner formation is one of these stacked pay interval and continues to generate good results as evidenced by the recently completed Flatbow 13-13H with an IP of 860 barrels of oil per day.","Our commitment to the long-term profitability of our Rockies plays is emphasized by additional infrastructure capital being invested that could reduce our future well cost by $300,000 to $500,000 per well. These investments include building more pipelines to move water to well-sites, and adding water handling infrastructure for recycling and disposal. As a result, we will not only reduce upfront capital but also reduce long-term LOE. These investments will decrease our need for trucking services and also help our communities by reducing truck traffic.","I'll now turn it over to Tim Driggers to discuss financials and capital structure.","Tim Driggers","Thanks, Billy. Capitalized interest for the first quarter 2015 was $12 million. Total cash exploration and development expenditures were $1.5 billion, excluding acquisitions and asset retirement obligations. In addition, expenditures for gathering systems, processing plants, and other property, plant, and equipment, were $117 million.","Drilling activity is expected to decline in the second quarter and flat now. And we have maintained our full-year capital expenditure guidance of $4.9 billion to $5.1 billion.","At the end of March 2015, total debt outstanding was $6.9 billion, and the debt to total cap ratio was 28%. At March 31, we had $2.1 billion of cash on hand, giving us non-GAAP net debt of $4.8 billion or net debt to total cap ratio of 21%.","In April, Moody's confirmed EOG's A3 rating with a stable outlook. The effective tax rate for the first quarter was 28% and the current tax expense was $31 million. For the period May 1, through June 30, 2015, EOG has crude oil financial price swap contracts in place for 47,000 barrels of oil per day at a weighted average price of $91.22 per barrel. For the period July 1, through December 31, 2015, EOG has crude oil financial price swap contracts in place for 10,000 barrels of oil per day at a weighted average price of $89.98 per barrel. These numbers exclude options that are exercisable by our counterparties.","For the period June 1, through December 31, 2015, EOG has natural gas financial price swap contracts in place for approximately 203,500 MMBtu per day at a weighted average price of $4.31 per MMBtu. These numbers exclude options that are exercisable by our counterparties.","Now, I'll turn it back over to Bill.","Bill Thomas","Thanks, Tim. We continue to believe that current oil process will discourage oil exploration and development worldwide and will encourage demand growth. This will correct the current oversupply situation and the market will continue to rebalance. We believe there is more upside to the forward curve than downside.","In summary, here are some important points to take away from this call. First, EOG remains disciplined. We are committed to maintaining our strong balance sheet. We do not plan to increase 2015 CapEx. And at recent oil price, our CapEx to discretionary cash flow will be balanced for the remainder of the year.","Second, the company's priority remains clearly focused on returns. We have directed 2015 capital to our highest oil return plays, which generate 35% or better after-tax rates of return at $55 WTI price environment. Returns are improving on each of these assets as we go forward. Well costs are going down and well productivity is going up. Even as oil prices have retreated, our direct rates of return are improving, and EOG will be more than competitive in the world markets as we go forward.","Third, we continue to organically grow reserve potential in our existing plays through down spacing and completion enhancements. We believe that Eagle Ford, Delaware Basin, and Bakken, will continue to grow in drilling potential. We are also optimistic that we will find new potential through our exploration efforts. As we test and confirm meaningful results, we will update you with new potential reserve estimates in the future.","Fourth, we've said all along that we are preparing to return to growth in 2016 when oil prices improve. If we have $65 WTI price environment in 2016, we can presume our strong double-digit oil growth profile with a balance CapEx to discretionary cash flow program.","And finally, EOG is in this business for the long-term. We've not made short-term decisions this year that would hinder our future growth. This year, we are even more committed to advancements in the technology, exploration, cost reduction, and operational execution. The company is building on the culture that has set EOG apart and resetting the bar to be successful in a lower commodity price environment. As we look to the future, we fully expect to remain the North America growth leader and the peer leader in returns on capital employed.","Thanks for listening. Now we'll go to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions].","And we'll take our first question from Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Doug Leggate","Bill, I wonder if I could touch on your completion strategy. What would it take -- what would we need to see in order to re-up the -- I guess the pace of completions to match your drilling pace? And I guess, and a related question is the backlog that you've talked about coming out of 2015, what kind of pace would you expect to move those towards production? And then I've got a quick follow-up please.","Bill Thomas","Yes, Doug, thanks for the question. Yes, the reason we've deferred the completions is to really substantially increase the rate of return. So as we go forward this year, it's really important for us to be patient and allow the prices to continue to firm up. As I've said, every -- the first $10 in oil price increase with a six months deferral is a $300,000 net PV add to typical well. So we want to make sure that we allow prices to firm up and that the prices will continue to be firm and not short-term.","And then on a -- we are -- as you see, we're getting significant cost reduction as we go forward. We're gaining on that every day. And we're gaining on well productivity as we go forward. So we don't want to get in a hurry. We want to stay disciplined. We certainly don't want to jump, start completions, and the price may be fall back. So if the forward curve continues to stay firm, then our plan, as we said, is to begin completing wells in the third quarter.","And we will really look at what the outlook on 2016 prices are that's what we're targeting and that's what we're really focusing on. So we'll just continue to watch the fundamentals and certainly we want to be convinced that they're strong going forward. And we'll really make the call for the third quarter activity probably July or so after we get a little bit more data.","Doug Leggate","So just to be clear on the pace of -- I mean you could obviously bring those completions back very, very quickly and turbo charge to your drill. So I don't know how easy as to frame the pace but I mean would you plan to have the backlog with just -- I guess a level of this equivalent to your current drilling rate within a period of time, can you help kind of walk us through how you may think about that, just trying to see what the upside is to the growth side, when you come -- when you go back to completing those wells?","Bill Thomas","Yes, we're going to -- I guess the answer to that, Doug, is we're going to be really patient and disciplined about it and kind of gradually increase the activities we go forward, making sure that the price is going to hold up. And we really do, as a company, EOG we're very, very focused on returns. So every time that price increases a little bit and every time we get the productivity wells up and get the cost down, we're making higher returns so there is no use pushing that too quickly.","And so the ramp up will be, as we talked about, the production shape is going to be U-shaped this year and the second and third quarters will be the low point, but the fourth quarter, with the current plan, is to ramp up production growth and the heading into 2016 on a very strong note.","Doug Leggate","Appreciate that. But my very quick follow up, hopefully I'm not taking up too much time here, but just on the comment on the tactical acquisitions, I just wonder if I could indulge me as you can get indulge me to may be elaborate a little bit on whether you're -- you see a pipeline has sufficient closer between the bid and ask, if you like. And there's been some speculation that you folks might have been interested or may be still be interested in looking at some of the resource available in California. And I just wonder if you could add that in your answer and I'll leave it there? Thank you.","Bill Thomas","Yes, I'm going to ask Billy Helms, he is very engaged in that process and so he can bring us up to-date on that.","Billy Helms","Yes, good morning, Doug. We're -- yes, we are looking at a lot of opportunities, as you know; there is a lot of opportunities out there. There's still a pretty good spread between the bid and ask on the acquisition front. I think we'll be very selective. We continue to be very selective in our approach, and what we're looking for, and I think we'll see some opportunities as we go forward, but there will be smaller, more tactical acquisitions, as well as just continuing to be able to accrete leasehold in some of our key plays and emerging place.","And so I think that's going to be our approach. I don't think you'll see us doing any large M&A kind of things in the future. They'll be more targeted to the smaller things that we've traditionally done as a company. And so continue to be very selective and review those on a one case or case-by-case basis.","Operator","And we'll move to our next question that will come from Paul Sankey with Wolfe Research.","Paul Sankey","Sorry to press on the drilled uncompleted but I guess a follow-up is trying to get a sense of the pace at which the 285 would come back relative to how much drilling you would do simultaneously. I think what you're saying is that a $65 plus price you would be ramping up I guess the DUCs or the drilling both simultaneously? Could you just go into that again? Thanks.","Bill Thomas","Yes, Paul, that's a good question. And as we head into the last half of this year and think about 2016, we'll be on a pretty good uptick. So what we want to do is get the equipment and the people and place and get the process started certainly very strongly in the second half of the year. And then, when we hit 2016, if oil prices continue to hold up, we will continue to increase our activity accordingly. Of course the goal is and the plan is to continue to remain CapEx to discretionary cash flow balance. And so that will really govern our activity. The stronger the price of oil is they're more obviously capital we'll have to work with and the more we'll continue to increase our activity.","As we look at the second part of this year, part of the process will be evaluating is how many drilling rigs to continue to have joint wells versus releasing rigs. And that certainly will be a function of what the oil price is. And so we won't get too far out in front on the drilling side. The 285 DUC that we start the year with most likely over the first half of the year will reduce significantly as we go forward and we'll exit the year, next year, with considerably less DUCs than we\u2019re exiting this year with.","Paul Sankey","Yes, I think I understand. So I think -- to reinterpret the close that you're to 65 the more DUCs will be used to generate the double-digit return but excuse me seasonally double-digit growth. But what you're essentially saying if we're 65 or above you will be delivering double-digit growth next year?","Bill Thomas","Yes, I think that's correct, yes, good.","Paul Sankey","Thank you. And then the follow-up is there is some criticism always about the relationship between the IRRs of individual wells and how they flow through to corporate returns. Could you just add anything that you have to add on how the current environment and the outlook will flow through, if you like, to your overall corporate return on capital employed? Thank you.","Bill Thomas","Yes, the rates of return that we talk about -- the direct rates of return and we used direct after-tax numbers when we quote our plays, those are on capital for the well cost and the production facilities of that well and that's the only cost in there. Of course the full corporate returns on ROCE are all capital and all capital spent from the history of the company. And so you\u2019ve got legacy gas properties in there and lots of other things in there over time and that's the real difference in the thing.","As you -- everybody has noted over the last several years, EOG's ROCE numbers have continued to improve rather strongly, and over the last year, our ROCE numbers were higher certainly than the E&P peer group and they were even higher than the average of the integrators and the majors. So we have one of the strongest track records and one of the strongest ROCEs in the business and that just reflects EOG's continued focus on returns.","Rates of return on our capital drives every decision in EOG and it is the fundamental metric that we use to manage the company. So as we talk about this year we're deferring wells that's really just to drive up the returns on our capital and all these things we're doing to decrease well cost and increase productivity are very, very focused on driving up the returns to the company as we go forward. So really that's the main difference.","Paul Sankey","Appreciate that. Thank you.","Operator","And next we'll go to Leo Mariani with RBC.","Leo Mariani","Hey guys, I was hoping you could give us a little bit more color around your second quarter U.S. oil production guidance. I look at the -- I guess the midpoint in the second quarter is down roughly 10% sequentially versus the first quarter. Could you guys kind of provide some color around that whether or not number of completions is extremely limited here in the second quarter? When you guys talked about deferring and is that deferring almost all of them or just majority, could you just kind of give us some color around that?","Bill Thomas","Yes, the reason that we're -- our guidance from the second quarter is down is because we've had a significant reduction in the amount of wells we complete that's really the driver. We were down 39% in completions in the first quarter. And then, in the second quarter, we were down additional 36%. And that is really just a process of deferring the wells and not completing the wells and just really taking off the spin right as we move into the second quarter. So that's really just driving it. And of course those will, we still have maintained our full-year guidance and we'll be making that backup that production backup in the second half of the year and it will be at much higher returns because we are waiting.","Leo Mariani","All right. I guess obviously you guys talked about sticking to your capital budget here in all costs. But at the same time you\u2019re also talking about starting to accelerate some completions at $65 oil which could happen as soon as this 3Q. Just to clarify is that accelerated activity in 3Q and 4Q, if we get to the right oil price, is that actually in the CapEx budget for 2015 already?","Bill Thomas","Yes, Leo, let me let Gary Thomas address that.","Gary Thomas","Yes, Leo. We do have those incorporated in our capital with our ramp up there, as Bill said, may be starting in July just watching oil prices but then will ramp up through the year. As a matter of fact yes we're doing less completions, we're kind of keep our frac rates in place, we've dropped them down from 7 days to 5 days, just everything to conserve capital here in the first half.","Leo Mariani","All right. That's helpful. And I guess just talking about some down spacing result that you all had. I guess in particular looks like in the Bakken and the Leonard; it looks like some of the IP rates you reported in some of those areas a little bit lower than some of the previous wells. Am I interpreting that you may be seeing some initial interference on those or is that incorrect?","Billy Helms","Yes, Leo, this is, Billy Helms. For the Bakken, as we continue to experiment with our completion designs we're seeing different areas of the field have different rock properties and we're tailoring those completion designs to match those rock properties. So we have, as you can imagine the quality of the rock varies across the field, so you got some areas that generate a little bit higher production rates than other areas.","So it's just a function of the properties of that particular area other reservoir and we're very confident that our down spacing patterns and our approaches that we're testing are going to lead to our best recovery in net present value for those assets.","Operator","And next we'll go to Subash Chandra with Guggenheim.","Subash Chandra","So a question on the Eagle Ford. I guess the W pattern staggered pattern I guess being described there in some of the other things you're trying. Is it too early to hazard a guess as to the inventory gains you might have come out of this process and similarly and say the Bakken where you're doing similar work?","Bill Thomas","Yes, it's too early on that to give some guidance on the inventory possibilities but certainly we\u2019re optimistic. There is going to be upside but a little of what we're doing there is we\u2019re using some enhanced identification tools to really identify the very, very best targets in the lower Eagle Ford. The rock quality varies as you go vertically up and down the section and we believe we have the ability to identify better rock in certain parts of the Eagle Ford and then make target selections based on that. So it's not just a geo metric pattern, it really is got a lot of technical work behind it and a lot of high grading as we pick each one of those targets. And so we're really just starting that process and we're optimistic about it but it's really too early to give guidance on the amount of upside it might be.","Subash Chandra","It is fair to say though I think in your commentary you said that because my initial impression was that individual wells will be better but I think you talked about increasing inventory there. So is it fair to say that as you target these laterals you might actually be accessing or getting a lot more locations out of more of the rock within say a section?","Bill Thomas","Yes, that's definitely true. We're hopeful that it will continue to build our inventory up. We have to prove that but certainly that is strong possibility.","Operator","And next we'll go to Charles Meade with Johnson Rice.","Charles Meade","Bill, if I could ask a question again on your 2015 plans, may be from a little different angle. The way it seems to me, what you've articulated this morning it\u2019s pretty much the same as what you talked about two months ago with ramping activity towards the end of the year into 2016. But I'm curious, can you may be speak about at the margin, has there been a shift in your thinking, especially, we're looking at crude over $60, close to $61 here today. And is there may be some subtlety in a shift from which we're thinking a couple of months ago when you talked about Q4 results that you want to direct us to?","Bill Thomas","No Charles. That\u2019s a good question. We really don\u2019t have a lot of different outlook on the macro or our 2015 plan than we had back in our February call. We made the call to defer drilling, because we thought this would be or could be a short-term cycle, and we're hopeful and certainly we're encouraged by the current firming of the products. So we\u2019re hopeful that\u2019s what will turn out.","But we still, as I said earlier, we're more optimistic in the forward curve than what it is right now. So we believe being patient and waiting on that products to continue to come up, while also continuing to take advantages of the cost reductions in the wells and the well productivity improvement. Those will all make a very significant difference in the returns we get on the wells when we begin to complete them. So you're correct. The plan is in the process of thinking is really, basically the same as it was in February?","Charles Meade","Right. Thank you for that clarification. Then, if I could ask about the -- you guys talked a few times in your press release about these integrated completion designs and tailoring the completion to the individual wellbore. Can you talk a bit about what that means? Whether it means varying the stage spacing along the wellbore, whether it's -- you\u2019re choosing your different pump rates or sand loadings for one stage versus the next, and perhaps also offer an idea of how big an opportunity is this?","David Trice","Yes, Charles, this is David. On these integrated completion, it's not a whole lot of different than what we've always been. We've always really focused on the very best rock and the very best interval within the overall section. And we try to keep our lateral in that and then when it comes with completions, we integrate that in as well. And we do very; we basically design each stage for the well and for that specific portion of the lateral.","So it\u2019s really an overall process and we've seen dramatic results over the years and even over the last several quarters in the well results. We really think of the -- it\u2019s really kind of part of the EOG culture and gives us a big competitive advantage going forward.","Operator","And next we'll go to Irene Haas with Wunderlich Securities.","Irene Haas","Hello, my question has to do with Delaware Basin. You are in full development mode in the Second Bone Spring, just may be a little bit more color on the Wolfcamp. Your successful wells are they coming from the upper or middle interval; and ultimately, how many benches within the Wolfcamp could be productive in this part of Delaware Basin so in the central North?","David Trice","Yes, Irene, this is David. As far as the Wolfcamp goes, we mainly have been targeting the upper Wolfcamp. We think that there is a very large potential throughout the Wolfcamp. But our very focus has mainly been on the upper.","And with regard to the Second Bone Spring Sand, we're moving towards development mode there. We obviously have a lot of work to do. We're testing a lot of targets. We're testing spacing there, and we're continuing to refine our completions but we see quite a bit upside left, really in all those plays.","Operator","And moving on we\u2019ll go to David Tameron with Wells Fargo.","David Tameron","I'll leave the acceleration question alone. I don't want to hit on that anymore. But just to clarify, you guys in the presentation you put in well cost which are running ahead of plan and then you put some target well cost, are those achievable, are those targets achievable? Is that a 2015 goal or is that a 2016 kind of outlook or how should we think about those target well cost?","Gary Thomas","This is Gary Thomas. On last February, we just mentioned that we were expecting to see our well cost down in the 10% to 20% range. And we're really pleased with the progress that we've made there and various things, but looks to me that our cost is going to be in the 20% to 20% plus. And most all these areas, we\u2019ve got target wells, our record wells that have exceeded our targets.","So yes, we're making good strides there. And we're also pleased that about half of that gain has been in vendor-cost reduction, but the other half has been in our efficiency gains. I'm really pleased with the efficiency gains, because you can see that on the number of days per well. And that\u2019s why we had the one Exhibit comparing yes the Barnett that we had worked in for several years versus the Eagle Ford. And there is still quite a lot of room, which is the EOG myntra; pleased, not satisfied. We're going to continue to make gains there.","Operator","Moving on we\u2019ll go to Pearce Hammond with Simmons and Company.","Pearce Hammond","Bill, service providers have highlighted refracts as a significant opportunity. Do you see such an opportunity for EOG with refracts?","Bill Thomas","Pearce, we get that question quite a bit and we've looked at it and talked about it internally and we've not tried any refracts. Our outlook on that is that it really -- technically, we believe that just drilling a new well and kind of starting fresh and making sure your lateral is in the very best target and making sure that you can redistribute the frac very evenly along the wellbore with the new well is probably the preferred way to go. We just think that the upside on the completion will be much greater than if you try to refract the well.","Then the other thing, obviously that contributes to that is the well cost on the drilling side is we can see are just getting lower and lower and becoming a smaller percentage of the total well cost. So drilling a new well from the drilling side standpoint is just a pretty low-cost item today. And there is a lot more upside in just drilling the well -- redrilling the well and doing it right.","Pearce Hammond","Great. Thanks for that color. And then my follow-up is how quickly do you think the industry and this includes obviously the service companies have to lay off a lot of people. How quickly do you think the industry can respond to higher prices? Is there going to be a substantial lag to adding activity or do you think there is enough capacity out there, service capacity that it can come back and fairly rapid order?","Bill Thomas","No, it Pearce, it depends on how much longer this goes. If we were ramping up here in the next month or two, I think you can ramp up pretty rapidly. And that's why many of those operators are trying to keep as many services in place even if reduced work levels just to maintain that support that service companies.","So as we've said before, yes, we\u2019ll be able to ramp there pretty rapidly on our production with just our DUCs that we have in inventory. But then it will take possibly a little longer just from the drilling site.","Operator","And next we'll go to Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer","I wanted to just see if you could provide some clarity on how your decline rates are trending versus your expectations on fee front? It seems you\u2019re naturally seeing sharper first year decline rates that complement your higher initial production rates from enhanced completion. What trends are you seeing overall versus your type curves in the Eagle Ford, Bakken, and Permian, when it comes to declines and the many efforts you\u2019re making on longer-term decline rate mitigation in this environment?","Billy Helms","Yes, Brian, this is Billy Helms. What we're actually seeing on our new completion approach is by targeting the wells in the better pay zones and then doing a better job of placing the completions along the lateral is we're seeing actually that declines are flattening over time. So little bit less decline over time and I think that's transferring yourself all through the company level I think as the base of production gets more material and larger and relative to the new wells we're bringing on that our -- our production decline is flattening over time as well. So I think we're seeing a lot of advantages to this new completion technique that we're still yet to fully realize and will material with time.","Brian Singer","Got it. Thank you. And then shifting back to the Delaware Basin and the Wolfcamp area you highlighted the Brown Bear Wolfcamp Well. Can you put into context what a 24 hour rate of 2,165 barrels a day means relative to your 900 MBOE typical Wolfcamp EUR it seems like the oil mix there was much higher versus your typical well. And whether this is an area that you already assumed was commercial or whether it represents a step out in Lea County, just kind of want to see whether this is a normal well, an above average well or something that\u2019s more substantive from a resource and productivity perspective?","David Trice","Yes, Brian, this is David. I would say, certainly this is a very good well and we\u2019re not necessarily surprised by the Lea County is a good area. We\u2019ve drilled some good Wolfcamp wells there in the past. I think as far as how it compares with the model, I think it would be fairly close to the model and we continue to see progress on these wells and I think over time we're hopeful that we'll even see better wells.","Operator","And our final question will come from Marshall Carver with Heikkinen Energy Advisors.","Marshall Carver","Yes, regarding the W shape patterns in the Eagle Ford are you testing that in several areas then how much of your acreage do you think might work for that. And how far are part of the wellbores in those patterns? How much tighter is it than what you were doing before?","Bill Thomas","Marshall, the W pattern we will do multiple pilots patterns on that and it really will apply to I think the bulk of our Eagle Ford acreage. And what we're doing is we\u2019re bringing the wells in. We've been drilling wells anywhere from 3 to 500 feet apart in our typical patterns, but we're bringing those closer. And we'll be doing that at various spacing closer than 3 to 500 feet and it really will vary a bit on the spacing depending on the area. But the general concept of taking out multiple targets within the lower Eagle Ford using these advanced techniques to identify the best rock will be apical across the bulk of our acreage.","Marshall Carver","Okay, thank you. And one follow-up if I could the current 2016 strip is at $65 but you mentioned seeing more upside than downside on the strip. How would hedges potentially factor into your plans to accelerate if the strip moves up could we see a flat -- how are you thinking about that hedges and how you could be your plans for acceleration?","Bill Thomas","Yes, Marshall, we're certainly evaluating that all along and we're really again a bit more optimistic about forward curves even then it is today. But we want to put some hedges in going into next year. And we'll just be looking at that and trying to find the opportunistic entry point as we kind of go forward. So really kind of watch the fundamentals of supply and demand and really pick the point that we think is the right point to make an entry there.","Operator","And that does conclude our question-and-answer session. I\u2019ll turn it back to Mr. Bill Thomas for any additional or closing comments.","Bill Thomas","We\u2019re very excited about what\u2019s happening in EOG this year. We said at the beginning of the year that when this downturn started that we wanted to emerge in better shape than we entered it. And what you\u2019re seeing today and what we're reporting today is exactly that happening.","And in my 36 years with the company, I\u2019ve never seen a company respond better. The company is driving down the cost and improving the productivity of the wells rapidly and whether oil prices remain where they are today or continue to improve, EOG is resetting the bar to be successful for many years to come, and we thank -- so thank you for listening today and thank you for all your support.","Operator","Thank you. And once again that will conclude today's conference. We'd like to thank everyone for their participation."],"8898":["EOG Resources, Inc.

As a reminder, this call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions I would like to turn the call over to Chief Financial Officer of EOG Resources, Mr. Tim Driggers. Please go ahead, sir.","Tim Driggers ","Good morning and thanks for joining us. We hope everyone has seen the Press Release announcing second quarter 2019 earnings and operational results. This conference call includes forward-looking statements. The risks associated with forward-looking statements have been outlined in the earnings release in EOG's SEC filings and we incorporate those by reference for this call.

We incorporate by reference the cautionary note to U.S. investors that appears at the bottom of our earnings release issued yesterday.","Participating on the call this morning are Bill Thomas, Chairman and CEO; Billy Helms, Chief Operating Officer; Ken Boedeker, EVP, Exploration and Production; Ezra Yacob, EVP Exploration and Production; Lance Terveen, Senior VP, Marketing ;and David Streit, VP, Investor and Public Relations.","Here\u2019s Bill Thomas.","Bill Thomas ","Thanks Tim and good morning everyone. EOG does not need high oil prices to create significant value for our shareholders. During the second quarter, despite a 12% decline in WTI oil prices, EOG generated more than $350 million of free cash flow, lowered our long term debt by $900 million and paid a substantially larger dividend than last year, all while organically growing U.S. oil production by 20%. ","The EOG culture consistently making improvements throughout the company year-after-year has propelled EOG to compete financially with the very best in the S&P500, all with oil prices averaging below $60 per barrel. ","We are now capable of delivering double digit return on capital employed, and double digit growth while generating substantial free cash flow through the commodity price cycles. Our commitment to strong free cash flow is enabling us to rapidly grow the dividend. We've increased the dividend 72% in the last two years and our ambition is to target a yield that is competitive in the S&P500, which stands around 2%. ","EOG never stops improving. We are one of the lowest cost producers in the global oil market and we continue to lower the cost of our business. In fact we have strong visibility and high confidence in our ability to lower our costs, so that by 2022 we can earn at least 10% return on capital employed at oil prices below $50 per barrel. ","Our first half results confirm that EOG is stronger than ever, and we are delivering a banner year in operational performance. For two quarters in a row we delivered more oil for less capital. With efficiency gains and new technology, we are achieving strong capital and operating cost reductions, while at the same time delivering excellent well performance. ","In addition, the company is leasing anchorage and testing new geologic plate concepts that we believe could lower our decline rate and continue to reduce our costs to produce oil. ","At EOG we have always believed in being a good corporate citizen goes hand-in-hand with delivering a long term value for shareholders. The same spirit of innovation that drives our excellence in operations is aimed at ensuring the business is sustainable in the long run. We are excited about several new environmental, social and governance initiatives that will both reduce our environmental footprint, while helping to lower costs and earned strong returns. ","We are a leader in water reuse in the Permian Basin, currently sourcing 90% of our water needs from recycled production water. We are busy transferring our reuse technology to other Basins. EOG is also a first mover and we believe the largest user of electric powered frac fleets. ","Later this year we will be testing the use of solar power to generate electricity for natural gas compression. Our expanding implementation of water reuse, electric frac fleets and solar power are just a few of the many things we are doing to reduce our environmental footprint. ","Our goal is to be the leader in ESG Performance by delivering high returns with responsibly focused operations. We will have more details in our updated sustainable report to be published later this year. ","The EOG culture is more than three decades in the making, and the foundation of our competitive advantage. Our ability to continuously improve the company is accelerating over time. It\u2019s not just a few items that we work on, it's every nut and bolt and every process in the company. ","Our culture of innovation, leverage through the application of real time data analysis, with our advanced information technology systems enables everyone in the company to create value. EOGs business is better than ever and our insatiable desire to improve has us excited about our future. ","Next up is Billy to review our second quarter operational performance and the outlook for the remainder of 2019.","Billy Helms","Thanks Bill. For the second consecutive quarter, oil production beats the high end of our forecasted range, while the capital expenditures were below the low end. The performance in the first half of the year demonstrates our focus on continuous improvement as evidenced by our higher capital efficiency, lower operating costs and ongoing integration of operating practices to minimize our environmental footprint. ","There are several factors that drive these outstanding results. First, our production beat this quarter is due to improve well performance. Our new completion designs, including the use of diverters, along with a continued focus on target selection are the main reasons for the improvement. ","Beyond the completion design itself, we also developed proprietary technology that allows us to make real time adjustments during the execution of the frac, to minimize the impact on nearby producing wells, thus reducing shut-in volumes. Ken will expand on this technology in a moment. ","Second, we continue to reduce capital costs and see line of sight to reach our goal of reducing total well cost by 5% this year. Through the first half we have realized about a 4% reduction compared to 2018, as a result of improved operational execution. Design enhancements and efficiency improvements, not service cost reductions, are delivering consistently better results across each of our active areas. ","Third, our operating cost performance has been outstanding. As a result, we are lowering our full year unit cost forecast for LOE and transportation. Cash operating costs which include LOE, transportation and G&A are expected to be under $9 a barrel for the full year 2019 compared to nearly $13 a barrel as recently as 2014. ","Fourth, as Bill mentioned in his opening remarks, we are committed to sustainability. Our decision to embrace electric frac fleets is an example of how we continue to find innovative solutions, to both reduce our environmental footprint and improve the profitability of our business. We began piloting this new technology last year in the Eagle Ford and have since utilized them in the Delaware Basins. ","Electric frac fleets currently make up more than a quarter of EOG fleets. We believe EOG is using about a third of the electric frac fleets available in the market, and we are looking to expand their use in our operations going forward. Our experience with this new technology has been very positive. We estimate electric fleets save up to $200,000 per well and reduce combustion emissions from completion operations about 35% to 40%. ","The EOG continues to expand its use of water reuse program. In the Delaware Basin nearly 90% of our water needs are currently sourced from recycled produced water. We are increasing our water reuse efforts in both the Eagle Ford and Woodford plays and are beginning to install reuse infrastructure in the emerging Powder River Basin. ","In the second half of this year we plan to initiate a pilot project that combines solar and natural gas to power compressor stations. While this first of its kind system is still in the design phase, early indications point to positive economics, reduced LOE and the potential to significantly reduce our combustion emissions.","Finally, looking ahead to the remainder of 2019, we modestly increased our full year U.S. oil production guidance as a result of better well performance. There is no change to our activity level in 2019. We will remain disciplined and still expect capital expenditures to be within the original range of $6.1 billion and $6.5 billion. ","Capital is trending to the low side of expectations, so assuming the trend continues, any realized savings if spent will likely be directed to two areas, water, oil and gas infrastructure to lower our operating expenses, and lease holds to support our ongoing exploration efforts.","For 2020 we are beginning to evaluate multiple scenarios, but sufficed to say, it is too early to provide any color or commentary on our plans at this time. In summary, our operating teams are executing the 2019 program and generating excellent results; I could not be more proud of them. ","Now I would like to provide some color on our Powder River Basin activity. In the first half of the year we initiated a handful of delineation and completion technology tests to better define our future program. As a reminder, we announced premium inventory at more than 1,500 locations with reserve potential of 1.9 billion barrels of oil equivalent, exactly one year ago. ","We are deliberately developing the play at a very modest pace to allow time to integrate both the build out of infrastructure, as well as incorporate the data and knowledge from our delineation wells. In addition, our diverse portfolio of 11 different plays gives us the luxury of pacing the development of the Powder River Basin, to maximize returns in net present value of the entire asset. ","During the second quarter we completed five gross Narborough wells with average 30 day IPs of 1,000 barrels of oil per day, 100 barrels per day of NGLs and 2.1 million cubic feet of gas per day. The tiburon 251 well had an IP30 of 1,300 barrels of oil per day, 63 barrels per day of NGLs and 2 million cubic feet per day of natural gas. Also, our operating teams are making tremendous progress toward reaching our stated well cost goals. ","In the Mowry we completed two gross wells in the second quarter. The flat Boed 870 well had an IP30 of 910 barrels of oil per day, 64 barrels per day of NGLs with 6.3 million cubic feet per day of natural gas. We also completed six gross Turner wells with an average IP30 of 700 barrels of oil per day, 150 barrels per day of NGLs and 2.7 million cubic feet per day of natural gas. Our program in the Powder River Basin continues to deliver strong results and we will continue to develop at a modest pace as infrastructure is installed. ","In the Wyoming DJ Basin it is continuing to deliver solid production results with improving operational execution. We completed 18 gross wells in the second quarter, with six wells having an average lateral length exceeding 14,000 feet. In all, the Codell wells delivered an average IP30 of 800 barrels of oil per day. ","Next up is Ken to review highlights from our Eagle Ford and Woodford plays. ","Ken Boedeker ","Thanks Billy. The Eagle Ford continues to deliver consistent performance quarter-after-quarter. This world class oil asset is off to a great start in 2019, delivering low finding costs through ongoing cost reductions. Every measure of capital productivity is better in the first half of 2019 compared to full year 2018. ","This quarter I\u2019ll highlight recent operational efficiencies driven by right sizing our completion designs and refining its execution. The wellbore stimulation process is aided by software developed in house, using our proprietary software and data on the nearby wells geology, spacing, lateral placement and production history, a unique completion design is prepared for each well in a pattern. The software allows EOG engineers to monitor real-time completions data, not only on the well we are stimulating, but also on surrounding wells. This enables the engineers to make real-time adjustments to the stimulation on a stage-by-stage basis. The result is a customized stimulation that can reduce pump time by 10%. ","The process also yields better well performance, both in and the new wells being completed and in the adjacent producing wells. For the new well, we can realize the same or better well performance with less sand. As a result, our completion costs are down 9% compared to last year, which is a significant contributor to our overall lower finding costs. ","Second, for the nearby producing wells, reduced sand loadings translate to reduce instances of sand reaching these offset wells. LOE costs come down due to reduced work over expenses to clean out sand during production and the associated downtime due to shut-ins is reduced, increasing volumes. In addition to completion cost reductions, we improved drawing speed and efficiency in the Eagle Ford. Thus far we've nearly realized or full year well cost reduction goal of 5%. ","Now, moving the discussion Oklahoma, the Woodford Oil Play in the Anadarko Basin continues to gain operational momentum as we increase our activity levels. We've made tremendous improvements on total well costs. Drilling costs are down 10% and completion costs are down 19% with a total well cost reduction of 18% in the second quarter of 2019 compared to 2018. As a result, we reduced our Woodford well cost target by 14% to $6.5 million per well. Finding costs for this newer premium oil play are now less than $10 per barrel of oil equivalent, which is on par with our other more established premium assets. ","We completed 15 gross well since the start of the year, a few notable recent wells include the Galaxy 2536 wells. They average more than 10,000 feet in lateral length and produced an average of 1,100 barrels of oil per day each for the first 30 days. Oil equivalence average more than 1,400 barrels per day each. In addition, these walls are exhibiting the characteristic shallower declines we\u2019ve seen in prior wells. ","We are pleased with our progress in this premium play and expect further operational gains in the second half of this year. ","Now here's Ezra for an update on the Delaware Basin. ","Ezra Yacob","Thanks Ken. We played 65 net wells to sales in the second quarter and continue to have an outstanding year in the Delaware Basin. Our drilling performance continues to benefit from improved downhole motor designs and increased quality assurance. Year-to-date drilling days are down over 20% compared to 2018 and we continue to utilize proprietary software to balance our drilling speed and steering to stay within our precision targets.","Completion costs are also down 10% compared to 2018 due to ongoing improvements to execution, application of our new completion techniques, as well as lower sand and water costs. Year-over-year stand costs are down 35% and our all-in-water costs including reuse have decreased by 30%. The combined impact of improved drilling and completions efficiencies has resulted in a year-to-date total average well cost reduction of 5% compared to 2018. ","Well productivity similar to operating efficiencies has also improved through the first half of 2019, across all five of our Delaware Basin targets. In our Delaware Basin Wolfcamp play, 30, 60 and 90 day rates have improved. Our 2019 Wolfcamp program is outperforming 2018 performance by 10% and continues to exceed our forecast. ","Performance of our shallower reservoir is also improving as we integrate geologic data, collected as we develop the deeper targets, along with our new completion technology. Year-to-date we brought on 23 net wealth in the Leonard and Bone Spring, with both formations performance stronger than 2018 results. ","In addition to tremendous progress lowering our finding and development costs through well productivity and capital cost improvements, we are benefiting from our strategic infrastructure investment. Currently 99% of our water and over 80% of our oil is transferred by pipe rather than trucking and contributes to a 5% reduction in operating costs compared to 2018. ","The impact of improved productivity and cost reductions have resulted in year-to-date all in finding costs below $10 per barrel of oil equivalent and an average direct after tax rate of return in excess of 100% of the current strip prices. Our progress throughout 2019 in the Delaware Basin highlights our focus on increasing capital efficiency through high return investments. ","Here\u2019s Lance to provide a marketing update. ","Lance Terveen ","Thanks Ezra. During the second quarter our marketing strategy paid dividends. Our execution is a result of a portfolio sales approach; that is we work to ensure each of our asset teams has flexible takeaway and multiple in-markets available, which provide security, a full assurance and access the optimal net back price. Our U.S. crude oil price realizations averaged $1.18 above WTI which was on the high end of our guidance issued at the beginning of the quarter. ","With respect to natural gas, despite significant volatility and Permian Basin prices and softness in the Rockies and out west in California, EOGs overall natural gas price realizations were only modestly affected. ","Anticipating infrastructure and transportation capacity, well in advance of our development plans has allowed us to have full assurance to one, mitigate most of the effects of the week local premium pricing; and two, avoid the long term, high fixed cost transport contracts, as we expect the Waha basis will improve significantly as new pipelines in our service later this year and 2021. ","Downstream markets, natural gas and oil basis differentials change very quickly. Our portfolio approach provides flexibility to quickly pivot to the highest net back markets. For example, in the Permian the Mid\u2010Cush differential has strengthened considerably since the end of last year. Additionally, looking ahead to the end of this year and into 2020, the market is pricing in crude oil pipeline take away, coming in the service over the next several months, as seen in the narrower Permian to Gulf Coast spread.","Our marking arrangements provide flexibility to sell our oil production in the local Midland market to take advantage of strength in the Mid\u2010Cush basis, or we can elect to utilize our low cost, long haul capacity to the Gulf Coast, the excess domestic refiners and export markets. ","Our forward looking portfolio approach has established access to Midland, Cushing, Houston, and Corpus Christi, along with doc capacity to access export markets for our Permian basin and oil production. In addition, access to all these markets by our diverse portfolio transportation, and self-markets options allows us to maintain direct control and keep our low cost transportation edge.","I\u2019ll now turn it over to Tim Driggers to discuss our financials and capital structure. ","Tim Driggers ","Thanks Lance. EOG leveraged its outstanding operation execution in the second quarter into superb financial performance. During the quarter the company generated discretionary cash flow of $2.1 billion, invested $1.6 billion in capital expenditures before acquisitions at the low end of our guidance and paid $127 million in dividends. This allows $352 million in free cash flow. ","In line with our objective of further strengthening our financial position, we repaid a $900 million bond in June with cash-on-hand. This leaves $1.75 billion remaining in our $3 billion, four year debt reduction plan which we expect to complete in 2021. ","Cash on the balance sheet at June 30 was $1.2 billion and total debt was $5.2 billion for a net debt to total capitalization ratio 16%, significantly lower than 24% just one year ago. ","In addition to the excess of the debt reduction plan has had on improving our leverage metrics, it has also meaningfully reducing our cash cost. Net interest expense has fallen about a third to $185 million, the mid-point of our fill year 2019 guidance from $282 million in 2016. ","The financial model for EOG is straightforward. We can very efficiently generate double digit organic growth at high rates of return, leverage our scale to reduce operating expenses and continue to lower the old price required to earn a double digit ROCE.","We believe EOG can accomplish this while supporting a growing dividend competitive with the S&P500 in generating a rising stream of free cash flow. The combination of EOGs financial strength, industry leading cost structure and organic exploration edge can deliver a level of financial performance, competitive not just with the best E&P companies, but competitive with the best companies in the industry in the S&P500 and we can deliver this performance at lower and lower commodity prices. ","I'll now turn it back over to Bill for closing remarks. ","Bill Thomas ","Thanks Tim. In conclusion EOG is executing at the highest level in company history and improving every quarter. Our premium drilling strategy combined with our ability to achieve continuous efficiency gains and technology breakthroughs are producing record results. ","The company is delivering a strong return on capital employed, production growth, free cash flow, debt reduction and strong dividend growth with oil in the 50s, and we clearly are on a path to achieve strong performance with oil in the 40s. We are accomplishing our goal of achieving results that are competitive with the best companies across all sectors in the S&P500 through the commodity price cycles. ","In addition to financial returns, EOGs mission is to be a leader in ESG performance. Our unique culture has embraced ESG with the same enthusiasm as everything else we do, innovation, technology and the pleased but not satisfied culture of EOG have a long history of producing outstanding results, and we believe that our best days are still ahead of us. ","Thanks for listening and now we'll go to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And today\u2019s first question comes from Arun Jayram of JP Morgan. Please go ahead. ","Arun Jayram","Yeah, good morning. I was wondering if we could maybe start with your thoughts on well spacing in the Delaware Basin and how you guys are managing the process to call it maximize resource recovery while mitigating the impacts from adverse communication?","Bill Thomas","Yeah, good morning Arun. Thank you for the question. Just in general, you know because we\u2019ve been in the shale business for two decades, you know we have a big learning curve in the history of the company and we recognize the parent child relationship and the importance of proper spacing to develop the assets correctly. ","And specifically you know in the Delaware Basin we attack that problem very aggressively back in 2017 and the early part of 2018, and we really got the learning curve on that well behind us and we continually are still making progress going forward, but we really are well down the road on maximizing the value of our asset. And so I'd like to maybe let Ezra, he\u2019s really the expert on the Delaware Basin to give you a little bit more color on that. ","Ezra Yacob ","Yes Arun, it\u2019s Ezra. As you know our resource estimate is based on 660 foot spacing in the Wolfcamp Oil window, and an 880 foot space in the combo side of that play and we are very confident in those numbers still. As you know and as Bill mentioned, we've been drilling multiple targets within the Wolfcamp and actually a tighter spacing on average than what our resource estimate is based on and so I think that you can see we've got a bit upside we feel like, not only really in our Delaware Basin Plays but across the portfolio of our plays. ","One way that we approached it and some of the testing that we did as Bill mentioned over a year ago is really to look at the number of targets and the quality of our high precision target that need to be co-developed with one another, and we combine our high precision targeting with our completions technology to really optimize that balance between a low finding cost and optimizing really the NPV per drilling unit and we think that that's the best way to really deliver shareholder value in the long term through you know increasing our corporate level returns while still capturing the NPV.","Arun Jayram","Great and my follow up is the updated guide does assume, call it the deceleration in CapEx in 4Q versus 3Q. I was wondering if you could maybe discuss the cadence of overall [indiscernible] in the second half and just your general thoughts on 4Q oil growth and sustaining some of the upper- aiding momentum into 2020. ","Bill Thomas ","Yes Arun, yeah we are on plan, everything is going just almost perfectly this year. It\u2019s been a great year in performance and capital is running according to plan, and we are going to be really well set up heading into 2020. And I'm going to ask Billy Helms to give a little bit more detail on that.","Billy Helms","Yeah, good morning Arun. This is Billy. So as Bill mentioned, we are exactly on plan where we wanted to be. Actually our well performance is exceeding the type curves that we laid out at the beginning at the year, and our well cost is actually coming in lower. ","So what's driving that really is just the continued efficiencies each of the operating teams continue to have. So we're actually able to \u2013 as we go into our second half of the year, in both the Delaware Basin and the Eagle Ford, our two most active plays, we'll see a slight reduction in rig count and frac crews there, just because we don't need as many rigs and frac fleets to achieve our goals that we originally laid out at the beginning of the year. ","Now also on top of that we have some seasonal programs like the Bakken where you'll see activity there, mainly it happens in the summer-time and in the winter-time we pretty much slow activity there just because of the additional costs associated with winter operations. You'll see a slight reduction also in the Powder River Basin for the same reason. ","So in general, we don't really see a dramatic change in the rig count, frac fleet count or the wells turned online, a slight drop in the fourth quarter. The big thing to take away is that for 2020 while it\u2019s really early to give you an indication of what we're going to do, we don't see that we\u2019ll have a dramatic drop off in the first quarter of 2020. We are well positioned and well set out to provide growth on a quarter-to-quarter basis as we enter 2020. ","Arun Jayram","Great. Thanks a lot for that commentary. ","Operator","And our next question today comes from Brian Singer of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Brian Singer","Thank you, good morning. I wanted to see on the dividend. How does your dividend goal that have shifted in terms of the focus of the 2% target yield, how does that, if at all impact your volume growth target? Do you still see growth in 2020 accelerating versus 2019, and how long can that growth be sustained while meeting your dividend targets until the Eagle Ford and Delaware Basin move into a more mature phase as you call it from the growth phase or until you depend more on the newer plays or organic exploration. ","Bill Thomas","Yeah, Brian, good morning. We don\u2019t see that our projection of being competitive with the S&P 500 on the yield as really slowing down our growth. You know we believe that our dividend, you know we've shown a very strong commitment to the dividend, we've increased it over 70% in the last two years and certainly our goal, with reasonable oil prices like we've seen this year, is to continue to grow the dividend at least 20% per year to bring the yield in line with the S&P500 and of course the Board considers the macro outlook in our business plan every quarter concerning the dividend. ","And then on growth at reasonable oil prices like we've seen this year, we do not envision our growth to be lower than our 14% that we are experiencing this year. So we have a very, I think robust business as Tim pointed out; we are creating significant value through our disciplined reinvestment and the premium drilling and we're generating strong free cash flow. You know we're having a substantial dividend growth and we've got \u2013 strengthening our balance sheet all the same time. So we believe our core business is super strong and competitive, with really any business in any sector of the market. ","So we\u2019ve got a lot of confidence that we're creating a huge amount of value for shareholders and we're going to continue on that plan.","Brian Singer","Great, thank you. And then my follow-up in regards to exploration, I realized that there was not a specific update here. On last call you talked about higher quality reservoirs that could lower decline rates in your supply cost and you referred in your opening comments to potentially lowering the decline rate and reducing the cost to produce oil. Can you just give us a general update on what you are seeing within that portfolio and how aspirational that is versus how far you\u2019ve progressed towards that in terms of reality of really having that confidence that the decline rate can come down and the supply costs can come down? ","Bill Thomas","Brian, we are \u2013 yeah, thank you. We are very excited about our exploration efforts this year. It's the most robust, diverse exploration effort I think we've ever had in the company. We are in multiple basins and multiple different plays, testing new ideas and they are rock quality, rock that would be able to deliver oil at lower cost and at lower decline rates than our current inventory, the average of our current inventory. ","So we are really focused on corporate returns. We want to drive, continue to drive down finding costs and that's a particularly strong focus. So we are looking for plays that have low drilling costs, low operating costs and we're working and we want to improve the decline rate of the company also. So low decline, low finding costs is the direction that we are heading, going in, and that's what will help us continue to generate higher corporate returns going forward. ","So we're really excited, we are really encourage, we are in the process of drilling and testing a lot of new ideas this year. We are also leasing very, very strong acreage positions, building very strong acreage positions at low costs and we\u2019ll be giving up dates on that as we get meaningful results. It takes a little while, we don't want to just drill one well you know and say we got all this. We need to have multiple tests done. ","Certainly we want to, before we start talking about specifically where these plays are, we want to have the acreage captured and so it's going to take a little bit of time. So we asked the investors to be patient with us on the process, but we're very excited and very encouraged on where we're headed. ","Brian Singer","Great, thank you. ","Operator","And our next question today comes from Neal Dingmann of SunTrust. Please go ahead. ","Neal Dingmann ","Good morning all. A question I guess to start around the Powder River. It seems like when it comes to incremental operational efficiencies and lower costs, it appears in terms of your conversations and very much on the Powder River is seen maybe the most in your portfolio, and I'm wondering if this is in fact the case. The Powder has seen you know some of the most improvement and then just wondering for overall portfolio can you continue to see, just the remarkable efficiencies that you all talked about in the last couple of quarters. ","Bill Thomas","Yeah, good morning Neal. Yeah, we are super excited about the Powder. It's got a lot of obviously upside, and we're in a learning curve. So we are testing as Billy talked about, different parts of the play, but particularly we are testing the targeting and the completion technology. So the wells will vary a little bit as we go through that process, but we're learning and that we're not really in a hurry. We want to take advantage of a learning curve before we you know increase activity there significantly. ","We don't have a lot of acreage exploration issues there. So we've got plenty of inventory in all the places of the company. So we can bring that on at the proper speed to maximize the returns and lower costs and build the inventory correctly. ","Neal Dingmann ","Okay, and then just one separate one if I could. It appears to me your exploration program remains this year a bit more active than we\u2019ve seen in the last year or two. I\u2019m just kind of curious if you all are focused here on ramp in one potential area or are you all looking at several potential plays when we look at the exploration. ","Bill Thomas","I\u2019m going to ask \u2013 Neal, I\u2019m going to ask Ezra to comment on that. ","Ezra Yacob","Yes Neal, this is Ezra. We have multiple opportunities that we have this year that were both leasing and testing this year. As Bill highlighted a few minutes ago, really the goal of the exploration program this year is to add quality to our inventory and not just quantity. What we mean by that is you know it all starts with the rock quality and so we're looking at \u2013 we basically, you know the advantage of having activity in six different basins this year as we drilled these wells, we collect a lot of data and we're able to formulate that data and that's really the basis for what has created our exploration effort this year. I'm looking at this better rock quality. ","We think that this rock quality we are targeting will really benefit from our horizontal drilling and completions techniques and as Bill said, should provide us an opportunity to add lower finding cost and higher quality of inventories to our already robust portfolio. ","Neal Dingmann ","Thank you so much guys.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Bob Brackett of Bernstein. Please go ahead. ","Bob Brackett ","I had a question on the electric frac spreads. You quoted the $200,000 per well savings. Part of that is the fuel arbitrage diesel verses nat-gas and part of it is the cost you\u2019re paying the service provider. Is there a way I can think about how those two offset each other? ","Billy Helms ","Yeah Bob, this is Billy Helms. Yeah the $200,000 savings, I'd say the majority of that is simply in the fuel cost savings and the reason why it benefits us so much is we're using it in place where we have readily available infrastructure to be able to access gas as a fuel source, relative to diesel as a traditional frac fleet not used. They also do provide us a great deal of a step up and efficiency gains to, so our efficiency games there provide I'd say the balance of the savings, but the majority of it is based on the fuel savings alone. So I wouldn\u2019t want to mislead you there, the efficiency gains are really good, but the majority is fuel savings. ","Bob Brackett ","Great, thanks. Follow-on would be, if we think about the 740 net planned completion for 2019 and wanting to hit that activity level, how would you balance that against the macro sell-off in the commodity where price fell and cash flow fell. Would you stick to the plan, would you trim the plan in order to hit cash flow? Where does that balance play out? ","Bill Thomas ","Yeah Bob, this is Bill. Certainly you know we are going to run the business with the balance cash flow. You know we're not going to outstand cash flow. So you know depending on our view of the length of that, you know downturn and oil process, we thought it was temporary. You know we might not make much adjustments, but we thought it was a super long term. You know we would certainly readjust the company. ","Our goal you know is not to grow specifically, our goal is returns. We are focused on increasing corporate returns going forward, generating strong free cash flow, certainly we're committed to the dividend very strongly as a company. So those all have a super priority in the company and we're here for the long term, we are going to run our business right, we're going to generate maximum value for our shareholders. ","Bob Brackett ","Thank you. ","Operator","And our next question today comes from Doug Leggate of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. ","Doug Leggate","Thanks, good morning everyone. Bill, I think you\u2019ve kind of set the cat amongst the pigeons by talking about the uncertain outlook for 2020. I think we're all facing the same thing, but I wonder if I could speak to how you would see relative capital allocation in the event that we did have a downturn. It's really \u2013 thinking more along the lines of sustaining capital and then beyond that how you a would allocate incremental dollars. If you could just elaborate a little bit as to what I'm trying to get at. ","The IRRs are very competitive across your entire portfolio, but the productivity is obviously very different in different plays for the same return. So I'm just curious as to how reallocate or allocating capital to your highest return plays would impact the relative productivity outlook in a downturn. I know it\u2019s kind of a complicated issue, but that\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to get at. ","Bill Thomas ","Yeah Doug, I appreciate it, your question. Good morning. We have got tremendous flexibility to allocate capital. We have such an enormously strong premium inventory and it\u2019s across multiple plays. So as I answered in the previous question, you know we're not interested in outstanding cash flow, certainly not on a long term basis. We are going to stay super disciplined and make sure that we generate free cash flow every year. ","So you know if we had \u2013 we don't believe we\u2019re going to have an extended downturn or low downturn, but it\u2019s in an extreme case that we did that, you know we would just tighten the belt all across the company. We would focus our capital on the highest return plays and we would allocate capital appropriately to the macro environment. ","So we're focused on returns and we believe we can generate the highest returns of any company in the E&P business at the lowest oil price scenarios, because we have the highest reinvestment hurdle of any E&P company we know. And so our premium inventory is good to go at $40 oil and that allows EOG to be the low cost provider of oil and gives us a tremendous competitive advantage. ","Doug Leggate","I know it's not an easy question to answer, so I'm going to follow-up with an even worse question, I apologize. You've also \u2013 I don't know if the language was deliberate on your dividend comment on the press release, but targeting, setting out a target yield kind of starts to bring in considerations of how the market thinks about valuations, something about dividend discount models, which then begs a couple of obvious questions as one, what do you see is the appropriate growth rate for the dividend? This is supported basically by what you said earlier about not less than 14% oil growth. ","And then related to that, those implications for the payout ratio, have you \u2013 do you have parameters around that, that you could share with us when you've kind of lead out this subject of up 2% yield. Because it\u2019s basically that you know we can all come up with long term projections of what that could look like, but some framework around that would be helpful. ","Bill Thomas ","Yes certainly, Doug. Our goal you know is to continue to aggressively increase the dividend, certainly at the 20% right or better every year, and that would be in consideration of you know reasonable oil prices like we've seen this year, we believe we can do that or better. And so our focus is just to have a sustainable strong dividend growth every year and get the dividend up to the yield of the 2% level. ","We don't have a specific timeline to give you, because we need to manage the business according to our view of the business environment obviously going forward, but directionally you know we want to be competitive with the S&P500 companies and the dividend yield just like we're going to be competitive in growth and in return on capital employed. And I think the dividend yield for the S&P is about 2% and so that's where we want to be long term in the company. ","Doug Leggate","Sorry Bill, just to be clear, the 2%, does that also have an oil price parameter like a you know obviously premier locations or premium inventories at $40 oil. 2% yield is at what commodity price? ","Bill Thomas ","Well no, it's not really based on that. You know the speed of which we can get the yield to that level of course would be you know have oil price considerations. But we are lowering the price of the company to be very successful as we said in the opening remarks, where we can do it very well at 50 with oil in the 50\u2019s right now. But we are really heading the company to where we can be successful with oil in the 40\u2019s. So overtime you know we believe we believe we can be competitive on the dividend returns and growth with oil in the 40\u2019s. ","Doug Leggate","Understood. Thanks for taking the question. ","Operator","And our next question today comes from Jeffrey Campbell of Tuohy Brothers Investment Research. Please go ahead. ","Jeffrey Campbell","Good morning. I\u2019ve just been listening to the lower decline stuff of great interest and I just thought I'd ask you if we think of a typical first year, unconventional decline is say 60%, can you roughly quantify how much the decline rates could be modified with these new exploration plays that you've been discussing? I don't mean the corporate decline, I mean of the well decline in one of these new plays. ","Bill Thomas","Yeah Jeffrey, this is Bill. You know, we are really in the early process of testing these plays and so we just need to get some well results behind us to give you specific numbers on that and some history. But these are plays that have better matrix probability than a typical shale play. We are not looking for a rock that has nanodarcy firm. This is really more microdarcy, maybe even millidarcy firm kind of rocks and there are also rocks that would respond really well to the horizontal completion technology. ","So we even get a complex fracture pattern, where you can drill long laterals, etcetera, and you can contact a lot of this better probability rock to wellbore. And so that combination and just in general will give you a high recovery for the metal oil in place, but it also gives you lower decline rates than the current shale plays. ","Jeffrey Campbell","And that sounds really interesting. We look forward to hearing more about that in the future. I think my other question is I believe last quarter you said that the Eagle Ford EUR program was completed or more or less complete. I just wondered, do you have any other programs going on anywhere else in the portfolios that\u2019s experimenting with or seeking to try to capture more resource, total resource from the wells than what we typically expect in an unconventional resource. ","Bill Thomas","I\u2019m going to ask Ken to comment on that. ","Ken Boedeker ","Yeah, this is Ken. We have about 150 wells in our enhanced delivery process in the Eagle Ford and we are really are seeing premium results in line with our 30% to 70% ad in our primary recovery. You know we are really watching our program and refining our process as we go, the process that you want to do after your primary drilling is complete. So we're going to evaluate expanding that EUR footprint in that area as we finish primary drilling in the surrounding units. As far as expanding that into other areas, we are constantly evaluating that, but we are not expanding that process into any of the other formations at this time. ","Jeffrey Campbell","Okay, great, thank you. ","Operator","And our next question today comes from Leo Mariani of KeyBanc. Please go ahead. ","Leo Mariani","Hey guys, very impressive progress on the cost reduction initiatives. I guess basically you're sort of in 80% your targets here, you know by mid-year on the well costs. Just wanted to get a sense \u2013 I know it\u2019s probably you know difficult question. Of course no one can kind of predict the future here, but just based on efficiencies, do you guys think that it's realistic that you might be able to knock another say 5% off those costs again in 2020 or 2021. ","Bill Thomas","Good morning Leo. I\u2019m going to ask Billy to comment on that. ","Billy Helms ","Yeah Leo, first of all let me just say, we're extremely proud of the efforts that are operational teams have made to get to the 4% hurdle halfway through the year. When we set our 5% goal out at the start of the year, I think you know we had no idea exactly how quickly they would get there, but confidence that they would and they've excelled just tremendously. ","You know being able to accomplish another 5% next year, it's a little early to say where that\u2019s going to come from, but I do have confidence that we'll be able to continue to lower costs. I mean there's no doubt in my mind that we can continue to push well cost down. And not just well costs, but also our unit costs, you know we're making tremendous progress there. ","So I don't want to go without given those guys a kudos as well, because they've done a great job and I guess we just have so much confidence in our teams, that I know we can achieve continued cost reductions across the board. ","Leo Mariani","Okay, that's great. And I guess just, you know wanted to \u2013 a quick question on some of the guidance here. So just looking at your third quarter U.S. oil production guidance versus the last few quarters, just noticing that you're kind of rate of growth in U.S. oil slows a little bit in the third quarter. Just wanted to get a sense if there is anything to read into that or is that just kind of timing sort of on well tie-ins here. ","Billy Helms ","Yeah Leo, this is Billy again. Yeah the rate of growth certainly slows a little bit in the third quarter, but really it falls directly in line with what our plan was laid out at the start the year, and as you know most of our activity in capital expenditure was in the first half, so that's where you're going to see most your production growth. ","So it will modestly decrease; the rate of growth will modestly decreased a little bit the third and fourth, but we're still on pace to really stay within our plan and then we're not concerned at all about how that sets up for the following year. We are still in great shape as we go into the next year as well. ","Leo Mariani","Okay, that's very helpful, and I guess just any you know follow-up thoughts on U.S. exports. Obvious you guys unveiled incremental volumes that should be shipping out you know last quarter and certainly made a point to put it in your slide. As you kind of look at the marketing side over the next couple years, do you guys think that U.S. oil exports are going to become even more important for you, and is that an area you are going to be looking to expand going forward.","Bill Thomas ","Let me let Lance comment on that. ","Lance Terveen","Hey Leo, good morning. This is Lance. How are you? ","Leo Mariani","Great.","Lance Terveen","Yeah good. Hey, here on the exports it's definitely exciting. You know as we\u2019ve talked about in the past we've got our \u2013 you know today we've got our existing Houston capacity, you know we're taking advantage of that, but we get more excited about next year with our capacity growing in corpus. ","So I think one of the things that really you know to think about us from an EOG standpoint, what really differentiates us is when you think about the Corpus capacity, we're going to have the capability to really show you know our segregated WTL, you know that we are going to be able to show across the docks and we're also going to be able to show our Eagle Ford as well. ","So I think, you know when you look a lot of peers and you look at a lot of our, you know the competition that\u2019s out there too, our capability with our transportation capacity, the storage tankage that we have, ability to deliver segregations you know into the market, you know we're going to be able to show multiple grades across the market. ","And yes, absolutely, I think you're seeing you know spread tighten up and I think we don't see any concerns as it relates to export capacity, you know at least in the short term. But I think one of the more important points to make is you know if you call export capacity right at 4.5 million barrels per day of export capacity. ","What we felt was very important is that we secured existing Brownfield capacity, so that way if you do see price dislocations that do occur maybe at the dock. You know we're advantaged there because we're not waiting in on permitting; we're not waiting on doc expansion. So our capacity is going to ramp-up you know as we move in to next year and I think that's going to be key because you know we can really take advantage of the values if there is a dislocation. ","And again we've got the flexibility that we can pivot our barrels and we can supply our great customers or domestic refiners. But then we can also supply to international markets as well. So we've got a full range you know in our portfolio there Leo. ","Leo Mariani","Okay, well that's great color. Maybe just on that point, do you think there\u2019s a decent chance there could be dislocations over the next couple years? Just wanted to get a sense how you are thinking about that piece. ","Lance Terveen","Yeah, I'm not going to speculate you know. I think when you've definitely seen you know when you look at the forward curves, you can see kind of the Brent NEH spreads and that's right around $3, so it definitely shows that the export order is opened you know, but I think for us, you\u2019ve seen \u2013 we talked about in our opening comments too about the Permian, kind of the Gulf Coast spreads, it\u2019s definitely narrowed. ","So I think really where you could possibly see the price dislocation is that you got a lot of oil that\u2019s going to show up at Corpus and there's going to be some players that aren\u2019t going to have secure dock capacity, and so there could be a dislocation that occurred there. But as it relates to EOG and what we've done, we went ahead and kind of take that \u2013 we took that variable time out of the play. As we think about our growth and then our capacity ramping up and then how we're going to place barrels in the next four months. ","Operator","And our next question today comes Paul Sankey from Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead.","Paul Sankey","Good morning all. Just kind of bringing together everything that you talked about this morning, well I was wondering, just in terms of your comp, that\u2019s your position against the oil industry as opposed to the whole market, where do you think you are furthest ahead of the industry and where do you think is the furthest to go and obviously I'm talking about the various components of your business, whether it's the acreage, the exploration, drilling, fracking, operating, transport and even decline rates. Thanks. ","Bill Thomas","Yeah, good morning Paul. You know clearly the competitive advantage that EOG has is our culture. Our culture is just amazing. It really drives all the success of the company. We have tremendous assets because the culture has built out over the years through our exploration efforts. You know we have tremendous cost reduction, continuous sustainable cost reduction, because our culture never is satisfied. It's just continually innovative and it continues to figure out better ways to run our business. ","So really the confidence that we have about the direction of the company to be able to be very successful, even with oil process in the 40\u2019s is really due to our culture. And of course that's supported by a lot of different things. We have a core competency obviously in exploration; we\u2019ve got a core competency in operations, you know we drilled the wells the fastest in the U.S. and the lowest comps, leading completion technology. ","We have by far the most advanced information technology systems where we can make real time decisions continuously across the company and the real value of the company is coming from every person in the company, the value of EOG is not top down driven, it's really from every person in the company. So that's our \u2013 that's where we have the lead and that is not easily duplicated. It's taken us three decades to build a culture of where it is right now and we believe our culture is improving as we go forward. So we're super excited about where EOG is and where we're heading. ","Paul Sankey","Thanks Bill. If I could make it much more specific, could you just talk a bit more about e-fracking; that seems to be very interesting. Thank you.","Bill Thomas","Yeah Paul, I\u2019m going to ask Billy to comment on that. ","Billy Helms ","Yeah Paul, as far as e-fracking goes, you know we got into the idea of utilizing the electric frac fleets, mainly because we are attracted by the efficiency gains, as well as the cost reduction. The efficiency gains is what really we view as being sustainable to help lower our cost long term and that has continued to get better with continued use. ","We've got four of those frac fleets operating today in the Eagle Ford and the Delaware basin and we're always looking for ways to continue to utilize our infrastructure to enable that to be spread into other plays. So I think as you look forward, we will look for opportunities to continue to put those in new plays. ","It's unique and that the fuel savings are mainly achieved through not only the cost of the gas, but really our ability, the ability of our facility teams to get ahead of the completions and come up with innovative solutions to get the gas readily available to the frac fleets and without that infrastructure and those teams enabling to do that, we wouldn\u2019t be able to take advantage of it to the extent that we are. So just super proud of that effort and where it's taken us. ","Paul Sankey","Yeah, just a quick follow up. Could you talk about the capacity of that and we'll see \u2013 I think you mentioned how big you are in the market. Could you just repeat how much of it you'll go in with I think. ","A - Bill Thomas","Yeah, I think you know what we're hearing and certainly this number might move a little bit, but there's currently about 11 frac fleets available in the market today. We're using about four of those and our frac fleet count varies you know week to week, but typically we\u2019re running about 16 frac fleets, 15 or 16. So that's about a quarter of our frac fleet in the company. ","End of Q&A","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, this includes our question-and-answer session. I\u2019d like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Thomas for any final remarks. ","Bill Thomas ","In closing, I first want to say thank you to everyone at EOG for their tremendous contribution to our performance in the first half of 2019. We're proud and honored to be on the same team. The company is performing at the highest level in history and we continue to improve every quarter.

At this time for opening remarks and introduction I would like to turn the call over to the Chief Financial Officer of EOG resources Mr. Tim Driggers. Please go ahead sir.","Timothy Driggers","Thank you. Good morning and thanks for joining us. We hope everyone has seen the press release announcing the third quarter 2016 earnings and operational results. This conference call includes forward looking statements. The risk associated with the forward looking statements have been outline in the press release and EOGs SEC filings and they incorporate those by reference of this call.","This conference call also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation schedules for these non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures can be found on our website at www.eogresources.com. The SEC permits oil and gas companies in their filing with the SEC to disclose not only crude reserves but also probably reserves as well as possible reserves.","Some of the reserve estimates on this conference call and webcast may include potential reserves or other estimated reserves not necessarily calculated in the quarter not contemplated by the SECs reserve reporting guidelines. We incorporate by reference the cautionary note to U.S. investors that appears at the bottom of our press release and Investor Relations page of our website.","In addition for the purpose of this call the reserve estimates for basin and low level resources are net after resources unless otherwise states. In reference to well location, wells drilled and wells completed are after EOGs interest unless otherwise stated.","Participating on the call this morning are: Bill Thomas, Chairman and CEO; Gary Thomas, President and Chief Operating Officer; Billy Helms, EVP, Exploration and Production; David Trice, EVP, Exploration and Production; Lance Terveen, VP, Marketing Operations; and Cedric Burgher, Senior VP, Investor and Public Relations.","An updated IR presentation was posted to our website yesterday evening, and we included guidance for the fourth quarter and full-year 2016 in yesterday's press release. This morning we'll discuss topics in the following order. Bill Thomas will review our shift to premium drilling and the updated 2020 growth outlook. Billy Helms will provide an update to our premium Delaware Basin resource and David Trice will discuss notable achievements in the other select plays. Gary Thomas will go over our operational accomplishments and I will discuss EOG's financials, capital structure. And Bill will provide concluding remarks.","Here's Bill Thomas.","William Thomas","Thanks, Tim, and good morning, everyone. EOG has responded to the downturn at oil process with an unrelenting focus on capital turns. In 2016 we increased well productivity and lowered well and operating cost at a record pace. The company projects an all-in return on the 26 capital program on the company record and we achieved this on the lowest commodity price environment that we have experienced in a long time.","Our tremendous success in proving capital return this year and combined with the addition of the Yates acreage has also increased the company resource potential in both size and quality at a record pace. As a result we reset the company to deliver high return oil growth with in-cash well with $50 oil environment. We believe this is unique to the industry. In this price environment our ability to generate high capital rates of return and achieve strong double digit growth with the balance CapEx that cash flow program sets the industry apart, leader in capital efficiency.","In early 2016 the town working each player across identified 3200 locations representing 2 billion barrels of oil reserve potential. That meant a new rate of return standard we designated premium. To meet the premium standards a well has to earn a minimum of 30% direct after tax rate returns at $40 oil. The process at first refining premium and second identifying the inventory will ensure that during 2016 year 2 we did not spend a single dollar during the un-economic wells.","We did anticipate about the new premiums standard is the fire it would light under each as a team working EOGs play across the company. Since it is all of 2016 we have converted more than 1000 additional locations to premium on our existing acreage. The Yates merger added another 1700 premium locations. A premium resource potential now totaled more than $5 billion barrels of oil equipment in 6000 locations, that's more than double the resource potential and almost double the locations from the start of 2016. More impressively when you do that math on those numbers you see that net reserves for oil for our premium inventory went from 625 MBOE to 860 MBOE to-date. We are not only adding more premium inventory, the productivity of that inventory is growing.","Another important factor in improving capital efficiency is 29% reduction in cash operating unit cost and over $1 billion annual operating savings compared to 2014. For the third quarter in a row we have lowered our operating expense forecast for the year. On the last number of years EOG has consistently added locations faster than we grab them. Over the next number of years we fully expect to do the same with our premium locations. We stated at the beginning of the year that EOG shift to premium was permanent. Our performance this year should leave little doubt of EOGs ability to execute that shift. Before I hand it over to Bill Helms to review the Delaware Basin, I wanted to discuss the other big news from the press release last night. Our updated 2020 outlook.","We introduced 2017 through 2020 outlook last quarter at 10% compounded annual growth rate at $50 oil, increasing to 20% at $60 oil. We provided this long-term framework for the reasons I just mentioned. Our premium inventory is growing in size and quality and we expect to replace it faster than we grow it. With continued capital efficiency gains we are increasing our 2017 through 2020 PAGR outlook by 5%. At $50 to $60 we are now capable of growing a compounded at 15% annually. Given the size of our base production today, stack growth is remarkable.","Also remarkable is the leak in the river that growth and in the dividend with the cash flow. It's important to note that our 2020 outlook includes growth throughout our large high quality diversified portfolio of place. As discussed in the opening remarks our organization structure and cutting edge culture are driving new technology advancements, cost reductions and exploration efforts across the company at a record pace.","Our 2020 outlook envisions high return in growth from the Eagle Ford, Rockies, Bakken and Permian. Additionally we continue to work on other emerging exploration exploits and expect they will become a material part of our future. EOG is a resilient company. Our unique culture continues to produce sustainable gains and capital productivity and generate years of high quality drilling potential. We are leaders in capturing high quality acreage in the best oil plains in the US. And the Yates transaction is just the latest example of EOGs ability to add highly turned growth potential.","Now I will turn it over to Billie Helms to update the Delaware Basin results.","Lloyd Helms","Thanks, Bill. 2016 is turning out to be a tremendous year for EOG in the Delaware Basin. Secondly highlighted in a couple of ways. First, our Permian teams progress delivering increased well performance and cost reduction has been outstanding.","As illustrated on Slide 11, EOG continues to deliver exceptional industry leading well productivity. This outperformance was accomplished in multiple ways which I will discuss in more detail in a moment. Second, with the combination of technology gains, cost reduction and the Yates transaction we increased the Delaware Basin's resource by 155% bringing the new total to a massive $6 billion barrels of oil equivalent from 6300 net drilling locations. The increase is 3.7 billion barrels of oil equivalent larger than our total announced just one year ago on the third quarter call.","Now that the resource potential has been further defined, our efforts will focus on converting the identified locations to premium, approximately 55% of the 6300 locations are currently premium and we are confident that the majority of the non-premium locations will be converted overtime. There are two ways to convert the inventory. One is by increasing oil productivity through technology since it is our precision targeting process and improved completion techniques. Two is through lowering costs, both capital costs as well as operating expenses. It is like the Eagle Ford, we are confident that our premium inventory in the Delaware Basin will continue to increase overtime.","As we have discussed in the past the Delaware Basin was a large very complex geological basin. Our first step entering any play is to focus our exploration team on understanding the details of the rock characteristics. And then acquire our acreage position in areas that exhibit high quality rock potential. Majority of the acreage required in the Yates transaction demonstrates strong geologic characteristics and compliments EOGs existing acreage position. The added acreage inventory will allow us to trade blocked up acreage to provide optional use of longer laterals and more efficient use of infrastructure.","Blocking up acreage will overtime continue to drive down operating costs and convert the existing inventories to premium status. Most of the acreage resource estimate is from the Wolfcamp. Our new estimate of total resource potential is 2.9 billion barrels of oil equivalent. This represents 123% increase to the previous estimate of 1.3 billion barrels. The elementary increase about 530 net locations but more impressively the average laterally increased by 60% over 7000 feet. We are steadily increasing the length of our laterals but more importantly maintaining our focus on targeting and completion to not diminish the productivity preferred of lateral.","We have previously sub-divided the Wolfcamp into an oil-window where the production is more than 50% oil and a combo play where the production is a balanced mix of oil, natural gas and NGLs. In addition, we have tested multiple target intervals within each sub; the resource estimate uses a confirmed test results from the different tested intervals in both the oil window and the combo play but in general can be summarized as including one productive interval across our acreage with well spacing averaging 660 feet between oil windows and 880 feet between wells in the combo play.","A few highlights in the third quarter are from two 660 foot spacing patterns. One with two wells and the other with 4 wells both in the upper wolf can. The two well pattern has an average 30 day production over 30,000 BOEs per day with 2100 barrels of oil per day per well. Both were drilled using shore laterals averaging 4500 feet. The 4 well pattern had average 30 day production over 2800 BOEs per day with 1900 barrels of oil per day per well.","These wells were drilled using about 4900 foot laterals. Somewhere to our other resource plays, we continue to test tighter spacing and evaluate the optimal development plan for each area. In the second bound springs we upgraded our resource potential estimate from 500 million barrels of oil equivalent to 1.4 billion barrels. Another massive increase that is almost 3 times our estimate from the year ago.","The Yates acreage added about half the increase with the remainder due to targeting and technology driving tremendous efficiencies. While the lendered, also known as the Avalon, is the most material of our Delaware Basin plays. We have had minimal activity in 2016, based on longer term production components and a detailed assessment of drilling locations we now estimate that the Leonard resource potential is 1.7 billion barrels of oil equivalent as compared to our previous estimate of 550 million barrels.","Finally we did not expect to convert the majority, we not only expect to convert the majority 6300 locations to premium, we anticipate discovering new sources of premium drilling as we test additional areas and we find new target intervals within this geologically complex basin. We are still in the early innings of the Delaware Basin and we are excited about the future. EOGs Delaware Basin potential is rapidly improving in both sides and productivity and adds to EOGs portfolio of US unconditional assets and unique growth story.","Here's David Trice.","David Trice","Thanks, Billy. In Eagle Ford we continue to make tremendous progress in costs. In the third quarter we drilled and completed 47 wells or remarkable $4.6 million per well. Well costs are being driven lower for all he reasons we mentioned in our last call. More efficient rate of operations are driving drilling days down to less than 6 days a well.","Completions are also getting more efficient. In 2014 we were 600 feet of lateral per day. During this downturn, we have taken a harder look at completion operations and logistics and are now completing wells 66% faster at almost a 1000 feet per day. At the same time we continue to enhance the effectiveness of our completion as shown on Slide 28.","Additionally Eagle Ford well performance continues to grow even as we push well closer together. During the third quarter we completed a set of 5 interim wells down spaced to 200 feet that were some of our best performing wells for the quarter. Core unit 10H through 14H averaged over 2000 barrels of oil per day per well for the first 30 days of production. We have been drilling the Eagle Ford for seven years and we still have so much to learn in this world class pay.","Also in the Eagle Ford our enhanced oil coverage or EOR is progressing on schedule. We completed on schedule the initial phase of the 32 well pilot, our largest to date. We look forward to having results with you sometime in 2017. In the Rockies we continue to get excellent results from the firm sand in the bottom of the Basin. Our drilling program there is delivering consistent premium level returns and we are looking forward to expanding actively there next year.","The 9 wells we drilled in the third quarter are producing on average almost 1600 BOEs per day for the first 30 days were drilled in under 6 days and have a total well cost of just $4.9 million normalized to a 6500 foot lateral. In addition the decline rates were relatively low, on average the wells produced almost a 100,000 BOEs per well in 90 days.","The average lateral length in the third quarter was short at just 4100 feet. We expect to move to wander to 2 mile wells particularly now that the Yates transaction blocked as much of our existing acreage in the sweet part of the play. Longer laterals were planned economics similar to what we have realized in other play and is particularly helpful with respect to surface permitting efficiencies in the powder of the basins.","Precision targeting has allowed us to convert the turner into a premium play. We used advanced techniques to identify to identify math and steer our wells in the narrow 15 foot window. We were able to accomplish this even while we continue to push the envelope on drilling speed. We plan to complete a total 25 net wells in the turn this year.","Here's Gary Thomas.","Gary Thomas","Thanks, David. EOGs operational performance in 2016 in terms of cost and efficiency gains has been one of the best in company history. In addition to making huge improvements in well productivity, we have driven so much cost and time out of our operations that we significantly increase the number of wells we are drilling into completing.","EOG will now drill approximately 90 more wells and complete 80 more wells than were originally forecast for 2016. While only increasing our development capital by $200 million. As a result our fourth quarter domestic oil production before the addition of the Yates is forecast to be 36,000 barrels of oil per day above our forecast at the start of the year.","That's an amazing accomplishment and the testament is the tremendous capital efficiency gains we have made this year. When we had Yates in international volume we expect the EOGs all exit rates will be near the company's all time high set in the fourth quarter of 2014. Now let's talk about cost reduction and efficiency gains. In 2014 EOGs drilling days and total well cost in our large, 80 Bakken [ph], in working place are down 25% to 45%.","Another measure of a drilling efficiency is number of wells drilled per rig per year which increased 40% in our top three place. For example, we are drilling 32 wells per rig year. On operating side we reduced cash in cost 29% and 2016 LOE alone has come down almost a $0.5 billion compared to 2014. While the major driver of cost reduction has been efficiency gains we are also benefitting from approximately half of our high-cost drilling and completion contract being replaced by rates that are 40% lower. In addition, tubular and well head cost will come down 25% with our 2017 arrangements. The market is speculating about service costs increases and how they will impact the industry. For EOG due to our integrated operations, current arrangements and continued efficiency gains we are well insulated. At a minimum we expect at least the well cost lap in 2017. Our teams continue to make significant efficiency gains.","EOGs rate of return culture and large scale sweet spot positions in the best North American reserve place but still it takes continual improvement across all categories. And now for a word on ducks. Our cost leading and additional $200 million of capital will allow EOG to complete almost all of the debts we had in the inventory in the beginning of the year. The rate of return on additional capital is very strong and as I noted earlier it allows us to exit the year with oil production on an upswing near record rates and will get EOG off to a great start of 2017.","We will end 2016 with approximately 140 un-completed wells, a normal level of working inventory. EOG thrives during downturns, due to our strength as a low cost operators. Our strategy of low debt, living within cash flow and focusing on returns has allowed us to be one of the few companies to preserve a balance without diluting our shareholders by raising equity to pay down debt.","Furthermore, we are in the best cost and inventory position I have seen in my 40 years with the company. Our 2020 outlook is testament to that. We have accomplished this through our premier shift to premium drilling and a wide spread focus on cost control. For me whether extensive inventory or premium locations however, CLO most proud of the highly integrated efforts of our teams to deliver sustainable cost reduction. They have done an outstanding job.","We're committed to maintain this focus and we are uniquely positioned for the future. Here's to Tim Driggers.","Timothy Driggers","Thanks Gary, Capitalized interest for 2016 was $8 million. Exploration and development expenditures were $660 million excluding property acquisitions which was 32% less as compared to third quarter 2015 while our production volumes decreased by just 3%. In addition expenditures for gathering systems, processing plants and other property, plant and equipment were $16 million.","We are increasing full year capital expenditure guidance from $2.6 million to $2.8 million. At the end of September, 2016 total debt outstanding was $7 billion and the debt to total capitalization ratio was 37%. At September 30 we had more than $1 billion of cash at hand leaving us non-GAAP net debt of $5.9 billion or net debt to total cap ratio of 33%. Year-to-date we have sold assets generating approximately $625 million of proceeds and associated production of 80 million cubic feet per day of natural gas.","3400 barrels of oil a day and 4290 barrels per day of NGLs. Assets sold include midland basin, Colorado DJ Basin and Hanesfield properties. The effective tax-rate for the third quarter was 30% and the deferred tax-ratio was 132%. Now I will turn it back over to Bill.","William Thomas","Thanks, Tim. Our micro view has not changed. Over the long-term we believe oil in the 40s will not sustain enough production to meet demand worldwide. While EOG can deliver strong oil growth within cash flow with $50 oil, we believe that US industry as a whole needs to sustain $60 oil prices and extended lead time to provide a moderate level of growth. Worldwide Base decline rates are slowly reducing supply and consensus view is the current large inventory overhang could return to normal levels by late 2017.","We plan to issue official guidance in 2017 along with our year end results early next year. Our overarching goal in 2017 is to build momentum of the foundation of premium inventory EOG has established in 2016 as Gary explained we are completing 180 more wells than previously forecasted so we are exiting 2016 with strong oil production and we will complete a higher percentage of premium wells in 2017 versus 2016. After two years of this down cycle we are more than ready to resume high return oil growth.","EOGs vision for 2017 to 2020 can be summed up with four goals; be the leader and return on capital employed. Be the US leader in oil growth, be one of the lowest cost producers in global oil market and remain committed to safety and the environment. EOGs long-term forecast has not wavered during the downturn. Our purpose is to create significant long-term shareholder value. And as we enter our recovery our unique and resilient culture has positioned the company to achieve strong results for years to come. Thank you for listening. Now we will go to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. The question and answer session will be conducted electronically. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Scott Reynolds from RBC Capital Markets.","Scott Reynolds","Good morning.","William Thomas","Good morning.","Scott Reynolds","Impressive job this quarter and congratulations on the increased outlook. If you step back and look at the big opportunity, we all have the premium that you described. Can you give us a sense on generally how are you looking at developing that, in terms of what formations may be high on the top of the list over the next couple of years. And how do you see pad development going forward in that play.","Billy Helms","Yes, Scott, the is Lloyd W. Helms. So on the Delaware we do expect with this increase there our activity over time will continue to increase. Especially going into next year. And our actively today has been focused largely on the Wolfcamp, I think that will stay of the majority the focus will stay on the Wolfcamp. Just to reiterate all three plays are considered premium today and we're excited about the potential. We're further along in our development at the Wolfcamp. And so, for that reason will continue that it\u2019s next an excellent volume growth generator, extremely high rate return play.","And what really need first, it also allows us to take a look at, this shallower objectives as we drove around through those, that gives us a better idea of long-term potential and how the drilling program in those place will develop. And in the future. In the second part your question there about pad, drilling, we are continuing to develop pads that are drilling, as we develop the field now. And that will continue as we add the shallower zones as well. The good thing about that is we putt in the infrastructure once, for all those wells to share, in the future.","So I incrementally - of return for those programs in the future will continue to increase. As we share that infrastructure, that's no doubt for the initial completions.","Scott Reynolds","Great, that's good and then in my follow up. This quarter you guys are now producing more oil than - it's over 50% which was a - it was a pretty good heavy lifting here over the last few years to get there. And when you look at your long-range outlook, could you give us a sense of how some of the resource pieces contribute to that, so specifically what is the premium producing today with EOGs [ph] for producing today and in your long range outlook, where did those plays go.","William Thomas","Scott, we never broke it out but - And so I think really what I think about the company is that we have a very strong diversified portfolio. And from year-to-year from actually maybe even quarter-to-quarter we shift our capital to where were we are ceding the highest rate returns. And I think changed over time. As Billy said, obviously the Delaware is giving that bigger and better for us, so it will get more capital next year than it got this year. And the EOG - will still get a lot of - lot of capital, in the Rockies play, particular the Powder River Basin will get a lot of capital. But I think, you need to be thinking of my view, very balanced, very large and very diversified portfolio.","Scott Reynolds","Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Subash Chandra with Guggenheim.","Subash Chandra","Hi, good morning. First question is, when I think about the number of locations in the Wolfcamp. Is it two zones, that you're thinking about, in each of the oil and combo plays? And what the status of the lower Wolfcamp if you had any results there.","Billy Helms","Yes Subash, this is Billy Helms again, So when the Wolfcamp we generally think about yes two, mainly two, we have two zones, the upper middle is what we assess resource potential too. But within each one, there are multiple target intervals. So you can think about is having multiple targets with each play and we assess the potential mainly and in areas where we tested each one, and we've based that on our confirm test, comparing results of each one. That's how we've kind of rolled up the resource potential there. I'm sorry. What was second part of your question? Yes, the lower Wolfcamp. So you have a lower Wolfcamp we have had some test, I'd say the majority of our test so far have been in the upper part of the zone. But we have said some testing what we call the middle of camp. And those results are encouraging as well.","Subash Chandra","Okay. So if I hear you correctly, it's a very highly risk [ph] measure your locations that you published to-date but if I just did not resource map across multiple levels I can get many more locations and what you publish.","Billy Helms","Yes, I think the way you think about that is; our results are based on our confirm test, in each one of the intervals and then we allocate that to sticks on the map kind of the approach, where we - is not just taking them - not total number breakers and dividing it by well spaces, it's actually geologically looking at where those perspectives intervals are exists, we mapped them out, pretty extensively and then place well locations on the spot to assess the potential. So, but you're right it only goes to the zones we tested and we do collect additional intervals to test going forward.","Subash Chandra","Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Doug Leggate","Thank you, good morning everybody. But I wonder if I could as you about the 22 well on Delaware this quarter. There is still the shorter wells but with well rates appear to still be - maybe I'm getting this wrong but it was but there still substantially better, than you can go longer lateral implied type.","Can you help me understand what the implications are, the run rate that been on those recent locations [ph].","Billy Helms","Yes, this is Billy Helms, we are excited about the potential that we're seeing in these - in these zones more recently in there. We along the laterals are giving us a lot more efficiently, lot more reserved per well, higher production rates. And our EUR assessment for the play, though is taking what we've tested across the play. And some of those tests are a little older, so we're trying to cooperate all the test we have. And all of the wells are not benefiting from the latest results, so and - so our results continue to improve and we assess that as time goes forward, and I think the tremendous thing that we are seeing it's just the benefits from our targeting and how that's really enhancing the productivity, and that really comes from our detailed working in continual work on assessing that geological potential to play.","And so, that's why we're confident, that as we continue to improve that technique, and gain more understanding that we're going to see additional intervals [ph]. That will add to the resource over time. So we fully expected the resource in the play will continue to increase.","Doug Leggate","Thanks, Billy. [Indiscernible] Wolfcamp oil at 1.3 million. It was quite a while you completed in the third quarter.","Timothy Driggers","No, that's exactly what I - and the wells were completed in the third quarter are including and actually year-to-date the results are still stronger than what our resource update is. So again, I think it's a testament to the technology and the things we're continued to expand on and learn. So yes, I think there is additional upside potential there.","William Thomas","Yes, if I could add a little more color there. This is bill Thomas. The water [ph] quality drive the productivity all the plays and so, we're getting better and better at identifying them the better quality lock [ph] in each one these plays and they were giving considerably better at locating the lateral with a precision targeting in keeping the lateral in that good rock, for long period long part of the lateral, so there is a process for learning.","We probably learn more about rock quality and targeting, and execution on that part of the process in the last year, so that we've ever wanted. So there's a lot of upsides as Billy, said and talked about which he does a lot of upside left to go in that process.","Doug Leggate","My follow up is quicker; it is kind of related question. If you can achieve 15% to 25%, $50 to $60 oil. If these wells continue to get better, would you choose to raise the growth rate again or do more with less? I'm thinking about constraints on the infrastructure on things about nature [ph]. Thank you.","Billy Helms","Well, there is a limit on how fast we want to go, in each one these plays. Because you don't want to go faster than a learning curve and certainly you do have to stay ahead of the infrastructure process. And we don't want to use less than the capital efficiency, we like to continue to increase the capital efficiency as we go along. But we're going to be very disciplined and are spending approach. And the rates-to-return just to say a bit about that the rate-to-return that we're getting on the premium, is that the minimum return, that means the lowest return well, in the 6,000 well inventory generates a 30% rate of return. At $40 in 2015 flat gas prices. So the returns on the average well is much, much higher than 30% of these are exceptionally strong well.","Doug Leggate","Thanks for the clarification, Billy, appreciate it.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley.","Evan Calio","Good morning guys, and impressive results again. Bill my first question is you got about $2 billion resource and indicated that's likely to rise over time. That is the best it has been in 40 years. So you're clearly not resource constraints, so how do you think about potential asset sales given acreage prices and given it appears like lots of BMPs [ph] are reaching a similarly conclusion at a similar time, and it's first mover advantage, what would your thoughts there.","William Thomas","Evan, as we continue to generate more potential. And we continue to high grade that, if those give us a lot more opportunity for just high grading our asset portfolio good property sale. So we're going to continue that process, evaluating each asset - and fits into the future of the company. And on core assets, that are the ones that don't reach the premium category, it'll certainly be candidates for our asset sales in the future. And that will help keep balance sheet strong, and we want to operate from our spending stand point we want to operate within cash flow. But the property sale proceeds will continue to help us keep our balance sheet strong. And by increasing the quality of things we drill over time, obviously increases the returns, but we are also lowering the cost which will filter back down through the base, we will hire a company and lower the drilling rate. So it's a process of just getting better in all areas through times.","Evan Calio","Great. And my second question, it's a follow up to Doug's [ph] you introduced the high or low growth guidance here 15%, 25%. I mean the entire industry from small cap to chevrons projecting an impressive rising growth targets, in largely in Texas low prices. So I mean how do you - what do you think is the limitations of growth are made for EUG or where they are levels and how are you - what differentiated the EUG execution and how are you preparing to deliver that in execute better than the industry, thanks.","William Thomas","Well, I think the real advantage we have, Evan, is the rates of return that we're generating of each one of these wells, is we believe is significantly higher than industry and so that will filter down through the financials. And in due time it will show up in ROCE so our first goal as I mentioned; is to meeting the US leader in terms of [indiscernible]. And, that's a position that we historically held and I think it's a big distinguishing factor in the company.","Evan Calio","And in your rating level, if you think about it maximum growth rate achievable within the organization outside of your sheet?","William Thomas","Well, I don't want to speculate on that. We want to stay efficient and we want to continue to get better so as I talked about before there we want to stay discipline and under control. And so the goal is to get better not just to get there. We're going to try to tackle at from that standpoint.","Evan Calio","Great, thanks guys.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Charles Meade with Johnson Rice.","Charles Meade","Good morning, Bill, to you and the rest you're team there. I'd like to ask a question about the estimate resources assessments the Yates of transaction, I think you get pertinent information on your slides specifically Slide 9. You have the resource per well. For the Yates acquisition around 9-20 of next year, higher than what you had to give an incumbent in your portfolio. Can you talk about what the factors - what factors that product that higher per well resource reflects and it may be is that up a piece of a bigger picture that in general the rock qualities are higher as you. As you move up into Mexico whether you get deeper higher pressure perhaps longer, lateral life that driving that.","Billy Helms","Yes, Charles, this is Billy Helms. So when we assess most of the Yates on the average, it was generally on the basis one-mile laterals. And we sense that we come back in and assess the potential across all the plays. And as you've noticed lateral link on the most of the across the whole portfolio, has increased to about 7,000 feet per well in the old window. And even greater in the combo window. And so, I think the allowed the initial estimate you saw their Slide 9, were based on our assessment only made the transaction. And per Yates and those were based on the essentially one mile a well. So that's the - that's the majority of the difference.","Charles Meade","Okay, thanks.","William Thomas","But as we move into this, the one thing that the Yates does allow us to do is to block it out with our existing acres. So we fully expect to be able to drill these longer laterals across all the portfolio.","Charles Meade","Got it thank you and then, Bill I thought I could ask a question about the 15%, 25 % that you put out you touched on this I believe on the last conference call about how that - how that trajectory might shift or evolve over the 2017 to 2020 framework. Do you see that whether we're talking about that $50 low end or the $60 high end? Do you see that being back end weighted or you have a growth accelerating to that two-year timeframe, or it more likely the front end weighted.","William Thomas","Charles, as you look at the slides, in the front part of the slide deck it shows in 2017 the growth rate is smaller, and it grows over time. So in 2017 it's less than 15% at $50, and into 2020 it's probably more than 15% at $50, it's a more back end weighted.","Charles Meade","Got it, that's detailed look, thank you, Bill.","Operator","Our next question will come from Pearce Hammond with Simmons Piper Jaffray.","Pearce Hammond","Good morning and thanks to the helpful color in the release on the Delaware base. My first question Bill is on our rigs and what the rig count could look like based upon this long-term production oil production growth plan. Kind of where are you right now on rig count and I know you haven't given seventeen guidance but looking at this long-term oil production growth plan, where do you see rigs reversing to, any color you can provide on that would be helpful.","Gary Thomas","This is Gary Thomas. Right now we have 15 rigs operating domestic, we got one international that being in traded at. And we as you say we have disclosed what we had planned for 2017. However, just with the rig efficiency that we've seen over the last two years and what the type rigs we have in place. We will not be required to ramp up the number rigs very much for both standing plan that we put in place. Just have a tremendous amount of flexibility. The one thing that we've 2016 most of our rigs were under long-term contracts high rates, as we mentioned Yates will have only about half that number for 2017, that we have put in place right that about 40% lower for especially the same number rigs.","Pearce Hammond","Great. Within those 15 great, how are those broken out right now?","Gary Thomas","Right now, we've got five in Midland that's really what we very average this year and that is that Delaware Basin, we have six now in San Antonio. So we have four in rocking mountains because we have one rig that was required on the Yates position in the Powder River Basin. And we will let it go but as we've mentioned earlier, we're going to be taken up an additional rig for the Delaware basin year end. And also for San Antonio for the Eagle.","Pearce Hammond","Great. As of my follow up, after pertains to sand loading. In just curious in the Delaware basin specifically, where you on sand loadings right now, you have you reached a point of diminishing returns on sand loading or we not there yet.","Gary Thomas","This is Gary Thomas. We're still experimenting near the Delaware basin, I might just take you back to the Eagle Ford operated for so many years. We found the point of diminishing returns as a matter fact here sand loading for 2016 on the average is slightly less than what it was in 2015. So we got a pretty good hand as to what we anticipate has an optimum sand loading rate there for the Delaware basin.","Pearce Hammond","Can you share with that is that like an Eagle Ford, on a pallet per foot basis?","Billy Helms","This is Billy Helms. Just to add a little more color on that. It will vary in each area and we've tested as much is maybe 3,000 pounds per foot which is probably not going to be applicable across all the plays, in every area, is probably an average somewhere between 2,000 to 2800 probably in that range. Down the zone and where it is but it's it'll be a broad range depending on that play and where it is in that play.","Pearce Hammond","Thank you very much.","William Thomas","Well, that's what we're in the process of trying as Gary, mentioned.","Pearce Hammond","Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer","Thank you, good morning.","William Thomas","Good morning, Brian.","Brian Singer","First couple questions on the Eagle Ford, can you add more color on the stacked - staggered spacing test put 200 foot spacing into context in terms of how widespread that that may be applicable, and then the total locations per unit that would represent. And how do you view well economics and you are as a given that you pin that applying some enhanced targeting and completion over a more for more than a year.","David Trice","Brian, this is David Trice. On the stack stagger targeting and the spacing we've had - we've been working on that for well over a year, and we're seeing good results on that and as we noted there on the quarter, we're not seeing any degradation the areas that we're doing that. So it's not applicable over the entire position. Some places we do have a too good targets in the lower Eagle Ford. And so, we were certainly doing that there but I think over time will continue to just seeing that improves the targets in a little bit better. And we work on the on the compilations. But again, it's not applicable on all areas, because some areas are - have little just one target, so it really throughout the play we're looking at anywhere from a 200 foot spacing 3 or 350 depending on the area.","Brian Singer","Got it, thanks. And then shifting over that Poweder River Basin which that seems like your employing similar strategy here as with that - you are in the premium can you talk to the potential cost savings for BOE from deploying longer laterals in the PRB. And then what type of activity do you think we can see and how prospective, do you view opportunities beyond the turners sand.","David Trice","This is David, again. In the Powder River, we're still really early endings there, we've been testing very stones that were we've been focused mainly on the Turner lately, but we do see a lot of upside as far as extending these laterals like we mentioned earlier that we're seeing a big up lift on the economics, and about our rivers as we do in other places. So we do think going forward, is going to be a bigger part of the program.","Brian Singer","Got it, thanks, and just in area that you mentioned exploratory the potential for further exploration and this may not count as exploration because you already have some premium locations built, but how does the Powder fall in, in terms of incremental opportunities for EOG on the trajectory.","William Thomas","Well again, I think the area where we have stacked by nearly got 4,000 to 5,000 feet of potential there is similar to the Delaware Basin. But like I mentioned we are we are early we are still testing a lot of targets. And we did have a substantial acreage position there. We got 200,000 net acres really in core of the play. But really across the basin we've got to kind of more than exploration we have got more like 4,000 acres. So again not that big thing that there's potential for progression additional activity here in the Poweder [ph].","Brian Singer","Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Ryan Todd with Deutsche Bank.","Ryan Todd","Thanks, and good morning. A longer term strategic question for you guys, how do you - how do you think about the potential to generate free cash flow prior to the collapsing crude we seen you reach a point where all you cash return for shareholders became slightly more meaningful component of shareholder return as reflected by some pretty substantial increases to the dividend. When you look out over the next few years. Do you vision dividend growth becoming more meaningful again are the outlook for growth change enough that we should expect all incremental cash flow going to drilling for the foreseeable future.","William Thomas","Ryan, the dividend certainly very important to us. And as the business environment improves, and process improves we'll start considering increasing the dividend again, and then certainly generating free cash flow as we go. I think we want to begin to do, we generate just a slight amount in the fourth quarter. So that's a goal that we want to continue to focus on as we go forward. So free cash flow and dividend growth will be a part of game plan. As the business environment improves.","Ryan Todd","Okay. Thank you. Then maybe one just as we think about the infrastructure, I know you talked about a little bit, any constraints in the permanent infrastructure side. In terms of kind of [indiscernible] through what we should expect to spend on like its 15% of the capital budget a reasonable amount or anything the ballpark how much what your needs are going to be as you ramp over the next three or four years.","Gary Thomas","Ryan, this is Gary Thomas. Just to address you on the infrastructure spending for next year, it will be a very similar to what we've had the last several years. We want to stay up a little bit a head and they'll be in that 18% to 20% of our capital. Will let - address our position on infrastructure there","William Thomas","Yes, Hi Ryan, good morning. The thing is we have done a great job on gas take away and when you think about the expenses gas gathering and we're going to have multiple market connections in the area, so we plan on exiting this year with over $300 million today of strong, so when we think about that coupled with our NGL transportation of vaccination capacity, we really don't see any constraints on the gas at all. And then also maybe just to add on oil too, we're actually finalizing agreements renewable terminal that's going to be all the - service and late 2017. The work that will have all the market diversification whether that's the Gulf coast - and also just continuing to align ourselves with our strategic providing partner. So, we wouldn't be more excited about the development, to say nothing have occurred.","Ryan Todd","Okay, thanks.","Operator","And that does conclude our Q&A session, I would now like to turn the call back over to Mister Thomas for any additional or closing remark.","William Thomas","In closing, I want to say thank you to all the tremendous EOG employees were making the record setting accomplishments went down this year of reality. Everyone listening, do you not think EOG is maxed out, we are willing to improve, and we've seen modeled on the trade opportunities ahead of us and we look forward to 2017 and beyond.

As a reminder, this call is being recorded.","At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to the Chief Financial Officer of EOG Resources, Mr. Tim Driggers. Please go ahead, sir.","Timothy K. Driggers - EOG Resources, Inc.","Thank you, good morning. Thanks for joining us.","This conference call includes forward-looking statements. The risks associated with forward-looking statements have been outlined in the earnings release in EOG's SEC filings, and we incorporate those by reference for this call.","This conference call also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliations for these non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures can be found on our website at www.eogresources.com.

Bill Thomas will review our corporate strategy and cash flow priorities. I'll cover our capital structure and dividend outlook. Billy Helms will cover first quarter operating and financial highlights, and Ezra Yacob, Lance Terveen and David Trice, will review asset levels results and marketing developments across our most active plays. Then Bill will provide concluding remarks.","Here's Bill Thomas.","William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.","Thanks, Tim. Good morning, everyone.","EOG is a disciplined, high-return, organic growth company. Delivering high returns and strong growth is a rare combination not often found in any industry. With our low-cost organic exploration expertise, the company is currently developing nine premium geologic plays across six basins in North America.","The power of our premium-only drilling strategy is reflected in our first quarter performance. We earned a company record direct after-tax rate of return of 150% on $1.5 billion of total invested capital. The ability of EOG to generate 150% direct after-tax rate of return on that much capital in one quarter is remarkable compared to any standard.","Strong execution delivered volumes on the high end of our forecast, and most of our operating costs came in below targeted ranges. We are well on our way to executing our 2018 plan that will deliver 18% oil growth and generate over $1.5 billion of free cash flow at $60 oil.","We believe disciplined reinvestment of cash flow and high rate of return drilling is fundamental to creating significant long-term value. We've been very consistent and clear about this priority for our cash flow. We believe it is by far the most shareholder-friendly decision we can make. Disciplined investment in premium oil, defined as having strong returns at $40 oil, allows EOG to deliver strong oil growth with free cash flow at $50 oil and substantial free cash flow at $60 oil.","Along with reinvesting in high return wells, we've outlined the following priorities for utilization of free cash flow. First, an impeccable balance sheet is fundamental to a commodity-exposed business. Having low debt strengthens the sustainability of our dividend and maintains our investment flexibility through the volatility of the commodity price cycle.","Concerning flexibility, let me be clear on one point. We have no interest in expensive corporate M&A in any commodity price environment. EOG is an organic exploration company with the ability to continually add premium drilling through low-cost organic leasing and low-cost tactical property additions. And it's important to emphasize here that our premium hurdle rate applies across the board to everything we do. We have set a target to reduce total debt outstanding by $3 billion over the next several years. Tim Driggers will provide more detail on our debt reduction plans in a moment.","Second, we will target dividend growth above our historical 19% compounded annual rate. We have a long history of delivering a dividend that we can maintain throughout the volatility of the commodity price lifecycle. The result has been 17 increases in 19 years without a single dividend cut. We believe our prospects for cash flow growth will support strong dividend growth that is sustainable through price cycles.","In summary, EOG is a high-return organic growth company. Our ability to grow production and cash flow, produce double-digit ROCE, and deliver cash returns to shareholders through strong dividend growth simultaneously is rare. That's a truly unique combination, not just in the E&P industry, but in any industry. It is perfectly aligned with our ultimate goal: to create significant shareholder value.","I'll now turn it over to Tim Driggers for more on our capital structure and dividend.","Timothy K. Driggers - EOG Resources, Inc.","Thanks, Bill.","Over the last three years, we have reset the company to thrive at much lower oil and gas prices. As a result, we are uniquely positioned to generate a meaningful amount of free cash flow. EOG now has the opportunity to take the next steps to further strengthen the balance sheet and increase the rate of dividend growth.","Currently, our balance sheet is strong at 28% leverage and $6.4 billion of total debt. Our target is to further reduce total debt by $3 billion. The $3 billion of debt reduction is a prudent target in a cyclical capital-intensive business. We expect to achieve that target over the next several years by repaying bonds as they mature, using cash generated from operations. This measured pace of debt reduction provides room to fund strong dividend growth.","We were pleased to make it through the last downturn without cutting the dividend and without a dilutive equity offering to shore up the balance sheet. Whatever future commitments EOG makes must be sustainable for the long term. This means we must consider the strength of our balance sheet and the sustainability of the dividend through low commodity price scenarios, not just against the rising level of oil prices that exists today.","The dividend is an important element of EOG's financial strategy. We've increased the dividend at a compounded annual rate of 19% since 1999. With a lower breakeven cost structure and a strong balance sheet, we're now targeting a dividend growth rate that exceeds the 19% historical rate. Our dividend growth strategy signals our confidence in the future profitability of the company, provides shareholders with a tangible form of return on their investment, and imparts a measure of discipline on the organization.","EOG creates shareholder value through operations and not financial engineering. A strong financial position is a competitive advantage as we seek to sustain our performance through the volatility of the commodity price cycle. The company can do this with a straightforward financial structure and an impeccable balance sheet. This will leave EOG positioned to keep its financial commitments in future downturns, including sustaining a more ambitious dividend.","Up next to provide details on our operational performance is Billy Helms.","Lloyd W. Helms - EOG Resources, Inc.","Thanks, Tim.","2018 is all about maintaining our disciplined capital growth program. In the first quarter, we delivered at or above our production targets and have laid the groundwork to deliver our forecasted well cost targets. We are maintaining our full-year capital guidance of $5.4 billion to $5.8 billion, growing oil production 18%, growing total production 16%, reducing well cost 5%, reducing debt, producing free cash flow, and most importantly, delivering double-digit return on capital employed.","There are a number of operational accomplishments from the first quarter I'd like to highlight. We increased activity earlier in the year and are now operating about 40 rigs across six basins. We still expect to average about 39 rigs for the year. Our operating teams in each area are quickly moving the new rigs in our fleet up the learning curve to deliver sustainable efficiency improvements that will yield benefits the rest of the year.","In our larger development programs, we moved to larger packages of wells with longer laterals, completing more than 150 net wells with over 30 of those brought to sales in the last week of the quarter. About two-thirds of the wells in the Delaware Basin were in packages of six wells or more. In Eagle Ford, over half the wells were in packages of five wells or more.","In the coming quarters, we will be competing several 6 to 10 well packages in both plays, which will improve our operational efficiency and maximize the net present value of our acreage. Initiating this development from larger multi-well packages results in a production profile that is more weighted to the second half of the year as can be seen in our full year production guidance.","As a result, we anticipate that our growth will be more heavily weighted to the third quarter than any other quarter this year. We improved our completions efficiency, increased the number of wells completed per month by each completion crew. This allows us the option to consider reducing the pressure pumping equipment utilized this year. And finally, we continue to meaningfully lower sand, water, flowback and facility cost.","As a result of the progress we made during the first quarter, we remain confident that we will be able to deliver the targeted 5% well cost reductions we discussed at our last earnings call. Controlling costs is key to a successful commodity business. Year-after-year, we have been able to consistently control costs. And that is true whether we are at the top or bottom of the cycle. There are a few good reasons for that.","First, we have a unique benefit of having worked in multiple basins through their lifecycles for almost 20 years. That experience provides valuable foresight. We take our very forward-looking growth plan and analyze the market to anticipate when and where we might see tightness from the services industry, takeaway, relative demand for oil, gas and NGLs, and many other factors. These hard earned lessons over the past two decades have given us the experience to quickly adjust our plans to the ever changing conditions in the industry.","Second, the scale of our operations provides several pricing benefits as well as efficiency opportunities. The more wells we drill in any given area, the better we get at drilling those wells. Drilling and completing hundreds of wells over and over is how our talented engineers generate ideas for innovation. It also allows us to invest time and money into unbundling services and, if advantageous, bringing those efforts in-house. That includes everything from building our own water sourcing and gathering infrastructure to self-sourcing or procuring raw materials directly from the manufacturer. Our self-sourcing capabilities started with sand and now grown to include tubulars, chemicals and drilling mud.","Third, we run a conservative business both operationally and financially. Operationally, we avoid going so fast that we start to degrade our return profile by paying too much for services or allowing ourselves to get inefficient. Financially, we're committed to a strong balance sheet. Low debt combined with scale allows us to commit to services when others in the industry may be hesitant to do so. This is exactly what occurred last year when we were able to lock in completion spreads at a low cost as one of the few E&Ps willing to commit capital.","Looking ahead to 2019, we'll continue to opportunistically lock in services by proactive engagement with our suppliers. We'll also continue to optimize well package size and increase the use of multi-well pads and zipper fracs which will speed operations and well transitions.","Finally, we see more opportunity to optimize our sand program and accelerate water we use to further reduce cost. We have line of sight into these and many more areas to reduce cost and improve efficiencies well into 2019.","I'll turn the call over to Ezra Yacob who will update you on the Eagle Ford and Delaware Basin plays.","Ezra Y. Yacob - EOG Resources, Inc.","Thanks, Billy. The Eagle Ford continues to prove itself quarter-after-quarter as a world-class oil play and EOG's premier asset. In the first quarter, we brought 72 wells online with average spacing of about 300 feet and average payout of seven months. We believe this operational and financial performance in the Eagle Ford is unmatched in the industry.","We increased our rig count to 11 in the first quarter and realized a 5% increase in footage drilled per day, accompanied by a 5% decrease in cost per foot. Not to be outdone, our completions team also increased operational efficiencies and is forecasting further cost savings with the addition of local sand sources.","Wells on the eastern Eagle Ford acreage position averaged 1,810 barrels of oil equivalent per day for the first 30 days online and wells on our western acreage averaged 1,375 barrels of oil equivalent per day for the first 30 days.","While the wells in our western acreage position have lower initial rates, the combination of less faulting and our contiguous acreage position allows for consistently longer laterals than in the East, which drives operational efficiencies. Therefore, the wells across our entire 520,000 net acres in the oil window are all equally competitive on a rate of return basis.","The Eagle Ford is a key contributor to flexibility of our diverse portfolio of assets providing the company many options. We modeled several growth forecasts assuming no productivity improvements or cost reductions. If we chose to pursue more growth in Eagle Ford, our current inventory of well locations and large acreage position would support more than 10 years of development.","No North American basin compares with the Eagle Ford for low transportation cost and access to Gulf Coast pricing. Currently, 85% of our oil production in this basin flows through EOG-owned gathering systems, and all of our oil from the Eagle Ford receives LLS prices, which averaged about a $4 premium to WTI during the first quarter. This basin continues to deliver consistently outstanding results.","Furthermore, we are still reducing cost through internally designed, innovative technology advances. Therefore, we are convinced the Eagle Ford still has significant upside even as it enters its ninth year of development.","In our Austin Chalk play, we continue to drill some of the most prolific and highest return wells in the company. The first quarter development program earned over 150% direct after-tax rate of return. The average 30-day production from the eight net wells brought online during the first quarter was 2,750 barrels of oil equivalent per day.","The Austin Chalk target lies just above the Eagle Ford in our South Texas acreage and, as such, benefits from our operational efficiencies and knowledge of the area. Production from Austin Chalk wells also benefits from lower operating costs and Gulf Coast pricing due to our existing infrastructure. We're on track to complete 25 net wells in 2018.","In the Delaware Basin, our results have been just as strong. In the Wolfcamp, the 58 wells brought to sales in the first quarter averaged 1,925 barrels of oil equivalent per day for the first 30 days, and delivered less than a $9 per barrel of oil equivalent direct finding and development cost.","The nine wells brought online in the Bone Spring delivered solid results, producing an average of 1,645 barrels of oil equivalent per day in our first 30 days. And in the Leonard, we brought on three wells to sales. The average 30-day rates were well over 2,400 barrels of oil equivalent per day on 4,300-foot laterals. That production per foot rivals well performance typically seen from our Austin Chalk wells in South Texas.","One of our constant studies across all basins is determining the most efficient number of wells to drill and complete together as a package. This work is essential to maximize the recovery and NPV of the whole asset, and is particularly important for a complex basin of stacked pay such as the Delaware Basin. Each play has an optimum number of wells that both captures operational efficiencies and minimizes parent-child productivity effects, without sacrificing net present value to either the long cycle times or large production facilities needed to handle high initial volumes.","During the first quarter, we averaged four wells per package versus two last year. We expect to further increase the average to five by year end. Larger well packages necessitate a larger inventory of wells needed to stay ahead of our completion crews. So much of January was spent ramping up drilling activity and increasing inventory to prepare for our completions scheduled this year. We increased our rig fleet 20%, exiting the quarter operating 20 rigs in the basin. And we are realizing the increased efficiencies of larger well packages on both the drilling and completion side.","Our Delaware Basin team has been diligently optimizing our completions operations and has achieved a 24% increase in stages per month per completion crew. And we're beginning to realize cost savings associated with increased use of both local sand and recycled produced water in our completions.","The State Magellan 722H-28H wells located in the over-pressured Wolfcamp oil window of Loving County, Texas illustrate our achievements drilling well packages. This 500-foot spaced to 7-well package took approximately 65 days from initial spud to first sales. The average 30-day rates for these 4,700-foot stimulated laterals were 2,200 barrels of oil equivalent per day. We completed 157 total stages on this group of wells and pumped more than 80 million pounds of sand over the course of 14 days.","Furthermore, 100% of the water used during the stimulations was sourced from reused produced water. The outstanding operations performance and well productivity delivered an average well payout of 5.5 months.","Next up is Lance Terveen to discuss our takeaway positioning.","D. Lance Terveen - EOG Resources, Inc.","Thank you, Ezra. I'd like to bring everyone up to speed since our last call on EOG's pricing mix for our crude oil and natural gas sales in the Permian, infrastructure buildout and takeaway positioning.","Our 2018 Delaware Basin oil and natural gas production will have minimal exposure to in-basin pricing. Only 25% of our in-basin crude production is exposed to Midland pricing. This translates to less than 10% exposure for EOG's total U.S. oil production. Furthermore, we supplemented physical capacity with additional price protection with Mid-Cush basis swaps. On the natural gas side, less than 20% of in-basin production is exposed to Waha Hub pricing, which translates to about 5% exposure when viewed on a total U.S. production basis.","We are in similar shape for our Delaware Basin production next year. Only 20% of crude production is exposed to Midland pricing and about 20% of natural gas production is exposed to Waha, which is manageable risk when viewed on a total U.S. production basis. So we're in great shape, and historically we have always been able to consistently anticipate the infrastructure needed to support growth.","Similar to our past experiences in the Barnett, Bakken, and Eagle Ford, an early-mover strategy in the Delaware Basin is paying off. We've successfully diversified our marketing options with physical firm takeaway to protect flow assurance and benefit from higher price realizations for both crude and natural gas sales. Please see slide 18 of our investor presentation for a history of our industry-leading oil price realizations.","On our last earnings call, we referenced the new Conan Oil Gathering system and terminal. This system has been in the works since 2016 and was placed into service on schedule during the first quarter of this year. Between the gathering system and short-haul dedicated truck offloads, we anticipate $50 million-plus in savings per year. Our goal by year end is to have up to 80% of our production on the gathering system in our core areas, which will have the added benefit of freeing up trucking availability.","In 2018, the oil terminal will have four market connections. A fifth connection to a newly announced long-haul pipeline that will service the Houston, Corpus Christi, and export markets is planned to be in service in late 2019.","On gas takeaway, our early-mover strategy allowed us to lock up transportation capacity at well below today's market rates. Also, in lockstep with our residue gas transportation capacity, we secure sufficient plant processing, with each plant location strategically fitting with the footprint of our gas gathering system throughout our acreage position. At each of the centralized hubs along our gathering system, we have the option to deliver our gas to up to four different processing plants. This gives EOG the ability to source our gas to multiple plants that also feed our takeaway capacity away from the Permian Basin.","We are confident our early-mover strategy will allow us to move forward with our development and growth plan in the Delaware Basin and realize attractive netbacks, bridging us to 2020 when adequate infrastructure will be in place to service the broader basin.","Here's David Trice to review the progress we've made in the Rockies and Mid-Continent.","David W. Trice - EOG Resources, Inc.","Thanks, Lance.","Well costs continue to drop for our Rockies plays. The efficiency gains we are making in both the Powder River Basin and DJ Basin are astounding, particularly considering they are in addition to the incredible progress made last year. In just one quarter, we have reached and beat well cost targets in some of our Rockies plays. Tremendous progress has been made in both drilling and completions to reduce days on location that translate directly to cost savings.","Overall, drilling days are down 70% since the beginning of the downturn in 2014 for the DJ, Powder River Basin, and Williston Basin. This is a powerful testament to the great sustainable efficiency gains our teams have made during the last several years. Recently, normalized spud-to-TD drilling days in the Powder River Basin are down from 9 days on average in 2017 to about 7.5 days for the first quarter of 2018. During that time, completion efficiencies have more than kept pace with drilling.","Stages per day and footage per day are up a whopping 50% in the first quarter versus the 2017 average. This includes a record day in the DJ Basin of 26 stages pumped on a four-well pad in a single 24-hour period. That record-breaking pad averaged 21 stages a day for the entire job. Our cost performance in the DJ Basin Codell has set the bar for the rest of the company.","Some notable wells that we highlighted in last night's press release are the three-well Flatbow package that IP-ed at over 1,300 barrels of oil equivalent per day from 3,900 foot laterals, and averaged just $2.9 million per well. We also turned on a four-well 9,500-foot Big Sandy package that averaged over 1,300 barrels a day equivalent per well, with a well cost of $3.5 million per well. These seven low-cost Rockies wells are earning an average direct rate return of over 250%. Our cost structure in the Rockies and Bakken gives us a competitive advantage and creates significant upside potential to add to our premium inventory in the future.","The Anadarko Basin Woodford oil window is the latest addition to our diverse portfolio of premium oil assets. We are increasing activity and building working inventory to support our 25 net well program this year. Our latest well to come online is the Terri 1621 #1H, which is a 2-mile lateral that delivered over 1,100 barrels of oil per day in its first 30 days. We currently have four rigs running in the Woodford. And as we move into development mode in the basin, we expect to have a number of new well results to share in the future.","We will also be testing multiple spacing patterns in order to determine the optimal spacing to maximize NPV per development unit. We are optimistic the Woodford play has upside potential for inventory additions and certainly returns as we increase efficiencies and reduce cost. Plays like the Woodford enhance the diversity of our portfolio and provide us flexibility to consistently deliver high-return production growth.","Now I'll turn it back over to Bill.","William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.","Thanks, David. I have a few closing thoughts.","Number one, our first quarter results have positioned EOG to have record-breaking direct rates of return on capital investments in 2018. We are going to remain disciplined and stay focused on improving returns going forward.","Number two, we're on track to continue reducing both operating cost and well costs.","Number three, with our diversified assets, forward-looking marketing arrangements, and advanced infrastructure planning, we are in excellent position to avoid any significant takeaway issues or negative product price differentials in the Permian or in any of our other active plays.","Number four, with two decades of horizontal experience and technology advancements behind us, we are developing sweet-spot acreage positions with our latest precision targeting techniques and determining optimal spacing patterns to produce industry-leading well results and per acre net present value.","And finally, EOG has never been in a better position to deliver long-term shareholder value. We have the largest and highest quality drilling inventory in the U.S., and it continues to grow much faster than we drill it. We are a low-cost leader today and we will continue to lower costs as we go forward. We are delivering record-setting returns on capital invested, improving corporate ROCE, along with strong production growth and substantial free cash flow. EOG is a high return organic growth company delivering sustainable long-term shareholder value.","Thanks for listening and now we'll go to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And our first question, we'll hear it from Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning. Bill, no one's going to fault you for wanting to reduce your debt or increase your dividends over time, but I did want to ask you one question. As you execute your premium drilling strategy, your returns on capital employed are now moving into the double-digits, and I was wondering if you could talk about weighing a buyback above your cost of capital versus reducing debt what looks to be in the 6% to 7% range?","William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.","Arun, we're committed to doing what's right for the shareholders. Our senior management team and our board are significant EOG shareholders and we're aligned with investors. And we're constantly evaluating what's best to create long-term shareholder value.","Currently, with the improving commodity prices, we believe investing in high returns and reducing our debt and strong sustainable dividend growth are the best ways to create long-term shareholder value. So at the moment, we're very confident in that plan and we believe that will be the best avenue to create shareholder value.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great, great. And just reduction in debt, does that suggest maybe keeping some dry powder for as you execute your exploration drilling program or to look at potentially other opportunities like you did with the Yates package?","William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.","Arun, we don't plan any corporate M&As. That's just not one of our game plans. As you know, we're a very organic company. We've got a lot of confidence in our organic exploration effort, and corporate M&As or just something that would be really not in our game plan at this time.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great, thanks a lot. Thanks a lot.","Operator","And next we'll move to Bob Morris with Citi.","Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you. A bit of a follow-up here, Billy, you've always said that you would spend 100% of your cash flow unless you saw some sharp degradation in efficiencies, and obviously $1.5 billion of excess cash flow is quite a significant amount. You starting out the year what you plan to average for the full year on the rig count, so what precludes you from stepping up activity or adding some rigs in some of these key areas given the sort of returns you're seeing here as we move through the year?","Lloyd W. Helms - EOG Resources, Inc.","Bob, this is Billy Helms. First of all, we remain committed to stay within our capital guidance. We're very much on track with our plan as we laid it out. Actually, our rate of capital spend is directly in line with what we laid out at the start of the year. And we've already talked about the benefits of moving to these larger packages of wells. And as a result, the front end of the year is more loaded towards capital spend with the production more weighted towards the back half of the year.","So, at this moment, yeah, we're very pleased with where we are headed and we don't really anticipate increasing activity above where we currently are. We're still guiding towards that average rig count of 39 and staying within our capital guidance.","Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","And we'll hear from Irene Haas with Imperial Capital.","Irene Haas - Imperial Capital LLC","Yes, good morning. So I have a question for the Eagle Ford trend which you guys definitely was the first mover, and it's been going on nine years, I was wondering what is the organic growth rate for this trend in 2018. And also regarding the Austin Chalk, I want to understand what are the key gating factors that would lead you to fully develop this concept, and when would the Chalk be a meaningful contributor to your Eagle Ford trend growth.","Ezra Y. Yacob - EOG Resources, Inc.","Irene, this is Ezra Yacob. And I don't think we're going to spend any time today guiding to the direct growth on that asset right now. But what I will say about the Eagle Ford is the upside we see there just involves our continued progression of integrating the data that we've collected over the development cycle that we've had there. We continue to integrate both high-graded geologic mapping completions data back into of our geologic model, and it helps kind of drive our precision targeting as we develop even finer scale and high graded targets.","And then also with respect to the Austin Chalk, we've gone a little bit slow making announcements on that because, geologically, it is a bit more complex than the Eagle Ford. I would say that it already is contributing in a pretty good way to not only our returns but also in 2017, both the Eagle Ford and Austin Chalk actually showed just a little bit of growth year-over-year. And so we're happy with our pace of development there in the Austin Chalk and when we have more information on that, we're a little more comfortable with it, we'll provide greater detail.","Irene Haas - Imperial Capital LLC","Okay. May I ask one more question? So are you generating organic growth out of the Eagle Ford and Austin Chalk trend in 2018?","Ezra Y. Yacob - EOG Resources, Inc.","Irene, without getting into specific details, we do plan to grow that asset this year.","Irene Haas - Imperial Capital LLC","Thank you.","Ezra Y. Yacob - EOG Resources, Inc.","We'll be doing that at a pace...","Irene Haas - Imperial Capital LLC","Sorry?","Ezra Y. Yacob - EOG Resources, Inc.","I was just going to finish up and say, we'll be doing that at a pace commensurate with where we can go ahead and continue to integrate our learnings, and do that really with a focus on returns first.","Irene Haas - Imperial Capital LLC","Understood, thank you so much.","Operator","And next we move on to Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you, good morning.","William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.","Good morning.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","I wanted to start on the well cost front. How can we define the more secular versus timing impact of your ability to use your scale to gain preferred services pricing exposure? Specifically, if you're not seeing the inflation in cost in 2018 because you locked in services cost early, what level of inflation would we see in 2019 when you need to recontract, or is there a quantifiable secular advantage?","Lloyd W. Helms - EOG Resources, Inc.","Yes, Brian. This is Billy Helms. What we can give you is \u2013 it's a little bit early to talk about guiding for 2019. So let me give you a little bit of color on where we are for 2018. First of all, as you're aware, we locked in about 60% of our well cost with the services we have locked in so far, with drilling really preferred providers on the drilling side and the completion side. And we self-sourced quite a bit of that too, about 25% of well cost is self-sourced.","So the progress we're making and I guess the confidence we would have in lowering our well cost in 2018 \u2013 we talked a little bit about how we're lowering cost in each one of the plays, I think for Permian, we added quite a few rigs and so we're starting to see the operational performance on those rigs get to the metrics that we like to see in our rig fleet.","Completions are already down about 2.3% for the first part of the year. On the Eagle Ford, of our drilling cost is already down about 5% and the completions are expected to follow. And then we've made tremendous progress in the Rockies, both on the drilling and completion side, in lowering our well cost anywhere between 4% and 5%. So I think overall, we're very pleased with where we're headed.","And we have a long history \u2013 just speaking of 2019 again, we have a long history, each year as we go into the year, we anticipate what the trends are going to be and we get ahead of them and try to work with our preferred providers to lock up some services for the coming year. And I expect 2019 will be done the same way. It's a little bit early to really guide on where we'll be, but we're very confident that we'll be able to maintain our cost advantages as we go into the next year.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great, thank you. And my follow-up goes back to the earlier discussion on the Eagle Ford, and I'm going to be trying to tie Bob and Irene's questions together. What would you need to see either in capital availability, rate of return or confidence in that precision targeting to allocate more capital to Eagle Ford? And do you need to exhaust your financial goals of reducing debt by $3 billion and delivering on that above 19% dividend growth before you would do that?","Ezra Y. Yacob - EOG Resources, Inc.","Brian, this is Ezra again. Like I reiterated, I think we're happy with our plan and we're happy with where we're at, kind of executing on it and we're on track with it.","As far as adding additional capital or redirecting capital to the Eagle Ford, I think \u2013 without guiding into future years, we have definitely run through a number of different forecast growth models, like I talked about in the opening statements, where if we choose to actually grow more aggressively there, we can certainly do that and we have the inventory and acreage position to do that for over 10 years at high returns. But as far as doing it within the year, I think it's safe to say that we're pretty happy with where we're at with our balanced approach across multiple basins to achieve our CapEx and volume growth goals for this year.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll move on to Doug Leggate with Bank of America.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Well, thanks and good morning, everybody.","William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.","Good morning.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Bill, I wonder if I could go back to dividend policy, capital discipline, share buyback discussion or \u2013 not so much of last part. But I'm just \u2013 looking at the dividend policy going forward, what do you see is the competitive metrics, what's kind of the end game you're trying to get to there?","And I just want to be clear on the $50 to $60 range you gave, I guess, a year or so ago, is $60 as a budget a kind of hard stop, so you should think of anything beyond that as going towards the balance sheet? And if that's the case, what happens longer term as it relates to incremental, let's call it, windfall cash flows?","William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.","Doug, I don't think we have some hurdle rate on the oil price. We've really reset the company to be very successful even in moderate prices going forward. And so the company is in a fantastic position now to make, I think, a strong statement to say that we're in a position to more aggressively grow our dividend than we ever have in the past. And we believe that our dividend is sustainable through the commodity cycles. And so the company is just in a fantastic position to both systematically reduce our debt and to grow our dividend very aggressively and sustainably in most commodity price situations.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","No question on the reset, I appreciate you tolerating another question on that issue. My follow-up is really on inventory. And I'm not challenging the discipline of the $40 hurdle for premium locations, but obviously some of the market may have a different view as to what the sustainable oil price is. And the question is really about inventory relative to your growth pace. If we had to run at $45 or a $50 number as the threshold for premium inventory, how would it change over the disclosure you've given so far? Does it go up 10% or does it double? And I'll leave it there, thanks.","William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.","So I think first of all, we don't have any plans on changing our criteria. We're going to stick with $40 oil and $2.50 flat. That needs to be really clear going forward. That is a fundamental thing with EOG.","If you looked at our entire inventory, which is quite substantial, I would say pretty much all of it would be 30% or better rate of return at $50. So it's a very high-quality total inventory. The inventory that we have in the company that's non-premium at $40 would be, I would say, equal to or better than the average inventory of the whole industry. So it's a very high-quality inventory set.","And we have a lot of confidence that we'll continue to make improvements on the non-premium inventory and bring it to a level to where it will classify as premium at $40 oil. So we've got, again, a very sustainable cost reduction. It's not just a one-year thing. It's a very consistent cultural attribute of the company. And then we have a tremendous ability to continue to improve well productivity at the same time. So our goal is to convert a lot of that non-premium inventory into premium inventory as we go forward.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you, Bill, very clear.","Operator","And we'll move on to Scott Hanold with RBC Capital Markets.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks, good morning. Could I ask another question on your increasing the dividend rate versus the long-term rate? Is there a particular yield that when you guys step back would like to be at? It looks like you guys are running somewhere sub-1% right now, and some of the large peers are in that 1.5% range. Is there a target rate you'd like to see EOG at?","William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.","No, Scott. We don't have a specific target other than just to say that on a percent increase on a yearly basis, we want to be above our historical average of 19% CAGR. So that's where we want to guide as we go forward. And we certainly, as I said before, we've got the ability to do that at relatively moderate oil prices and sustain that going forward.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay, I appreciate that. And a little bit more on \u2013 it seems like you're definitely more front-end CapEx weighted, as you said, and in the back half ceasing that production. Can you talk about the cycle times that some of these larger Permian pads have? It looks like you averaged about four in the first quarter moving to five, but can you discuss maybe what those cycle times look like as you move from two to four to five?","Lloyd W. Helms - EOG Resources, Inc.","Scott, this is Billy Helms. The cycle times, of course, vary by play. So in the Eagle Ford, it's a much shorter cycle time than, say, the Delaware Basin, just strictly because drilling times are much longer. And it also depends on the size of the pads. So certainly a 10-well pad might be a lot longer to cycle time than a 6-well package.","And then it also depends on how many rigs and frac fleets we put on each package. So it's hard to give you, directionally, a certain number other than to say it takes several months to start drilling a pad \u2013 or a package of wells and bring that whole package to production. And as a result, it results in some lumpy nature of both capital spend and production.","And that's why you see the production growth vary by quarter. And it's also why as we entered the year, we obviously had to build some inventory to be able to execute this plan, so the capital guidance is more weighted towards the front of the year than the second part of the year. And that's just the lumpy nature of this development.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Is that smoothed out in 2019 as you catch up with that inventory?","Lloyd W. Helms - EOG Resources, Inc.","Yes, I think you'll still see a lumpiness to the overall production growth. But you won't see, I'd say, the delay we exhibited in the first quarter on a go-forward basis. You'll see it more just growth quarter-over-quarter as we move through the future.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","I appreciate that. Thanks.","Operator","And next we'll move to Leo Marinari (sic) [Mariani] with NatAlliance Securities.","Leo P. Mariani - NatAlliance Securities LLC","Hey, guys. I was hoping you could address the Austin Chalk a little bit more. I know that you said that you're not trying to make extensive comments. I'm just trying to get a sense of the inventory there. It sounds like this is one of the best returning plays you guys have. Just curious, is this a couple years inventory, or is there a similar 10 years like the Eagle Ford?","Ezra Y. Yacob - EOG Resources, Inc.","Leo, this is Ezra Yacob again. It's just really still pretty early in in the Austin Chalk. We are still doing a lot of testing on our well spacing, trying to determine the optimal spacing, how many precision targets we have in there. We've talked about in the past that it is different than the historical Austin Chalk play. It is a matrix \u2013 contributing kind of a matrix drive play. And so it's not quite as straightforward to use a lot of those historical learnings.","The way we're developing it is different and it's unique. I'd say the initial productions look good. I know it seems like we put a lot of wells on but we'd like to be confident before we really come out with any detailed numbers on that. And like I said, when we have a little more detail on that, we'll certainly talk about it.","Leo P. Mariani - NatAlliance Securities LLC","Okay, that's helpful. And I guess I just wanted to follow up on the Eagle Ford. You guys talked about some of the differing production rates you saw in the first quarter on the eastern wells versus the western wells, but then cited that returns are pretty similar. Just curious, does that kind of imply that maybe your well cost in West are lower than the East, what can you say sort of say about that?","Ezra Y. Yacob - EOG Resources, Inc.","Leo, it's Ezra again. I think you hit the nail on the head there. The cost per foot \u2013 I tried to highlight in those opening remarks the contiguous nature of the western Eagle Ford acreage and a little bit less faulting out there, allows us the opportunity to drill longer wells and larger packages. It's a little bit less pressured and less shallow too. So in general, the costs are a little bit cheaper there.","In the eastern Eagle Ford side of our acreage position though, we usually have wells with a little bit more robust rates, a little bit bigger wells, but it is a little bit more challenging drilling over there. It's a little bit deeper, a little bit extra pressure. And then in general, the well lengths tend to be just a little bit shorter due to both the layout of specific leases over there, but then also there's an increase in the faulting off to that eastern side.","Leo P. Mariani - NatAlliance Securities LLC","Okay, that's helpful. And I guess just quick question on your dividend here. You talked about increases in the future. Should we expect to see a increase here in 2018? Are you more talking about evaluate that for 2019 and beyond?","William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.","Leo, we don't have any specifics on timing. Our board evaluates the business environment every quarter concerning the dividend. And I think what we're saying is we believe EOG is in the best shape we've ever been for sustainable, more aggressive dividend growth. So our board is eager to return cash to shareholders with a strong dividend growth.","Leo P. Mariani - NatAlliance Securities LLC","Thank you very much.","Operator","And next we'll move to Charles Meade with Johnson Rice.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Yes. Good morning, Bill, to you and your whole team there. You've covered this a little bit already in your comments in the Q&A, but I just want to go back to the comments you made in your opening when you said you had no interest in corporate M&A. And that's certainly been the pattern for you guys, with the one prominent exception of the Yates deal. And that was really a brilliant deal for you guys but I'm trying to understand a little bit more, is the Yates deal the exception that's not likely to come along again or should we be interpreting that you see the market or the opportunities differently from the way you did at that time?","William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.","I think, Charles, what we are saying is that we've got extreme confidence in our ability to organically add new high potential at very low cost through our exploration efforts. In general, I think this year, we have a very robust exploration effort ongoing. And we've acquired a significant amount of low cost acreage in multiple plays, and we're testing numerous new plays with exploration or step up drilling this year.","And so our organic machine is really in high gear and we have a lot of confidence in it. And we believe we can acquire significant, hopefully, even better drilling potential than we currently have through that process at very low cost.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Got it. That's helpful, Bill. That's all for me. Thanks a lot.","Operator","And we'll move on to David Heikkinen with Heikkinen Energy Advisors.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Good morning, guys, and thanks for taking my question. We appreciated the details that you put on slide 21 around your diversified marketing options. Can you talk more specifically about firm sales, firm transportation, financial hedges and then balance of avoiding those long-term contracts that I know EOG doesn't want?","D. Lance Terveen - EOG Resources, Inc.","David, this is Lance Terveen, and thanks for your question. Let me start and answer your last question there, when you talk about commitments. I'll tell you all of us in this room, we've seen the Barnett, the Haynesville, the Uinta. And so when we think about long-term commitments, it's really twofold. It's we want to have near-term flow assurance; and two, we just want to be very disciplined about any kind of long-term commitments.","And what we think that does when we can kind of have that first mover and we can identify it, where we need to identify transportation and access to get to markets, at that point, we really make good business decisions, because a lot of folks are going to be waiting for new pipelines that are going to be starting out in late 2019 and probably into 2020.","And what happens when there's a lot of hype and especially very active area like the Permian, with 453 rigs running, it's just \u2013 it's not a panic that comes in but people are looking for capacity. So we want to get out in front of that like we've done and like what we've shown. So for us on the commitments, it's really \u2013 it's just being very disciplined, have a balanced approach, get in front of it.","And the second thing with that, it allows you to have more discretionary volumes and it allows you to look at other projects, and other things that can come available at even lower rates. So getting in front of that and having some of that near-term assurances really sets us up in the future to lock in other markets or also look at lower transportation costs.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Any specific kind of split","D. Lance Terveen - EOG Resources, Inc.","Go ahead, David.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Any specifics of splits as far as you think about that flow assurance of marketing agreements, either firm sales, firm transportation? Because you might have done these contracts or terms two years ago, three years ago, I'm just trying to get an idea of how you think about splitting marketing agreements, pipeline agreements, hedges, just in that kind of forward-looking process (55:07).","D. Lance Terveen - EOG Resources, Inc.","Sure, sure. Again, it goes back to our experiences and what we've seen in other basins and as we've looked at making commitments and transportation commitments. So again, when we look at that and we look at the forward forecast and where we think each of the basins might be growing, especially like a new emerging basin. So typically, we want to lock up anywhere from maybe 70% to 80% of that near term and leave kind of more available in the outer years.","So really with the crystal ball, when we're looking at making the commitments, we try to protect more of a, call it, the first three years. And then if we need to make medium-term commitments, then those commitment volumes are a little smaller in the outer years. So that's strategically how we think about the commitments, David.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Yeah, so cut a three-year and roll. Okay, that's helpful. Thanks, guys.","Operator","And we'll move on to Jeffery Campell with Tuohy Brothers.","Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Good morning. I just wanted to ask for a little bit color on the Woodford oil. I noticed that you've added a rig and you drilled quite a long lateral there, which is usually a sign that you're more into development than into delineation. And it seems like this play has really accelerated in a reasonably short amount of time. So I just wanted to just check in on that.","David W. Trice - EOG Resources, Inc.","Jeff, this is David Trice. On the Woodford, yes, we have picked up additional rigs there. We are running four rigs currently there. And what we're doing this year is, one, we're securing operatorship on all these units, and then also we're doing several spacing tests there. So what we want to really focus on in the Woodford this year is we want to \u2013 like in our other plays, we want to really confirm the correct spacing so that we can be sure to maximize the NPV per section there.","Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","And if I could just follow up on what you just said, what's your \u2013 if you look at your position as a whole, what percentage of it can you operate now and what are you trying to get to?","David W. Trice - EOG Resources, Inc.","Really most of the 50,000 acres net that we show we would be able to operate that. We have quite a few trades going on where we may not have a majority interest. And so we think at the end of the day, we'll be able to operate the entire position.","Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Okay, great. Thanks for the color.","Operator","And next we'll move to Bob Brackett with Bernstein Research.","Robert Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thanks for taking my question. I'll follow up a bit on the Austin Chalk. If I divide the Austin Chalk into the Karnes Trough into Louisiana and into everything else, where's your sense of how mature your understanding of those plays are right now? And where is the upside on each of those?","Ezra Y. Yacob - EOG Resources, Inc.","Bob, this is Ezra Yacob. Let me start with the Karnes Trough area down in the South Texas trend. Now like I said, we brought to sale last year a number of wells and we're very happy with the initial rates on there. And again, it's a new concept on the play that we have been working over the last couple of years where we're basically applying our precision targeting, our petro-physical model in combination with our seismic attributes to upscale and model these precision targets that actually have matrix contribution. And then we're applying some of our high density frac designs, things that we've developed in these different basins -or different unconventional plays, basically to the Austin Chalk. And so we're really happy with it.","I would say where the upside resides down in South Texas is continuing to delineate targets, high grading those targets and again, kind of the continued evolution of our frac designs. It is the Chalk, so it does \u2013 each of these plays that we're in, whether it's a carbonate, siltstones, mudrocks, as you know, little tweaks on your completion design can make a big difference. And so the biggest upside I see with the Austin Chalk is just that, advances \u2013 continued evolution and advances on our completions, delineating additional targets.","And then in Louisiana, it's very early on that prospect. I think everyone knows that we've drilled a very successful Eagles Ranch well out there. We're very pleased with the initial results on there and we'll provide further details on that on future calls.","Robert Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","And elsewhere, is the Austin Chalk trend, should we think of it working along the entire trend or do you need sort of local structures to help you out?","Ezra Y. Yacob - EOG Resources, Inc.","This is Ezra again, Bob. Yeah, the way I'd follow up with that is I'd say there are definitely going to be sweet spots. That's obviously a widespread play from Mexico all the way up around Gulf Coast there. Just like any big regional unconventional play, there are going to be sweet spots in different parts of that area. There are different attributes geologically and geophysically, including structure is one of them, that we're looking at to high grade those areas. But any additional color than that, I'm not sure if we want to provide today.","Robert Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Great. Appreciate it.","Operator","And that will conclude today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Bill Thomas for any additional or closing remarks.","William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.","In closing, I want to say thank you to every EOG employee for all of your great work. Our execution in the first quarter was outstanding. We are well on our way to the delivering the best investment returns in company history. EOG is never been in a better shape to deliver sustainable, long-term shareholder value.

Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.","Thanks, Tim, and good morning to everyone. EOG is a high-return organic growth company and we are delivering what we promised: a compelling combination of high returns, disciplined growth and free cash flow. In the third quarter, we lowered well costs and improved well performance. As a result, year-to-date, we are generating triple-digit well level returns.","We grew our oil production 27% year-over-year and total production 25%. And we generated over $0.5 billion in free cash flow. This is a rare performance not often seen in our industry or even in the broader market.","Our third quarter results demonstrate the value of EOG's unique culture of innovation, supported by a rich history of a data-driven, non-bureaucratic flat organization. Innovations, real-time data gathering, rapid analytics and redeployment of learnings to the field are continually producing improving results through the company.","For example, in the Delaware Basin, we are making significant progress in breaking the code for optimum well spacing. Likewise, on the cost side, we are making significant progress driving down drilling and completion costs. The same is true for our Woodford Oil Play, where just like in the Delaware, we're finding better drilling targets, discovering improved completion techniques and lowering costs all at the same time.","We're excited about our progress and the continuous improvements we are seeing this year. And more importantly, we believe there's plenty of momentum to continue to get better in 2019. EOG's unique culture of innovation and focus on exploration are fundamental to our sustainable business model. Our culture of innovation drives continuous improvements in each play we develop, maximizing the value of our leasehold by optimizing NPV, returns and finding and development costs.","Our focus on organic exploration makes EOG a prospect-generating machine, and we continue to generate significant new ideas. And to be clear about it, we're only interested in adding new plays that will increase the quality of our premium inventory, and we're encouraged with the new prospects we're currently evaluating.","Innovation and exploration are key to EOG's sustainable business model and creates long-term value for our shareholders. We're on track to deliver double-digit ROC and strong double-digit production growth in 2018. Those two milestone achievements, combined with returning cash to shareholders through a 31% increase in the dividend this year, debt reduction and the generation of substantial free cash flow make EOG a unique and compelling investment, not only in the E&P industry, but in the broader market.","Looking forward to 2019, we're not going to increase capital at the expense of efficiencies and returns. We will develop our assets and spend capital at a pace that will optimize our learning curve and allow sustainable improvement to our well productivity and cost structure. Any production growth is strictly the result of disciplined capital allocation to high return assets. Furthermore, capital allocation will continue to be based on returns measured against our premium price deck of $40 flat oil and $2.50 flat natural gas prices, no matter if commodity prices improve next year. Our goal of being one of the lowest cost producers in the global oil market has not changed. We are continuously resetting the company to deliver strong returns, even in a low to moderate oil price environment.","Next up is Billy to discuss third quarter highlights that are the results of a well-executed capital and operational plan and how we plan to maintain that performance for the remainder of the year and into 2019.","Lloyd W. Helms, Jr. - EOG Resources, Inc.","Thanks, Bill. Our operating teams continue to deliver solid performance executing on our 2018 program. As a result, we are seeing returns on a direct basis reach levels previously not achieved in the history of the company. New technology is increasing drilling speeds, drilling more consistent targets and lowering cost, all at the same time. Combined with cost reductions from local sand, water recycling and infrastructure projects, we are well on our way to achieving our stretch goal of reducing average cost 5% by year-end 2018.","Our goal is to be one of the lowest cost producers in the global E&P industry, and we are very pleased with our progress through the third quarter. As we near the end of 2018, industry activity is slowing. Consequently, the service sector is experiencing a period of softness in the market. To take advantage of market conditions, we elected to secure some of our existing service providers through the fourth quarter for next year's program. This will capture favorable prices and sustain the operational continuity of these high-performing service providers into 2019.","For example, we retained a number of high-performing completion crews that we had initially planned to release in the fourth quarter. Retaining these crews means we will complete 20 additional net wells compared to our prior forecast and accomplish our objective of maintaining our momentum into next year.","We have contracted for about 65% of our anticipated services and materials needs in 2019, which is higher at this point in the calendar year than in past years. By doing so, we expect to reduce total well cost again in 2019. The negotiated structure for these services provides EOG with a great deal of flexibility to adjust our activity level in 2019.","We also anticipate opportunities to capture additional leasehold before year-end. As Bill mentioned, our exploration efforts are key to our proven sustainable business model by both replenishing and improving the quality of our premium inventory. As we begin planning for 2019, disciplined capital allocation is key. We view growth as a by-product of focusing on returns first. While we aren't providing specific guidance for 2019 today, we can provide some broad outlines of how the plan is shaping up. We aren't targeting an arbitrary growth rate. We are seeking to reinvest capital to the point that allows us to continue to lower cost and improve efficiencies. Again, capital allocation will continue to be based on returns measured against our premium price deck of $40 oil and $2.50 natural gas.","I'll turn the call over to Ezra to update you on the Delaware Basin and Eagle Ford.","Ezra Y. Yacob - EOG Resources, Inc.","Thanks, Billy. In the Delaware Basin, we've made remarkable progress determining how to optimally develop this technically-complex basin. During the first three quarters of 2018, we put 201 net wells to sales in various spacing and target patterns, which generated more than 150% direct after-tax rate of return.","Well results across all of our Delaware Basin targets are consistently outperforming their respective type curves and early production observations and data have been incorporated into our ongoing development to further improve future well productivity.","The geology in this basin is variable and complex, so there will not be a single answer on spacing or package size; however, the ultimate goal is to maximize capital efficiency by optimizing the numerous drivers of finding cost, returns and NPV.","We're also making significant progress reducing well costs in a number of areas. Like many operators, we are benefiting from local sand. But most of our gains are from operational efficiencies. Drilling days are down 10%. We've steadily increased the use of zipper fracs throughout the year, contributing to a 20% increase in stages completed per day and a more than 10% decrease in completions costs.","Finally, our investment in water infrastructure is paying off. We are moving 95% of our water on pipe. That includes water used for drilling and completion operations, as well as produced water.","Our progress in the Delaware Basin is a prime example of EOG's culture of innovation and entrepreneurship. We continue to experiment with operational and logistics changes and targeting and completions advances, all supported by real-time data capture to quickly respond to changing conditions at the field level. The result is better wells at lower costs.","The Eagle Ford continues to deliver consistent performance quarter after quarter. We've been drilling this world-class asset for almost 10 years and we are still growing production, innovating our operations and experimenting with well completions, targeting and spacing.","The well mix in the Eagle Ford during the third quarter included a higher proportion of western acreage wells. While the pay is thinner in the west, there's less faulting, which allows for longer laterals. The longer laterals you can drill, the better the efficiencies to be gained during drilling and completions.","Wells drilled in the west this year are averaging over 3,500 feet per day and are delivering the highest direct NPV of our Eagle Ford program. These long lateral Western Eagle Ford wells will make up a growing proportion of our total Eagle Ford development in the future.","Across our 520,000 net-acre position in the Eagle Ford Oil Window, we have a massive inventory of 2,300 net undrilled premium locations. We continue to make progress maximizing value through technical innovation and operational efficiency, which in turn generates additional premium wells.","The Eagle Ford remains core to EOG's business and one of the most important assets driving our production growth.","Here's David Trice.","David W. Trice - EOG Resources, Inc.","Thanks, Ezra. We are in the initial innings of our Woodford Oil Window play in the Anadarko Basin and are experimenting with completion designs, testing various targets, confirming well spacing and lowering cost. Late in the second quarter, we brought online a four-well, 660-foot-space package that targeted the same landing zone. The four Ted wells have over 120 days of production and are matching or exceeding our 1 million barrel oil equivalent per well type curve for the play.","The Ted's average per well 30-day initial production delivered 660 barrels of oil per day and their 90-day IP held up at 530 barrels per day. These results are consistent with the performance we have seen since we started actively developing the Woodford last year. Initial IPs in this play tend to be lower than those in our other plays; however, they also have a lower decline rate.","The performance of this four-well package supports our initial estimate that 660-foot spacing is optimal in the Woodford and delivers premium economics at low finding and development costs. Going forward, we will be working to optimize spacing, while targeting multiple landing zones.","On the cost side, we're making great progress toward our target well cost of $7.8 million per well. Recent wells have come in at or even below our targeted cost and we anticipate that costs in 2019 could average below $7.8 million. One significant source of future cost reduction is the water reuse program that is being rolled out in our Oklahoma operations. We expect at least 50% of our water needs in 2019 will be sourced through recycling, and that percentage will increase over time.","We're currently moving up the learning curve in the Woodford. In typical EOG fashion, we're innovating and experimenting with completion and targeting technology, capturing data in real-time, then rapidly redeploying what we've learned in the field. As a result, we expect to continue to improve the Woodford play's well productivity and cost structure as it grows to contribute meaningfully to EOG's production and premium returns.","We mentioned on our year-end call that starting this year we decided to take a more seasonal approach to developing the Bakken. Historically, activity in the winter has come at a higher cost due to harsher conditions, so we decided to make it a practice to minimize activity through the winter months. As a result, most of our 2018 Bakken program started production in the second and third quarter.","During the third quarter, we completed 12 net wells with an average 30-day IP of almost 1,400 barrels of oil equivalent per day per well. These wells are solidly premium due to high oil cuts, low decline rates and very low well costs. The wells brought online in the third quarter cost approximately $5 million for laterals that averaged about 9,400 feet. The cost structure in the Bakken is one of the primary reasons we consistently deliver premium economics that are sustainable through commodity price cycles. The Bakken remains an important asset in EOG's diverse portfolio of plays, providing flexibility for reinvestment at our premium return hurdle rate.","Our Powder River Basin activity during the third quarter was focused on the Turner play where we completed 11 net wells that produced an average of 1,700 barrels of oil equivalent per day per well in the first 30 days. In the Mowry we drilled two wells that we are currently completing and expect to spud a Niobrara well in the fourth quarter. From a technical standpoint, we continue to fine-tune target identification and execution in both plays, as well as dialing in the right completion practices. In the early life of any new play, this tends to be an iterative process as we collect data and rapidly integrate the new information on a go-forward basis.","We are also in initial planning stages for two spacing tests that will target the Mowry and Niobrara. We are planning to spud the tests by year-end, and the results will help determine how we co-develop the Mowry and Niobrara going forward. Co-development of these targets will drive additional long-term efficiencies, lower cost and increase returns in the Powder River Basin.","As we plan for 2019, we are in active discussions with third-party service providers to ensure we have capacity to transport and process production next year and beyond. In addition, we will begin to add EOG-owned infrastructure at a pace that is commensurate with development. This pay-as-you-go strategy will ensure that we can maintain our capital efficiency, even as we increase activity in the basin. EOG-owned infrastructure will potentially include oil, gas and water gathering facilities, water recycling facilities, oil terminals and compressor stations.","The main advantage to EOG-owned infrastructure is that it dramatically lowers lease operating and transportation expenses, as well as future capital cost associated with water handling. It also gives us greater control and flexibility, along with access to multiple markets, which will ultimately result in higher netback prices. In summary, we're planning for long-term, high-return growth out of the Powder River Basin, the newest addition to our portfolio of premium assets.","Here's Tim.","Timothy K. Driggers - EOG Resources, Inc.","Thanks, David. EOG's financial position improved significantly during the third quarter. The company generated discretionary cash flow of $2.3 billion. EOG invested $1.7 billion in exploration and development expenditures and paid $107 million in dividends. Free cash flow was $503 million. Cash on the balance sheet at September 30 was $1.3 billion, and total debt was $6.4 billion, for a net debt to total capitalization ratio of 22%. This same ratio was 28% just a year ago. Our goal is to repay $3 billion of debt through 2021. The first repayment was for a $350 million bond that came to maturity October 1, 2018. We also reached an agreement to divest of our UK operations, including the Conway asset and expect to close before year-end.","With the recent volatility in commodity prices, projections of future cash flow move around considerably, even on a daily basis. But EOG's priorities are steadfast: invest with discipline, focus on rate of return and maintain a strong financial position. Our goal, as always, is to create significant shareholder value over the long-term.","I'll now turn it back over to Bill for closing remarks.","William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.","Thanks, Tim. I would like to share the following concluding remarks. First, we are making significant progress on optimizing well spacing in the Delaware Basin and other plays. We're breaking the code on how to increase well productivity and lower finding and development costs while optimizing NPV. We feel next year our capital efficiency will be much-improved. Second, we're on track to reduce well costs 5% by year-end 2018, and we believe we can continue to reduce costs further in 2019.","Third, as we demonstrated last quarter with the addition of the Powder River, Niobrara and Mowry plays, the company continues to organically add significant new high return premium drilling inventory much faster than we're drilling it. More importantly, EOG's inventory is growing in quality, not just quantity. Better rocks make better wells and enhance the company's ability to deliver high returns in the future. And we are encouraged with the new ideas we're generating through our exploration efforts.","Fourth, EOG's unique innovative culture, real-time data gathering, advanced analytics and quick deployment of new ideas to the field are delivering sustainable cost and productivity improvements across the company. The combination of our pleased but not satisfied culture and industry-leading information technology is delivering sustainable results and provides a significant competitive advantage for the company.","Fifth. We're systematically resetting the company's performance to be one of the lowest cost producers in the global oil market. Step by step we believe we're continuously improving the company to produce strong returns through the commodity price cycles. And finally, our third quarter results demonstrates EOG's ability to deliver strong double-digit return on capital employed, strong double-digit production growth and generate free cash flow. This combination is rare in the energy sector and places EOG in line with the top performers in any sector of the market. It's a unique and compelling combination that creates significant long-term shareholder value.","Thanks for listening and now we'll go to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. The question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. Our first question today will come from Ryan Todd of Simmons Energy. Please go ahead.","Ryan Todd - Simmons & Company International","Great. Thanks, and congratulations on the good result. Maybe if I could start with one as we think about \u2013 or maybe a couple questions on capital. Can you break down \u2013 I mean, I know you mentioned some of it. A few of the drivers in the $300 million increase to the CapEx budget. And with implied spending falling to just over $1 billion in fourth quarter, which is obviously low, could you give us an idea of maybe what a normalized run rate would be on CapEx right now? And I have a follow-up.","Lloyd W. Helms, Jr. - EOG Resources, Inc.","Yeah, Ryan, this is Billy Helms. So, yes, the fourth quarter we expect to be down relative to the third quarter, and that's simply because our activity was planned that way at the start of the year. We are going to have fewer wells completed in the fourth quarter than we did in the third. And as an election of trying to maintain our momentum on driving cost down, we are going to retain some equipment that we'd previously planned to release. In doing so, we'll end up completing about 20 additional wells and that'll be the majority of the increase that we're seeing in the fourth quarter. That will give us momentum going into 2019 by capturing these high-performing service providers and maintaining the efficiency gains that we have realized to-date, we'll be able to continue to drive our well costs down into 2019.","We're pretty excited really about the progress we've made on lowering well cost. In general, we'd say our well costs are down about 3% year-to-date across our plays. For example, we're down about 2% in the Eagle Ford. In the Wolfcamp, we're down about 3%. In the Bakken, we're down about 4%. We're making similar progress across all of our plays. And on average, we're about 3% down for the company, headed towards our goal of 5%, which we believe we'll accomplish in the fourth quarter.","So, our plan this year was, as everybody recognized, it was loaded to the front end with CapEx. The production showed up really in the third quarter. All intended to drop a little bit in the fourth quarter, so our run rate this year on a capital basis by quarter was a little bit lopsided.","Going into 2019, we do not expect to do the same thing. Our 2019 program would be a little more balanced. We can't give you any guidance or any numbers on that yet. We're still working on that. But we would expect the run rate going into next year to be more balanced and then capital efficiency continue to improve, and that's the whole basis at which we allocate capital these days, is we're only going to do so as we can continue to improve our capital efficiency.","Ryan Todd - Simmons & Company International","Great. Thanks. And then maybe just at a higher level. I mean, I appreciate the effort to talk about your reinvestment philosophy. But, I guess, how is the right way to think about \u2013 I know growth is an output, but you've got a relatively-unique growth and free cash flow profile. How do you think about balancing more or less growth with more or less free cash flow?","And I get returns are a part of it, but you clearly have far more opportunity to deploy capital at high rates of return than you do in any given year. So, where do you draw a line between the amount that you're willing to grow versus a higher or lower amount of free cash? I'll leave it there. Thanks.","William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.","Brian, this is Bill. Yeah, certainly, we're very committed to operating within cash flow and generate free cash flow every year. Our goal is to generate free cash flow every year. So, we look at the program every year with not a volume number that we're really focused on. We really look at the program as we've already talked about extensively to continue to get better. So, we want to improve capital efficiency, continue to lower the finding and development costs and improve returns.","And we believe we've got a sustainable business model, because it's based on $40 oil, which we believe is well below the marginal cost of oil. So, we've created, as you have already commented on, we've got a very powerful engine and we certainly have the ability to grow very fast, but we're not really focused on growth. We're really focused on getting better at increasing returns.","So, every year we throttle back to allow us to learn and get better. And we believe as long as we continue to add new plays, we do not see our growth dropping significantly in the next several years at current prices.","Ryan Todd - Simmons & Company International","Thanks, Bill.","Operator","Our next question will come from Arun Jayaram of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah, good morning. Bill, I wanted to \u2013 if you could elaborate on your comments on capital efficiency being better in 2019 versus 2018. Do you believe that on a spending per unit of production basis, and I'm thinking about oil, that your CapEx dollar will deliver a more oil growth on a year-over-year basis per dollar invested?","William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.","Yes, Arun. That's absolutely what we believe. It's based on a number of different ideas. The first one, as Billy has already commented on, we're going to get off to a better start, a faster start next year than we did in 2018. And then we really believe we're going to be entering the year at lower cost and higher well productivity than we entered 2018. And we believe with our ability to continue to learn, capture data, integrate the data, analyze the data and put it back into the field very quickly, that we will be able to continue to improve, lower costs and continue to improve our spacing patterns, development patterns and continue to improve well productivity going forward. So our goal every year, not just in 2019, is to get better. And that's a core culture of the company. We've consistently done it for many, many, many years and we do not see any end in that process.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. And just my follow-up, Bill, I totally appreciate the fact that EOG allocates capital on a returns basis. But just had a philosophical question on growth. You guys have previously highlighted a 15% to 25% kind of oil growth outlook, assuming $50 to $60. One question we think about, if you get to the middle part of that range, the organization would essentially have to grow kind of a Parsley Energy in terms of size, in terms of oil growth. So we'd argue maybe towards the lower end of that range, may be better from a longer-term perspective. Would love to hear your thoughts on that.","William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.","Well, Arun, again, we don't give you any specific numbers. But in general, just as I've commented, because we have multiple plays, we're developing currently 11 different oil plays in the company, and because we have a very decentralized structure that we can focus our divisions on each one of these plays, put the proper people, the proper process in place to continuously improve, as long as we continue to add new potential to the company every year through that whole process, we believe that our growth will not drop significantly in the next several years at current prices.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question will come from Brian Singer of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you. Good morning. Can you discuss the decision to lock in services costs for 2019? Specifically, do you think that market prices are near trough? And then if you were to create a waterfall for 2019 like you have on slide 16 for 2018, do you think you need to deliver efficiency gains and multiple green bars from here to keep well costs down? Or are you already seeing well costs down year-on-year in 2019 based on the pricing terms you've locked in?","Lloyd W. Helms, Jr. - EOG Resources, Inc.","Yeah, Brian, this is Billy Helms. Yeah, the decision to go ahead and lock in or capture these service providers that are we think at very favorable prices was really to maintain those efficiencies. We feel like that we're getting some highly efficient crews at what we believe is near the market conditions that we have today, or probably near the low end. We don't know if we can capture the absolute bottom of the trough, but we do feel like we're capturing some of the best providers out there at very favorable prices. So it gives us confidence to be able to continue to lower our well cost in 2019.","Yeah, we believe that the momentum we've created on efficiency gains and the progress we're seeing across all of our plays will continue to deliver solid results going into 2019, which is the whole reason we made this decision. We want to \u2013 as we started 2018, we had to pick up quite a few crews and equipment. And certainly those don't operate at the efficiency levels that we anticipate or expect. And it took us a while to get there, but we're very satisfied where we are today and the progress we're making on continuous improvement. We just want to maintain that into 2019. Yeah, we're going to continue to push every one of those categories you mentioned there on that slide 16, I believe, for the Wolfcamp. And I believe that one's going to continue to get better over time.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks. And then to follow up on the capital efficiency improving in 2019 point and Arun's follow-up there, you mentioned that well productivity you expect to improve next year. Can you talk about what and where the drivers of that are?","William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.","Yeah, Brian. This is Bill. It's really in multiple different areas. We're seeing still very significant frac technology applications and improvements. We're seeing better execution in our targets, which we're able to drill even faster and stay in a very narrow window even more precisely than we've done in years past. And we continue to learn how to pick our targets better. So our target selection is better, so just in general, the quality of the rock that we target is improving over time. And all these are incrementally and moving continuously at the same time. So we just don't really see an end or a plateau in being able to improve the company going forward. We have a very sustainable business model, a very sophisticated information technology process. And I think I'll ask Sandeep maybe to comment on some of the things that we're doing in the information system to continue to improve.","Sandeep Bhakhri - EOG Resources, Inc.","Yeah, sure, Bill. Yeah, Brian, like Bill said, the main goal is really to continue to improve capital efficiency, and that means drilling better wells for lower cost. And the game-changer for us really has been the ability for us to capture data at a very, very high frequency at a very, very granular level in real-time and deliver it to all our engineers. The level of innovation that is currently that we're seeing continues to amaze me in terms of the inventiveness of our completion engineers and their ability to almost custom design fracs to take advantage of the unique rock that we steered through and the ability of our geosteerers and our G&G folks to continue to fine-tune the target and stay in the real-time basis, regardless of running \u2013 maybe crossing faults even and getting back into zones much faster.","The whole system is geared towards becoming better with data, assimilating the understanding of potential depletion, dialing that into the frac designs to make better wells on an ongoing basis. So there's innovations going on in drilling, in completions, in production optimization, all with the goal of improving capital efficiency. So the levers of capital efficiency improvements in 2019, I would say, are just numerous, countless almost.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question will come from Leo Mariani of NatAlliance Securities. Please go ahead.","Leo P. Mariani - NatAlliance Securities","Hey, guys. Just wanted to follow up a little bit on sort of your comments around capital efficiency. Obviously, you had a really nice ramp in production here in 2018, and certainly as you guys have pointed out, well costs have fallen. So I guess all things being equal, it certainly looks like we're going to see higher operating cash flows in 2019 versus 2018 here. So just high level, should we expect to see some higher overall just activity levels from EOG? And obviously looks like free cash flow will go up. So maybe just talk about sort of prioritizing the uses next year.","William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.","Yeah, Leo, again, we're going to maintain very strict discipline. So the governor is we're only going to increase spending if we can get better. So that's the absolute thing. I think you've heard that. So the priorities have not changed. We're getting currently, at current prices, we're getting triple-digit rates of returns at the well level. So that's the first priority for cash. We're very excited about new exploration potential that we're generating inside the company. So, we want to continue to pick up better rock at low cost, and we're certainly have debt reduction as a very high priority in the company. And as Tim said, we have already reduced by $350 million this year and we plan to retire another $900 million next year, and we've target over $3 billion of debt reduction over the next \u2013 in four-year period.","And then, we want to continue to work on increasing the dividend. We have a very strong commitment to returning cash to our shareholders through the dividend as we increased it 31% this year. And if we have a healthy business environment, we'll evaluate quarterly on that, but our goal is to continue to increase that at stronger than a historical rate of 19% compounded annual growth rate.","And then, I just want to reiterate. We have no interest, no need in even thinking about expensive corporate M&As. So, we're very focused and very disciplined, and we're going to continue to remain focused on increasing returns by getting better.","Leo P. Mariani - NatAlliance Securities","Okay. That's great color. And I also just wanted to focus quickly on the Austin Chalk. I know this is an emerging play for you folks, but obviously you've been in the play for a while. Just wanted to get a sense of where we are in the evolution here. I mean, do you guys feel like you've got a better handle on sort of the economics, as well as just the productive extent of your sizable acreage position at this point in time?","Ezra Y. Yacob - EOG Resources, Inc.","Hey, Leo. This is Ezra Yacob and, yeah, I think as we've talked about it, we've been developing the Austin Chalk. We've been co-developing it now with our Eagle Ford program and it's a little bit more of a complicated play than the Eagle Ford, certainly.","And so, while it's prospective across our entire South Texas acreage position there, the sweet spots are a little more discontinuous. And we've done a very good job integrating not only core data and log data that we've collected while we've been developing the Eagle Ford, but we've also tied that into our seismic coverage, which extends across our entire acreage position.","So, yeah, we're feeling very good with it. The benefit that the Austin Chalk also has is that since we do co-develop it with the Eagle Ford and it's within our core area, it benefits from a lot of the existing infrastructure. And, obviously, all the operational performance that we have there that we continue to increase in the Eagle Ford, the Austin Chalk continues to benefit from that.","So this quarter we brought on 10 net wells. They had a average 30-day rate there of just over 1,800 barrels of oil per day. And so, we are very happy with the performance of it.","Leo P. Mariani - NatAlliance Securities","Okay. Thanks for the color.","Operator","Our next question will come from Bob Brackett of Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Robert Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hey. Good morning. You mentioned that approximately 65% of anticipated 2019 services have been secured. What is that 65% of?","Lloyd W. Helms, Jr. - EOG Resources, Inc.","That's 65% \u2013 Bob, this is Billy Helms, by the way. This is 65% of our typical average well cost in the company. So, we look at our typical well costs being somewhere in that $6-million range, and it's about 65% of that number.","Robert Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. So, that's a per-well number, it's not a total capital number?","Lloyd W. Helms, Jr. - EOG Resources, Inc.","No. It's a per well. It's an average for the per-well drill and complete cost.","Robert Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. That's understood. A separate question. If I look at sort of where you are in spacing in the Delaware Basin, there's a fairly-wide range from 660 feet up to 1,000 feet, and it doesn't seem to be a function of depth or oil cut. Can you give some color? What's driving that well spacing? And how fixed are those numbers?","Ezra Y. Yacob - EOG Resources, Inc.","Yeah, Bob. This is Ezra Yacob. So that's a good observation you have. I appreciate the question. The first part of our well spacing, it does actually begin with the oil cut. I think our announced type curves for the oil play where we have 226,000 net acres is based on 660-foot spacing. And then for our combo play, which is a little bit shallower, a little bit less of an oil cut, that type curve is based on an 880-foot spacing. And that would be some of our Reeves County acreage down there.","But then more than that, the spacing really across the Permian is going to be tied to the local geology. We continue to kind of monitor the long-term performance, a lot of those spacing and different targeting patterns that we've tested. And we've discussed those on past calls where we've been testing spacing in the oil window down to 500-foot to 700-foot spacing, depending basically on the local geology, the number of targets, and as such. It is a complicated play in the Delaware Basin.","But I think what we see this year is we've made tremendous progress on defining kind of our optimal spacing and targeting packages for our core acreage positions. We brought 180 wells in the Wolfcamp to sales this year, and it's reinforced that we feel very confident with our announced resource potential on that type curve at 1.3 million barrels of equivalents. And again, that's for a 7,000-foot lateral at 660-foot spacing. I think the way to think about that 660 feet is if you just look at our remaining premium inventory, that's going to be a good average over that acreage position.","We feel very good about the work that's been done this year in the Permian; our ability to increase returns and optimize NPV and ultimately increase the capital efficiency as we finish up 2018 and move into 2019.","Robert Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Great. Appreciate that. Just to be explicit, those numbers account for things like parent child relationships and down-spacing, well interference effects?","Ezra Y. Yacob - EOG Resources, Inc.","Yeah, that's correct, Bob. When we put our resource potential on our type curves out there, we've baked all of that in. And so as we continue to integrate our data, not only from the early package development, the early and long-term production profiles of the wells, our real-time completions data. As we integrate that into the next well of packages, really we consider the improvements and the gains that we're able to make as upside.","Robert Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Great. Appreciate it.","Operator","The next question will come from Charles Meade of Johnson Rice. Please go ahead.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Yes, good morning, Bill, to you and your whole team there. I was listening to your prepared comments, and I wanted to go back and explore a little bit the idea that you're ranking these plays at $40 oil. It makes sense to me that your best play at $40 would still be your best play at $60 or $70. But it also seems to me that the way you would develop your assets or your spacing patterns, to pick up on Bob Brackett's point, or how intensively you go after those assets would be different at $60 or $70 than it would at $40. So can you talk about whether you agree with that point of view? And if you do, how you modulate that density aspect of your program?","William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.","Charles, we run all of our economics based on our premium price deck of $40 flat and $2.50 flat natural gas prices. So our focus on all of our properties is to develop those to continue to lower the finding costs. That's really, really important; to continue to improve the capital efficiency, that's really, really important; to continue to improve the returns and ultimately, to optimize the NPV. And so we're really able, we believe, to optimize those all at once.","And we have a very strict $40 flat, $2.50 flat price deck that we manage the company on. And we believe that will continue to improve the cost structure of the company. And that is what we believe will continue to help us to generate double-digit returns and double-digit growth through the commodity price cycles and that is what will continue to help us become one of the lowest cost producers in the global oil market. So, we're very focused, we're very strict and we're committed to that process.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Thanks for that clarification, Bill. That's it from me.","Operator","Our next question will come from Irene Haas of Imperial Capital. Please go ahead.","Irene Haas - Imperial Capital LLC","Yes. My question is on Powder River Basin. Very glad to see that the company is preemptively working on infrastructure. And my question has to do with just permitting on the state and federal level, how is it coming along? Any progress on the EIS? And also, really any gating factor that needs to be taken care of before you guys really, really ramp up, such as oil and gas takeaway.","David W. Trice - EOG Resources, Inc.","Yes, Irene. This is David Trice. On the regulatory side, we have captured the permits that we need for operatorship out there. So, we've been busy doing that for really the last couple years. As you know, Wyoming's kind of a capture-the-flag state, so you have to actually file the permit to get operatorship no matter what your interest is there. And so we've done that for essentially all of our acreage out there.","And as far as the infrastructure goes, we had mentioned on our last call that 2019 was really where we're going to be focused on adding infrastructure and takeaway. Our drilling activity will not be up significantly in 2019. It'll probably be up slightly there, but mainly the focus in 2019 is going to be more focused on putting the pieces in place to go ahead and bring the Powder forward in 2020 and beyond.","Irene Haas - Imperial Capital LLC","Okay. May I have a follow up? Feels like the basin really kind of benefits larger well-organized producers kind of like EOG with scope and scale. So, are there any bolt-on that might make sense down the line for EOG, understanding that you guys are not into buying big companies?","David W. Trice - EOG Resources, Inc.","Yeah, again, I think I'd reiterate what Bill said earlier. I mean, we're certainly not interested in any of these expensive corporate-level acquisitions. We're always looking to add high-quality acreage at low cost. And so, if some bolt-on would make sense and it's low cost, then we would certainly look at it. But again, our focus is more on the exploration side, finding low cost, high-quality acreage.","Irene Haas - Imperial Capital LLC","Thank you.","Operator","The next question will come from Subash Chandra of Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead.","Subash Chandra - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Yeah, thanks. Good morning. I was hoping you guys could just comment on some public data that's out there. Just showing I guess in New Mexico the well results being sort of incrementally lower than in prior years. And if that's sort of a data integrity thing, or if there's something else going on and this is just an interim event.","Ezra Y. Yacob - EOG Resources, Inc.","Yeah, Subash. This is Ezra Yacob. With the results in the Delaware Basin there in the New Mexico portion, I'm not sure if I can speak directly to the state data that you're seeing, but what I will say is we're very pleased with the results that we're seeing out there. As I discussed earlier in the opening remarks, all of our well performance are actually outperforming their respective type curves for each of the plays that we're drilling.","And we've made a tremendous amount of progress this year. I think this quarter's early time 30-day results are actually the highest of the year this year. And part of that is those quarter-over-quarter numbers will move around a little bit, just depending on which package of wells you're bringing on from which part of the basin.","But, really, I think, in general, our team out there has done a great job integrating the data from some of our packages that we've been drilling early in the year, making some adjustments to the spacing and targeting, as well as on the completion side and really increasing the well productivity of those wells, and I think that's showing up a little bit here in this last quarter.","In addition to that, as Billy highlighted, we're making pretty good gains on our operational efficiency, which is translating into lower well costs. And so, when you combine those two things together, we're seeing a decrease in our finding and development costs in the plays which are resulting in better returns and a higher capital efficiency, which is what our goal is for that basin.","Subash Chandra - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Yeah, thanks, Ezra. State data can be a dangerous thing. That's why I thought I'd ask. The second question is just in the Eastern Anadarko. If this next batch of wells was the very similar sort of high rate artificial lift. And if so, would this open up maybe some other plays for you that are not as in the geo-pressured areas as you typically prefer?","William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.","Could we get the first part of your question? We didn't quite understand the first sentence.","Subash Chandra - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Yeah. Sure, sure. My understanding is, at least in East Anadarko, is that the wells are brought on with very high rate gas lift. And I could be wrong there. So just curious if that's the situation or not. And if it is, if there's other plays better in less geo-pressured areas that you can apply a similar artificial lift on the front end to open the plays up.","David W. Trice - EOG Resources, Inc.","Yeah, this is David Trice. Yes, in Anadarko Basin we do use gas lift there. We bring those wells on initially with gas lift, and really throughout the life of the well. We use gas lift really throughout the company. So that's nothing new for us. In the Eastern Anadarko, we do it a little bit different than we do in other areas, but basically, it's the same around the company. And it's a very low-cost method that we use and we get a very good return and LOE on that.","Subash Chandra - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Got it. Thank you for the clarification.","Operator","The next question will come from Paul Sankey of Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead. And we'll move on to the next question. The next question will come from Jeffrey Campbell of Tuohy Brothers Investment Research. Please go ahead.","Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Good morning, and congratulations on the quarter. I wanted to just quickly return to this discussion of the premium locations and just ask is it fair to think that even though they're all great, some of the locations are better than others? Or maybe to put it another way, since all the premium locations have high potential for outperforming, what informs the choice to develop some of them now and wait on others for later?","William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.","Yes, all the premium locations are quite outstanding. They're quite different, I believe, than the average well that the industry's drilling. So they're at a very high, elevated level. And, of course, it's a huge inventory. It's 9,500 locations and some of them are much better than others. And as we continue to add to that premium inventory, our goal is to bring the quality of the inventory up, just like we'd drill, build the quantity of the inventory.","And so we do develop all of it. And we believe that every well in the inventory and every play in that inventory has got continuous room for improvement going forward. And so we develop the plays based on returns, and the allocation of the capital in the company is strictly based on returns. And so we drill the highest rate of return wells we have and rank them in the company every year. And we develop them on a play basis. And the pace of learning in the company, because of the information technology and the culture in the company, continues to increase.","Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Okay. Well, that was very helpful. I appreciate that. I'll ask a more narrow question for my follow-up. I noticed on the call you mentioned there's going be a spacing test of the Mowry and the Niobrara together. And so I'm just wondering, since the Turner wasn't mentioned, does that imply that the Turner sweet spots are discrete from the premium Mowry and Niobrara locations?","David W. Trice - EOG Resources, Inc.","Yeah, Jeff. This is David again. On the Turner, we feel like we understand that play a lot better. We've been drilling the Turner for years and we've done various tests over the years, and so we have a good handle already on what the spacing should be in the Turner. Just the fact that the Mowry and the Niobrara are new, we're going to go ahead and do some spacing test there, similar to what we did in the Woodford. And so, we're planning to do those. Those are two separate tests and we're going to do those at 660-foot spacing.","Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thanks for that clarification. I appreciate it.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude our question-and-answer session. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Thomas.","William R.

For investors who are focus on non-GAAP net income to eliminate mark-to-market impacts and certain nonrecurring items as outlined in the press release, EOG's fourth quarter 2013 adjusted net income was $548 million or $2 per share.","For the full year 2013, EOG reported net income of $2.2 billion or $8.04 per share and adjusted basis full year net income was $2.25 billion or $8.22 per share. For investors who follow the practice of focusing on non-GAAP discretionary cash flow, EOG's discretionary cash flow for the fourth quarter was $1.9 billion. Using the same methodology for the full year 2013, EOG's discretionary cash flow was $7.4 billion.","For the full year 2013, EOG's net cash provided by operating activities exceeded financing investing cash outflows. At December 31, 2013 debt to total cap was 28%. Net debt was reduced by $841 million during 2013, resulting in an ending net debt to total cap ratio of 23%, down from 29% at year-end 2012.","I will now turn it over to Bill Thomas to discuss operations.","Bill Thomas","Thanks, Tim. 2013 was EOG's best year on record Over the course of 2013, EOG increased crude oil production growth targets three times and ended the year with total company oil production up 40% over 2012. This is a 44% average increase over the last three years. Our key assets the Eagle Ford, Bakken and Leonard keep getting better and we continue to improve well productivities from these plays.","The 42% increase in U.S. oil production last year is solid proof of the depth of EOG's drilling inventory. For the year NGL production increased 17% while natural gas production decreased 11% for a total company production growth of 9%. EOG cost structure is a focus area and for the fourth quarter and full year unit costs were lower than expected.","The combination of increased growth from high margin oil with the decreasing cost structure flowed through our income statement and balance sheet, further deleveraging the company and generating a 16% ROE for the year, a big increase from 12% for 2012. We updated the ROE and ROCE charts in our IR presentation on pages 14 and 15 showing our improving metrics and a comparison of our results to our peers.","While I discuss 2014 business plan in greater detail later on in this call, EOG is targeting 27% oil production growth in 2014. Given the strength of our balance sheet and the depth of our high margin domestic crude oil drilling inventory, we have increased CapEx levels over 2013 to accelerate drilling of the high rate return oil inventory. Last year, we added two new locations for every one well we drilled. With this strong operational momentum in our key areas of activity, we plan to keep it going.","The biggest driver of EOG's outstanding crude oil growth during 2013 is the topic of one of today's biggest new items is Eagle Ford. For the third time since EOG discovered oil in the play in 2010, we have increased the net reserve potential. We now estimate EOG's total net reserve potential on our acreage to be 3.2 billion barrels of oil equivalent. That's a 45% increase from the previous 2.2 billion barrels of oil equivalent estimate.","This is a great example of the value of EOG's exploration focus and organic growth strategy by being first mover in capturing the best assets, we are able to grow them to the drill bit and improve them over time with in-house ingenuity and well completions. Our wells across the Eagle Ford continue to exceed our expectations. The Eagle Ford will again be our biggest oil growth driver and our highest of rate return asset in 2014.","Last year, our Eagle Ford drilling program focused primarily on two aspects, number one, improving well productivity in the West. Prior to 2013, we had drilled very few wells on that portion of our acreage. Suffice it to say, our successful drilling program in the West was big part of EOGs growth in the Eagle Ford, and the continued high rate of return activity we recorded in the play last year.","During the fourth quarter, the average IP rate of wells in the West exceeded the average IP rate of wells in the East. On a go-forward basis, we will talk about one Eagle Ford oil play as both, the East and Western areas are contributing more or less proportionally to the remaining reserve potential.","Number two, improving reserve recovery and maximizing NPV, our goal was to determine the optimum well spacing while increasing well productivity and decreasing well cost. We will continue to work on these two goals.","What we concluded was, first, our downspacing efforts proved even more successful than we have previously thought. While the optimum distance between wells will vary across the field depending on various geologic considerations, on average, the wells will be drilled on 40 acre spacing.","Second, as a result, we have approximately 7,200 net locations, taking into account 1,200 net wells drilled to-date, we have 6,000 net wells remaining. This represents a 12-year drilling inventory at our current activity level.","Third, based on our improvements in completions, we increased by 12% the net recoverable reserve per well, up from our previous 400 Mboe net per well to 450 in Mboe net per well. Multiplying 7,200 net wells by 450 in Mboe brings our total net potential recoverable reserves for the Eagle Ford at 3.2 billion barrels of oil equivalent with four years of production history from our early wells and database of over 1,200 EOG wells, we are confident in the long-term performance and potential reserve estimate of the Eagle Ford.","Overall performance from the field continues to surpass our expectations. In addition, we reached an efficient manufacturing mode in Eagle Ford. While we still have further efficiencies and cost reduction goals, we have now reached the point of optimal drilling completion and operational logistics in the play. This year, we plan to allocate a larger percentage of EOG's 2014 drilling CapEx budget to the Eagle Ford and drill 520 net wells, up from 466 net wells in 2013. We currently have 26 rigs operating in the play.","In summary, EOGs Eagle Ford asset continues to be the largest and most economic horizontal crude oil plays in North America and it's getting better. We simultaneously increased the EURs, reduced cost, and through downspacing, identified an additional 1,600 net drilling locations. Although we are increasing the well count this year, we still have 12 years of very highly economic crude oil drilling inventory in this single play.","Now, I will turn it over to Billy to discuss the Bakken, Permian, Trinidad end reserves.","Billy Helms","Thank you, Bill. During 2013, we made significant progress with our Bakken and Three Forks completions that dramatically improved well productivity and individual EURs. These enhancements and the ongoing implementation of cost saving measures, including the use of EOG sand, have turned what was once a mature producing area into a higher rate of return oil growth assets.","We continue to see plenty of opportunity on our Bakken core acreage by bringing the latest technology to this area that was initially sparsely drilled over five years ago. Recent core wells are the Wayzetta 30-3230H and 31-3230H which began production at 2,510 and 2,540 barrels of oil per day respectively. We have 59% working interest in these wells.","The Wayzetta 35-1920H had an initial production rate of 2,240 barrels of oil per day with 1.2 million cubic feet a day of rich natural gas. We have 60% working interest in this Mountrail County well. Using the same improved completion techniques in our Antelope Extension area, we are seeing similar enhanced IP rates and EURs. The Hawkeye 2-2501H had an initial production rate of 2,075 barrels of oil per day with 3.8 million cubic feet a day of rich natural gas. We have 80% working interest in this well.","In 2014, we expect to again grow crude oil production. Our drilling efforts will be localized in these same two areas, the Bakken Core and Antelope Extension, with the majority of activity in the core. We will continue to downspace in both areas and plan to operate a six rig drilling program. We have existing oil and pipeline infrastructure within the core and with the integration of EOG Sand into our Bakken operations, we will continue our focus on reducing well cost even further, while enhancing the productivity and recovery factor of the field. We plan to drill 80 net wells this year compared to 54 last year.","EOG's total drilling CapEx budget in Permian will be essentially flat in 2014 from 2013. The majority of the Permian drilling dollars however will shift from the Midland Basin to our to higher return plays in the Delaware Basin, the Leonard and Wolfcamp. The largest increase in activity will be the Leonard play where recent wells have had excellent rates of return and we are continuing to make progress on our technical understanding of this outstanding play. The Leonard is EOG's third best play in terms of rate of return. To date, we drilled in A and B zones and have identified additional pay zones in our 73,000 acre net acre position.","During 2014 we plan to develop the A zone with 8 to 10 wells per section. This base development program in a single zone will drive volume growth for the Leonard. We have exploration opportunities in other zones on our Leonard acreage and are testing multiple targets in spacing patterns, both between wells and also between runs. Three recent Leonard wells in Lea County, New Mexico came online with very strong oil production. The Vaca 24 Fed Com #5H began production last month at 1,520 barrels of oil per day with 265 barrels per day of NGLs and 1.5 million cubic feet a day of natural gas. The Vaca 24 Fed Com #6H had an IP rate of 1,380 barrels oil per day with 170 barrels per day of NGLs and 935 MCF per day of natural gas. We have 89% working interest in these wells. We plan a much more active year in the Leonard with 40 net wells compared to 17 last year.","In the Delaware Basin Wolfcamp, we are gathering microseismic from several wells to further define optimal development for this multi-pay shale play. During 2014 we plan to test number of spacing patterns across various zones with the goal of maximizing recovery and determining the impact of any communication between wells. We also plan more active year in this play with 14 net wells.","In Trinidad, we expect to be as crude contract takes for full-year, we have a development drilling program planned for the second half of the year to maintain stable production in the years following 2014.","I will now address reserve replacement and finding cost. In total, we replaced 264% of production from all sources at a $13.42 per BOE all-in total finding cost. Proved developed reserves increased 19% and net proved oil reserves increased 28%. For the 26th consecutive year, DeGolyer and MacNaughton given independent engineering analysis of our reserves and their estimate was within 5% of our internal estimate. Their analysis covered about 82% of our proved reserves this year. Please see the schedules accompanying the earnings press release for the calculation of reserve replacement and finding cost.","I will now turn it back over to Bill.","Bill Thomas","Thanks, Billy. Regarding new plays, we have been saying for some time now that we haven't lost our focus on looking for new domestic liquids plays, primarily oil. In addition to increasing the recovery on our existing plays, we continue to look for new prospects and test new ideas.","In our midstream operations, we are working with our partner rail companies. We have a strong emphasis on safety and our crude-by-rail operations. On our crude-by-rail our crude-by-rail continues to give us flexibility to access markets with premium process and plays a role in the ultimate destination of EOG produced crude.","To summarize our operations, EOG has captured the best horizontal oil acreage in North America, and our high performance operational teams continued to execute superbly. Our wells are still getting better, unit cost continue to decrease and oil production continues to increase at peer leading growth rates.","EOG has a long life inventory of crude oil and liquids rich drilling prospects with high after tax rates returns. We continue to focus on delivering high margin oil growth, increasing recoverable reserves and existing assets and generating new plays to ensure that EOG remains best-in-class through 2017 and beyond.","I will now turn it over to Tim Driggers to discuss financials and capital structure.","Tim Driggers","Thanks, Bill. Capitalized interest for the quarter was $15 million. For the fourth quarter 2013, total exploration and development expenditures were $1.6 billion, excluding acquisitions and asset retirement obligations. In addition, expenditures for gathering systems, processing plants and other property, plant and equipment were $93 million. There were $28 million of acquisitions during the quarter.","For the full year 2013, capitalized interest was $49 million. For the full year, total expiration and development expenditures were $6.7 billion, excluding acquisitions and asset retirement obligation. In addition, expenditures for gathering systems, processing plants and other property, plant and equipment were $364 million.","For the full year, total capital expenditures for all categories were $7.1 billion, excluding acquisitions. We ended the year below our guidance. Total acquisitions for the year were $120 million.","During the quarter, net cash provided by operating activities exceeded financing and investing cash outflows. We paid off $400 million bonds that matured in October. For the year, total proceeds from asset sales were $761 million compared to the goal of $550 million.","The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 37% and the deferred tax ratio was 64%. We announced a dividend increase of 33% and at 2:1 stock split in yesterday's earnings release. The dividend increase is the largest year-over-year dollars increase in EOG's history.","Yesterday, we included a guidance table with earnings press release for the first quarter and full year 2014. Our CapEx estimate for the full year is $8.1 billion to $8.3 billion excluding acquisitions.","The expiration and development portion, excluding facilities, will account for 80% of the total CapEx budget. The largest increase in spending will come from drilling activity, primarily in the Eagle Ford and Bakken.","For the first quarter and full year, the effective tax rate is estimated to be 35% to 40%. We have also provided an estimated range of the dollar amount of current taxes that we expect to record during the first quarter and for the full year 2014.","In terms of crude oil hedges, for March 2014, we have 181,000 barrels per day hedged at $96.55. For April 1 through June 30, 2014, we have an average of the 168,000 barrels per day hedged at $96.48. For the second half of 2014, we had 64,000 barrels per day hedged at $95.18.","We have a number of contracts outstanding that could be put to us at various terms. For the period of April 1 through December 31, 2014, we have 10,000 barrels per day of options that could be put to us at approximately $96.60 on or about March 31, 2014, if it is advantageous for the counterparty to do so. For June 1 through August 31, 2014, we had 10,000 barrels per day of options that could be put to us at approximately $100 on or about May 30 2014. For the second half of 2014, we have 118,000 barrels per day of options that could be put to us at approximately $96.64 on or about June 30, 2014. For the first half of 2015, we have 69,000 barrels per day of options that could be put to us at approximately $95.20 on or about December 31, 2014.","For natural gas, we have 330,000 MMBtu per day hedged at $4.55 per MMBtu for the period March 1 through December 31, 2014, excluding unexercised options. For January 1 through December 31, 2015 we have 175,000 MMBtu per day hedged at $4.51 excluding unexercised options.","We also have a number of natural gas contracts that could be put to us at various terms. If counterparties exercise all such options, the notional volume of EOG's existing natural gas derivative contracts will increase by 480,000 MMBtu per day at an average price of $4.63 per MMBtu for each month for the period March 1 through December 31, 2014. For 2015, if counterparties exercise all such options, the notional volume of EOG's existing natural gas derivative contracts will increase by 175,000 MMBtu per day at an average price of $4.51 per MMBtu for each month during the period January 1 through December 31, 2015.","Now I will turn it back over to Bill.","Bill Thomas","Thanks, Tim. Now I will provide our views regarding the macro environment and 2014 operations activity. Regarding oil, we are still waiting for the final 2013 EIA U.S. oil production data, but it looks like the rate of growth in 2013 slowed compared to 2012 and we expect this trend to continue in subsequent years. The October and November EIA monthly data indicates the rate of annualized production growth was approximately 760,000 barrels per day compared to 1.04 million barrels per day for the same period in 2012. We are still bullish regarding U.S. oil process because of slowing domestic oil growth and we are not particularly concerned about a surplus of U.S. light sweet oil.","Regarding North American natural gas prices, our long-term view hasn't changed. We have obviously seen some relief this year due to the multiple shifts in the polar vortex this winter. We think natural gas prices will stay around the $4.50 level in 2014 and '15. On the plus side, we have taken advantage of some the recent prospects to layer in hedges.","For our 2014 business plan, it is as follows. We plan to focus on high rate of return domestic crude oil growth. We are targeting 27% oil production growth this year and 11.5% total company growth. We have increased our CapEx budgets from last year because we have so many high rate of return opportunities to pursue. The greatest increases are in our highest return plays, the Eagle Ford and Bakken. The amount of CapEx dollars allocated to midstream infrastructure is also increasing. This year we plan to spend approximately 10% of our total CapEx budget on these types of projects to lay the foundation for future growth and to manage operational costs.","Also for the sixth year in a row, we are not growing EOG's North American natural gas production. This is reflective of our view of the low return on natural gas investments. We won't drill any dry gas wells in North America during 2014, because we don't see a change in the gas oversupplied picture until the 2017-2018 timeframe.","I want to leave you with some important summary points. First, 2013 was an excellent year for EOG, particularly in our three key plays, the Eagle Ford Bakken and Leonard.","In the Eagle Ford, we moved beyond an assembly line of operation to a high precision manufacturing mode of delivering top quality individual wells.","In the Bakken, we created a technical renaissance not only for EOG, but also for the industry. We changed our completion techniques and improved the well productivity.","In the Permian Basin, we are shifting activity to the Leonard, where we made exceptionally good wells during the second half of 2013. Our Leonard is our highest rate of return asset in the basin.","Second, in terms of capital discipline, we boosted our financial returns in 2013, while deleveraging the balance sheet. We generated strong ROE and ROCE numbers last year, 6% and 12%, respectively. We think this is a discriminator in a sector not recognized for financial returns. Additionally, we raised the dividend for the 15th time in 15 years.","Third, EOG has captured the best horizontal acreage in North America and our higher performance operational teams continued to execute superbly. In March 2013, EOG became the largest producer of crude oil in the state of Texas and we continue to maintain that position.","Today, according to HIS, EOG has become the largest onshore crude oil producer in the U.S. Lower 48. With our large, high-quality drilling inventory, we expect EOG to be one of the largest crude oil producers in the U.S. by 2017.","Fourth, we ended 2013 with a strong balance sheet posted, peer-leading oil growth rates and increased our high margin oil opportunities set to drill bit. Finally, the increased budget and increased dividend rate are a function of EOGs confidence in our long-term business plan. It's the same business plan we have always had, capture the best assets grow organically and focus on returns.","Thanks for listening. Now we will go to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) We will go first to Leo Mariani with RBC.","Leo Mariani - RBC","Hey, guys. Can you talk a little bit more about the Eagle Ford in terms of some of the downspacing initiatives, I guess, you talked about in average of 40-acre spacing across your position here. Would you expect to see some interference at that level and is it possible for you guys to quantify that at all?","Bill Thomas","Yes. Thanks, Leo. That's a good question. The downspacing that we have done across the field we found that has been the spacing is very variable, due to different geology, different faulting situations at this different things across the field that we have to deal with.","Some places, you know, we can drill wells as close to maybe 30 acres to 35 acres per well and in some places it's more like 50 to 60 and 65 acres per well, so it is quite highly variable.","The number of wells that we have, again, were 7,200 total wells are based on actual well locations that we have put on the map in regard to the geology, the individual geology at each unit and the configuration of the leases, so these are not spreadsheet numbers.","As far as the interference between wells, there is some interference in some areas and in some places there are not interference, so again it's really highly variable and that we have been able to overcome the interference and increase the well EURs with our frac technology. So the frac technology has definitely enhanced the productivity of the wells and it has enhanced the EUR per well. So we have quite a bit of confidence that the average EUR for the 7,200 wells we have is 450 MBOE per well.","Leo Mariani - RBC","Okay. That's really helpful. I guess, just jumping over to your thoughts on oil marketing. I guess there is some concern out there among investors that too much oil is coming through the Gulf Coast over the next couple of years. Can you talk at all about your optionality in terms of moving oil going around? Are you guys able to access East and West Coast markets as well with your oil?","Billy Helms","Yes, Leo. Our crude by rail system gives us a lot of flexibility and we believe that will come in to play as we go forward. We have established markets in the East and West Coast but really our prime markets still remain on the Gulf Coast or LLS prices and an increasing WTI prices. So as we have seen, just really over the last few months, there's been some variances in the differentials between WTI and LLS prices and we have been able to take advantage of that, and we have been switching back and forth. So again our crude by rail system gives us a lot of flexibility to get our oil to the highest priced markets.","Leo Mariani - RBC","Okay. That's really helpful. Thanks, guys.","Operator","We will go next to Doug Leggate of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Bill, I wondered if I could go back to the 460 EUR average. I am not sure how to ask the question eloquently. So I will stumble through probably. But what I am trying to understand is that's obviously an average and I am guessing there is some variability across the play. So what I am trying to get is, where are you concentrating the drilling inventory in the first part of the 12 years backlog you have got. In other words are you drilling better wells first on average or the lesser wells will be later on in the program? And if so, how should we think about your medium-term growth outlook? Then I have got a follow-up, please.","Bill Helm","Yes, Doug. That's a very good question. Our drilling is very well equally spaced and really as we look forward, we need to be thinking about the Eagle Ford as one play, because the Western wells and the Eastern wells are relatively same in the average EUR per well and there is a little bit of variability but there is really not much difference across the whole play. So whether we drill in the West or we drill in the East, our well results we believe will be very consistent going forward and that is certainly not front-end loaded with the best wells in the East and then later on we won't drill wells down the road. So I think you can look at the 12 year inventory we have is very strong and very consistent and we will have good results every year because of that.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, that's very clear. Thanks for that. Then my follow-up is really on the midstream spending. I know you guys have said often the drilling consideration short-term, at least, to maybe do something structurally, by way of an MLP or something like that, but given the scale of your standing, I just wondered if I could ask you to frame your latest thoughts on that, has it even changed and if not, why is that not a thought that EOG would be interested in? And I will leave it at that. Thanks.","Bill Thomas","Yes, Doug. On midstream, we are very, very selective on how we spend our midstream dollars and the midstream dollars we have allocated this year and particularly have given us a very strong rate of return and are really focused on getting our oil to the market and decreasing our future operational cost and transportation costs. We are not at all interested in working on forming new MLP companies or making the company very complicated. We want to keep the company financially and structurally simple as we go forward. So it is easy to understand. And so our midstream is really just to enhance EOG's acreage positions and getting our products to market and keeping our cost low as we go forward","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I guess if I may, why then wouldn't you include the midstream cost when you look at your well economics?","Bill Thomas","Well, I mean, certainly the midstream costs are part of the whole picture, but really we are really focused on getting the wells drilled and getting the direct return of those the wells at a maximum and we are focused on that. Then we are always looking at the whole picture EOG has a lot of scale and were able to midstream dollars down to a minimum when we have a scale. We are really focused on the company on returns and increasing our ROE and ROEC numbers, so midstream really helps us do that.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Appreciate the answers though. Thank you very much.","Operator","We will go next to Charles Meade with Johnson Rice.","Charles Meade - Johnson Rice","Yes. Good morning, everyone. If I could go back to the Eagle Ford spacing question, particularly the average being 40 acres and some other operators in the play are testing - they haven't confirmed - they are testing just down to 175 feet which would get you close to about 20 acre spacing, so I am wondering can you share what the close offset you guys maybe have planned '14 and what supposedly you have done today?","Bill Thomas","Yes, Charles. I think we have done some in the 300-foot range and that's 200-foot maybe down to 200 feet. Again, we push them pretty close together and the goal of course is to always to maximize the NPV of the acreage. As you push them too close together, you could start destroying the value, so these pilot programs that we put in and tested have given us a pretty solid understanding of the interference between wells and the spacing between wells in terms distance between wells, so we feel pretty solid at this point that on an average 40 acres is probably the optimal spacing pattern.","Charles Meade - Johnson Rice","Got it. Thanks for that detail, Bill. Shifting over to the Permian your slides are very hopeful. It's obvious you look - cut by the Leonard play is a more attractive than the Wolfcamp play, because you are pretty classy there but, but I am wondering if your 2014 plans for the Wolfcamp, you might be able to go North and East from Reeves to perhaps in Worden, I think where you have seen higher oil cuts in that Wolfcamp play and if that's an option for you it is part of your 2014 plans.","Bill Thomas","Yes. For the Delaware, Wolfcamp our acreage is located kind of central Reeves and we do have some acreage up to the North and to the East in the northern part of Loving County and then in the Lea County that we believe are prospective for the Delaware Wolfcamp.","Your correct it does get a bit oilier as you move that way, so into in 2014 we are really probably just focused on the Central Reeves County area. Then will be testing additional the Wolfcamp potential maybe later in the year in 2014 and in the 2015 as we go forward, but we are trying to work the play technically and increase the oil percentages as we go forward.","Charles Meade - Johnson Rice","Great. Thanks. We will stay tuned on that.","Operator","We will take our next question from Matt Portillo with TPH.","Matt Portillo - TPH","Good morning. Just two quick questions for me, I was wondering if you can give an update to your Bakken downspacing test and how you I think about the upside to your inventory depths. Then I have a quick follow-up after that.","Bill Thomas","Yes, Matt. On our Bakken, we are continuing with 160 acre downspacing and we are studying very intensely the possible interference between the new wells in the existing older wells.","Obviously the new wells had come in extremely good. We are very pleased with the results so far in our downspacing efforts and we will give some guidance on what all this means later down the road.","We haven't given any time commitment on that. We really want to make sure that we technically understand where we are going and what this really means to recovery for our acreage.","Matt Portillo - TPH","Great, and then just a quick follow-up in regards to your out Midland Basin Wolfcamp position. You have a nice footprint there, although the asset looks like it doesn't compete on a rate of return basis within the portfolio today. How do you guys think about that asset from a long-term perspective in terms of it s strategic nature in your portfolio?","Bill Thomas","Yes, we want to certainly hold on to it. We are making some progress there in the Midland Basin. Our long-term view is that we can continue to improve the results there, establish the right spacing patterns and continue to reduce costs and also increase the well productivity and really focus on increasing the rate of return there. So we are going to leave it in the portfolio right now and see if we can get it up to the point where it can make its way back into our high return inventory.","Matt Portillo - TPH","Thank you.","Operator","We will go next to Amir Arif with Stifel.","Amir Arif - Stifel","Thanks. Good morning, guys. First question really on the Leonard Wolfcamp. I know its early days there but I was just curious where do you think the 2% to 3% recovery factor that you are putting out there could go to as you better touch the downspacing and the timing around testing the downspacing to get a comfort on resources?","Bill Thomas","Yes, Amir. On our Leonard play, we are still doing some testing there, as you can imagine, on spacing and testing different target zones to really understand what the productivity in the long-term performance is going to be. We obviously are seeing improvements in that. So we are optimistic of what we might see on improvements in recovery factor but we still haven't quantified that yet. That's still a work in progress. So we will provide more data on that once we have it fully evaluated.","Amir Arif - Stifel","Yes. Just a follow-up question on that CapEx, the $900 million for facilities. Can you give us some more color in terms of what type of facilities and where that CapEx is going?","Bill Thomas","Yes. So two thirds of that is going to be in the Eagle Ford and that on lease facilities with us drilling more wells this year and we are going ahead and putting it in our oil and gas gathering lines. Put the new oil on pipeline. It saves us quite a lot on our transportation. Then we are putting it in an oil storage and pipeline facility there for the West. Gas processing facilities, SWD systems, water reuse facilities and that also includes artificial lift. We are putting that on quite a number of wells this year. So all that is just to reduce transportation, our LOE, realize higher prices, all long-term benefits for earnings.","Amir Arif - Stifel","Thank you.","Operator","We will take our next question from Joe Allman with JPMorgan.","Joe Allman - JPMorgan","Thank you. Good morning, everybody.","Bill Thomas","Good morning.","Joe Allman - JPMorgan","Hi, Bill. In terms of the increase in the Eagle Ford EUR and resource, what drove your decision to increase the EUR per well in that resource at this time? And then, what could make that EUR or the total reserves go up in the future?","Bill Thomas","Yes, Joe. The EUR per well increase was certainly up a lot of strong historical data. We have over 1,200 producing wells in the play right now. And then, we have done extensive pilot testing on each one of these downspacing patterns and through our completion technology, we have seen dramatic increases in initial rates per well and then the shape of the decline curve really has not changed. It's relatively the same shape. It's just that the well's initial rates have improved over time with better their completions. So that gives a better total EUR. When you have long-term production, you have enough data, like we do to establish and have a lot of confidence in that. So we have got a lot of confidence in that and as we go forward, we are hopeful that we will be able to continue to improve the well productivity but we certainly have not proven that yet, but we are going to obviously continue to work the technology. We are never going to give up and we are never going quit trying new ideas or new things. So we are in that process right now. We will just see how time will tell .As we go forward, we will see how it all turns out.","Joe Allman - JPMorgan","Great. Thanks for that. And then, on your gas production forecast for 2014, you are now looking at a decline in gas production, a short time ago you were actually looking over the next few years for a flat to modestly up profile for natural gas, so what changed in terms of your forecast for natural gas?","Bill Thomas","Yes. Joe, we look at our drilling portfolio and we have continued to shift money to the higher return plays, so one of the things we have been reducing is some of our combo plays, so we continue to reduce dollars from the combo plays which are more gassy, because of just a bit lower return than our high return oil plays, so that's really the shift that we have seen in the gas profile.","Joe Allman - JPMorgan","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","We will go next to Pearce Hammond with Simmons & Company.","Pearce Hammond - Simmons & Company","Yes. Bill, some other operators in Eagle Ford you talked about, the upper and lower Eagle Ford intervals being distinct zones within the play. Are you seeing the same trend cross some of your acreage?","Bill Thomas","Yes, Pearce. We do have that we have recognized that on a decent portion of our acreage and that's certainly an option that were looking at an exploring and may do some testing on that as we go forward to see if the upper part of Eagle Ford specifically has not been affected and contacted with the existing frac technology that we are using, so we have got that in mind and we are going to be working on that.","Pearce Hammond - Simmons & Company","Great. Then my follow-up Bill, in Slide 31 of your presentation, you highlight your gas acreage. While I know right now you are focusing on oil because of the better rates of return, if you were to turn your attention to gas, which of these areas would receive EOGs primary attention?","Bill Thomas","The best acreage we have are in really probably some of the more combo-ish acreage. The Haynesville combo play is a really strong rate of return play for us. Also the highest quality dry gas that we have is certainly would be in Bradford County in Marcellus.","Then we drill a few selective wells in South Texas in the Frio and Vicksburg area. There are good wet gas and combo and also very high rate wells and give us high rate of return, so those are three areas that probably will be high on the list.","Pearce Hammond - Simmons & Company","Thank you Bill.","Operator","We will go next to Bob Brackett with Bernstein.","Bob Brackett - Bernstein","Hi. I will do a follow-up. You mentioned Frio Vicksburg wet gas wells. Are those conventional-type sand targets or there are any sort of shale plays you are chasing down there?","Bill Thomas","Yes, Bob. Those are really conventional plays. They are the typical Gulf Coast.","Bob Brackett - Bernstein","[Nanodarcy].","Bill Thomas","Yes. I would say they are mostly nanodarcy top reservoirs and so they are very high rate very, very specific prospects, not regional prospects. They are very specific.","Bob Brackett - Bernstein","Yes. Then following your language of captured the best asset is one of your strategic goals. Can you give us some flavor of what you might be doing this year, next year against bad objectives?","Bill Thomas","Yes, Bob. We have a nice working list of new prospect potential that we are working all the time and we are very, very focused of course right now on the oily-type plays and we are focused on only on plays that would be additive to our portfolio, so our portfolio is such a high return for portfolio that for a new play that work itself into our system, we are targeting only plays that we think that could generate after-tax rates of return greater than 50%, so we are being very selective on that.","We have a nice list working, so we are taking her time to test those and to evaluate those to make sure that they are the kind of quality plays that we want to invest money in as we go forward, but we are confident that EOG is going to continue to be a leader in generating new plays as we go forward, so that will be certainly a nice part of additional resource potential for the company as we go forward.","Bob Brackett - Bernstein","Thanks.","Operator","We will go next to Joe Magner with Macquarie.","Joe Magner - Macquarie","Good morning. With all the updates provided on the Eagle Ford, I noticed that references to specific recovery factors weren't in the presentation any more. I was just curious with what you are seeing and understanding how the reservoir now, are there any changes to your access of original oil plays and\/or those recovery rates?","Billy Helms","Yes, Joe. That's a very good question. The recovery factor is a work in progress and we are certainly not seeing any decrease of any oil in plays. We are learning about these resource reservoirs. We are learning more all the time. Of course there is no textbook on them. So we are trying to get a better understanding of that as we go forward and as we learn more about that, we will be able to update you with a bit more stronger technical information.","Joe Magner - Macquarie","Okay, and then, I guess, just to circle back on the spacing and the prospectivity of your Eagle Ford oil acreage. The final plot of 40 acres to that entire position, it seems like there would be more locations than what you have provided. Just curious how you are thinking about risking and the delineation of that acreage position and if there is more work to be done over time? Just wanted to make sure I got that discussions right in my mind.","Billy Helms","Yes, Joe. The 7,200 locations that we have announced or talked about are actual sticks on the map. So they are very specific locations, not a spreadsheet calculation at all and those are all very firm locations. As we look at our acreage, there are other areas of our acreage that could be prospective and those areas, at this moment, we feel like fall below our rate return cut off. And although they would be productive, they are not weighed in our portfolio right now. So we have put a cutoff on rate of return, anything less than the 60% effect rate of return is not included in the 7,200 locations. So there could be additional upside. We are hopeful that we will be able to continue to reduce costs and improve well productivity in all the areas in a specific unit in the areas that are a bit more of return.","Joe Magner - Macquarie","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","We will take our next question from David Heikkinen with Heikkinen Energy Advisors.","David Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","Good morning. Just speculate your midstream CapEx this year. How much does the spending this year impact 2014 in your realize pricing in OpEx guidance? And then should we assume further efficiency gains in 2015?","Bill Thomas","Yes, but some of this effect 2014 certainly. When we talked about our gathering lines here and on lease and our artificial lift, but you are right, David, what we are doing here is going to have impact certainly beyond 2014. A portion of this share is midstream and also even our sand facilities because we are seeing that, yes as we drill new wells, we have a need for additional sand and we are just ensuring that we have a long-term, low cost sand available to EOG.","David Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","That was a perfect segue to my second question. So you saved $500,000 a well in Eagle Ford for using your own sand, roughly. As you take your sand to the Bakken this year and then the Permian next year, how much would you save per well using sand there, the EOG sand?","Bill Thomas","Yes. We think that we are going to be looking at the same sort of savings and we are working towards having us self-sourcing all of our sand for the Bakken. We are doing some of that now in the Permian. We believe we will be able to do that pretty well across the board for EOG.","David Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","Okay. Thanks. That was my two questions.","Operator","We will take our next question from Arun Jayaram with Credit Suisse.","Arun Jayaram - Credit Suisse","Good morning, Bill.","Bill Thomas","Hello, Arun.","Arun Jayaram - Credit Suisse","Bill, I just wanted to talk a little bit about the increase in the Eagle Ford resource. You added, I believe, 1,600 incremental well locations. Can you maybe quantify what drove that between downspacing versus opening up new parts of the plays you have done additional delineation drilling?","Bill Thomas","Yes. That's a good question. I am not saying the majority of it is really due to downspacing at this time, and that is and something we took great care and technically and use multiple downspacing pilot to determine these additional locations, so we found out certainly that it's very variable across the field, but the average is about 40-acre spacing between wells and that gives us the optimal net present value. We have a slide in the in the IR slides that show how that the net present value or per acre basis has increased over time as we downspaced and added additional potential, so it's a really good solid number but really most of the year increase is downspacing.","Arun Jayaram - Credit Suisse","Okay. Then Bill, as you shift towards '14 and '15, is the development plan now going to be just 16 wells per section? Is that how you plan to developing?","Bill Thomas","Well, it is variable across the field, so it's not a standard thing. It really varies from lease-to-lease, but certainly I think on an average 40 acres space is that we are proceeding ahead at this time and that looks like that will generate the best returns and the best NPV.","Arun Jayaram - Credit Suisse","Okay. My follow-up is just on the Leonard. I believe, you guys mentioned optimism to do 8 to 10 wells per in a interval? Could you just comment on some of your early appraisal something in the Leonard?","Bill Thomas","Yes. It's a good question. Saying it's still early is a good point, because we are still testing multiple spacing patterns there as well. We do believe eight is certainly a very achievable number. We are going to be testing 10 A zone and we are still have additional zones there to test as well, so we are very encouraged about what we are seeing in the Leonard play based on our latest results and so were optimistic that the spacing pattern will prove itself out here as we go forward.","Operator","This does conclude today's question and answer session. I would like to turn the call back to Bill Thomas for any additional or closing remarks.","Bill Thomas","I just want to thank everybody for joining the call this morning and we look forward to a great 2014. Thank you.","Operator","This does conclude today's conference.

At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I'd like to turn the call over to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of EOG Resources, Mr. Mark Papa. Please go ahead, sir.","Mark G. Papa","Good morning, and thanks for joining us. We hope everyone has seen the press release announcing first quarter 2012 earnings and operational results.","This conference call includes forward-looking statements. The risks associated with forward-looking statements have been outlined in the earnings release and EOG's SEC filings, and we incorporate those by reference for this call. This conference call also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation schedules for these non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures can be found on our website at www.eogresources.com.","The SEC permits oil and gas companies in their filings with the SEC to disclose not only proved reserves but also probable reserves, as well as possible reserves. Some of the reserve estimates on this conference call and webcast, including those for the Eagle Ford and Bakken, may include potential reserves or other estimated reserves not necessarily calculated in accordance with or contemplated by the SEC's latest reserve reporting guidelines. We incorporate by reference the cautionary note to U.S. investors that appears at the bottom of our press release in Investor Relations page of our website.","With me this morning are Bill Thomas, President; Gary Thomas, COO; Tim Driggers, Vice President and CFO; and Maire Baldwin, Vice President, Investor Relations. An updated IR presentation was posted to our website last night, and we included second quarter and full year 2012 guidance in yesterday's press release.","This morning, I'll discuss topics in the following order: I'll initially review our first quarter 2012 net income and discretionary cash flow, then I'll provide operational results and our 2012 business plan. Tim Driggers will then discuss financials and capital structure and I'll follow with our macro view and hedge position, and finish with concluding remarks.","As outlined in the press release, for the first quarter 2012, EOG reported net income of $324 million or $1.20 per diluted share. For investors who focus on non-GAAP net income, to eliminate mark-to-market impacts and certain nonrecurring items as outlined in the press release, EOG's first quarter 2012 adjusted net income was $317.5 million or $1.17 per diluted share. For investors who follow the practice of industry analysts who focus on non-GAAP discretionary cash flow, EOG's DCF for the first quarter was $1.3 billion.","I'll now address our operational results and key plays. During the first quarter, all 3 of our production categories exceeded the midpoint of our guidance. Our total crude and condensate production was up 49% year-over-year and total liquids were up 48% year-over-year. Additionally, the midpoint of our second quarter total crude and condensate guidance projects 42% year-over-year growth and 5% sequential growth. Our first quarter North American natural gas volumes declined 9% year-over-year, which is consistent with our projections.","Total company first quarter production from all sources was up 10% year-over-year. Our aggregate unit costs were in line with projections. For the full year 2012, we have increased our total company liquids growth target from 30% to 33%, consisting of 33% crude and condensate growth and 32% NGL growth. The higher liquids growth is a result of stronger Eagle Ford and Bakken production. This increases are our total company production growth target from the previous 5.5% to 7%. We have not changed our full year CapEx estimate.","As you know by now, we believe that total company production per debt adjusted share is a useless metric, given the current 42:1 oil to gas price ratio. EOG's focus is on year-over-year increases in EPS, EBITDAX and DCF, and our path to achieve this goal is strong crude oil growth. In the first quarter 2012, our year-over-year increase in GAAP EPS was 131%, non-GAAP EPS increased 72%, adjusted EBITDAX growth was 39% and DCF increased 39%. This is on top of the peer leading growth that we posted in these same metrics for the full year 2011 versus 2010 that I articulated on our year-end earnings call.","For the first quarter, 80% of our total company wellhead revenues emanated from liquids. In North America, 85% of wellhead revenues came from liquids. Of these liquids revenues, 87% are from crude and condensate and only 13% from NGLs.","This strong liquids revenue and volume growth is primarily generated by our 4 large horizontal domestic oil and liquids plays, which I'll now discuss starting with the Eagle Ford. The Eagle Ford continues to be our 800-pound gorilla in terms of crude oil growth, and we still believe our position is the largest domestic net oil discovery in 40 years and generates the highest direct ATROR of any current large hydrocarbon play. We continue to be largest crude oil producer in the play, with 77,000 Boe per day average net production for March, 90% of which was liquids. ","Our press release again contains multiple new well results with IPs for individual wells in the 2,000 to 3,000 barrel oil per day range. Note that these are oil IPs, and if we included NGLs and natural gas, the barrel oil equivalent per day rates would be even higher because our oil IPs are much higher than those reported by offset operators. I've received several investor questions asking whether we're testing our wells on wide open chokes to generate artificially high oil rates. The simple answer is no. These are flow tests into our normal production equipment with a normal choke in the wellhead. We think the high initial rates are simply indicative of better wells as attested by our 49% year-over-year organic crude oil and condensate growth rate.","I'll now discuss 6 key points regarding the Eagle Ford. First, last quarter, we advised you that 65 to 90 acre downspacing was successful, and we'd increased the potential net recoverable reserve estimate from 900 million to 1.6 billion Boes.","Now that we have an additional 90 days of production history, we're even more comfortable with these downspacing conclusions. We're now testing space or tighting -- tighter than the current 65 to 90 acres, i.e. 40 acres, to determine if further densifying will be viable to increase the recovery factor and we'll likely have some results by year end.","Second, we continue to see an improvement in well performance from recent wells compared to wells completed just a year ago. This is likely due to better fracs and better placement of our laterals. This is occurring across essentially all our acreage. We've certainly seen this in our more prolific acreage where a year ago, we were highlighting wells with 1,500 barrel oil per day IP rates. And today, in those same areas, the IPs are 2,500 to 3,000 barrels of oil per day. These 2,500 to 3,000 barrel oil per day rates are holding up and have averaged 30-day rates of 1,500 barrel oil per day. We're also making these type of improvements in areas with lesser quality rock.","With the success in downspacing, we have identified at least 3,200 additional locations to drill. Based on the 300 net wells we plan to drill this year, this gives us an 11-year inventory. The reason we're not accelerating the drilling of this unusually large well inventory is the technological improvements we're making. If we're making better wells than we were a year ago, who's to say we may not make even better wells a year from now? So why rush to drill wells that may not be technically optimum? We're closely focused on balancing the present value of this asset versus this technical well improvement. And you'll hear more about this in subsequent quarters.","We've reduced the number of drilling days per well due to learning curve efficiencies and now need fewer rigs to drill the targeted 300 wells. Relative to the first quarter, our Eagle Ford drilling activity will be less frenetic for the remainder of the year as we reduce our rig count from the current 26 to 23 rigs.","Third, I continue to be impressed with the consistency of this play across the trend. We don't get a lot of geologic or reservoir surprises, and the few surprises we do get are generally more upside than downside.","Fourth. Now that our Wisconsin sand plant is operational, we're currently using 100% self-sourced sand in this play and saving about $500,000 a well. Because our sand is cheaper, our engineers are experimenting with bigger fracs to see the effect on initial flow rate and long-term reserves.","Fifth. During the past year, I've highlighted the possibility of product takeaway restrictions, but so far, we've been able to dodge these bottleneck bullets. We expect Enterprise to commission their new oil pipeline and gas processing plant next month. So we think the go-forward risk of takeaway curtailments has been considerably reduced.","And sixth. In early 2013, we expect to commence a dry gas injection pilot to determine whether this enhanced oil recovery technique will improve our current estimated 6% recovery factor. We expect to have preliminary results in late 2013.","To summarize the Eagle Ford, it's given us a lot of upside surprises so far, and we'll continue to develop it at a technically optimal pace.","I'll now shift to the Bakken Three Forks. Each of our 2011 quarterly calls had a business-as-usual tone for our Bakken Three Forks asset, even though we continue to be the largest Bakken oil producer in North Dakota. However, we've recently generated exciting and very significant results in 3 different parts of the play, indicating we have more potential upside and growth opportunities than we've previously indicated. The 3 focus areas are: First, in the last quarter, we mentioned early success in our partial core area with 320-acre downspacing compared to our original 640-acre spacing. We recently drilled 3 additional 320-acre downspaced wells, and all are successful with IP rates ranging from 992 to 1,393 barrels of oil per day. Working interest in these wells vary from 51% to 61%.","Additionally, production from the offsetting original 640-acre wells has doubled after the downspaced won [ph] after completions. The typical 640 acre well that had been online 4 to 5 years was producing 100 to 200 barrels of oil per day before the downspaced well was drilled, and is currently making 200 to 400 barrels of oil per day. This gives us production gain from both the new infill wells and the older producing wells. Based on these results, we'll implement 320 acre downspacing throughout our core area, and we'll also test 160 acre downspacing.","In our Bakken Lite area, our original development plan was on 320 acres. And by next quarter, we'll have some 160 acre downspacing results.","In summary, the downspacing is working and the reserve impact will likely be larger than the 50 million net barrels of oil we indicated on the February call. ","Second, we continue to achieve excellent results in our Antelope Extension area, which is 25 miles southwest of our core area. Both the Bakken and Three Forks are productive in this acreage. We've recently drilled a group of Clarks Creek wells. 4 wells were drilled in the Three Forks formation and had IP rates of 926, 1,393, 1,455 and 3,415 barrels of oil per day, plus 1 million to 3 million per day of rich gas. A Bakken well we recently drilled in this same area had an IP rate of 2,300 barrels of oil per day with similarly associated rich gas. We have 100% working interest in all these wells. These results are better than we expected.","Third, in Far Eastern Montana and Western North Dakota in our Diamond Point and Stateline areas, we've recently completed 7 wells that IPed at rates between 540 and 1,100 barrels of oil per day. We have an average 63% working interest in this area. All 7 wells have high rock quality that we expected, and this opens up a brand new large development area for us where we have identified over 200 drilling locations.","Additionally, in late April, we commenced 2 waterflood pilots in our Core Parshall Field to try to improve our current approximately 8% recovery factor and we expect to have preliminary results by year-end 2012.","In summary, we're much more excited than we were a year ago about our remaining Bakken and Three Forks potential.","Moving to our Wolfcamp and Leonard plays. Our press release highlighted some individual well results, which are consistent with previous quarters. Because of the timing of our pattern drilling, we expect our 2012 production from these plays to be back-end loaded. We're still experimenting with the optimum well spacing, and expect we'll have more specific detail regarding these plays later in the year. The 2 most asked investor questions we've received regarding the Wolfcamp are, one, is more than one interval productive? And 2, why are EOG's indicated 280 Mboe per well NAR reserve estimate smaller than those quoted by offset operators? To-date, most of our success has been in the middle Wolfcamp interval, but we do have 2 positive results from the upper interval. Regarding per well reserves, in our February IR presentation, we used an example of a well with a low net revenue interest to EOG that was not comparable to peers who report gross reserves. On a gross 8 8 [ph] spaces, our typical Wolfcamp per well EUR is approximately 430 Mboe.","I'll also note that although university wells noted in the IR slide we posted last night, have lower initial production rates than in past quarters. That's because these wells tested against -- flowing against high line pressures. We consider that these wells are typical and have typical reserves to wells that we've reported in previous quarters, even though the IP rates are lower because of the higher back pressure.","Shifting to our Barnett Combo play. We continue to expect this to be our second largest liquids growth contributor in 2012, and we've highlighted typical wells in the press release. In the first quarter, we expanded the combo play with successful step out wells in 2 different directions. This play continues to slowly expand year after year. We plan to complete 200 net combo wells this year. And year-to-date well results are on track with expectations. I will note that we might have a possible gas processing pinch point in the June time frame. It will be touch and go for a month or so to see if we can add processing capacity quickly enough to handle our increasing rich gas volumes from this particular area.","In the Wyoming Powder River basin, we continue to have success with our horizontal drilling program in the Turner sandstone. Two recent wells are the Arbalest 59-3601H, which tested at 412 barrels of oil per day with 2.2 million cubic feet a day of rich gas. And the Arbalest 29-23H, which tested at 208 barrels of oil per day with 1.6 million cubic feet a day of rich gas. We have approximately 93% working interest in these wells.","We continue to be bullish regarding our 240,000 net acres in the Powder River basin. The basin has multiple stack pays similar to the Permian Basin, all of which contained oil rich gas. We've had great results in the Turner sands, and we'll be testing other zones in addition to the Turner before year end.","Regarding other North American oil plays, we recently completed a nice Niobrara well in Laramie County, Wyoming. The Jubilee 6904 [ph] well produced 460 barrels of oil per day. After a few weeks online, we have 100% working interest.","In the mid-continent, we continue to generate consistent results from our Marmaton and Cleveland plays. Four recent Marmaton wells IPed at 470 to 770 barrels of oil a day each. We have 61% to 94% working interest in these wells. Two nice 51% working interest Cleveland wells recently IPed at 490 and 560 barrels of oil per day.","We're also continuing to look for a new greenfield North American liquids plays. We have captured a number of these, but as you know, we only disclose these plays when they\u2019re proven successful and we have all the acreage tied up. This same disclosure strategy worked for us in the Eagle Ford, Bakken, Barnett Combo and Permian. It may frustrate investors on the front end because we don't hype unproved potential, but we think investors are happy with our actual order results at the end of the day. ","Recently, the trade press has highlighted an EOG transaction in the Tuscaloosa. We continue to have 0 interest in a JV in any of our Big 4 oil resource plays. However, over the last several months, each of our Big 4 oil place has gotten bigger, and we're accreting acreage in other areas. This will likely add to our CapEx opportunities over time. Therefore, we decided to work with an outside partner in our exploration efforts for the Louisiana Tuscaloosa marine shale oil play where we've teamed with Mitsubishi. We don't intend to provide specific funding details, but we hope it's win-win for both parties. To reiterate, any possible oil resource play JVs will be the exception rather than rule, and will definitely not be implemented in the Eagle Ford, Bakken, Combo or Permian.","We've previously disclosed that approximately 10% of our 2012 CapEx will be devoted to dry gas drilling in Haynesville, Marcellus and Horn River to hold acreage, and nothing has changed. We expect the percent of CapEx allocated to dry gas in 2013 will be approximately 5%. ","I'll make one interesting observation regarding our Barnett Shale gas production, which I believe apprized all horizontal resource plays both gas and oil. For 2 years, we've not only monitored drilling in our Johnson County Barnett gas field, and we've been able to observe production declines without interference from new wells. Over the past 2 years, the aggregate decline of wells has been slightly less than our forecast. This data should ameliorate concerns among investors regarding longer term declines from horizontal gas and oil resource plays.","Outside North America, we're continuing to work on our East Irish Sea Conwy oil development with an expected second half 2013 production start up. Production's commencement has slipped 6 months because of a delay in drilling rig arrival. Production will likely peak at 20,000 barrels of oil per day late in 2013. We own 100% of this project.","In Argentina, our first Vaca Muerta vertical well has been completed. The well was currently in the early flowback stages after frac and looks strong. We've also drilled and cased a horizontal well, and we'll frac it in June. In Trinidad, we continue to project that 2012 gas sales will be flat with 2011. We don't have much news to report regarding our Kitimat project. We still expect FID no sooner than year end.","I'll now address 2 other EOG key differentiators: Crude-by-rail and sand plants. Our St. James crude-by-rail facility received its first Bakken crude oil shipment on April 15, allowing us to begin capturing the current $15 Bakken in LLS price uplift. We now have the capability to move our Bakken, Eagle Ford and Wolfcamp crude to either Cushing or St. James. Based on current differentials, the best NPV for our rail tanker fleet is to move our EOG Bakken oil to St. James and sell our Eagle Ford in the Houston and Corpus Christi markets. We expect our St. James facility to handle 50,000 barrels a day by June, increasing to 70,000 barrels a day by year end. We've provided guidance on our U.S. oil differentials relative to WTI for the second quarter in yesterday's press release. ","For those modeling this net back benefit, remember that May will be a debugging month while we iron out the startup kinks, though likely to facility will run at intermittent capacity. We will not have the St. James facility fully operational for the entire second quarter, and not all of EOG's oil production will be sold to St. James. As market conditions and differentials change, we have great flexibility and can rapidly revise where we sell our production and how we get our production to market.","Regarding frac sand, our new Wisconsin sand plant started up in January. And this plant, in addition to our other sand facilities gives us the capacity to now self source the majority of our 2012 domestic fracs. A rough approximation of the annual savings is $500,000 per well times 600 wells or $300 million per year.","No other E&P company has boasted these differentiators, and only a very small minority has even one of the 2, which, combined with our first mover resource play advantage, gives us a big competitive advantage.","Now I'll discuss our 2012 business plan. Because we value consistency, I'm happy to report that there are no changes to the strategy that we articulated in February. This strategy is obviously working because we increased our full year liquids growth target from 30% to 33%. We continue to adhere to a low debt ratio and intend to limit our max net debt to cap to 30% and sell $1.2 billion of assets this year. Through May 1, we've closed on $565 million of sales and have approximately $600 million of sales in progress. So once we close on pending sales, we've essentially met our $1.2 billion target. Over the past 3 years, we've concentrated our assets by selling over 8,000 wells.","Part of our plan is to preserve a large dry gas resource play positions, and we're achieving that by devoting a small portion of our CapEx to Marcellus, Haynesville and Horn River lease retention drilling. In the Horn River Basin, we drilled 4 wells during the first quarter and have 3 wells remaining to drill in the second quarter. Once these are drilled, our leases will be held for 10 years. Our liquids plays are generating very strong results as evidenced by our outstanding organic liquids growth. This business plan will generate strong year-over-year EPS, EBITDAX and discretionary cash flow growth even with low gas prices. Remember, only 8% of this year's North American revenue is subject to spot gas prices. Even though some of our gas hedges roll off in 2013, because of our strong liquids growth, we expect only a small amount of 2013 North American revenues will emanate from unhedged gas. Simply put, we think we're better situated than any other large cap E&P to deal with the current natural gas price environment. ","I'll now turn it over to Tim Driggers to discuss financials and capital structure.","Timothy K. Driggers","Good morning. Capitalized interest for the quarter was $11.9 million. For the first quarter 2012, total cash, exploration and development expenditures were $1.9 billion excluding asset retirement obligations. In addition, expenditures for gathering systems, processing plants and other property plant and equipment were $171 million.","Total acquisitions for the quarter were $327,000. As mentioned, through May 1, proceeds from asset sales were $565 million. At the end of March 2012, total debt outstanding was $5.0 billion and the debt to total capitalization ratio was 28%.","At March 31, we had $294 million of cash on hand, giving us non-GAAP net debt of $4.7 billion or net debt to total cap ratio of 27%. The effective tax rate for the first quarter was 38% and the deferred tax ratio was 56%. Yesterday, we included a guidance table with earnings press release for the second quarter and full year 2012. For the second quarter and full year, the effective tax rate is estimated to be 35% to 45%.","We have also provided an estimated range of the dollar amount of current taxes that we expect to record during the second quarter and for the full year. Regarding price sensitivities, with our current hedged position in 2012, for each $1 moved in crude oil prices, net income is impacted by $29 million and cash flow is impacted by $43 million. For each $0.10 move in natural gas prices, net income is impacted by $10 million and cash flow is impacted by $14 million. ","Now I'll turn it back to Mark.","Mark G. Papa","Thanks, Tim. Now I'll provide some views regarding macro hedging and concluding remarks. Regarding oil, we still think the global supply-demand balance is tight and the fundamentals dictate an average $105 WTI price in 2012. The upside pressures are mainly geopolitical. The downside risk is a second global recession. And for that contingency, we've recently increased our crude oil hedge position. We don't subscribe to the theory that North American oil growth will create a global surplus. We think a lot of the advertised but untested new North American liquids plays are even more show than subsequence or our NGL plays.","For the second half of 2012, we're approximately 24% hedged at $106.74 price. We continue to have a very cautious outlook regarding 2012 natural gas prices. And fortunately, as a percent of North American gas, we're 45% hedged at $5.44 for the second half of the year. We think the current rise in gas prices is a head fake but the storage overhang is just too massive.","As you know, we've been a big North American gas bear the last several years, and we adjusted our gas investments accordingly in 2010, '11 and '12. Last year, our North American natural gas production declined 7%, and this year we project a 10% decline. This is likely the largest 2-year gas production decline of the peer group, so we're doing our part to balance the market. Please see the table that was included in our earnings press release for the details of our hedging contracts.","Now let me summarize. In my opinion, there are 6 points to take away from this call. First, the game plan we articulated several years ago is working. In the first quarter, our year-over-year GAAP EPS increased 131%, non-GAAP EPS increased 72%, adjusted EBITDAX was up 39% and discretionary cash flows increased 39%. This is on top of our peer leading full year 2011 versus 2010 growth in these same metrics.","Second, we continue to exhibit extremely strong oil and NGL growth for a company our size. First quarter crude and condensate growth was 49% year-over-year and total liquids were up 48%. This is on top of 52% crude and condensate growth and 48% total liquids organic growth for the full year of 2011 versus 2010. Accordingly, we've raised our full year 2012 liquids growth target to 33% while keeping CapEx flat. Third, we're on track to sell $1.2 billion of properties and keep our net debt to total cap below 30%.","Fourth, what can I say about the Eagle Ford except that it's an 800-pound gorilla developing into a 1,000-pound gorilla.","Fifth, the Bakken Three Forks is our upside surprise to the quarter, and we're considerably more optimistic about the next 10 years of this play than we were a year ago.","And finally, EOG has 2 very significant logistical advantages that put us in a class by itself, crude-by-rail and self-sourced frac sand. Together, these provide the opportunity for higher net backs, market flexibility and cost advantages far above what we estimated when we committed to these projects.","Thanks for listening. And now, we'll go to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Leo Mariani with RBC.","Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just a quick question on CapEx. Looked like it is kind of trending a little bit higher in the first quarter on a run-rate basis, if I sort of multiply it by 4 for the year. Can you just talk through how CapEx may change sequentially in the following quarters to kind of keep you guys within your guidance?","William R. Thomas","Yes, that's been a focus for us. And as is mentioned earlier by Mark, yes, we started off the year. We've got to a peak of 76 rigs, and we did that because we had dropped back to 65 end of 2011, and we wanted to go ahead and get quite a number of these patterns drilled to bring on our production. We're reducing that to 65 rigs total. That's dropping rigs even out of the Eagle Ford as well as some of our gas well drilling. And with that running 65 rigs, we believe we'll be able to stay within our CapEx guidance.","Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, great. And I guess in the Bakken, clearly you guys seem pretty excited about it. Just trying to get a sense of how much additional acreage has kind of come in to your development program. And additionally, how much acreage you think left to be tested in the Bakken in sort of the Lite area that's kind of yet to be determined?","Mark G. Papa","Yes, Leo. It's not so much additional acreage. Pretty much all of the acreage we have, we think is acreage that's going to turn out to be productive. Out of all the things we described, and we kind of described 4 things there, the core area downspacing, the light area downspacing, actually it's 5 things. And then the Antelope area and the stuff out there in the state line area and then the Waterflood. I'd say that there's a -- 3 of those things are definitely working, core area downspacing, state line area, Antelope. The Bakken Lite area downspacing, we don't know for sure whether that's going to work, and then the Waterflood. But probably the biggest things that could make a difference there are the core area downspacing, which we already checked the box on that, and then the Waterflood. Those are the ones that are going to be the big difference. It's not so much are we going to be trying to prove up incremental acreage somewhere. It's really, really now, how best -- how dense a spacing can we drill on the acreage that we have, and then can we make a secondary recovery project work on that. So that's the way I'd look at it, but there's -- if we can get the -- particularly the Waterflood to work, then we've got, I think, a significant upgrade in the likely reserves that we\u2019ve got captured and the likely production we'll be generating out of the Bakken for the next decade, really.","Operator","We'll take night our next question from Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","In the Eagle Ford, can you talk to, by year end, what areal extent you're planning to test at 40 acres versus what you've already tested at 65 to 90? And then beyond the downspacing, where do you think you are in optimizing completions in the Eagle Ford and whether you see room for further efficiencies?","Mark G. Papa","Yes, I'll give it to Bill Thomas.","William R. Thomas","Brian, that's a good question. We have several patterns that we're currently drilling and frac-ing and just starting to test that are on the lower spacing, below 65 acres per well. So we're going to take that kind of flow because that's pushing it pretty hard, and we really would like to get a couple of those patterns fully tested and developed before we expand that to -- over large, large areas. So that'll just take a little bit of time and we'll just kind of see how that goes as we progress. On the frac side, as you know, industry-wide, we are very aggressive on trying new techniques and new styles of frac technology and using microseismic and trying to increase the amount of rock that we are connecting each one of these horizontal wells. And so we're making very, very substantial and steady progress in the Eagle Ford. As Mark mentioned earlier, we are being more aggressive in some of the areas on our frac styles. In terms of sand, we're using different kinds of frac fluids and even different kinds of sand sizes in alternating the pump rates, as well as alternating the way we distribute the frac along the laterals and we're making really good progress. I would say much of the increases in the IPs that you see on the wells are due to just better frac technology than we had a year ago. So we're just very pleased. We're also, as Mark mentioned, the rock quality in the Eagle Ford, it looks like we definitely captured the sweet spot. And so the quality of rock that we have to deal with and work with in the Eagle Ford is very, very, very good.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great, great. And then as a follow up, is the takeaway from your comments on CapEx going forward that your call on development opportunities in your Big Four fields is now leading you to pursue more outside partner funding for opportunity for exploration outside those Big Four fields? And then can just remind us how you're thinking about balancing growth with CapEx and cash flow beyond 2012?","Mark G. Papa","Yes. It's fair to say that if you looked at our Big Four fields, and this is our internal assessment in terms of the size of them relative to a year ago, and you know this, a year ago we were looking at Eagle Ford at 900 million barrels, now we're looking at it 1.6 billion. A year ago, we were looking at the Bakken. And based on this call, we're certainly more excited about the Bakken Three Forks than we were a year ago. And as we also said on the call, we continue to expand in the combo play, although nothing that's discernibly exciting, but just gradual expansion and the same in the Wolfcamp Leonard area. So they've all gotten bigger, some of them -- considerably bigger, some of them just a bit bigger. And then we continue to have an increasing list of greenfield new play ideas. And so we just decided that this 30% net debt to cap is a hard line for us. And we will just avail ourselves of some external financing on at least one selected oil play. And so I think on a go-forward basis, 2 things come out of -- that you ought to conclude. One is the 30% net debt to cap is not a number we take lightly. And the second thing is that the comment about not using external funding in the Big Four plays is just totally inflexible. We're not going to change that at all. But on some of our greenfield ideas for new plays, we may elect from time to time to consider using outside financing","Operator","We'll take our next question from Pearce Hammond with Simmons & Company International.","Pearce W. Hammond - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Mark, impressive liquids growth during the quarter. And as we ramp up the earnings season, a number of the producers have delivered some pretty stunning liquids growth. I was wondering if you can elaborate a little bit more on your comments at the end of your prepared remarks that you're not worried about there being a glut of oil developing here in the U.S. given this impressive oil growth in this tight oil [ph] revolution?","Mark G. Papa","Yes. I mean, I'm not sure, as the quarter ends that I've seen that impressive of liquids growth for most of the companies. So I might disagree a little bit from your first comment there. I think there's a lot of intent to have impressive liquids growth, but I haven't seen the numbers put on the board. But there are some theories out there by some sell siders that there ultimately will be a huge plethora of liquids growth. But I just -- and there are a lot of liquids plays that are being talked about, but they're yet unproven liquids plays. And I would just say that our analysis is that we just don't think that there's going to be the growth out there that some people are projecting. And if you look at our analysis in what we put out there on our website last night, we're projecting, by 2015, about 1.5 million barrels a day of increase in total U.S. oil production due to this horizontal revolution, which is quite substantial. But we don't think that's going to be enough to change the global supply-demand picture.","Pearce W. Hammond - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","And then as a follow-up to Leo's question on the CapEx and how we stay with the guidance for the full year, can you provide us with that roadmap? You say you're going down to 65 rigs from year end and that was starting at where? And then is the majority of that going to be gas rigs?","William R. Thomas","The ones we dropped were -- we dropped 4 there in the Eagle Ford, but the rest of them are principally gas or liquids-rich gas well drilling.","Pearce W. Hammond - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","And then what was the starting point on that? Going from how many rigs down to 65.","William R. Thomas","We peaked at 76 and we're now dropping to 65.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Joseph Allman with JPMorgan.","Joseph D. Allman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Mark, how much of the 9% decline in North American natural gas year-over-year that you experienced in the first quarter, how much of that is natural declines and how much of that is asset sales?","Mark G. Papa","We haven't worked that out exactly. I mean, it's probably fair to make an assumption, maybe half. Half is due to asset sales and half is just natural declines, Joe. It probably won't be too far off if you make that as an assumption.","Joseph D. Allman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful, Mark. And then in the Parshall field, what were your previous assumptions about the recoveries you were getting, and then where can those recoveries go with the infill drilling?","Mark G. Papa","Well, I mean, in the Parshall field, the latest model we've done, we keep on updating it. Previously, I'd quoted that our Bakken recovery factors in that area we're about 10%. But now the latest model we've done shows that the recovery factor is about 8%. And then it shows, with the downspacing, hopefully we can take that up to -- from 8% to in the range of about 12% or so, and then further boost it farther than that, if we're lucky enough to have the Waterflood work. I'm not going to quote you a number on the Waterflood. We'll give you that one if it actually works.","Operator","We'll take our next question from David Tameron with Wells Fargo.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Back to the gas comments. What do you think is going on in the Barnett as far as why those wells are holding up better? Is it just didn't have the -- can you just give us some color there?","Mark G. Papa","Yes. I mean, what I meant to convey there is they're holding up just a little bit better than what we had projected on our decline curves. So there had been some talk out there that all these resource plays were going to fall on their face once you quit drilling. And the intent of my comment was to say this is the first time where we've had kind of 2 years without a lot of interruptions from a lot of new drilling wells. And the data basically shows that we have 2 years, that with no precipitous declines other than what we had projected, and actually, a little stronger well performance than what we've projected. So there were some profits of doom out there that said always all these resource plays we're going to -- overstated reserves, et cetera. And I just thought it'd be useful to you folks to hear some real work data.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","All right. But, yes, obviously a lot of plays are seeing that so a lot of guys report more gas than they thought.","Mark G. Papa","Yes, sad for the gas market.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Yes it\u2019s not good. As a follow up, back to Eagle Ford, you said you're going to 21 rigs from 23 at year end\u2026","Mark G. Papa","Actually, 27 going to 23.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. 27 going to 23. Is that just simply CapEx or is there -- I mean, why not, if the play's working as well you think and you're trying to test some new concepts, why not just keep running at that 27 given the return you're probably seeing there right now.","Mark G. Papa","Yes. We just had a target to drill up 300 net wells this year. And what we're finding out is with our drilling efficiencies, we're -- it's taking us less time per well to drill. And so we\u2019re able to drill the 300 net wells for the rest of the year just with 23 rigs. So that's kind of what drove us to release rigs.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I wanted to jump back to the Eagle Ford. The well results that you discussed are obviously pretty impressive. And looking at your presentation on the website this morning, it looks like those wells are fairly consistently -- fairly close to the transition window, I guess, into the white gas area. I guess my question is how repeatable do you think those results are going to be across your acreage? And are you prepared to not chop your type curve or your expectation for the play generally in terms of near-term production outlook?","Mark G. Papa","Yes, you're right, in that what we found is the wells that are nearer to the transition, closer to the rich gas area, generally have the better quality. And so when you blend them all together, the wells that are farther back from that  you end up with that 450 Mboe per well. A lot of these wells that we\u2019re quoting, of course, are our best wells. And so many of them are 800, 900 Mboe per well, kind of wells on there. So again, we're -- overall, it's kind of the average well it turns out to be. The surprising thing to me is that other people, all of which I'm sure are quoting their best wells to you. Have yet to quote 2,000, 3,000, 4,000 barrel a day wells. So there appears to be a big differential between the wells we're making and what other companies are making, which is still kind of surprising to me on there.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","As a follow up, Mark, if I can use my follow up. So as you lower your rig count for this year in the Eagle Ford, are you -- how are you -- are you kind of high grading where you're focusing the near-term drilling program towards that sort of transition region. In other words, should we be looking at higher early production results, maybe transitioning to lower production over a longer period of time? In other words, your 2012 production guidance could actually have some upside risk? I'm just trying to understand how you're allocating the rigs in that play? And I'll leave it at that.","Mark G. Papa","No, what's really driving us is more the acreage exploration than trying to high grade it there. We can cover all the acreage exploration with 300 wells this year, but that's what's driving us, so we're not in a perfect world for NPV optimization, you drill all your best wells in the early years. But it's not a case where we're targeting our best wells in the early years, and then saving all the weaker well later. It's really just -- we drilled some of the better wells and some of the less good wells driven by the acreage side. So you can't really project that the well quality will go down in later years because we cherry-pick the best wells.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I think about -- more about front end loading the better wells so that we actually end up with much shaft [ph]. As you say, faster NPV realization. Okay, that's very clear, Mark. I'll leave it there.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Arun Jayaram with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Arun Jayaram - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Mark, last quarter you commented or gave some data on the Henkhaus unit where you're testing down the 65 acres in the Eagle Ford. And obviously, the results from the 4H well were very, very strong. I just wanted to see if you could give us a sense for the 5H and the 12H wells. How tightly spaced were those laterals relative to that unit?","William R. Thomas","Yes, they were basically all in the same spacing. The 5H and the 12H are a little bit shorter than the other wells, but their IPs and the way that they're responding for total lateral are very comparable to the other wells. And the surprising thing on that is, is that we have significant production from the other wells on the unit before we completed these wells. And so that's very, very, very encouraging to us. The matrix contribution on the Eagle Ford, I think, has been remarkable, and it's been a very big pleasant surprise for us. So things are going well.","Arun Jayaram - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. But in general, those are all in that 65 acre spacing in terms of width? Is that a fair comment?","William R. Thomas","Yes, that's correct. Yes.","Arun Jayaram - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And my follow-up question. Mark, you talked about the offset wells in Bakken increasing in the core part of the field as you've gone down from 640 to 320s. What exactly is going on there? And can you comment, was that a positive surprise for you?","Mark G. Papa","It was a surprise, yes. We didn't expect that. Our theory is that when we frac those wells originally, which would've been the 640-acre wells 4, 5 years ago that looking back, we probably didn't get as efficient of a stimulation as we might have liked and that we now are going to bigger fracs today than what we did back then, and that in the downspaced well, we gave a bigger frac and we probably stimulated some of that area even around the 640-acre original well. So that's kind of -- that's one theory that seems to make the most sense to me, that we would frac new rock around even the older well. So it's kind of an extra bonus, really, on there, which kind of cinches the case for the downspacing there, really. And the other thing it tells us is that clearly the 640-acre original spacing was too wide. So it makes it kind of a slam dunk case for the 320-acre spacing, and then it just opens the question about well is 320 still too wide? And should we investigate 160? So that'll be the next step we're look at too. On the spacing on both the Eagle Ford and the Bakken, clearly, what we did in retrospect is we started out with too wide of spacing and in both of them now, we're densifying the spacing, and we\u2019ll densify it until we conclude okay, this is too dense of a spacing. And maybe in the Eagle Ford example maybe 65 acres is as dense as we want to go, maybe 40 acres is, we don't know. But I guess you live and you learn. The other way we could've done it is we could have gone to ultra-dense spacing to start, and then said this is too dense and then work the way to wider spacing, but we're doing it the other way. So we'll just see how it plays out, but we're concluded that the initial spacing was too wide, and we'll just work inwards until we conclude that now okay this is too close in terms of spacing.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Ray Deacon with BBMC Capital.","Raymond J. Deacon - Brean Murray, Carret & Co., LLC, Research Division","I was wondering, so I think is -- I think previously you were saying Bakken production will be in decline in 2012. Is that still the case or not?","Mark G. Papa","I think previously what we said is Bakken production would be flat in 2012. And it's probably fair to say that in 2012, Bakken production will be flat or maybe we'd say maybe just very slightly up. But based on what we're seeing, I'd say that 2013 and forward, there's a pretty decent chance Bakken production will have a good chance to be on the incline.","Raymond J. Deacon - Brean Murray, Carret & Co., LLC, Research Division","Got it. And would that be based on results of downspacing in Bakken Lite and Waterflooding or based on what you see today?","Mark G. Papa","Probably just on what we see today, not even counting the Waterflooding results. The Waterflooding, all we're doing right now is a pilot. And we'll know something about that by the end of the year and then we'd have to go to a full-scale Waterflood. And so frankly, it would be 2014 before we really see production results from a full-scale waterflood. So that's still a couple years away.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Irene Haas with Wunderlich Securities.","Irene O. Haas - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","Mark I just want to catch back up with one of your beginning comments. You said that a lot of your growth is really coming from oil and condensate. And so I want to ask, how do you feel about the natural gas liquid markets, specifically ethane? Are we kind of hitting a bottleneck or simply we have unusual amount of downtime during first quarter. In multiple basins, I wanted to get your take on the ethane market.","Mark G. Papa","Yes. I mean, we've put some guidance in our 8-K there. For the first time, more of a gas than guidance as to -- as a function of crude, what our total NGL price expectations are. We don't guarantee the accuracy, but we decided we'd put some guidance in there anyway. Our read on the NGL market is that the second quarter will -- and specifically ethane. Second quarter will continue to be relatively weak. But the second -- and the reason first and second quarters were weak, are weak is that there were a lot of plant turnarounds, ethylene plant turnarounds. But beginning in the second half of the year, we expect those prices to strengthen in a relative sense, and that we're a little more bullish than a lot of people that ethane prices will remain decent, probably in the 40% to 50% range of crude oil long term. So right now, we're not writing off those prices and saying they're going to just degrade to nothingness. And that's based on the long term that the ethylene -- the cheapest place to make ethylene is probably going to be in the United States as opposed to anywhere else in the world. But second quarter, our expectations are pretty bearish. Check with me in 6 months and I might have a different story.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Monroe Helm with Barrow, Hanley.","H.

So you've connected it up and you've kind of done a mini waterflood test inadvertent, Mike.","William R. Thomas","That's correct, yes.

As a reminder, this call is being recorded.","At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to the Chief Financial Officer of EOG Resources, Mr. Tim Driggers. Please go ahead, sir.","Timothy K. Driggers - EOG Resources, Inc.","Good morning and thanks for joining us.","This conference call includes forward-looking statements. The risks associated with forward-looking statements have been outlined in the earnings release and EOG's SEC filings, and we incorporate those by reference for this call.","This conference call also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation schedules for these non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures can be found on our website at www.eogresources.com.","Some of the reserve estimates on this conference call may include estimated potential reserves not necessarily calculated in accordance with SEC reserve reporting guidelines.

Bill Thomas will review second quarter highlights and corporate growth strategy. David Trice will discuss our new Powder River Basin plays, followed by Lance Terveen, who will cover Powder River Basin takeaway status. I'll then discuss yesterday's dividend announcement and our capital structure outlook. Billy Helms will cover second quarter operating highlights, and Ezra Yacob will give an update on our Eagle Ford and Delaware Basin activity. Then Bill will provide concluding remarks.","Here's Bill Thomas.","William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.","Thanks, Tim, and good morning, everyone.","EOG is focused on delivering long-term shareholder value through disciplined high-return organic growth. Our Powder River Basin resource additions this quarter demonstrate once again the value of our exploration focus. We were able to grow our premium inventory in both size and quality by adding locations much faster than we drill them.","In addition, our second quarter production results demonstrate our ability to consistently execute and deliver strong double-digit oil growth through our decentralized organization and multi-play asset base. EOG's ability to organically generate new prospects coupled with our proven ability to execute on our premium drilling program demonstrates that EOG is a high-return growth machine with the ability to sustainably generate long-term shareholder value.","During the second quarter, we exceeded production targets for oil, natural gas, and NGLs, beat our quarterly total per-unit operating cost, realized better than target prices across all three production streams, announced two new shale plays in the Powder River Basin, and added over 1,500 premium locations and 1.9 billion barrels of oil equivalent of net resource potential.","In addition, we also identified new premium locations in the Delaware Basin and Eagle Ford, effectively replacing the inventory we drilled in our two largest core assets. EOG's undrilled net premium resource potential now equals 9.2 billion barrels of oil equivalent and 9,500 net locations, which is more than 13 years of premium return drilling at our current pace.","Last but not least, the Board of Directors approved another increase to the common dividend. The current 19% increase coupled with our previous 10% increase last February brings our total dividend increase to 31% this year. This is a tremendous vote of confidence in our premium business strategy, a strong commitment to capital discipline, and demonstrates our commitment to returning cash to shareholders through the dividend.","Looking ahead to the remainder of 2018 and beyond, EOG will continue to deploy a disciplined growth strategy. Disciplined growth means pacing long-term growth to allow the company to maximize the value of our acreage, retain efficiencies to support high returns, and generate cash flow to both reinvest and reward shareholders.","EOG in particular is uniquely positioned for disciplined growth due to our diverse portfolio of assets. We're not relying on any one basin to drive our company's success, which means we are in a position to grow production without straining the return on our capital investment or the underlying assets. In other words, we can grow each asset at a pace that maximize returns and NPV per acre.","Our production growth in 2018 is a result of investing in high-return premium drilling across nine plays in six different basins. Year to date, almost every one of our operational areas grew production and did so while maintaining efficiencies and producing premium returns. With the addition of the Mowry and Niobrara in the Powder River Basin, we now have 11 plays to develop and fuel the company's future.","Slide 8 illustrates the progression of our premium inventory, highlighting our ability to consistently replace and grow premium inventory much faster than we drill it. Disciplined reinvestment of cash flow in our deep inventory of high rate of return drilling is fundamental to how EOG creates significant long-term shareholder value.","Next up is David Trice to provide details on our exciting Powder River Basin news.","David W. Trice - EOG Resources, Inc.","Thanks, Bill.","Yesterday afternoon we introduced two new premium plays in the Powder River Basin, demonstrating once again the value created by our leadership and exploration. Over the last few years, our Powder River Basin team has focused on understanding the geological complexities of our 400,000 net acre position. Like the Delaware Basin, the Powder River Basin is prolific, with almost a mile deep column of pay and multiple targets.","We tested many zones over the years and learned that both the Mowry and the Niobrara shales, much like the Eagle Ford, are resource rich, over-pressured source rocks that produce prolific wells when we apply our refined targeting techniques and EOG-styled completions.","Also, much like the Eagle Ford and the Woodford, the Mowry and Niobrara are both shale resource plays, and therefore have great potential for additional efficiencies in the future. Shale allows for tight downspacing, which is a great fit for drilling large packages, using multi-well pads, longer laterals, and zipper fracs. Furthermore, these two resource plays overlap on much of our acreage, allowing development of both concurrently. Tightly spaced wells and co-development also translates to less surface disturbance per well, which reduces our environmental footprint and is particularly important for permitting in Wyoming.","Over the last year, we reported some remarkable efficiency records in our Rockies plays, including drilling 18,000 feet in under three days and completing 26 stages in a single 24-hour period. While the records are impressive, so are the averages. Drilling days are down 70% since the start of the downturn in 2014, and completion stages per day are up 50% over the last year. Sustainable cost reductions and shorter cycle times, driven by efficiencies, were a big contributor to adding these two shale plays to our Powder River Basin premium inventory.","Currently, well cost in both plays are around $6 million for laterals approaching 2 miles. Combined with average EURs of more than 1 million barrels of oil equivalent net after royalty, the Mowry and Niobrara shales are delivering premium rates of return at very low finding and development cost. Low finding and development costs drive higher corporate-level returns.","We estimate EOG's position in the Mowry Shale is prospective for 1.2 billion barrels of oil equivalent from 875 net premium locations using 660-foot spacing. Oil cuts in the Mowry range from 20% to 60% depending on location. We completed two Mowry wells during the second quarter, and their 30-day initial production averaged almost 2,200 barrels of oil equivalent per day.","Our Niobrara Shale resource estimate is 640 million barrels of oil equivalent from 555 net premium locations, also on 660-foot spacing. We expect about half of our estimated Niobrara resource is crude oil.","In addition, we identified another 80 net undrilled locations in the Turner play, bringing our undrilled premium location count in the Powder River Basin to over 1,600 net wells.","And the Powder River Basin is now ready to become a meaningful contributor to EOG's future growth. We worked hard to assemble and block up our position as well as permit (00:09:59) well locations to capture operatorship.","During the second half of 2018, we'll drill the remaining Turner wells planned for the year, and we'll conduct a couple of spacing tests in the Mowry and Niobrara. For 2019, we expect to increase our activity as we add infrastructure and prepare to bring the Powder into full development.","Adding nearly 2 billion barrels of oil equivalent in the Powder River Basin from the Mowry, Niobrara, and Turner exemplifies EOG's differentiated investment profile of multiple diverse assets supporting long-term, disciplined, high-return growth. EOG's extensive and diverse asset portfolio is unmatched in the industry and now totals 11 plays across six basins. We have the flexibility to allocate capital to the best performing assets over the long run, ensuring consistent returns to our shareholders throughout the commodity price cycles.","Next up is Lance Terveen to discuss our takeaway positioning in the Powder River Basin.","D. Lance Terveen - EOG Resources, Inc.","Thanks, David.","The existing midstream presence in the Powder River Basin is strong. For liquids-rich natural gas, there are four processors near our operating area with significant low-pressure and high-pressure gathering systems with backup connections as contingencies. This allows EOG to fully utilize existing plant capacity in the area.","In conjunction with midstream providers, planned processing, and NGL takeaway expansions, we are designing an EOG gas gathering and compression system. This system is similar to the successful design of our infrastructure in the Bakken, Eagle Ford, and Delaware Basin, and accomplishes three goals: one, control; two, lower operating costs; and, three, access to multiple markets.","Now, on the oil side, takeaway in the PRB is plentiful. The Casper and Guernsey hubs provide access to multiple local refining markets as well as the Salt Lake City and Denver markets. Other pipelines are available to access the Cushing market, and we are studying all options, even the potential to move barrels to the Gulf Coast. Wellhead net-backs today for lease sales are also strong, and we currently anticipate the local market dynamics for oil and condensate to remain strong into 2019. Finally, we are working on solutions for longer-term oil gathering and oil terminal infrastructure.","We are well positioned for processing and takeaway in the Powder River Basin today, and we are taking steps now to prepare for increased activity longer term. Infrastructure investments we make over the next 18 months will provide the flexibility to respond to changing market dynamics and access a wide variety of markets out of the Powder River Basin.","Here's Tim.","Timothy K. Driggers - EOG Resources, Inc.","Thanks, Lance.","As Bill mentioned, the Board of Directors approved a $0.14 increase in the common stock dividend. The indicated annual rate is now $0.88. Combined with a $0.07 increase approved in February, the dividend has increased by 31% in 2018. This should send a strong signal about the effect of our shift to premium has had in lowering our cost structure and improving the profitability of the company as well as our commitment to returning cash to shareholders.","At the same time, we are making good progress strengthening EOG's financial position. Since year-end 2017, cash on the balance sheet increased by $174 million to $1 billion, and our net debt-to-capitalization ratio decreased to 24% at June 30. $1.26 billion of debt is now classified as current on the balance sheet, as we intend to repay upon maturity a $350 million bond due in October of this year and a $900 million bond due in June 2019.","I'm happy to report both Standard & Poor's and Moody's recognized EOG's growing financial strength. Standard & Poor's updated EOG's credit rating to A-minus, and Moody's changed EOG's outlook to positive.","We still expect to generate over $1.5 billion of free cash flow in 2018, assuming $60 oil prices. This is defined as discretionary cash flow less CapEx and dividend payments. The bulk of this free cash flow is anticipated to be generated in the second half of the year. Discretionary cash flow is forecasted to increase through the remainder of the year while our CapEx budget was more heavily weighted towards the first half of the year.","Up next to provide details on our operational performance is Billy Helms.","Lloyd W. Helms, Jr. - EOG Resources, Inc.","Thanks, Tim.","I'm happy to report that our operational teams delivered the well results and volume growth projections that we anticipated at the start of the year. In 2018, we are focused on increasing the net present value of our acreage through more efficient, larger development packages. Our 2018 capital plan was designed to increase our well inventory during the first half of the year in order to improve the operational flexibility for managing these larger development packages.","As indicated on our last call, we expect to see more production growth in the third quarter following the increase in activity and capital spend that was weighted towards the first half of the year. In addition, our decentralized organization operating in multiple basins gives us the flexibility to adjust our activity to take advantage of changing market conditions.","During the second quarter, our Eagle Ford oil production received favorable Gulf Coast prices that were nearly $3 per barrel higher than WTI. Premium Gulf Coast pricing may persist into next year, so we recently added two rigs in the Eagle Ford to build well inventory, providing us optionality as we begin to plan for 2019.","I want to emphasize that we still expect to spend within our guided capital expenditure range, although most likely above the midpoint. About 10 more Eagle Ford wells will be completed this year, with most of the additional inventory being carried into 2019. Operating in multiple basins makes this level of flexibility possible and is fundamental to our ability to deliver sustainable, long-term, high-return growth.","We remain focused on our goal of reducing well costs and cash operating costs by 5% this year. Our overall unit operating costs are trending down year over year. And while certain lease operating costs are showing signs of upward pressure, we've been able to offset that pressure with other unit cost savings in transportation and DD&A. Total unit costs are still expected to be down at least 10% this year.","Looking ahead to 2019, we anticipate the industry will see some inflationary pressures, possibly on the order of 5% to 10%. As we do every year, we are working diligently to find creative solutions to keep our costs flat in the upcoming year. While drilling rigs and tubulars may see upward pressure, we are positioning ourselves to take advantage of pricing softness in other areas. We have good line of sight into our sand and water cost, which we expect to be down in 2019. We currently have about 50% of our 2019 oil field service needs locked in at very competitive prices, and are working to secure more of our service costs ahead of next year.","Finally, we'll continue to benefit from efficiency gains and reduced cycle times obtained by optimizing well package size and increasing the use of multi-well pads and zipper fracs. Taken all together, we think we are well positioned to keep costs at least flat in 2019.","I'll turn the call over to Ezra Yacob to provide you an update on the Eagle Ford and Delaware Basin plays.","Ezra Y. Yacob - EOG Resources, Inc.","Thanks, Billy.","This quarter we updated our premium inventory for our two largest oil assets, the Eagle Ford and the Delaware Basin, adding 520 net premium locations, primarily as the result of efficiency gains as well as productivity improvements. We added 145 net premium locations to the Eagle Ford. And in the Delaware Basin, we identified an additional 375 net locations across our four plays.","The last major update to premium inventory for these assets was in early 2017. We have since drilled more than 500 net wells between the two basins, 270 in the Eagle Ford and 250 in the Delaware Basin. These two workhorse assets made up 73% of our oil production last year and 58% of our total production. With this update to premium locations, we effectively replaced the inventory we've drilled over the last year and a half.","Our Eagle Ford asset delivered another great quarter of consistent high-return results, with 67 net wells brought online. Utilizing larger well packages, longer laterals, and zipper fracs, we continue to incrementally push the boundaries of this world-class play every quarter, and it continues to deliver.","Average lateral length on our western acreage is now approaching 2 miles while continuing to deliver excellent initial 30-day production rates. Wells drilled on our western acreage during the second quarter averaged more than 1,700 barrels of oil equivalent per day.","Increased drilling efficiencies are driving down drilling days even as we extend lateral lengths. In fact, this year we are drilling the same total footage per month as we did in 2014 at the peak of our activity level, and doing so with only half the rig count. Furthermore, our drilling team is achieving this performance while staying within a precision drilling window that is approximately one-fifth the size it was four years ago.","We've discussed the impact of precision targeting in the past. It is the number one driver of well productivity and critical to optimizing net present value across our 520,000 net acres.","In the Austin Chalk, the average lateral length of the five wells drilled during the second quarter was the longest yet at 7,900 feet. Average initial 30-day production exceeded 3,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Austin Chalk wells on average pay out in just over three months.","We continue to examine the Austin Chalk's prospectivity in our South Texas Eagle Ford acreage. The target is less consistent than the Eagle Ford shale. However, where it is prospective, it consistently delivers prolific results. Earlier this year, one of our first successful Austin Chalk wells, the Kilimanjaro, reached 1 million barrels of oil in less than two years, averaging more than 1,500 barrels of oil per day for 626 days. Furthermore, the play is in an advantageous location with well-developed infrastructure close to the Gulf Coast and benefits from our extensive seismic and log control collected through our Eagle Ford development program.","In our Delaware Basin asset, we brought 70 net wells to sales in the Leonard, Bone Spring, and Wolfcamp plays. Twenty percent of our Wolfcamp activity during the second quarter was in the Wolfcamp combo trend, a higher GOR play in Reeves County, Texas.","Over the last 18 months, we've been building out infrastructure to transition a portion of this asset into a core development area, and we are increasing activity commensurate with that construction. We have captured a 120,000 net acre position across this trend, and the combination of increased operational efficiencies and well performance, permanent infrastructure, and our natural gas processing contracts generate some of the highest net present value per well across the company.","This quarter, we brought online 10 net wells averaging over 8,000 feet in lateral length and delivering 2,200 barrels of oil equivalent per day per well. We're excited to see this trend become a larger contributor to our portfolio, delivering in excess of 200% direct after-tax rate of return.","In our Leonard and Bone Spring plays, we completed one of the largest packages we have done to date. The State Viking wells in Loving County are a package of 13 wells drilled across four targets, two in the Leonard and two in the Bone Spring. The combined 30-day rate for this package was a staggering 21,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, or approximately 1,600 barrels of oil equivalent per day per well on laterals averaging about 4,500 feet.","In every one of our unconventional plays, determining optimal well spacing is critical to maximizing the net present value of each acre. Determining optimal well spacing is also a problem-solving exercise that requires balancing multiple variables. Drilling widely spaced wells to maximize initial production rates and early returns can prevent optimal asset development over the long run due to the parent-child effect. However, overly aggressive well spacing will also have a detrimental effect due to potential communication between wells and potential overinvestment.","In each of our plays, we collect an extensive amount of robust drilling, completion, and production data and integrate it with geologic analysis to build reservoir models. These complex models provide the basis to determine optimal development patterns to maximize the NPV of our acreage.","A basin as target-rich as the Delaware is a great example. During the first half of 2018, we drilled a number of spacing and development patterns across six different Upper Wolfcamp targets in different combinations across the play. One of these packages was the Quanta Parker 8H through 11H, a four-well package drilled on our Texas acreage. Average 30-day IPs for the wells in this package were more than 2,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day per well on lateral lengths approaching 2 miles. The wells in this package were drilled 440 feet apart across two Upper Wolfcamp targets. This is some of the tightest spacing we've tested in the Wolfcamp to date, and these wells are generating at an outstanding NPV of $10 million per well.","The Delaware Basin is still early in its development. Leveraging our experience and data from 15 years of developing unconventional resources across North America is a tremendous advantage in our efforts to maximize NPV across our 416,000-acre position.","Now I'll turn the call back over to Bill.","William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.","Thanks, Ezra.","I would like to leave everyone with a few closing thoughts. Number one, EOG continues to solidly execute our 2018 premium drilling program. The company is delivering strong triple-digit direct well returns and strong double-digit U.S. oil growth.","Number two, EOG's exploration effort continues to deliver by organically generating premium drilling potential much faster than we drill it. This quarter's addition of 1.9 billion barrels of oil equivalent in the Powder River Basin is a remarkable and significant resource addition to our portfolio. Since permanently shifting to premium in 2016, we've essentially tripled our premium location count and more than quadrupled our premium resource potential.","Number three, EOG now has 11 premium options to efficiently deploy capital. Our multi-play options enhance our ability to deliver strong returns and growth consistently and sustainably over the long haul.","Number four, we're committed to a disciplined growth strategy. For the remainder of the year and as we look to start planning for 2019, you should expect EOG to remain disciplined about growth and capital allocation to maximize returns.","And number five, executing our premium strategy will grow production and cash flow, produce double-digit ROCE, and fund dividend growth. More importantly, we can consistently deliver this performance over the long term and through commodity price cycles. We believe that is unique, not just in the E&P industry but in any industry, and it is perfectly aligned with our ultimate goal to create significant shareholder value.","Thanks for listening, and now we'll go to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question today will be from Doug Leggate of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Bill, I'm not sure who you want to direct this one to. But some time ago, I seem to recall you mentioning the Powder River had some of the best wells in the portfolio. Now that you have shown us what this can do by way of the additional inventory, how would you characterize how activity might evolve there relative to the other plays or indeed additive to the other plays in 2019?","David W. Trice - EOG Resources, Inc.","Yeah, Doug, this is David Trice. As far as the Mowry and the Niobrara go, we'll be increasing activity in 2019 on those plays. The volume impact of those will be more likely weighted to late 2019 and on into 2020 as we build out our infrastructure there.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So I guess we'll wait in the cuff. I guess there are no specifics you can give us at this time, but I'm presuming it's not going to be a two-rig programs out there.","William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.","Well, as far as any specifics, we'll give the specifics in February when we give our 2019 plan.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, thank you. I thought I would try anyway. But my follow-up is, Bill, I feel as if I ask you this question a lot nowadays, but the cadence of spending in the second half of the year, given even slightly above the midpoint of your guidance, suggests that we're dropping off quite a bit to a $1.25 billion-type run rate. Is that realistic?","And how are you starting to think about, dare I say it, share buybacks? Are they ever going to be on the table assuming you remain capital disciplined and let's say a $60-type of level? I'm just thinking about the amount of free cash you're generating this year. Despite the guidance on the debt reduction, it still looks like you're going to be churning out a great deal of free cash beyond your uses.","William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.","Doug, we constantly evaluate all of our options, and we are very, very committed to doing what's right for the long-term shareholders. As you know, we manage the company for a sustainable success over the long term. So currently with the improving commodity prices, we believe certainly that the first thing we want to do is continue to reinvest in our premium drilling at very, very high rates of return, and continue to invest in organic exploration that's produced these Powder River Basin results.","And we're focused on debt reduction, and we're certainly focused on, and very committed to the shareholders with a very strong dividend increase. And so at this point in the life of the company, that is certainly the best way we feel like to continue to create long-term shareholder value and leave our options open and leave us flexible to do what is right for the shareholders in the long term.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So the first part of that question, Bill, sorry to push on this, but the drop-off in spending in the second half of the year, is that run rate about right? And can you maybe just give us an idea what's driving the drop sequentially? And I'll leave it there. Thank you.","Lloyd W. Helms, Jr. - EOG Resources, Inc.","Doug, this is Billy Helms. So the plan that we put together at the start of the year is consistent with the way it's being executed today. We planned about and actually completed about 40% of the wells. In the company that were completed in the first half were Delaware Basin wells. That will decline in the second half of the year to about 30% of our overall completions.","And on the flip side, our plays up in the Rockies that we've talked about, the DJ, the Bakken, and the Powder River Basin, will go from about 10% of our completions in the first half to about 20% of our completions in the second half. And so we're bringing in a mixture of just lower-cost wells in the second half of the year as compared to the first half of the year, which is why the spending rate has declined a little bit. The goal in the first part of the year was to build, as we moved to these larger packages wells, was to build up our inventory, and that gives us a lot of flexibility in managing these programs.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","That's really helpful, guys. Thanks so much.","Operator","The next question will be from Paul Sankey of Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead.","Paul Sankey - Mizuho Securities USA LLC","Hi, good morning, everyone. Gentlemen, I understand your excitement over the operational performance in the Powder River Basin, but it seems to me, especially with the stock trading off this morning, that the inventory is getting bewilderingly large, and you repeated on the call that you're adding inventory faster than you drill it. You're up to 13 years of future drilling. Is there a terminal point for that at which you don't need any more, or perhaps would you shift to an ultra-premium well location metric with a higher hurdle so that it becomes more meaningful at a given level? Thank you.","William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.","Paul, I think you know our focus is certainly replacing and adding to our premium inventory, but it's also very focused on improving the quality of the premium inventory. If you look at the slide, I believe it's slide number 8, you'll see that our inventory is growing very fastly. But at the bottom, it shows the per-well productivity and reserve potentials per well. And you can see that that's also going up too. So that went up again as we added the Powder River.","And what that does, with multiple assets, that gives us the ability to continue to shift our capital based on returns. And that is what we're focused on, is maximizing and continuing to improve the returns in the company. And so that gives us more options and even better quality inventory to continue to do that. And it also gives us an option down the road that if we're not going to drill that in a certain amount of time, we can certainly get value for that by maybe monetizing it or doing other things with it too.","So generating more and better inventory is not a problem. That is a very good thing to do, and that's what we're focused on, and that's what's going to continue to create value for the company going forward.","Paul Sankey - Mizuho Securities USA LLC","So I guess what you're saying is that the per-well metric that you highlighted is effectively an increase to the definition, an ongoing increase to the definition of a premium well?","William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.","Yes, they're getting better as we continue to generate over time.","Paul Sankey - Mizuho Securities USA LLC","Right, I've got you. And then the CapEx for this year was set at a lower price, I assume. I forget the exact number, but it's being maintained despite higher prices. It's really a follow-up to Doug's question. Can we run this level of CapEx into the future because that becomes such an important way of looking at all this? Thanks.","William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.","We don't have any specific guidance for 2019 or forward. The message we \u2013 and the way we're going to manage the company is we're going to stay disciplined, and we're going to stay focused on returns and not growth. So we'll spend and increase our CapEx only with discipline. Obviously, our cash flow is growing even if oil prices stay the same because our volume is going up. But we're not going to go so fast that we begin to have rising costs or we exceed the learning curve. And we're focused on developing each one of our properties at the maximum NPV and returns, and that takes discipline and it takes time. And so we're going to focus and stay very disciplined going forward.","Paul Sankey - Mizuho Securities USA LLC","I met my quota. Thank you.","Operator","The next question will be from Leo Mariani of NatAlliance Securities. Please go ahead.","Leo P. Mariani - NatAlliance Securities","Hey, guys. I was hoping to dive a little bit more into the Powder River here. Just noticing that you haven't had a ton of wells in the Niobrara and Mowry, but you guys are certainly coming out with a pretty robust inventory. I was hoping you can maybe just give us a little bit more color if there are a lot of industry wells that are giving you confidence. And then also I'm just trying to get a sense of how the new Powder River plays rank in comparison to some of your other premium plays.","David W. Trice - EOG Resources, Inc.","Leo, this is David Trice. So we've known for quite some time that the Mowry and the Niobrara have a lot of resource potential under our acreage. We began drilling on those actually in 2008 and 2009 as far as in the testing phase. So over the years, we've collected a lot of data. We've drilled nine Niobrara wells and nine Mowry wells since that time. We have five proprietary cores in the Mowry and two proprietary cores in the Niobrara in addition to all the publicly available data.","So what this has allowed us to do is build over 1,700 full petro-physical models across the Powder River Basin. And what that really does is allows us to define the very best targets, also the resource in place, and helps with our completions as well, which is really critical to the success of the plays.","And then as you noted, there has been industry activity in the basin. There have been over 200 Niobrara wells drilled in the Powder River Basin and about 30 Mowry wells. So we can take all that data with all the petro-physical data and core data, and we can build some very sophisticated reservoir models that we can really apply across a lot of our different plays and help us to understand both these plays. So all of that data that's been collected over the years has really helped.","And then one of the biggest factors in converting this to premium is the fact that our cost structure has dramatically come down over the last several years. We've been able to focus our drilling the last few years on the Turner, which is a higher permeability sandstone that's premium. And so as we've done that, we've gotten a lot better at executing in the Powder River Basin, and we've been able to bring down a lot of our drilling and completions, facility, and LOE costs over time.","So as we mentioned on some of the calls and even on this call, we set a lot of records over several years in the Powder. We routinely drill these Turner wells. These are 2-mile wells, in six to seven days, and our zipper frac operations allow us to complete up to 10 stages a day. So all of that really, really helps, and it really helps deliver a really low finding cost. As you think about the low finding cost, that ends up flowing through to your corporate-level return, so that's going to drive a higher ROCE over time. So really we do have quite a bit of data, and we've got a lot of experience in the basin.","Leo P. Mariani - NatAlliance Securities","Okay, that's helpful. I just wanted to shift gears a little bit over to the Delaware Basin. I just wanted to get you guys to talk a little bit high level about what your exposure is to some of the weaker differentials there, and if you guys are able to maybe get a bunch of those barrels over to the Gulf Coast. And I guess if there is some exposure to the diffs, would you plan to reallocate capital going forward?","D. Lance Terveen - EOG Resources, Inc.","Leo, hey. This is Lance. Hey, thanks for the question. I think you can really see the value of our transportation is really flowing through. When you look at our gas differentials, you can absolutely see for the first quarter and the second quarter relatively very little exposure related to Waha on gas.","And then for the oil differentials, I think what you're seeing there too, we've talked about 25% is subject to the Mid-Cush. But when you look at our transportation that we have, and then when you look at that with our natural hedges that we have operationally and the large focus that we have in the Rockies, big Gulf Coast exposure, it's really distilled, it's really diluted down. So when you really look at the Mid-Cush exposure even for the rest of this year, it's less than 10%. Then you add in our Mid-Cush hedges, we're very well insulated in terms of the differential related to the Permian.","But maybe just to talk about the transportation, we've done an exceptional job there. We've got our Conan terminal. That's up and running full speed. We're going to have five market connections there long term. We're moving barrels to Cushing today. We've got capacity down to Corpus today.","We don't talk a lot about it, but when you think about a lot of the new pipeline expansions that are going to be starting up, starting in late 2019 and then 2020, EOG was a big reason why a lot of those got anchored. When you think about the Sunrise expansion that's going to be starting very quickly going into Cushing, that's EOG. When you think about Gray Oak Pipeline starting up, we're going to have a position behind that with our terminal.","So we think not only 2018 for the rest of this year and then also into 2019 and beyond, especially looking into late 2019 moving into 2020, we're effectively going to have very minimal if any Mid-Cush exposure. And that's the value of having a lot of optionality, because what we've seen in other basins, as you see the infrastructure get built out and somewhat overbuilt, you don't want to have too much exposure into one market. Because as we see things going into 2020, the overbuild situation, you could actually see a lot of strength actually in the Midland local market. So long term we're going to have the flexibility to sell into all those markets.","Leo P. Mariani - NatAlliance Securities","Okay, that's a great answer. Thanks.","Operator","The next question will be from Bob Brackett of Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Robert Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Good morning. Talking a bit about the Powder River Basin, if I think about the way you've talked about those locations, it feels like there's a single landing zone in each of the Mowry and the Niobrara. We know that the Mowry and the Niobrara are regionally extensive, but your acreage footprint is a subset of your total acreage, and you haven't even talked about more than half the targets out in the column there. How should we think about how well refined the numbers are for locations, and what's the potential they could grow?","David W. Trice - EOG Resources, Inc.","Bob, this is David Trice again. On the Niobrara and the Mowry, those do overlap. And so as you think about those, what we've given you there is a subset of our acreage, and it's only the portion that we feel is premium. So all the locations are premium. If you think about how they overlap, pretty much 100% of our Niobrara will be co-developed with the Mowry. So where the Nio is premium, the Mowry is also premium. And then the Mowry footprint is a little bit larger than the Niobrara footprint. And so if you think about that, about 60% to 65% of that area will be co-developed with the Niobrara.","So we haven't really talked a lot about the other zones or anything like that. But that's always something we're working on. We're always testing new zones, trying to find better targets. And currently in both the Niobrara and the Mowry, we're focused predominantly on single zones, but we're also looking at potential to stack or stagger in either of those. So that's an ongoing process as we collect more data and get more tests in the ground.","Robert Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Great, I appreciate it.","Operator","The next question will be from Irene Haas of Imperial Capital. Please go ahead.","Irene Haas - Imperial Capital LLC","If I may, to touch a little bit on South Texas on your Austin Chalk, right now you've got 582,000 net acres in the area. I was just wondering of what percentage is prospective for Chalk, and then in terms of the product mix, oil, gas, and NGL. And can you cherry-pick and move into the more oily and liquids-rich windows?","Ezra Y. Yacob - EOG Resources, Inc.","Irene, this is Ezra Yacob. And as I mentioned in the opening remarks, this quarter we brought on five wells there in the Austin Chalk in South Texas at an average lateral length of about 8,000 feet and over 3,000 barrels of equivalents per day. The oil mix on those was about 87%. And we continue to be very pleased, very happy with our Austin Chalk performance down in the South Texas acreage.","Part of what makes it so prospective down there is that we've collected an awful lot of data while we've been developing and producing the Eagle Ford underneath the Austin Chalk. And so integrating that core data, the log data that we've collected along with our seismic, we've really been able to map out and high-grade where we've been developing the Austin Chalk.","As we've talked about in the past, it's geologically a bit of a complex play. Historically, the industry's success has been pretty inconsistent from well to well as it was more of a fracture play. We've really been focused on the matrix contribution in the Austin Chalk, making it a bit more repeatable. But outside of that, across our acreage and different GORs, I'm not sure if we're prepared to get into those details today.","Irene Haas - Imperial Capital LLC","May I follow up also? With your enhanced oil recovery, it looks like you guys have added some locations this year, maybe a little color on what we should be looking forward to 2019. Is it going to be a consistent program that would be replicated each year? That's all.","Ezra Y. Yacob - EOG Resources, Inc.","Irene, again, we've been very pleased with our EOR performance in South Texas. As you know, that's a process that we really implement after the units or the drilling area is fully developed. And so there is a quicker ramp up over the first few years, and then there will be a little bit of a slowdown as we convert wells because we need to make sure that we're optimally developing for primary recovery.","The production profile so far is falling right in line with our early models. We're expecting to produce an incremental 30% to 70% more than the primary recovery. And this year we're on target to turn over approximately 90 wells onto the EOR process. And as far as the forecast out in 2019, I don't think we're prepared to give guidance on that at this time.","Irene Haas - Imperial Capital LLC","Thank you.","Operator","The next question will be from Christine Alfonso of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hi, it's Brian Singer actually. Thanks, good morning. I wanted to stick in the Eagle Ford for the first question here. You added 145 new premium locations, but still have substantial locations not classified as premium. Could you talk to the level of certainty that those non-premium locations could or will not become premium? And can you address your latest thoughts on well spacing in the Eagle Ford?","Ezra Y. Yacob - EOG Resources, Inc.","Brian, this is Ezra again. Hopefully, I'll hit on all those points here. In the Eagle Ford, so the first thing I'd mention is that inventory update for the Eagle Ford and the Delaware Basin, that's a snapshot in time. We continue, between lowering well costs through operational efficiencies and increasing well productivity, continue to see and feel good about our ability to convert non-premium wells into the premium status. To date, we've got 7,200 total wells in our provided guidance on the Eagle Ford, and those are actual sticks on a map, with 2,300 of those approximately as premium, about 2,600 of those as drilled wells. And so that leaves roughly about 2,000 wells that are currently non-premium. And with the advancements we've made just in the last few years on the operational efficiencies, I think we feel very good about being able to convert a large portion of those.","I mentioned in the opening remarks, we're averaging 10,000-foot laterals drilled out in the western Eagle Ford, and we brought on 22 wells this quarter at that treated lateral length. And those wells were actually drilled in less than seven days' time, again, in that precision target of just a 20-foot window. And so that combined with our geologic understanding and our completions methodology should really keep that stimulation near wellbore and complex. I feel very good about increasing well productivity also.","And then the second part of the question was on the spacing side. That's right. We're developing currently between 330 to 500-foot spacing across the Eagle Ford. A lot of that is dependent on the different geologic trends that we're in, whether we're in the east or the west, whether or not there's more or less faulting in the area. Again, we strive not to get into a one-size-fits-all manufacturing mode. That's exactly what we don't want to do. We try to integrate as much data as we collect, and we remain flexible to adjust our drilling patterns and our targeting based on the local geology across the asset base.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great, thank you. And my follow-up also is on the topic of spacing but shifting to the Delaware and the Wolfcamp. You've highlighted over multiple quarters the expectations that the industry could struggle a bit here on parent-child issues and spacing tests. And here you're highlighting favorable results from your 440-foot spacing test in the Wolfcamp. Can you talk more about the implications of that, if any, across your acreage, how much acreage could be developed potentially at that spacing? And can you remind us what's built into your premium locations and what milestone set you're looking for further?","Ezra Y. Yacob - EOG Resources, Inc.","Brian, this is Ezra again. Let me start with your last question there. Our type curve for the Wolfcamp oil window is \u2013 and that's across 226,000 acres in the oil window \u2013 that's a 1.3 million barrel of equivalent gross type curve on a 7,000-foot lateral at 660-foot spacing. And that type curve of course is an average across the 220,000 acres. And so what we've highlighted over the last couple of quarters are we've been trying to optimize our spacing, really with a focus on maximizing the NPV for our acreage position. We've been happy year to date with our progress there. All of our Wolfcamp wells are performing at or above the type curve that we've released. So we're very, very pleased with that.","Really what happens across the play, I think the way to think about it is, especially in the Delaware Basin, the geology is pretty complex. There's just an abundance of targets. And so again, similar to how I referenced the Eagle Ford, the last thing we want to do is get going too fast and get into a manufacturing mode. I think the 440-foot spacing highlighted on the Quanah Parkers highlights a good spacing for that area and that geology where those targets are applicable. I think with as many targets as there is in the Delaware Basin and in the Wolfcamp, we think there's a tremendous amount of upside, but we're happy with what we've released right now. And as we gather more data and have more details for you, we'll certainly update you.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great, thank you.","Operator","The next question will be from Michael Scialla of Stifel. Please go ahead.","Michael Stephen Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Good morning. Lance, you mentioned in your prepared remarks about the midstream in the Powder River. It sounds like you're going to build out your own gathering system and there's plenty of processing capacity, but I was wondering. It looks like there's going to be a lot of gas coming out of the play. What are your thoughts about the end markets for that gas? Where is most of that going to go?","D. Lance Terveen - EOG Resources, Inc.","Great question, Michael. One thing to remember too, we've been operating down here for a long time, so we actually have existing capacity on the intra-state systems there today. And as you think about a lot of that residue gas, it makes its way down to Cheyenne. And then from Cheyenne, we have other transportation arrangements that we can move further downstream from there too.","So again, as we've look back over time, when we look at making commitments, we're going to be really very disciplined about it. We're looking at all the macro things, what's going on up in Wyoming. We're looking at all the takeaway on the pipes. And then we also want to be very careful just from a transportation standpoint. We don't want to make transportation commitments at some different rates. As we know, things are going to change. Basis is going to change over time.","So I'd say to get you comfortable there, we're aware and familiar of all the markets. We've been operating and marketing in that area for a long time. And then as we look at layering in additional capacity over time, we're going to be very disciplined on that and ensure that it matches up. And like we've said in the past, we typically like to have anywhere from 70% to 80% of coverage for the first three to five years because your crystal ball so far looking out and what's happening out in the macro environment and with pricing. And so that's traditionally how we like to set things up from a capacity standpoint looking forward.","Michael Stephen Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Good, thanks for that. And I was just wondering, any update on the Anadarko-Woodford? You guys had talked about it the prior quarter, but not much this quarter. I'm just wondering where that stands.","David W. Trice - EOG Resources, Inc.","Michael, this is David Trice. So on the Woodford, we were reasonably active there in the second quarter. We brought on a number of wells late in the quarter, including two four-well packages of wells that are going to be spacing tests. And so as you know, what we really like about that play is the high oil cut and the low decline nature of the play. So really coming out with 24-hour IPs are really not that beneficial. So what we're really looking to do is provide a little more color in the next quarter on those larger packages.","Michael Stephen Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Very good, thank you.","Operator","The next question will be from David Heikkinen of Heikkinen Energy Advisors. Please go ahead.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Good morning, guys, a couple in the weeds questions. You commented that you had two Wolfcamp targets in the 440-foot testing. What was the hypotenuse between those? I know you gave the lateral at 440.","Ezra Y. Yacob - EOG Resources, Inc.","David, this is Ezra. You caught me off-guard with the hypotenuse. I will say in the vertical sense, the spacing between those two targets is approximately 120 feet. And so 120x440, you can do the math.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Yes. And then your operating expense guidance was up due to the higher workover expenses, and you expect that to trend down as your larger pads get normalized. One question, for the offset wells post-workover, did they come back to the prior production levels before they were frac-impacted?","Lloyd W. Helms, Jr. - EOG Resources, Inc.","David, this is Billy Helms. What we've experienced in our plays is we are successful in getting those wells pretty much back to what they were producing prior to the frac hits. I think one thing we've noticed in some of the plays is production from the offsets can increase. But in general, they do tend to come back to what they were producing prior to the cleanouts. And sometimes, it just takes a little longer in certain plays to react.","We've learned a lot about how to manage those larger packages of wells and the lumpy nature of the production that we see as a result of those and then how to best manage the offset production and clean out the wellbores. So that's why it gives us confidence that our expense workover costs are going to trend down through the rest of the year.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","How much downtime did you have, like how many barrels was that? I was just curious, in the second quarter.","Lloyd W. Helms, Jr. - EOG Resources, Inc.","It varies certainly by play and also it varies a lot between \u2013 so it's hard to give you a specific answer. But in each play, the amount of depletion that you have from that offset production prior to coming in with the new package affects it. The well spacing, the targeting, and how big the fracs are that you're putting on the new wells, all those play a role in how much the production is down. So it's hard to give you a specific number really based on that.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","All right. Thanks, guys.","Operator","The next question will be from Robert Morris of Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great, thanks. I think you've hit on almost all my questions. But I just guess following up, Ezra, you mentioned that the type curve is 1.3 million barrels gross for a 7,000-foot lateral on 660-acre spacing on the Wolfcamp A. As you go down to 440-foot spacing, I know slide 14 gives it on a 5,000-foot lateral basis, but what would you anticipate the degradation in the per-well EOR as you go to that tighter spacing?","Ezra Y. Yacob - EOG Resources, Inc.","Robert, this is Ezra. So it's a little bit difficult to quantify. That 1.3 million barrels is an average across our 220,000 acres. Right now, the Quanah Parkers are outperforming that type curve on the 440. I don't want to mislead you and suggest that we're thinking 440-foot spacing is the correct spacing going forward across the entire 226,000 net acre position.","Like I said, that's exactly the route that we prefer not to go down to is to get into a manufacturing mode. We really integrate our completions data, our reservoir data, and our geology most importantly to right-size each of these well packages for the area that we're drilling in. This is the approach that we have taken really in each of our plays that we've been developing throughout the 15 years we've been developing unconventional horizontal plays. And so hopefully that gives you a little bit of color on the 440 there on the Quanah Parkers.","Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","I appreciate it. I understand. It's a lot of data, and it's very complicated. So I appreciate that. Thanks.","Operator","And, ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude our question-and-answer session.

At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to the Chief Financial Officer of EOG Resources, Mr. Tim Driggers. Please go ahead, sir.","Tim Driggers","Thank you. Good morning. Thanks for joining us. We hope everyone has seen the press release announcing third quarter 2014 earnings and operational results.","This conference call includes forward-looking statements. The risks associated with forward-looking statements have been outlined in the earnings release and EOG's SEC filings, and we incorporate those by reference for this call.","This conference call also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation schedules for these non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures can be found on our website at www.eogresources.com.","The SEC permits oil and gas companies in their filings with the SEC to disclose not only proved reserves, but also probable reserves, as well as possible reserves. Some of the reserve estimates on this conference call and webcast may include potential reserves or other estimated reserves not necessarily calculated in accordance with or contemplated by the SEC's reserve reporting guidelines.","We incorporate by reference the cautionary note to U.S. investors that appears at the bottom of our press release and Investor Relations page of our website.","Participating on the call this morning are, Bill Thomas, Chairman and CEO; Billy Helms, Executive VP, Exploration and Production; David Trice, Executive VP, Exploration and Production; and Mario Baldwin, Vice President, IR; and Lance Terveen, Vice President, Marketing Operations.","An updated IR presentation was posted to our website yesterday evening and we included fourth quarter and full year guidance in yesterday's press release. This morning we will discuss topics in the following order. I will first review our 2014 third quarter net income and discretionary cash flow, and then Bill Thomas, David Trice and Billy Helms will provide operational results, I\u2019ll then address EOG's financials, capital structure and hedge position. Finally, Bill Thomas will provide concluding remarks.","As outlined in our press release, for the third quarter 2014, EOG reported net income of $1,103.6 million or $2.01 per share. EOG's third quarter 2014 adjusted non-GAAP net income, which eliminates the mark-to-market impacts and certain non-recurring items as outlined in the press release was $720.6 million or $1.31 per share.","Non-GAAP discretionary cash flow for the third quarter was $2.2 billion. At September 30, 2014, the debt-to-total cap ratio was 25%. Adjusting for cash the net debt-to-total cap ratio was 20%, down from 23% at December 31.","I\u2019ll now turn it over to Bill Thomas to discuss operational results and key plays.","Bill Thomas","Thanks, Tim. EOG continues to deliver outstanding production growth and financial metrics by consistently executing on our strategy of investing in high return organic crude oil growth. For the third quarter, all three of our productions components exceeded our expectations and are unit costs were below our forecast.","Total company crude oil and condensate production was up 27% for the third quarter and 33% compared to the first nine months of 2013. Total liquids production, including NGLs increased 27% for the third quarter and 31% for the first nine months.","Based on these results, we are raising our full year crude oil growth target for the second time this year to 31% from 29%. We are increasing our total company production growth target of 16.5% from 14% based on outperformance from our Eagle Ford and Delaware Basin assets. I will now address the Eagle Ford, then David Trice will provide an operational update on the Permian, and Billy Helms will discuss the Bakken and Rockies plays.","In the Eagle Ford, I can characterize our current activity in three points. One, the Eagle Ford is on track for multiyear growth; two, we continue to make enhancements in completion; and three, the Eagle Ford is the industry's best crude oil asset and we\u2019ve captured the sweet spot. I\u2019ll now address each point in more detail.","First one, the Eagle Ford is on a growth trend for the next 10 years. On the May earnings call, we indicated our model was based on making a modest increase to 520 net wells we had initially planned this year and holding net well count flat through 2004. In this scenario, the oil production rose for 10 years, based on our production this year, we are set up to achieve this upward growth curve.","Second point, our well quality continues to improve with completion enhancements, even after five years, we are still experimenting with completion designs and we continue to see improved well productivity and higher overall MPB. Our completions are customized for specific rock properties not only in each well, but in each and every stage within the well.","We've been testing what we call high-density frac. In one area, we saw a 39% improvement in well productivity from this new frac design, relative to adjacent wells. Year-to-date, we have seen a 10% average improvement in well performance from our Western Eagle Ford acreage drilling activity. We have included illustrations in our accompanying IR slides for reference.","Third point, the Eagle Ford continues to be the industries and EOG\u2019s premiere crude play in North America for both production growth and financial returns. Our drilling program will remain very profitable, despite fluctuations in oil process.","At $80 oil, the eagle ford will still generate direct after-tax rates of return in excess of 100%. At less than $40 oil, we would still achieve a minimum 10% direct a-tax rate of return. The Eagle Ford remains EOG\u2019s highest rate of return asset.","While we still see some cost pressure and completion services, we are able to control costs increases largely with our self-source sand and other completion materials. We also continue to make progress reducing drilling days during the second and third quarter. Year-to-date, we\u2019ve decreased our average drilling days by 12% in the Eagle Ford.","One final point, we would caution those who used monthly Texas Railroad Commission's state data as a measure of company current production and a forecasting tool for future production. Remember, the State Data tends to lag and it\u2019s potentially incomplete on a month-to-month basis for a variety of reasons.","To wrap up the Eagle Ford, EOG\u2019s long-term oil growth will be anchored by this world class asset, where we are still improving well productivity through new completion designs and by lowering well costs.","I will now turn it over to David Trice to discuss EOG\u2019s activity in the Permian.","David Trice","Thanks, Bill. In the Delaware Basin, we continue to test and drill step out wells to confirm the viability of each of our three plays across our acreage. In the Wolfcamp, we had exciting news in the third quarter. After testing some of our Northern Delaware Basin acreage, we confirm that a majority of it is in the highly over-pressured crude oil window where we expect the wells to be 50% crude oil.","We completed two upper Wolfcamp horizontal wells, which flow 46 degree API gravity crude oil. The Voyager 15 number 3H was completed at a maximum oil rate of 1,890 barrels of oil per day, with 385 barrels per day of NGLs and 2.5 million cubic feet a day of natural gas from a 4,400 foot-treated lateral. The well had a 30-day average rate of 1,500 barrels of oil per day with 365 barrel per day of NGLs and 2.3 million cubic feet of gas per day.","The Voyager is located along the Texas, New Mexico Stateline in Loving County, Texas. EOG has a 48% working interest in this well. The Diamond SM 36 State number 1H flowed at a maximum rate of 1,340 barrels of oil per day, 195 barrels per day of NGLs and 1.3 million cubic feet of gas from a 2,200 foot-treated lateral. This well is north of the Voyager in Lee County, New Mexico in the heart of our Red Hills acreage and EOG has 100% working interest in this well.","We\u2019ve done some preliminary G&G work and have confirm that 90,000 net acres of our hydrated 140,000 net acres in the Delaware Wolfcamp are in a highly over-pressured crude oil window. We plan to increase our Wolfcamp drilling activity in this crude oil window, where we expect to achieve reinvestment returns much higher than the combo window and competitive with our second Bone Spring Sand and Leonard plays.","In the second Bone Springs Sand, we drilled our third well in the Red Hills area during the third quarter. It was a 20-mile step out from our first two wells to further confirm the viability of our acreage. The State Magellan number 2H near the Stateline in Loving County, Texas was completed with a 4,900 foot-treated lateral and flowed at a maximum rate of 1,825 barrels oil per day of 44 degree API gravity oil with associated production of 295 barrels of NGLs per day and 2.2 million cubic feet of gas per day. These wells are 70% crude oil.","The State Magellan well gives us additional confidence in the plays they will extend and following additional geological work on our existing acreage, we\u2019ve increased the prospectivity of the second Bone Spring Sand to at least 90,000 net acres. The Leonard Shale also continues to deliver solid well results. In the third quarter, we turned the State Pathfinder 1H to sales with the maximum rate of 1,370 barrels of oil per day, 245 barrels per day of NGLs and 1.3 million cubic feet of gas per day. The well was part of the 450 foot spacing test and has a 4800 foot-treated lateral.","Going forward, we plan to develop the Leonard 300 to 450 foot spacing. We've also modestly increased our holdings to 80,000 net acres in this play. We plan to increase our activity in the Delaware Basin from four rigs at the end of the third quarter to eight rigs by year end. We plan to drill additional wells in the Wolfcamp second Bone Spring Sand and Leonard then anticipate in our original plan.","To summarize our activity in the Delaware, we had a very promising result after drilling our first two oil wells in the crude oil window in the Wolfcamp where we have 90,000 net acres. With an additional data point, we are getting further confidence in the second Bone Springs Sand and we continue to deliver excellent wells result from the Leonard, even as we further downspace the wells. With these three outstanding plays, EOG is well-positioned for higher rate return crude oil growth in the Permian for many years.","I will now turn it over to Billy Helms to discuss the Bakken and the Rockies.","Billy Helms","Thanks, David. We began our downspacing campaign in the Bakken Core at the beginning of the year by systematically testing spacing patterns, starting at 1,300 feet between wells. With confidence from the production profiles of the 1,300 foot spaced wells, we begin testing 700 foot spacing earlier this year and now have data from the wells that have been producing for four to seven months.","Simultaneous with downspacing, we have seen improvements in well productivity after introducing new completion technology to the field. We are encouraged by early indications from the 700 foot spaced wells, but we need additional time to assess the impact on long-term production, reserves and ultimately the net present value. We also have product spacing test with 500 foot and 300 foot patterns to determine the optimal spacing to maximize the net present value of the field.","We noted a number of new core wells in our press release, the Parshall 44-1004H came on line at 2,710 barrels of oil per day, with 875 Mcf per day of rich natural gas and the Parshall 46-1004H came on line at 2,105 barrels of oil per day with 860 Mcf per day of rich natural gas. We have 69% working interest in both of these wells. As we noted in our press release, in the Antelope Extension area, we had success from the Three Forks -- first, second and third benches.","We completed our first well in the third bench of the Three Forks, the Mandaree 134-05H, which came on line at 1,410 barrels of oil per day with 2.2 million cubic feet of natural gas. We have 70% working interest in this well. We will continue testing the potential of the Three Forks across our Antelope acreage and we will expand our Three Forks testing in the core in 2015.","In the DJ Basin, we completed our first seven-well development pattern on a multi-well pad, consisting of four Niobrara and three Codell wells. The wells were drilled with long laterals spaced at approximately 700 feet between wells in the same zone. The seven wells came on line at a combined rate in excess of 7,800 barrels of oil per day with 5.4 million cubic feet per day of rich natural gas. We have 75% working interest in these wells.","We plan to test spacing patterns in various completion tasks for the balance of the year. Early production results verify initial type curves and provide confirmation of our EUR estimates. This program is delivering consistent initial production rates of 1,000 barrels of oil per day per well. We are rapidly climbing the operational learning curve in this play and expect to achieve our well cost targets in the near-term.","In the Powder River Basin, we have maintained our one rig program and are on track to drill 34 net wells this year, targeting the Parkman and Turner reservoirs. In the Turner Sand, we completed two wells, the Mary's Draw 24-13H and 25-13H, for a combined rate of 1,880 barrels of oil per day, with 3.1 million cubic feet per day of rich natural gas.","We have one new well from the Parkman. The Mary's Draw 412-1527H came on line at 1,190 barrels of oil per day, with 270 Mcf per day of rich gas. In Trinidad, we are actively drilling out three net well development program which will allow us to maintain flat natural gas production in coming years.","I will now turn it over to Tim Driggers to discuss financials and capital structure.","Tim Driggers","Thanks, Billy. For the third quarter, capitalized interest was $14.5 million. Total cash exploration and development expenditures were $2.0 billion, excluding asset retirement obligations. In addition, expenditures for gathering systems, processing plants and other property, plant and equipment were $184 million.","Year-to-date total exploration and development expenditures were $5.8 million, excluding asset retirement obligations. Expenditures for gathering, processing plants and other property, plant and equipment were $587 million.","We had $17 million of proceeds from asset sales during the quarter and there were no acquisitions. At the end of September, total debt outstanding was $5.9 billion. At September 30, we had $1.5 billion of cash on hand. The effective tax rate for the third quarter was 36% and the deferred tax ratio was 81%.","Yesterday we included a guidance table with earnings press release for the fourth quarter and full year 2014. For the fourth quarter and full year, the effective tax rate is estimated to be 32% to 37% and 34% to 37% respectively. We have also provided an estimated range of the dollar amount at current taxes that we expect to report during the fourth quarter and for the full year.","In terms of our hedge positions, for the period November 1 through December 31, 2014 EOG has crude oil financial price swap contracts in place for 192,000 barrels of oil per day at weighted average price of $96.15 per barrel. For the first half of 2015, we have 47,000 barrels per day of crude oil hedge at an average price of $91.22 per barrel. For the second half of 2015, EOG has 10,000 barrels per day of crude oil hedge at an average price of $89.98 per barrel.

For the same period, we have a 175,000 MMBtu per day of options that could be exercised by our counterparties at an average price of $4.51 per MMBtu for each month.","Now I will turn it back to Bill to discuss EOG\u2019s overview for 2015 and provide the summary.","Bill Thomas","Thanks, Tim. Now for our 2015 overview. Although our planning process won't be complete until the beginning of the year, I want to provide some color regarding our 2015 capital allocation.","EOG has key positions in the top domestic crude oil plays. We have tremendous reinvestment opportunities in the Eagle Ford, Bakken and Delaware Basin that will generate after-tax rates of return of 100% or greater at $80 WTI. We\u2019ve added a new chart to our presentation showing the minimum oil price that would be required to generate a 10% direct after-tax rate of return.","At $40 oil, we would still achieve a 10% direct after-tax rate of return in the Eagle Ford, the Bakken\/Three Forks and the Delaware plays. Our 2015 plan is to manage a balanced CapEx cash flow program, with CapEx plus dividends in line with cash flow. Our strategy will remain the same. EOG will be fiscally prudent with low net debt and a very strong balance sheet.","At $80 oil, w should have sufficient cash flow to fully fund our Eagle Ford, Bakken and Delaware Basin plays and sustain double-digit oil growth through 2017 and beyond. We plan to invest in our highest return crude oil plays and reduce our activity in our combo plays. We still expect to be a leader in organic growth -- crude oil growth next year.","The dividend continues to be a high priority. Our Board remains committed to increasing shareholder return through both high return production growth and dividend growth.","Now let me conclude there are four important takeaways from this call. First, we talked about our key plays for a couple years, the Eagle Ford, Bakken, and Delaware Basin Leonard. Today\u2019s call has highlighted these three plays and our ability to improve our results with leading-edge completion technology. We continue to make better wells by lowering costs with self-sourced sand and drilling efficiencies. Our excellent base of key plays keeps getting better.","Second, as a result of continuous productivity improvement in the Eagle Ford and Delaware Basin, we have increased our oil growth target for the second time this year.","Third, we continue to organically add new high return plays to our drilling portfolio as well as high grading existing plays through improved completions, enhanced targeting and the identification of sweet spots on our acreage. The second Bone Spring Sand and Delaware Wolfcamp oil plays are good examples of this strategy. Although we are expanding our portfolio, the Eagle Ford will remain our foundation, a high return production growth driver for many years.","And finally, EOG is focused on returns and our large high-quality drilling portfolio still generates exceptional returns with $80 oil. With best-in-class horizontal crude oil assets and a strong balance sheet, EOG will continue to be a leader in absolute organic U.S. crude oil production growth in 2015 and beyond.","Thanks for listening. And now, we will go to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) And we will take our first question from Doug Leggate with Bank of America.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America","Thank you. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for all the additional color on the presentation this morning. Bill, I have got one question on CapEx and maybe one for Billy on Permian.","On CapEx you guys have become very well-known as living within cash flow. Obviously with the oil price down and given some fairy consistent production guidance for next year, how should we think about your spending relative to cash flow given your strong balance sheet? Do you intend to still live within cash flow or would you allow the spending to go up a little bit given the strength of your balance sheet?","Bill Thomas","Yes, good morning, Doug. And thanks for the question. Next year we need to be thinking about continuing to have a very strong balance sheet. And as we talked about in opening remarks, our capital spending plus the dividend will be balanced our cash flow. So the discipline spending fundamentals of the company are not going to change, as we go forward. And we\u2019re only focused in reinvesting in highest return plays. And we are not really interested in exceeding cash flow by trying to accelerate production in the combo plays or certainly not the gas plays.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America","So I guess just to be clear, I mean, I guess the overall level of activity though and the overall price environment, is it fair to assume that the overall drilling activity would have to slow? So I\u2019m guessing bigger wells but fewer wells if you see what I mean?","Bill Thomas","Yeah. As we look just -- let's just assume, Doug, if we have an $80 oil environment next year we\u2019re going to be have enough cash flow to fully fund our Eagle Ford, Bakken and our Delaware program. So all of those programs generate in excess of 100% rate of return at $80 oil.","What we would cut back on is the combo plays certainly the Barnett Combo, some of our drilling in South Texas, in the Mid-Continent, in East Texas and even in the Permian where we have the Wolfcamp Combo. We would not spend as much money in those.","But we need to be thinking that we would fully fund the Eagle Ford, the Bakken and the Delaware Basin plays and that we would have very strong double-digit production growth next year, oil growth and we would continue to be a leader in organic oil growth in the U.S.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America","Thanks for that. My follow-up hopefully, quickly is on Permian. I guess, first of all congratulations on your very strong results there. It\u2019s been underlying by the step-up in the rig count. But I think historically, you\u2019ve raised some question about infrastructure constraints. So I\u2019m just wondering with your move to four to eight rigs, do you not believe this result any restrictions on EOG or is that still an issue for the basin as a whole, now even there? Thank you.","David Trice","","Doug, this is David. On the Permian, the great thing is we've got three plays there, they\u2019re all really high rate of return. And they\u2019re each slightly different. And so we've got a lot of options there as far as play selection. For instance, the Second Bone Spring Sand tends to be a lower QR play and so that gives us a lot of options, if there is any type of gas takeaway restrictions or anything. So we\u2019ve got a lot of options -- we\u2019ve got a lot of options on the marketing side. I\u2019ll let Lance follow up with the marketing question.","Lance Terveen","Yeah, Doug, just to follow up on -- I mean, it\u2019s very encouraging on the midstream infrastructure that\u2019s going to be come online, especially over the next year or so. We\u2019ve really aligned ourselves with the new capacity that\u2019s going to be coming online. So it might be a little bit of potential as the new timing comes on. It could be a little tight, but we\u2019ve contracted ourselves and aligned ourselves with a lot of these midstream providers that we feel at this time are going to be in good shape.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America","I appreciate the answers guys. Thank you.","Operator","(Operator Instructions) And we\u2019ll take our next question from Leo Mariani with RBC Capital Markets.","Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets","Hey, guys. I was hoping that you could kind of talk to a little bit of a dynamics around your fourth quarter U.S. oil production guidance. Kind of looking at what you guys have laid out, my math is indicating about the 0 to 2% sequential oil growth in U.S. You guys did about 7% in the third quarter versus 2Q sequential growth. Can you maybe just kind of address why the lower growth on the fourth quarter?","Bill Thomas","Yeah. Good morning, Doug -- I mean, Leo. That\u2019s a good question. Thank you for that. In the fourth quarter, our production growth is really highly predicated on timing of the completions. And so we have a good number of wells. The majority of the wells will come on very late in the quarter and most of them -- a lot of them will be in December. So when you bring them on late in the year, obviously they don\u2019t add as much impact to the quarter.","Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets","Okay. That\u2019s helpful for sure. I guess, in terms of the Permian plays, it looks like you guys certainly have made a step forward there recently. I guess couple just sort of quick questions around that. Just trying to get a sense of kind of what kind of inning you\u2019re in there? I mean obviously, you\u2019ve been at the Eagle Ford for quite a bit longer than the Delaware Basin. And additionally, can you maybe talk to potential improvements there that you might see down the road in EURs and well cost? And is there any potential to add more acreage?","David Trice","Yeah. Leo, this is David. I would say on the Permian, we've been very deliberate on testing new zones and testing the extent to these other plays. And I would say, we\u2019re very early on. We\u2019re probably third or fourth inning if you want to put it in baseball terms.","And so we\u2019re going to continue to aggressively test these new zones and the extent of these plays and test the spacing of these plays. And potentially, to go to your second part of your question, with oil prices at $8o there is potential going forward that we could add some acreage.","Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets","That\u2019s really helpful. Thanks guys.","Operator","The next question is from Paul Sankey with Wolfe Research.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research","Hi. Good morning, everyone. There was an interesting inflation point coming in terms of free cash flows to you guys. And now we\u2019ve had this inflation point with the oil price. I think what you\u2019re saying clearly is that you will have trimmed back your CapEx in some of the more marginal areas. If oil prices were surprising the upside next year, would you be pushing perhaps towards generating free cash flow for cash return to shareholders? Or do you think you'd reaccelerate your activity? Thanks.","Bill Thomas","Yeah. Thank you, Paul. Good morning.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research","Good morning.","Bill Thomas","As we think about 2015, obviously our goal is to fully fund the Eagle Ford, Bakken and the Permian plays but those very high returns. But we\u2019re going to also continue to be very committed to the dividend and dividend growth. We\u2019ve had 15 years that we\u2019ve increased the dividend 16 times in 15 years and we don\u2019t expect that pattern to decrease as we go forward.","So we're always focused on returning value to the shareholders through that way. Obviously, with better prices next year that would help us to fully fund more drilling, but we\u2019re very confident even with the low price environment we\u2019re going to be able to have very strong double-digit growth going forward and continue to be a leader in U.S. organic production growth.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research","I guess, my point was you\u2019re already a leader in the organic production growth. Wouldn\u2019t you be now in the situation where at the margin you would be looking for even more rapid increases in cash return as opposed to extending your leading growth?","Bill Thomas","Yeah. I think that\u2019s something that our Board will certainly consider as we go forward. And there obviously, as we look at the commodity price next year, the higher the price the more flexibility. We\u2019ll have to work on the dividend as well as increase drilling activity in some of other plays.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research","Sure. I\u2019ve got you. And then the second follow-up question is that we\u2019ve had an interesting announcement from BHP today with regards to exports. I assume it\u2019s not a coincidence at the same time as the Republicans taken control of the Senate. Can you just give your perspective on that move and what it means to you? Thank you.","Lance Terveen","Hey, Paul. It\u2019s Lance. Obviously, we\u2019re closely watching everything that\u2019s going on out in the market. But a lot of what you\u2019re seeing is on ultralight oil, which is very high gravity condensate. And we look at our three big plays, essentially EOG has very, very little condensate. So we really have an ability to blend -- the condensating with our crude oil, so kind of a follow-up there. We are going to continue to watch it and strike as necessary?","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research","But the actual export is less relevant to you as such in terms of your own activity.","Bill Thomas","","That\u2019s correct, Paul.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Joe Allman with J.P. Morgan.","Joe Allman - J.P. Morgan","Thank you, Operator, and good early morning everybody.","Bill Thomas","Good morning, Joe.","Joe Allman - J.P. Morgan","So just a clarification on the plans for 2015 spending. So are you saying that you plan to spend within the cash flow from operations or potentially would you be contemplating some assets sales and help fund some CapEx?","Bill Thomas","Yes, Joe. We are going to keep the cash flow in balance with the CapEx, plus the dividend. But also, we\u2019ve sold properties over the years and that is something that we will be considering next year also those. Obviously, the kind of non core properties, properties that will help us to be more efficient as the company reducing LOE cost and properties that don\u2019t have scale, that don\u2019t have maybe the potential of some of the others. So, yeah, that will be part of our plans next year is continue to sell additional properties.","Joe Allman - J.P. Morgan","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then a follow-up. In the Eagle Ford, the high-density frac results were pretty impressive. So what are the main parameters around the high-density fracs that really give you that uplift from even, early this year production results?","Bill Thomas","Yeah. These are new techniques, Joe, and they are experimental and really proprietary. So we don\u2019t want to give out a lot of details on what we are doing other than to say that we\u2019ve made significant improvement in distributing the frac more evenly along the lateral. And that has contacted more rock and we have this one example in our IR book. It\u2019s on slide 26. You may want to look at that in detail.","But it shows 2014 wells, the kind of the current completion practices versus several of these high-density fracs in close proximity. The wells are in close proximity and there is a 39% increase in the first 60-days. So we are very excited about it. And we\u2019ve only completed high-density fracs on really kind of a handful of wells. So as we go forward, this gives us a lot of encouragement that there is still considerable room left to go in the Eagle Ford and really all this plays on improvements and completion technology.","Joe Allman - J.P. Morgan","All right. Very impressive. Thank you, Bill.","Operator","Our next question is from Bob Brackett with Sanford C. Bernstein.","Bob Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein","If we stayed in a lower crude price environment through next year, what would your interest be in acquiring distressed assets or operators that might be in trouble?","Bill Thomas","Good morning, Bob. Yes, good question. EOG is our focus and our success has been really generating new potential through organic exploration and we see no lack of opportunity in that direction. And those were able to generate -- we generated five new plays this year. And we have a good list going forward that we have -- we are hopeful, we will be good addition to the company at very low cost. And so the acquisition businesses as you all know, historically, there is a lot of competition in M&As and acquisitions and usually they turn out to be very, very low return. So we are going continue to maintain our focus on growing the company organically through exploration and low-cost, acreage acquisitions in that process","Bob Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein","Okay. Thanks. And you\u2019ve had a couple competitors talk about East Taxes a bit more in the last quarter. You\u2019ve got a position up there, how does that stack in your portfolio or is it still too early to know?","Bill Thomas","Bob. That\u2019s again a yes. It's too early to know there. And we as everybody knows, we are drilling wells there and we are testing concepts. And when we have meaningful results on that, we will be able to update everybody on. But it\u2019s still really early and as we\u2019ve talked about before, we have a very high cutoff because our asset quality is so strong in the company. We are not interested in going forward with plays that would generate less than a 50% return. So we are working on only plays and spending a lot of money in going forward with very high-quality play. So we are taking our time and we\u2019ll let everybody know when we have some meaningful results.","Bob Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein","Thanks.","Operator","The next question comes from Irene Haas with Wunderlich Securities.","Irene Haas - Wunderlich Securities","Yes. Hey, guys. This is really interesting. So it\u2019s becoming sort of a mining operation. So, I am curious as to, as you continue to improve these resource plays, for example in the Eagle Ford, what percent recovery we are up to, like right now our with your assessments?","Bill Thomas","Yeah. Good morning, Irene. In the Eagle Ford, we have quit giving a percent recovery factor there because we are still, I think trying to relook at what the oil in places there. But it\u2019s certainly going up all the time. And we continue, as we showed and demonstrated in some of the charts and we\u2019ve talked about this morning. We continue to make very significant increases in the completion technology and being able just to contact more rock along the lateral and keep the contact closer to the wellbore, so that we can drill additional wells closer together as you go forward, and So we think we are in about the sixth inning in the Eagle Ford and so there is a lot of room left to go there.","Irene Haas - Wunderlich Securities","Great. If I have one follow-up, I\u2019m going to hit you up on your macro view in this very volatile time?","Bill Thomas","Are you talking about the price of oil?","Irene Haas - Wunderlich Securities","Yeah. Oil, gas, yeah because usually you guys would have few lines on that.","Bill Thomas","Yeah. We are pretty good at some things, but the world oil supply demand situation is not an area that we have a lot of expertise in. And a special insight and we read a lot of the same reports and follow the same analytics that many of you do and we are going to kind of leave it up to them, to kind of give direction to others, a lot of opinions out there on what oil prices could do.","Irene Haas - Wunderlich Securities","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Pearce Hammond with Simmons & Company.","Pearce Hammond - Simmons & Company","Good morning.","Bill Thomas","Good morning, Pearce.","Pearce Hammond - Simmons & Company","What level of flexibility do you have regarding oil services like rigs and completion crudes, et cetera, in your contracts if you need to adjust activity in a low oil price environment?","Bill Thomas","Yes, Pears. Good question. We have about 33%, about a third of our frac spreads are under long-term contracts. And about 50% of our drilling rigs are under long-term contracts companywide. So we have a lot of flexibility to lower activity, if we need to or increase activity if that is wanted. And we also have a lot of flexibility to take advantages of any kind of price decreases that may happen and we are already beginning to see especially in the frac equipment business and we are already seeing some price reductions and certainly, if prices stay at these levels, we could see a bit more that going forward.","Pearce Hammond - Simmons & Company","Thank you. And then my follow-up, is under a low oil price environment, will you prioritize away from exploration and focus more on development? And then, as a leader, how do you balance the need for exploration to drive future growth of the company with lower cash flows and the need to maybe focus on development?","Bill Thomas","On that, Pearce, as we go forward and if we stay in a fairly low price environment, we don\u2019t really expect to pullback on much of our exploration efforts, because they are really, really low cost. Our entry cost on these plays is extremely low because we are upfront in areas where nobody really else is looking. So we don\u2019t expect to have a significant pullback on that.","We are generating significant amount of new inventory each year. This year we\u2019ve generated two times the amount of drilling inventory that we\u2019ve actually drilled this year, some of that, of course, is in the existing plays, but again, already generated in new plays too.","So the company is a very prolific organic prospect generating machine. And we think it\u2019s -- we can continue to do that as very, very low cost. As we -- in the last few years our exploration costs have been relatively low in the company and a very small part of our budget.","Pearce Hammond - Simmons & Company","Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question is from Arun Jayaram of Credit Suisse.","Arun Jayaram - Credit Suisse","","Good morning. Bill, I wanted to get your thoughts on the overall development strategy from here in the Eagle Ford? I know you have 6,000 locations, you\u2019re drilling 520, 540 wells per annum? So I just wanted to get your thoughts on how you develop it from here? I guess, the reason I ask that question is I have noted that you have down shifted activity in the last couple of quarters in Gonzales County. And perhaps, increase some activity on the western side of the play (indiscernible). So just trying to get some thoughts on, how do you move playing on the rigs news, et cetera?","Bill Thomas","Yeah. Good morning, Arun. Thank you for that question. As we go forward, the mix of wells in the Eagle Ford will be relatively what they have been in the last several quarters. And in the third quarter, it is about 52% of wells were in the west and 48% were in the east.","And as we look going forward that mix will stay about the same. We did drill in the third quarter some retention wells and holding some of that acreage that with the kind of classify this that less than 60% a-tax rate of return kind of acreage.","So we just drilled the initial wells on that to hold that, we don\u2019t plan on developing that acreage anytime soon going forward, but we wanted to hold it. But just directionally, the mix of well should be relatively consistent with what we\u2019ve been doing in the last several quarters.","Arun Jayaram - Credit Suisse","Okay. Just to clarify that, Bill. Q3, perhaps, the mix of wells was towards a lower rate of return then typical on lease retention and you expect that to normalize maybe going forward, is that fair?","Bill Thomas","Yes. We drilled 28 wells to do lease, excuse me, lease retention in some of those lower returns acreage in the third quarter and going forward, we don\u2019t have that many wells planned to do that going forward. So that will drop off as we go forward.","Arun Jayaram - Credit Suisse","That\u2019s very helpful. My follow-up Bill, you\u2019ve talked about expanding opportunity set in the Delaware, you\u2019re moving from four to eight rigs by year end. So just wanted to ask you, do you think you have the appropriate level of scale in the Delaware, are there opportunities through leasing, where you like to get a little bit bigger in the Delaware?","David Trice","","Yeah. Arun, this is David. And we have got -- we have laid out the three big plays that we announced today. And those -- we have numerous locations in those. We have many, many years of drilling just in those plays. And like I said before, we\u2019ve been very delivered about testing new ideas and continuing to push the boundaries of these existing plays. So, I think, we have plenty of scale there in the Delaware Basin.","Arun Jayaram - Credit Suisse","Thank you very much.","Operator","","And we\u2019ll take the next question from Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs","Thanks. Good morning.","Bill Thomas","Good morning, Brian.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs","Without trying to tie you down to your production or CapEx guidance from next year. In the plays you do plan to focus on Eagle Ford, the Bakken, the Delaware Basin? Can you run through, how you see required spending from HBP or infrastructure versus discretionary spending evolving next year i.e. what efficiency gains do you see on the horizon or you could keep the growth engine running without having spend as much capital and perhaps, some estimate for how much capital that that could represent?","Bill Thomas","Yeah, Brian. Thanks for the question. As far as acreage retention or explorations, we have very little requirements in that area. For example, this year, at the end of the year in the Eagle Ford will be 80% of our acreage is HBP and by the end of 2015 it will be 95%. So the actual retention drilling in the Eagle will be less next year than it is this year.","And then in the Permian we have just a little bit that we have to do for retention drilling and in the Bakken it\u2019s all held our production. So we have a lot of flexibility to make sure that we are focusing on drilling and on high return. And so there was another part of your question, you have to remind me again, what was that?","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs","Yeah. Infrastructure, just a bit of the same question for infrastructure and each of those areas, do you see your infrastructure needs to support growth rising or falling?","Bill Thomas","Yeah. No. That\u2019s a good question. We see, I think, next year a bit less spending in infrastructure than we did this year. Because, again, a lot of the infrastructure this year was in the Eagle Ford and we were doing a lot of step out or retention drilling and we have to build out through that, is that by fault, the need for infrastructure is less.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs","Great. Thanks. And then, if well performance is driving your stronger than guided your production results, do you see your rates of return in the Eagle Ford, Bakken and Delaware improving as a result and in each of those areas, how much would you attribute to greater first year production versus greater overall recoveries versus better production mix?","Bill Thomas","Yes. As the well productivity increases with the completion designs, it is very additive to the return. So as you bring the oil, obviously, forward quicker, the returns go up and we are also able to continue to lower costs at the same time too and be more efficient in that area. So, rates of return given the confident commodity price are improving.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs","And to your point you are pushing up production earlier on with the completion technique, with -- which might be a little bit different than you are recovering more overall?","Billy Helms","Yeah. I think the, Brian, this is Billy Helms. I think I would also add to that is, yeah, Bill is right, the rate of return is certainly increasing, we are increasing the initial production rates too, but we are also increasing the recoveries of the wells. So, overall, recovery is going up too. So we are not just accelerating early time production at the sake of longer term production. We are seeing an uplift of overall curve.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs","Great. Thank you.","Operator","We will go next to David Tameron with Wells Fargo Securities.","David Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities","Hi. Good morning Bill. Question, can you guys talk about what you -- how you complete these wells in the Permian. I know you had one of those little yellow boxes on one of the slides, you talked about your advance completion technology. So I imagine you don\u2019t want to give all the secrets but can you give us like same framework around the way you complete this?","Bill Thomas","Yeah, David, in the Permian, just like we do in all the other plays, it\u2019s a constant experiment. Eagle Ford, you\u2019ve seen a track record that we had there. We just continue to experiment and to push this. So lot of the techniques that we\u2019ve learned in these other plays have been applied in Permian. Like Bill mentioned earlier, we don\u2019t want to give out any specific details on that but we do spend a lot of time experimenting with each play and each plays a little bit different. But we\u2019ve got a good process in place.","David Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities","Any reason that the 4500 plus lateral versus longer laterals, you should have got to that yet or just -- is there anything you comment on that, is that your larger curve. Could you talk about that?","Bill Thomas","Your question is why don\u2019t we drill longer laterals?","David Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities","Yeah. Have you tried the longer laterals? And it seems like just most of the stuff you mentioned at least in the slide that was on the shorter 4500 foot?","Bill Thomas","I mean, each play is different and so we\u2019ve done longer laterals both in the Delaware and in the Midland Basin. And it just depends on the cost of drilling, the added footage and then also the performance of the wells. And so what we\u2019ve generally seen is at least they are in the Delaware Basin that we tend to prefer to go with, more with 5,000 to 4500 foot lateral. It also helps -- it tends to be kind of the resized configuration as well.","David Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities","Okay. And then just back to the Eagle Ford, I think it was Bill that you mentioned RSC data. Can you give us any framework just around what the Eagle Ford is doing as far as overall basin production quarter-over-quarter sequentially or can you give us anything along those lines?","Bill Thomas","David, no, I don\u2019t have that in front of me right now. We have to get back with you on that. You\u2019re talking about the whole field for all operators.","David Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities","Yeah -- no, just for your specific Eagle Ford. I mean, there is so much concern about Eagle Ford production levels. I was just looking for some -- directionally, there are some type of comfort I guess you gave us on your end?","Bill Thomas","Yeah. No, I mean, again we\u2019ve talked about -- we\u2019ve got a 10-year growth profile in the Eagle Ford as we go forward. And we\u2019re on target for that, pretty consistent. We\u2019re drilling 540 wells this year and again, the mix of wells that we drill going forward will be relatively the same. So we\u2019re planning a long-term growth profile there.","David Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities","All right. I\u2019ll go back there. Thanks. Appreciate it.","Operator","The next question is from Charles Meade with Johnson Rice.","Charles Meade - Johnson Rice","Good morning Bill and to the rest of your team there.","Bill Thomas","Good morning.","Charles Meade - Johnson Rice","I was wondering if I could go back to the Three Forks and get you guys to maybe decompose a bit, that the results you\u2019re seeing there and what I\u2019m really curious about in the end, is there any chance for the Three Forks. I know it\u2019s already pretty high in the stack of your play but is there a chance forward to move higher and get bigger.","And I guess, the little bit of detail to add there is the rates you gives have on those main three wells are good but they will be more impressive when you look at the lateral lengths you guys had on them. And as I understand the lot of Three Forks is kind of being puzzling the people and some times there is undifferentiated log responses, hard to predict, what\u2019s going to be good, what\u2019s not. So can you talk about what the prospects for that to grow in your portfolio are?","Billy Helms","Yeah, Charles, this is Billy Helms. On the Three Forks, we\u2019re probably going a little bit slower than we are, relative to the Bakken. Most of our activity in that area will be focused on Bakken because that is what we consider the higher rate of return, the more consistent development play in that program.","In the Three Forks, however, we do realize the potential in that play and we are anxious to get some more test. And as you can see, what the results we\u2019ve had this quarter, they are all testing out fairly strong. Let\u2019s say we\u2019re still delineating what the ultimate extent of that play will be across our acreage position and what each zone will contribute across the acreage position.","So I think we\u2019re still a little bit early in that play. And again, most of our activity will be focused on the Bakken as we go forward. I think there is -- we're certainly pleased with the upside we see there. And we will continue to test that with some encouragement from these wells.","Charles Meade - Johnson Rice","Thank you, Billy.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Matt Portillo with TPH.","Matt Portillo - TPH","Good morning.","Bill Thomas","Good morning, Matt.","Matt Portillo - TPH","Just two quick questions for me. My first question revolves around your international asset basis. Wondering if you could give us an update on your thoughts around the East Irish Sea and the production potential coming on stream in 2015?","Bill Thomas","Yeah, on our Conwy project, that\u2019s going to coming on in the second quarter of 2015. And what we expect there is that we\u2019ll have a kind of ramp-up phase and probably max out at around about 20,000 barrels a day for couple of months there.","Matt Portillo - TPH","Great. And then, I guess, just back on the CapEx question. As we look at your programs for 2014, is there any color you could provide us in terms of the capital you\u2019re spending currently this year on assets outside of the main three you talked about the Eagle Ford, the Delaware, and the Bakken, maybe that would help us with some other context as we head into 2015 from an expectation perspective?","Bill Thomas","Matt, we have active drilling programs or one rig program in the Barnett Combo. We have a rig or two running in the mid-continent. A couple of rigs running in the East Texas and a couple of rigs running in South Texas. So we do have activity this year outside the Eagle Ford, the Bakken and the Permian plus we also as we talked about early in the year of these new plays in the Rockies, we\u2019re running a rig or two in the Powder River. And I believe we\u2019re running two rigs in the DJ. Actually there is four rigs in the DJ Basin. So we have quite a bit of activity in plays outside of the core plays.","Matt Portillo - TPH","Thank you very much. It\u2019s very helpful.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s question-and-answer session. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to today\u2019s speakers for any additional or closing remarks.","Bill Thomas","Well, thank you very much for listening and for your continued support. And I just like to say and concluding that we\u2019re confident as we head into 2015 and been with the company for 35 years. Every time we go to one of these price cycles, EOG outperforms and we come out of that price cycle in better shape than we entered it. So the company is in great shape with a sweet spot and the best role is on the plays in the U.S. and along with our low cost in our industry-leading technology. EOG is going to be strong performer in the yeas to come and a leader in the U.S. oil growth. So again thank you for listening.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s call.

As a reminder, today's call is being recorded.","At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to the Executive Chairman of the Board of EOG Resources, Mr. Mark Papa. Please go ahead, sir.","Mark Papa","Good morning and thanks for joining us. We hope everyone has seen the press release announcing third quarter 2013 earnings and operational results. This conference call includes forward-looking statements. The risks associated with forward-looking statements have been outlined in the earnings release and EOG's SEC filings and we incorporate those by reference for this call.","This conference call also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation schedules for these non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures can be found on our website at www.eogresources.com.","The SEC permits oil and gas companies in their filings with the SEC to disclose not only proved reserves, but also probable reserves, as well as possible reserves. Some of the reserve estimates on this conference call and webcast may include potential reserves or other estimated reserves not necessarily calculated in accordance with or contemplated by the SEC's reserve reporting guidelines. We incorporate, by reference, the cautionary note to U.S. investors that appears at the bottom of our press release and Investor Relations page of our website.","With me this morning are Bill Thomas, President and CEO, Gary Thomas, COO, Billy Helms, EVP, Exploration and Production, David Trice, EVP, Exploration and Production, Tim Driggers, Vice President and CFO and Maire Baldwin, Vice President, Investor Relations. An updated IR presentation was posted to our website yesterday evening and we included fourth quarter and full year guidance in yesterday's press release.","This morning we will discuss topics in the following order. I will first discuss third quarter net income and discretionary cash flow. Bill Thomas will review operational results. Then Tim Driggers will then discuss financials and capital structure. Finally, I will cover our macro view and hedge position and Bill will provide concluding remarks.","As outlined in our press release, for the third quarter 2013, EOG reported net income of $462.5 million or $1.69 per share. For investors who focus on non-GAAP net income to eliminate mark-to-market impacts and certain non-recurring items as outlined in the press release, EOG's third quarter 2013 adjusted net income was $634.3 million or $2.32 per share. For investors who follow the practice of industry analysts who focus on non-GAAP discretionary cash flow, EOG's DCF for the third quarter was $2.0 billion.","Similar to the first half, EOG continued to hit on all cylinders in the third quarter. Our oil, NGL and gas production again exceeded guidance and unit cost beat the lower guidance provided last quarter. Because of continued strong Eagle Ford and Bakken performance, we are again raising our full year 2013 production growth estimate for oil from 35% to 39%. NGLs from 14% to 17% and total company's growth estimate from 7.5% to 9%.","The impact of the high reinvestment rate of return Eagle Ford, Bakken and Leonard investments is also showing up in our EPS and cash flow numbers, as well as our ROE and ROCE ratios. This quarter's oil results provide further confirmation regarding our five-year plan where we expect to achieve most profitable and highest oil growth rate of any large cap independent as we have done in the past six years. No other large cap oil company has even remotely matched EOG's oil growth rate either in 2013 or for the six-year average and I am going to repeat that last sentence, because it bears repeating. No other large cap oil company has even remotely matched EOG's oil growth rate either in 2013 or for the six-year average. We continue to have no interest in zero profit North American gas growth and we will continue the high margin oil focus.","I will now turn it over to Bill Thomas to discuss specific operational results.","Bill Thomas","Thanks, Mark. I will start with our third quarter 2013 Eagle Ford results. During the third quarter, we continued to achieve 100% direct [after-tax] rate of return from both, the Western and Eastern portions of our 565, 09,000 net acres in the Eagle Ford, continuous improvement in well productivity and operational efficiency are driving cost down and production up. As a result, we now expect to drill and complete 460 net wells in the Eagle Ford this year, which is an increase of 20 wells since last quarter. We have been able to increase the planned well count every quarter this year, because we are going well faster and more cost effectively.","In the West, we completed a number of the Mitchell Unit wells in order to earn acreage and establish multi-well development patterns. The [Unit] #1H began production at 2,195 barrels of oil per day plus 1.0 million cubic feet of rich gas per day.","The press release noted. The Kaiser Junior unit #1H has the best well to-date in the West. The well came online at 2,815 barrels of oil per day plus 1.3 cubic feet of rich gas per day. The Nelson Zella Unit #1H and 2H began production on 1,960 and 2,810 barrels of oil per day plus 1.0 and 0.8 million cubic feet per day of rich gas, respectively.","To continue pattern development of the River Lowe Ranch, We completed an additional six wells, the River Lowe Ranch #4H through 9H had initial flow rates of 1,970 to 2,115 barrels of oil per day plus 1.0 and 1.1 million cubic feet per day of rich gas. EOG has 100% working interest in each of these Western wells. The consistently strong drilling results from the West in the first three quarters have been a significant contributor to EOG's Eagle Ford oil growth in 2013.","Page 19 of the IR presentation has an updated chart that shows average IP rates for our Western wells are 20% higher in the third quarter than the first quarter of this year. The continuous improvements in well productivity as a result of new frac techniques and the downward trend of well cost through operational efficiencies give us a high confidence level in the strength of our large drilling inventory on our Western Eagle Ford acreage.","In the East, we continued the development of the Baker-DeForest Unit with the #5H, #6H and #7H, falling 3,200, 3,560 and 4,115 barrels of oil per day with 3.5, 4.1 and 4.4 million cubic feet per day of rich gas, respectively. We also began development of several new acreage units with the completion of the Justiss Unit #1H, #2H and #3H flowing 3,885, 3,560 and 3,940 barrels of oil per day plus 4.4, 5.0 and 5.6 million cubic per day of rich gas respectively. In addition, the Vinklarek Unit #1H was completed flowing 4,510 barrels of oil per day with 5.9 million cubic feet per day of rich gas. EOG has 100% working interest in each of these Western wells.","As noted on our second quarter call, we continue to test downspacing patterns in both the East and West. The downspacing process takes time. The ultimate goal is to maximize oil recovery in the net present value of the acreage. In summary, EOG's Eagle Ford position and our operational team are proven to be the most powerful all oil growth offense in North America. Quarter-by-quarter, this asset continues to get better and better. We have many years of drilling inventory in this high rate of return play.","Now I will shift to the Bakken Three Forks. We continue to seek outstanding results from the technical renaissance in frac technology that we started in 2012 in conjunction with our downspacing program in the core. Recent downspaced wells in the core including the Van Hook 126-2523H and 130-2526H with initial production rates of 2,235 and 1,910 barrels of oil per day plus 1,115 and 900 MCF per day of rich gas respectively. The Wayzetta 137-2226H and 150-1509H which began producing 2,500 and 2,320 barrels of oil per day with 1.2 and 1.1 million cubic feet per day of rich gas respectively.","In the Antelope Extension area, we completed three excellent Three Forks wells in the first bench. The The Bear Den 100-2017H, 101-2019H and 23-2019H began flowing 2,100, 1,235 and 1,665 barrels of oil per day plus 2.0, 1.2 and 1.6 million cubic feet per day of rich gas respectively. We are encouraged by the Three Forks' potential in the Antelope are. We completed an excellent well in the second bench early this year and plan to test the third bench during 2014.","We are now achieving direct a-tax rates of return in excess of 100% in both the Core and Antelope areas. We added two new slides to the IR presentation showing EOG's outstanding 2013 results. Page 23 shows EOG's 2013 completions have 58% more production in the first 100 days as compared to those completed in 2012. The same slide also shows year-to-date IP rates from these two areas are up 50% as compared to last year. Page 25 shows EOG compared to 20 different Bakken operators. EOG's average IP this year is 1.9 times better than the peer average. With a modest drilling program, we are going oil volumes and setting new production records.","On our second quarter call, we increased our drilling inventory in the Bakken Three Forks from 7 to 12 years. With excellent results and our large inventory we anticipate increasing drilling activity in the Bakken Three Forks in 2014.","In our Delaware Basin, Leonard and Wolfcamp plays, our third quarter activity was centered on drilling multiple well spacing patterns, testing numerous target zones and optimizing frac techniques to improve well economics and recovery factors.","In the Leonard play, we completed a number of wells in Lea County, New Mexico. The Endurance 36 State Com #4H was completed in the B zone at an initial rate of 875 barrels of oil per day with 1.1 million cubic feet per day of rich gas. This is one of our first B zone tests and initial rates are excellent. We completed two new wells in the A zone. The Endurance 36 State Com #3H, 735 barrels of oil per day with 1.2 million cubic feet per day of rich gas. We are completing a number of wells the A zone and drilling a number of wells that we will test multiple targets zones and well spacing patterns.","Year-to-date direct a-tax rate of returns have exceeded 100% of this drilling program, so we continue to be very excited about the Leonard. We plan to significantly increase activity in the Leonard next year with approximately 1,600 locations in inventory. The Leonard is a powerful part of our offensive arsenal that will enable EOG to continue to [legally] and high margin oil growth through 2017.","In the Delaware Wolfcamp play, we have previously said that we were waiting on infrastructure. We can now report that as of October 1, gathering infrastructure is in place and operational. We are now ready to complete two multi-well patterns to test various spacing and targets. We plan to use microseismic to determine frac geometry and monitor production in order to determine optimal development patterns for our Delaware Wolfcamp acreage.","We have more than 1,100 locations in inventory currently generating direct a-tax rates returns of 60%. Drilling for the remainder of this year and next will be focused on establishing optimal well spacing, completion techniques and evaluating multiple target zone the set this play for full scale development in 2015 and beyond. We now have approximately 134,000 net acres in the play.","In Trinidad, we completed our Osprey platform drilling program, which should provide for flat production in 2014 versus 2013. In the East Irish Sea, the startup of our Conwy oil project is now estimated for late 2014. In addition to our ongoing efforts to increase recovery factors in our existing plays through downspacing and completion improvements, we have not lost our momentum or focus on searching for new reserve potential with domestic greenfield plays.","To summarize, EOG has captured the best horizontal oil acreage in North America, and our high performance operational teams continue to execute superbly. Wells are getting better, unit costs are coming down and oil production continues to increase at peer leading growth rates. We have a very strong inventory of crude oil and liquids rich drilling prospects with high after-tax rates return.","We continue to focus on delivering high margin oil growth, increasing recoverable reserves and existing assets and generating new plays to ensure that EOG remains best-in-class through 2017 and beyond.","I will now turn it over to Tim Driggers to discuss financials and capital structure.","Tim Driggers","Thanks, Bill. Capitalized interest for the quarter was $12.6 million. For the third quarter 2013, total cash exploration and development expenditures were $1.8 billion, excluding acquisitions and asset retirement obligations. In addition, expenditures for gathering systems, processing plants and other property, plant and equipment were $87.6 million. There were $89.2 million of acquisitions during the quarter.","During the third quarter, net cash provided by operating activities exceeded financing investing cash outflows. Year-to-date, we have closed on asset sales of approximately $620 million and we expect approximately $750 million in total asset sales by year end. This is a $200 million increase from our previous estimate.","At the end of September 2013, total debt outstanding was $6.3 billion and the debt to total capitalization ratio was 30%. At September 30, we had $1.3 billion of cash on hand, giving us non-GAAP net debt of $5.0 billion for a net debt to total cap ratio of 25%, reduction from 29% at year end 2012.","On October 1, we paid off $400 million of debt that matured with cash on hand. The effective tax rate for the third quarter was 36% and the deferred tax ratio was 65%. Yesterday, we included a guidance table with our earnings press release for the fourth quarter and full year 2013.","Our CapEx estimate for the full year is approximately $7.2 billion. For the fourth quarter, the effective tax rate is estimated to be 35% to 40%. For the full-year, the effective rate is estimated to be 35% to 38%. We have also provided an estimated range on the dollar amount of the current taxes that we expect to record during the fourth quarter and for the full year.","Now, I will turn it over to Mark.","Mark Papa","Thanks, Tim. Now I will provide our views regarding the macro environment, hedging and 2014 activity. Regarding oil, we believe that absolute 2013 total U.S. oil growth will be less than 2012 and this trend will continue in subsequent years. Through August, the EIA monthly data indicate 2013 oil production is on trend to increase 600,000 barrels per day on an annualized basis compared to 1 million barrels per day in 2012. We continue to be pragmatically bullish regarding oil prices, partially because we don't expect any large international shale oil plays to impact global supply for at least five years.","In terms of 2014 oil hedges, we have 123,000 barrels per day hedged for the first half of 2014 at $96.44. For the second half of 2014, we have 9,000 barrels per day hedged at $95.30 per barrel. We have a number of contracts outstanding that could be put to us at various terms. For the first half of 2014, we have 64,000 barrels a day of options that could be put to us at approximately $99.60 on December 31, 2013, if it is advantageous to the counterparty to do so. For the second half, we have 10,000 barrels per day of hedges that could be put to us at $96.60 on or about March 31, 2014. Also, for the second half, we have 103,000 barrels per day of hedges that could be put to us at $96.60 on or about June 30, 2014.","Regarding North American gas prices, I suspect I have a reputation as the most various CEO or former CEO in E&P business and I am not going to change that reputation on my last earnings call. I believe the gas prices will stay depressed until the 2018 timeframe. So EOG will not be in any hurry to generate a lot of gas deliverability. The current Marcellus location differential is likely just a harbinger of chronic Appalachian price dislocations that we will see over the next multiple years.","Our gas hedge position is unchanged from last quarter. We also expect ethane prices to remain weak until 2018. For the third quarter, our average U.S. oil price realization was $2.74 above WTI within $0.01 of our guidance. This premium over WTI has shrunk considerably compared to our first half realization because WTI has increased relative to LOS.","As EOG has done in the past, we will discuss our detailed 2014 business plan on the February earnings call. However, we can provide a few conceptual thoughts at this time. Assuming oil and gas prices are similar to the current NYMEX, EOG will likely ramp its 2014 activity in Eagle Ford and Bakken Three Forks plays above 2013 levels. In the Permian basin, our overall CapEx will likely be flat, but the spend ratio will shift dramatically from this year's allocation of 65% in the Midland basin, 35% in the Delaware to 15% Midland basin, 85% Delaware Basin next year. Also, we again plan to drill zero North American dry gas wells in 2014 because we see no light at the end of the gas oil supply tunnel until 2018.","Now I will turn it over to Bill for summary remarks.","Bill Thomas","Thanks, Mark. Now let me conclude. There are four important takeaways from this call. First, our third quarter and nine-month year-to-date results confirm that EOG's oil growth momentum is not diminishing. Our six-year compound annual growth rate is 38%, which is awesome when you consider this growth is 100% organic. Each of our three key plays has 12 plus years of currently defined inventory. So EOG is built for the long haul. Second, our unit cost control have been impressive, as evidenced by today's results and the full year guidance provided yesterday. Third, the vast majority of our CapEx is going into three plays yielding 100% direct after-tax rates of return, the Eagle Ford, the Bakken and the Leonard.","These returns are showing up in the bottom line with nine-month non-GAAP net income, up 55% year-over-year increasing ROEs and ROCEs, our net debt ratio was reduced from 29% at year-end 2012 to 25% at September 30th. Finally, the board now have asked Mark to stay on as the a director after he retires at year end. I am happy to report that Mark has agreed to do so. This will provide additional continuity and experience to our board.","Now I will turn it back to Mark for one closing remark.","Mark Papa","Thanks, Bill. This is my last earnings call and I want to thank everyone on both, buy and sell side for investing your time and patience in EOG story. I have enjoyed working with all you and have a sincere appreciation for all that you do. I am leaving the company in good hands with Bill Thomas and intend to keep my personal EOG stock holdings for a long time.","Thanks for listening and now we will go to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. (Operator Instructions) First, we will go to Leo Mariani with RBC.","Leo Mariani - RBC","Hi, guys. A question on fourth quarter guidance here. Clearly you had really robust oil production growth in 3Q. You guys are guiding to sort of a lower increases in 4Q. Just can you give us some color on that that is a function of trying to stay within our CapEx budget this year?","Bill Thomas","Leo, let me put in a little bit of context. If you go back t 2012, in 2012 over 2011, we grow oil production 39% that year and actually our 4Q oil production actually declined versus 3Q. If you remember, there was a lot of concern as we exited 2012. People were saying, oh boy I am nervous by EOG's 2013 oil growth, because the trend line is 4Q production was falling relative to 3Q and it doesn't look good.","Then look at results for 2013. We grow production again 39%, so if you look at it on a historic context, people shouldn't too nervous. Actually we are going to not fall in oil production, we are going to slightly grow in oil production 4Q over 3Q. There are some reasons for that. One is, we are going to be drilling some isolated leaseholder wells more than typical which as opposed to drilling more groups of wells, particularly in Eagle Ford and also some potential weather conditions in the Bakken, but if you just look at the 2012 trend and look at what we are projecting for 2013 and the fourth quarter, I think that should ameliorate any concerns now about what we are likely to do 2014.","I am not projecting we are going to do another 39% oil growth in 2014, because obviously there are a lot of big numbers that's going to catch up with this one percent year-over-year, but no one should view the situation that oil growth in the fourth quarter is likely a slowdown our trend of a significant oil growth in 2014.","Leo Mariani - RBC","Okay. That's really helpful color. I guess just in terms of frac technology. Obviously, you guys had talked about a lot better completions in the Bakken and I am certainly assuming that that's going to be applicable to other areas, Eagle Ford, Permian, et cetera. I mean, could you guys give us a kind of a ballpark on kind of what inning we are in in terms of just improving frac techniques and completions? I mean, it's just kind of the early days here and can we expect a lot better improvements in recovery in your key plays going forward?","Bill Thomas","Yes. That's a good question, Leo. The frac technology that's really making a big impact of the Bakken as actually we brought that from on the shale plays with mainly the Eagle Ford cut completion process that we have been so successful in that play with. So it is improving really in all of our plays. Basically, there is a lot of simple fundamental things. We have had a big advantage with our EOG sand. As a company, it has not only provided very low cost and help us reduce our completion cost, it's also really helped us technically to be able to experiment more, to use more sand and that is a big part of the reason our wells are much better.","I would say, we are probably in the fifth or sixth inning, if you had put in baseball terms, on where we are on the completion technology process. We continue, quarter-by-quarter, to make advances and we are learning all the time. The EOG culture is that we are never satisfied and we never quit thinking and experimenting and trying new things and really thinking out-of-the-box on new technology in all areas. So we are going to continue to press on and we are hopeful that we will have continued new improvements as we move along.","Leo Mariani - RBC","Well, that's great to hear. Thanks a lot, guys.","Operator","Next, we will go to Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Mark, hi. Congratulations. You have left a heck of a legacy behind you. I have got a couple questions, if I may. Maybe a follow-up on Lea zone on the completion. There has been a lot of chatter, obviously. I think you guys have been out and about talking about some of the things you have been doing in particular in the Bakken as you transferred some of your Eagle Ford (inaudible). Could you just help us a little bit with how you are seeing the impact of some of these changes in terms of very, very high IP rates, obviously but is this also translating into higher recovery rates? And if so, I guess I asked this question on the last call, why have you not yet decided to lift your EURs, particularly in the Eagle Ford?","Mark Papa","Yes, that's a good question there, Doug. Thank you. The whole process on all of these horizontal wells is connecting more rock to the well and so we are very focused on doing that and also with a real strong effort on the frac geometry, trying to keep the fracs closer to the well. If you connect more rock, you are hopeful that recoveries and the total recoveries of the field will go up, but we have not really proven that yet. We have proven it two times with two generations of downspacing in the Eagle Ford and we are currently on the third one. So we are really watching what we are doing. It takes quite a bit of time to establish and determine specifically if there is any increase in reserve potential or changing of the EUR per well and we are just not there yet on this third generation in the Eagle Ford. So when we get that done, we will certainly pass that on. That is going to take a bit more time. We want to be able to technically be accurate any numbers that give to you. So we are very careful to do our homework and to do our work right and to provide you really with record numbers and that process does take some time.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, thank you for that.","Mark Papa","Yes, Doug. Sorry, a little addition on that. Our view is that the industry has just been a little bit flippant with numbers. Reserves had been just floated about on essentially all plays. Billion barrels, 5 billion barrels, BOEs and it is just numbers that we think is just keep in the reserve estimating system a little bit but people just throwing number that offhand and EOG has not really joined that party. We, on the other hand, have been very cautious, very judicious in the numbers that we have given and we like to think we set our standards a little bit higher than most other companies have done when they issue reserve numbers and particularly with Eagle Ford.","We just take a lot longer to qualify our numbers before we issue them. So that's a little bit of a difference. I would like to say, our standards are higher before we issue numbers on Eagle Ford, but we are certainly reviewing. When it meets our standards for potential reserve upgrade, we will certainly let everyone in the investment community know.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. My follow-up, a really quick one, I guess we were all watching your balance sheet improve and expecting stuff like free cash flow next year, but should we given your comments and stepping up activity, should we be thinking that you are again spending cash flow next year, but obviously with a substantial step up in activity and I will leave at that. Thanks.","Mark Papa","What you should read through on the comments on the comments we made on the 2014 CapEx is that if oil prices stay where they are now then we will likely step up our CapEx over the 2013 levels. That's the only thing we are really saying at this point. We have not made any comments relating to free cash flow and we think at this point we should be in a decent position relating to that, but we are looking at accelerating our overall CapEx. The degree of acceleration is yet to be determined though.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","All right. Thanks again. Congratulations yet again, Mark.","Mark Papa","Thank you.","Operator","Next, we will go to David Tameron with Wells Fargo.","David Tameron - Wells Fargo","Hi. I will echo what Doug said, Mark, congratulations on (Inaudible) the company and doing what you have done there.","Mark Papa","Thanks, David.","David Tameron - Wells Fargo","Let me just take the free cash flow question one step further. If we think about, if we start looking at next year and you can choose whether or not generate free cash flow, but if you look at the 15 pretty powerful cash flow generation. How should we think about how are you guys going to allocate capital over the next two years?","Mark Papa","Yes, David. We are set to have very, very strong cash flow growth in the company and we have given guidance on the counter priorities that number one, we want to continue to have a healthy increase in the rate of dividend growth in the company, so that is number one.","Number two, you know we are committed to be a low debt company and to work that net debt to cap ratio gradually downward over time and then the big part of the capital what's left over will go to our best plays. We are going to be very very focused on capital discipline and capital efficiency and we are going to focus the capital where we can achieve the highest rates return.","Fortunately for EOG, we have a lot of opportunities. Of course, you we are getting very high rates return on the Eagle Ford, and the Eagle Ford will continue to get more money each year. The Bakken, with the dramatic improvements we have had in it is now equal you know to the Eagle Ford in returns in excess of 100%, so it will get more money each year and we have built the Leonard play into a very successful play and have a very large inventory in the play also with 100% rates of return, so those plays will be first on the list to get more capital each year. The company is really in great shape to continue to grow cash flow strongly and also to have very strong capital returns and capital efficiency as we go along.","David Tameron - Wells Fargo","Okay. Let me ask a little bit different way. [2015], could you draw - can the organization today handle another $1 billion, $1.5 billion capital, what you do in '14 or first should we look for - Obviously balance sheet is down. I mean, are you guys looking at dividend increase (Inaudible) '15free cash flow numbers. What happen to that?","Bill Thomas","Yes. I think we are going to have to lag and be a bit caution on giving guidance for '15 at this point and we will see how that all go along. I mean, we are going to be, as I said the capital efficiency in the return on the reinvestment capital is really our primary focus and I believe we can continue to improve that over time, which will directly go to the bottom line of the company, so we are going to be very focused on that and be very diligent about spending and staying disciplined.","As I said the dividend increase certainly will be the first part of our priority and will just discuss that as we go along and kind of watch the returns of the company and where we on the capital.","David Tameron - Wells Fargo","All right. I will let somebody else jump on. Thanks for the color.","Operator","Next, we will go to Pearce Hammond with Simmons & Company.","Pearce Hammond - Simmons & Company","Good morning and congratulations, Mark for a well-deserved retirement.","Mark Papa","Thanks, Pearce.","Pearce Hammond - Simmons & Company","My first question is, in the Eagle Ford, you have a nice downtick in your drill times. Down to nine days. Previously you were less than 12 days. Just curious, using that baseball analogy from earlier, how many handy flips or innings do you think you are in as far as this drill times in the Eagle Ford?","Mark Papa","As far as the Eagle Ford, with us saying nine days, we would say, probably again we are in the sixth, seventh inning there. We are just continuing to work on our consistency. We have had many wells that are quite a bit faster than that. So we are please with the improved consistency with our drilling operations here. Our record day is five days.","Pearce Hammond - Simmons & Company","Thank you, and then my follow-up, just coming back to the activity, as it relates to next year, reading on the '14, guidance that you have provided in the prepared remarks. Do you think that this means a higher rig count as well as higher well count or more a flattish rig count but given the improvement in drilling times, et cetera, that we would see higher well count?","Mark Papa","We expect that our rig count is going to be similar to what we had this year. We had a peak this year of 56 rigs and we probably averaged somewhere around 50, but we expect just continued improvement with rig efficiencies. We have upgraded our entire rig fleet and we fortunately now have, what I would just classify, is just premium rigs.","Pearce Hammond - Simmons & Company","Excellent. Thank you very much and congratulations, Mark.","Mark Papa","Thank you.","Operator","And now we will go to Charles Meade with Johnson Rice.","Charles Meade - Johnson Rice","Good morning, everyone and thank you for taking my question. If I could first just go to the capital allocation part of your discussion here. Looking at the results up in the Bakken, it looks like you have had great results not only with that infill program in Core but also with the Three Forks over in Antelope Extension. So could you talk a little bit about how you are thinking of prioritizing the incremental ramp in that area between those two efforts?","Bill Thomas","Yes, Charles. We have had some very excellent results. As we talked about, we have had a number of good wells in the Three Forks in the first bench and then we did complete an excellent well in the second bench this year and these recent wells have all been done with the same new completion technology that we are using in the Core. It has been very successful. So we have, and particularly in the Antelope area, we do believe that we have potential in the third bench and possibly in the fourth bench in the Antelope. So as time goes along, we will be testing those and working on what kind of development patterns and spacing that we can develop the Three Forks (inaudible) and there other areas in the Bakken in the Williston Basin Bakken acreage that we do feel like that could be additional Three Forks potential that we have not drilled. So that's the step-by-step process we go along and learn more about the Three Forks. So as we said, we are getting extremely strong rates of return in the Bakken. We have 12 years of inventory there. So as next year and the years go along, we believe that we will be drilling more wells each year in the Bakken and that's really the whole Bakken Three Forks has, even with our modest drilling this year, we have been able to continue to grow production there and we are setting production records there quite often in the pocket, even with the modest programs. So we have got some good expectations as we go forward.","Charles Meade - Johnson Rice","Got it. Thank you for that detail, Bill. Then one other thing, and this maybe a little bit more conceptual. When we look at the, and I really appreciate this new slide where you are showing the 2013 mini drills versus the 2012 and how the cumulative production you have had that in 20% or 30% or 50%, 60% increase, and I was wondering if you could characterize that as how much of that is a function of capital that you are putting into the well whether through more stages or big fracs and how much of it is more kind of a free benefit from a better design?","Bill Thomas","Yes. There are several things going on. Obviously those are normalized on a per foot basis, so that takes out the lateral length. As we have learned in all these plays as I said before, connecting more rock and connecting that rock that closer to the wellbore is the goal that we are working on. As increase the amount of sand that we put in the Bakken, we feel like we are also doing a much better job of distributing that sand and the fluid frac along the lateral more evenly, so that helps to connect more lock and get more of the oil in contact with the well, so what we are seeing on these wells with the new improved frac is that when they come on really knocks our peace as we reported, but they also have a little slower decline rate than the initial wells. They hold up better and so the initial whether it's a 30-day rate or the 100-day cumulative production are showing quite a bit of improvement, because we are moving that oil forward in the production lot for the well, so it's nice, good, successful technical renaissance that we are achieving there in the Bakken and seeing really good results because of it.","Operator","Now, we will go to Irene Haas with Wunderlich Securities.","Irene Haas - Wunderlich Securities","Hello. Mark. This is Irene. Congratulations and we will very much miss you in this capacity, but we look see around oil hedge and one last question, why 2018 is the year that we would see the light at the end of the tunnel and then a way out to the gas glut.","Mark Papa","I am going to miss you too, Irene. I believe in 2018 is when we will have the first significant impact of the of gas exports in way of LNG from these converted former LNG import terminals. I think that's when we will really have the first meaningful impact and I think that may have some impact on prices, so that is kind of the that way I see things.","Irene Haas - Wunderlich Securities","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Next, we will hear from Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs","Thank you. Good morning. Mark, congratulations and best of luck as well. You mentioned Greenfield exploration remains a commitment, I wonder even if you can't provide specifics, if you could characterize what we should expect from your exploration program in terms of size or production impact in the next few years and how impactful brownfield opportunities like water floods in the shale could be?","Bill Thomas","Yes, Brian. Certainly, as you said there and noted that exploration has not lost any focus [Leonard] EOG. We still have same people, the same culture and the same focus on that and I truly do believe EOG will continue to be a first mover in that area as we go forward. As you also noted, we are reticent talking about new plays for a number of reasons and we really don't want to talk about any specifics of those plays until we have some meaningful results to report.","Then in the secondary recovery efforts, I think, EOG will also be a leader. We don't know any other companies really working on secondary recovery in the Eagle Ford. As we reported earlier, we have a dry gas injection pilot program going on in Eagle Ford and that will take a good bit of time to determine whether that's going to be successful and whether that's the proper method on that.","Then we also have water injection pilot going on in the Bakken, and that will take some time too, so we fully are committed and I really do expect that EOG will be a technical leader in the shale plays, and new plays and secondary recovery and also cost reduction. We just got a culture in the company that is very focused on all that and we are going to be taking that forward.","Mark Papa","Brian, this is Mark. Let me add something to that, because I did get a chance to (inaudible) note this morning where you made a comment or words to the effect that EOG's valuation was still quite low because there seems to be a perception that EOG didn't have the reserve life that company didn't generate the production growth that we had or exhibiting because of difference in reserve life and EOG was perceived to have great production growth but not its own reserve life. Here is to real-world examples from the two biggest oil assets in North America relating to EOG. At the beginning of this year, I think most everybody viewed EOG's Bakken position as a static position, kind of a non-growth position and look at it now. Now, we are making the best wells in the Bakken. We view it as a considerable growth position and we are quite excited about it and I believe that everybody is looking at it as a growth position for EOG on a go forward basis.","Second one is the Eagle Ford. A year ago everybody said, yes, EOG is hitting grand slams daily in the Eastern Eagle Ford but in the Western Eagle Ford, everybody knows lower quality and EOG is not going to do as well in the Western Eagle Ford. That was just 12 months ago. Look at our results now. We are getting 100% rate of return in the Western Eagle Ford and we are getting 200% rate of return in the Eastern Eagle Ford. But the highlight of our last two earnings calls in the Eagle Ford has been the Western Eagle Ford. So in the span of 12 months, we have taken our two best oil assets and taken what was perceived to be weaknesses, lack of growth in the Bakken and Western Eagle Ford and turned them into major strengths in both areas. And that's one thing that I think you can continue to see from EOG is that the Eagle Ford and the Bakken, the two best oil plays in the United States are going to continue to turn out to be overall grand slams for EOG for at least the next decade plus in addition to the greenfield work and the secondary recovery work we have.","So we hope that our investors would see the lessons that has shown up here in the last year and certainly take a look and say, who is generating the results among all the E&P companies. We think results matter and we will stack our results up against any company in the business.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs","Thanks. That's helpful. Go ahead.","Mark Papa","Okay.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs","Yes, thanks. that's helpful. I guess as a follow-up, shifting to the Permian Basin. You mentioned in your opening comments that you are shifting more to, you are going to start doing the multiwell spacing in targets in the Delaware Basin stating with the microseismic. Can you just add some color on what your base case expectations for multiwell development would look like and how play zones you are planning on developing there?","Bill Thomas","Yes, in the Delaware Wolfcamp, we will focus on a very nice sweet spot in the Wolfcamp there and today we have completed four wells there in three different play zones and those play zones are located in the upper part of the Wolfcamp. The upper part of the Wolfcamp, we believe will tend to be a bit more oily than the lower part of the Wolfcamp. So we will be testing additional zones there.","The actual Wolfcamp thickness there is very thick like somewhere around 2,000 feet of total thickness to work with and there are numerous additional play zones that we have not targeted or tested yet but the goal is, we are completing a couple of patterns now on different spacing, well spacing and different targeting geometries and we will do some microseismic on some of those and work on the frac geometry on how to contain the frac close to the well and to make it complex to where we are connecting more rock and just see what that is in respect to the spacing that we are drilling the wells on and also production, results of all those different things we are going to do.","It's a process that it will take some time. It will take several years really to figure out the most optimum way to do it just like it has been in the Eagle Ford, but the recovery factors for the total Wolfcamp at this point are very low. Our goal would be to hopefully increase those recoveries as we go along, so, we have got a lot of work to do there but the good side of all this is that this Delaware Wolfcamp, had target rates of return of 60%, and so it is a very strong rate of return play for us already and hopefully we can improve as we go along.","Operator","Next we go to, Biju Perincheril with Jefferies.","Biju Perincheril - Jefferies","Thanks. Good morning. Congratulations, Mark. My question is if I would go back to the completions one more time and look at the - Bill, I think you mentioned that you are seeing 30 day rate and I think 90 day rates, but if you look at the decline curves of the new completions versus the previous completions? Are you seeing the higher rate holding up or do you see a curve eventually converging? Wondering why the hesitancy on (Inaudible).","Unidentified Company Representative","Biju, do you have it on speaker?","Biju Perincheril - Jefferies","Can you hear me better now?","Unidentified Company Representative","Yes, Biju. Thank you.","Biju Perincheril - Jefferies","Okay. Sorry about that. Yes. I was wondering about the declined curves on the new completions versus the older completions. Are you seeing the new curves consistently staying higher or do you see them eventually converging as you get to the tail portion of the production curve?","Unidentified Company Representative","In the Bakken?","Biju Perincheril - Jefferies","In the Bakken. Well, new completions in general in the Bakken and Eagle Ford.","Bill Thomas","Yes. In the Bakken, specifically yes we are seeing that the initial part of the production of the well are holding up and the decline rates are a bit flatter than the older wells. It's because the fracs are bigger and more expensive and we are just connecting more rock to the new completions than we did with the original wells that we completed in there.","In the Eagle Ford, we have got multiple things going on there. We are downspacing as well as working on frac technology at the same time, so we are still in the process of learning of that and so I would say comparing the Eagle Ford decline rate is maybe a bit more difficult than the Bakken at this point.","Biju Perincheril - Jefferies","Then the hesitancy on commenting on reserves whether you are seeing how much of an EUR uplift that you are seeing is that simply wanting to see more of that data or is there other factors that come into play here?","Bill Thomas","No. Specifically, we need more comp, because you just can't go by the early time of the well. You really need to have enough production time to get a good read on the total production of the well.","Again, as Mark commented, we are very, very cautious about coming out with new EURs per well, our new recovery fractures for any of our plays until we have had the very thorough technical review of that and had enough time to really evaluate it and to make a good call on it.","Operator","Next, we will go to Phillips Johnston with Capital One.","Phillips Johnston - Capital One","Hi, guys. You alluded to this in your prepared remarks, but your Eagle Ford wells continue to generate returns above 100% even in the West now, which likely suggests suboptimal spacing.","Obviously, downspacing continues to be a work-in-progress and it's going to take more time and I am just wondering how you are thinking about the tradeoff just between per well returns and NPV per section, whether or not you think it makes sense for further downspacing to accelerate NPV per section even if means that our returns fall down in the, call it the 50% to 75% range.","Bill Thomas","Yes, that's exactly what we are doing. We are very focused on that NPV of the asset and the particular lease. So the returns are certainly a part of that but we are also reducing cost at the same time on the wells and it's a balancing act. So we are very, very focused on generating the maximum NPV for that particular lease of that particular asset and that's the goal that we are focused on. And that's the reason it takes a bit of time to determine that. You have to really give the wells. You have to do things and then give wells enough time to respond and to monitor that and to model that.","Phillips Johnston - Capital One","Is there a minimum sort of per well IRR that you would be willing to live with if it meant accelerating the NPV?","Bill Thomas","No, accelerating the NPV is the goal.","Phillips Johnston - Capital One","Okay, got it, and then just getting back to the subject of free cash flow. At this point, it looks like even your Eagle Ford program is now free cash flow positive. So I am just wondering if you have reconsidered at all this strategic value of keeping some of your mature legacy assets and if so, does it now make sense to monetize some just to highlight NAV of your growth assets?","Mark Papa","I think we have, over the last several years, sold $4 billion of assets. Though it's not likely in our 2014 plan that we are going to have significant asset sales as we see it now. I think right now maybe $700 million worth of assets sales but not a larger amount of asset sales, as we see it now. So don't look for a big strategic repositioning, as you may be suggesting. (inaudible).","Phillips Johnston - Capital One","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Mark Papa","Yes.","Operator","That's all the time we have for questions today. So I would like to turn it over to Mr. Mark Papa for any more additional remarks.","Mark Papa","Well, in my remark, I would say, I am going to miss you all.

This morning we'll discuss topics in the following order. Bill Thomas will review our 2016 plan and first quarter highlights. Billy Helms and David Trice will review the operational results. I will then discuss EOG's financials, capital structure, and hedge position. And Bill will provide concluding remarks.","Here's Bill Thomas.","William R. Thomas - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Tim, and good morning, everyone. EOG is becoming an even better company that was just a year ago about lowering development and production costs and increasing returns. In yesterday's press release, we announced two exciting developments that have the potential to be significant additional drivers of higher returns and lower costs. I'll briefly highlight those, and Billy and David will provide details in a moment. Finally, I'll review our shift to premium drilling and how this shift is a game-changing event with significant long-term implications for EOG shareholders.","First, I want to highlight EOG's development of the first successful enhanced oil recovery [EOR] technology in U.S. horizontal shale. We initiated our EOR efforts in the Eagle Ford three years ago. Here's what we've learned since that time.","Number one, geology matters. The Eagle Ford is unique. The same geologic characteristics that make the Eagle Ford prolific in primary development also make it unique for enhanced oil recovery. The EOR process we are using to produce incremental oil out of the Eagle Ford is not necessarily applicable to other horizontal basins. Number two, how you initially drill the field matters. Secondary recovery works best on leased units that were developed using the best completions with optimal spacing. Finally, returns matter. We figured out how to execute EOR economically. The process can be implemented at rates of return that rival our premium drilling and significantly lower finding costs over time.","The second item I'll highlight is our discovery in the South Texas Austin Chalk. The term \"discovery\" is loaded, as many operators have been drilling the Chalk for years with varying degrees of success. Perhaps a more accurate characterization is that we discovered a new geologic concept in an existing play. Our team at EOG has cracked the code on how to make our particular footprint in the Austin Chalk a top-tier horizontal play, earning returns on par with the Eagle Ford, Permian, and Bakken.","The third item I would like to review is EOG's shift to premium drilling this year. The shift is a game-changer with significant long-term implications. I will cover those implications in a moment. But first, let's review what we mean by premium. Premium inventory is defined as drilling locations that generate at least 30% direct after-tax rate of return at $40 oil. Here are a few more clarifying points regarding this inventory.","First, 30% return is not an average; it's a minimum. Second, 30% was established as the minimum direct return to ensure that when indirect costs are included, the drilling program earns healthy full-cycle returns.","Third, we fully expect to more than replace our drilling inventory with new premium locations every year. Therefore, and this is the most important point. Our shift to premium is permanent and not simply a temporary high-grading process in a low commodity price environment.","So early 2016 will mark the point in time that EOG made a significant permanent shift in its drilling program. There are many long-term implications for that shift. The first is superior capital discipline. Premium drilling sets a new higher standard for capital allocation within the company.","The second is a large capital efficiency gain. We do not need 50 rigs drilling thousands of wells per year. It will take far less capital to grow production at strong double-digit rates.","The third implication is we can return to triple-digit direct rates of return with oil as low as $60 per barrel. And if history is any indication, we will continue to push the oil price needed for triple-digit returns even lower.","And finally, premium drill extends our lead as the low-cost horizontal oil producer. As I outlined, our permanent shift to premium drilling this year is a game-changing event for EOG. Yesterday's announcement regarding our enhanced oil recovery success in the Eagle Ford and our Austin Chalk drilling success are two more technical and operational achievements that help us reach our long-term goal of being one of the lowest-cost producers in the global oil market.","Now I'll turn it over to Billy Helms to discuss our exciting results from enhanced oil recovery in the Eagle Ford.","Lloyd W. Helms - Executive Vice President-Exploration & Production","Thanks, Bill. Three years ago we initiated an effort to test EOR using gas injection in horizontal shale. The results from lab experiments indicated that the process was technically feasible, but the economics and operational execution were going to be challenged without some creative problem solving. Our EOR team has not only solved the problem, but demonstrated returns that are competitive with our premium drilling program. That EOR process we developed is highly proprietary, and this limits the amount of detail we are able to disclose. However, I will share several reasons why EOG is uniquely positioned to achieve a successful outcome.","As Bill mentioned earlier, the geological setting is important. We have long discussed the competent barriers that encase the Eagle Ford and provide vertical containment for completions. This unique feature also plays a significant role in keeping the injection in contact with the targeted reservoir. The injected gas is thus able to become miscible with the oil in the reservoir and subsequently drive incremental oil recovery.","EOG's acreage position is situated in the optimal thermal maturity of the play to maximize oil recovery. Being in the oil window has provided many benefits during the primary development, but it's also important for the EOR process. Acreage that is too far downdip or updip in the play may not benefit as greatly. The EOR economics are significantly enhanced by the scale of EOG's footprint in the play. The infrastructure and facilities that are utilized during primary development across the field are key to being able to operationally execute the EOR process, thus providing a significant economic benefit. These reasons are the keys to the process's success and are why that we believe EOR will not be a blanket application across the Eagle Ford or necessarily applicable to other horizontal shale plays.","We have not yet determined how much of EOG's acreage will benefit from EOR or what the overall resource potential may be. The four pilot projects have tested different geographic and geologic settings, each proving the concept successful. But further definition and time will be needed to assess the applicability and overall benefit across EOG's acreage position.","Here are some of the key takeaways regarding the economics and recovery potential. One, this EOR technique is not capital intensive. There is no incremental drilling required, so capital costs average approximately $1 million per well.","Two, the operating costs are low. The process makes use of produced gas readily available to the field, and there are few other incremental operating costs.","Three, EOR may have significant effect on our long-term Eagle Ford base production profile. Unlike typical secondary recovery projects, the production response occurs quickly, within the first two to three months, and holds steady for longer.","Four, the combination of lower operating costs and steady production delivers a return profile that complements our primary drilling program. Primary drilling delivers high returns and short paybacks. Our EOR pilots have a much different profile, characterized by modest upfront capital investment that delivers a long annuity of incremental oil production and strong cash flow. The rate of return is still on par with primary drilling. But for each dollar invested, EOR delivers at least twice the net present value created as primary drilling.","Finally, our models indicate that this process will increase recovery by 30% to 70%. I want to emphasize. These are incremental potential reserves, not accelerated production, delivered at potential finding costs of $6.00 per barrel or below or less.","We will conduct a fifth pilot in 2016, and we will evaluate the results and review our acreage. We will determine the long-term capital production and earnings effect of EOR. It's important to note that while this is a significant technical and economic breakthrough, rolling out this effort will take time and is dependent on the pace of primary development drilling and field development.","Now here's David Trice.","David W. Trice - Executive Vice President-Exploration & Production","Thanks, Billy. Another exciting development on our South Texas acreage position concerns the Austin Chalk. In our press release yesterday, we published the results of two tremendous Austin Chalk wells. The Leonard AC Unit 101H produced an average of 2,715 barrels of oil equivalent per day for 30 days. The Denali Unit 101H was completed in April, and its average production for the first 20 days was 3,130 barrels of oil equivalent per day.","While the Austin Chalk is not a new play, historically industry production has been inconsistent from well to well. While good wells are possible, the performance and resulting returns are highly variable across the play. However, using proprietary petrophysical analysis, we discovered how to apply new geologic concepts to the Austin Chalk and drill prolific wells consistently. Much like the Eagle Ford, the Chalk responds very well to EOG-style completions. Our high-density completions create complex fracture systems close to the well bore, significantly improving well performance.","Also like the Eagle Ford, the Austin Chalk benefits from the detailed work we conduct to determine the best target. The chalk can be as thick as 140 feet in some areas, but our targeting efforts keep the drill bit confined to the best 20 to 30 feet of rock. Precision targeting combined with EOG-style completions is now generating prolific premium level well performance.","It's too early in our exploration efforts to know how much of the Austin Chalk is prospective over our acreage, but subsurface data and detailed mapping throughout the field are encouraging. We plan to drill seven additional Austin Chalk wells in 2016 and look forward to updating you with future drilling results as we learn more.","In the Permian Delaware Basin, our recent activity has focused on the Wolfcamp oil window. Drilling the Wolfcamp generates excellent returns while allowing us to collect data on the shallower targets, such as the Second Bone Spring sand. During the first quarter, we completed a dozen wells, with per well average 30-day rates over 2,100 barrels of oil equivalent per day, with approximately 70% oil cut. The average lateral of these Wolfcamp wells is approximately 4,500 feet.","Over the last year we've focused on increasing our understanding of the geology and maximizing well performance through better technology, such as precision targeting, high-density completions, and better well bore design. As a result, our wells are industry-leading, as illustrated on slide eight in our investor presentation.","Since January of last year, our wells have been twice as good as the industry average in the Midland or Delaware Basin when normalized for lateral length. This is the approach EOG takes across all of our plays. We seek to first, understand the geology; second, optimize the completions; and finally, enhance operational practices that maximize efficiencies and lower cost.","Our next step for Wolfcamp optimization is to extend the lateral. The breakthroughs we made in well bore design will allow us to apply EOG-style high-density completions to long Wolfcamp laterals. Longer laterals will enhance the economics of our highly successful Wolfcamp program and reduce our surface footprint across the play.","In April we drilled two 7,000-foot laterals, the Rattlesnake 21 Fed Com 701H and 702H. These wells are too new to report a 30-day rate. However, the first 20 days of production are averaging more than 3,800 barrels of oil equivalent per day per well with maximum 24-hour rates of 4,200 barrels of oil equivalent per day per well.","Meanwhile, we continue to further improve operational efficiencies and costs in the Wolfcamp. During the first quarter, drilling days decreased 14% from our 2015 average to 16.1 days. Also, total well costs decreased 8% to $6.9 million, more than offsetting costs associated with continued completion enhancements.","In addition, in the second quarter we'll begin using our brackish water supply for our New Mexico completions, with an anticipated saving of $150,000 per well. This new water supply along with many other operational improvements will allow EOG to continue to lower cost and increase returns.","On the international front, we are very happy to report that our East Irish Sea Conwy project achieved first production in late March. We are currently addressing normal startup items, and running tests to determine the optimal production rate. Our full-year guidance has been adjusted until we complete more testing.","Here's Tim Driggers.","Timothy K. Driggers - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Thanks, David. Capitalized interest for the first quarter 2016 was $9 million. Total exploration and development expenditures were $568 million, excluding property acquisitions and asset retirement obligations. In addition, expenditures for gathering systems, processing plants, and other property, plant, and equipment were $25 million. As compared to the first quarter 2015, total exploration expenditures decreased by 62%, while our total production volumes decreased by just 7%. We have maintained our full-year capital expenditure guidance of $2.4 million to $2.6 million (sic) [$2.4 billion to $2.6 billion].","At the end of March 2016, total debt outstanding was $7 billion, and the debt to total capitalization ratio was 36%. At March 31, we had $700 million of cash on hand, giving us non-GAAP net debt of $6.3 billion, for a net debt to total cap ratio of 34%.","The effective tax rate for the first quarter was 34%, and the deferred tax ratio was 82%.","For the period May 1 through June 30, 2016, EOG has crude oil financial price swap contracts in place for 128,000 barrels of oil per day at a weighted average price of $42.56 per barrel. For the period June 1 through August 31, 2016, EOG has natural gas financial price swap contracts in place for 60,000 MMBtu per day at a weighted average price of $2.49 per MMBtu.","Now I'll turn it back over to Bill.","William R. Thomas - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Tim. First, a brief word on our macro views and how they relate to EOG's plans. The substantial reduction in capital investment by the industry in 2015 and 2016 is causing oil supply to decline in many producing regions around the world. Led by steady declines in the U.S. and supported by strong gasoline demand, the market continues to rebalance. We agree with consensus that this process will accelerate in the second half of this year and into 2017. We believe that in the U.S., it will take a sustained $60 to $65 oil price and 12 months of lead time for the industry to deliver a modest level of growth.","However, what is true for the industry in general does not hold for EOG. EOG is the low-cost U.S. horizontal oil producer. With our premium drilling inventory, we believe our reinvestment advantage is $15 to $20 per barrel lower than the average industry operator. When the market balances and prices recover to moderate levels, our leading asset quality, best-in-class technology, and low cost structure will become apparent with how quickly we can resume high-return oil growth.","And that may be the number one question we received the last two months, or more accurately, at what price will you accelerate and return to growth? Our first priority this year is to completely fund our capital program with cash flow and reduce net debt with property sales. We're in the late stages of negotiating on a number of deals and are confident we will be successful on many this year. We expect their collective impact will be meaningful.","Our second priority will be to complete DUCs. We have managed our operations such that we have the capacity to add 40% more completions without adding any additional equipment from the service industry. We can respond quickly as supply and demand balance and oil prices firm.","In summary, I would like to leave you with the following important takeaways from this call. Number one, our shift to premium drilling this year is a game-changer. We expect well productivity to improve more than 50% in 2016, which is the largest one-year improvement in the history of the company. More importantly, this shift is permanent. Premium drilling will allow us to maintain a balanced capital program and resume high-return oil growth in a moderate oil price environment.","Number two, our enhanced oil recovery success is another example of EOG's ability to make significant technology gains. EUR has the potential to add meaningful long-term value to our Eagle Ford asset by adding low-decline, low-cost, high-return reserves.","Number three, the new Austin Chalk results are encouraging for our South Texas acreage position. Time will tell, but we believe the chalk geology we discovered is substantially better and more repeatable than previous chalk drilling.","Number four, last year we said 2015 was a record year for improving the company. As we start this year, we are beginning to realize that improvements in 2016 may be even stronger than 2015. Our sustainable gains in technology and efficiencies are running at record-setting pace. And we are excited about what we can achieve in cost reduction and productivity improvements in 2016.","Number five, our goal has always been to be the highest return E&P company in the U.S., and we believe we have achieved that goal. Our sights are now set on becoming one of the lowest cost producers in the global oil market. We believe it's possible, and we are moving toward that target rapidly.","Thanks for listening, and now we'll go to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi, good morning, guys, and thanks for all the comments. The new EOR results are very encouraging. I know the next step is the 32-well pilot. But once that's complete, what are the remaining gating items to full-scale development, or when do you expect to better understand the extent of the opportunity across the play?","Lloyd W. Helms - Executive Vice President-Exploration & Production","Evan, this is Billy Helms. So as you mentioned there, the next step obviously is implementing the 32-well pilot. We're still learning a great deal about the process and what its overall impact will be. And primarily the pace of development in the future will depend on our pace of development primarily for the developing out the remaining leases and then how we roll that out.","I would say that our pace of rollout, we expect to continue to announce new wells or bring new wells into that process in the coming years. And it will become a part of our overall capital allocation to the Eagle Ford that we do primarily each year, and we'll roll out certainly our 2017 guidance on that probably in February. But we are very encouraged with our initial results. So it's probably a little bit too early to talk about how we're going to roll that out. We still have a lot to learn from our 32-well pilot. And then we still have a lot of leases to develop too.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Does the existence of the EOR potential later in life opportunity, does it change the way you allocate capital on primary drilling, meaning does it make the Eagle Ford either relatively more attractive or the black window versus the condensate window more attractive given this new secondary recovery option?","William R. Thomas - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Evan, this is Bill. I don't think it changes it dramatically. We're focused on premium drilling in all of our plays. And the Eagle Ford, that's what we want to develop first in our leases and that's what we're going to focus on really permanently from now on. So we'll develop those at a normal pace. As Billy mentioned, the key is really to get those developed with the drilling and the completions in the most optimal spacing and to connect as much rock through the primary process and that really enhances the EOR effectiveness as we go forward.","So we'll move along both of them at a nice steady pace, and we'll just continue to learn as we go forward. And I think the EOR process will be much like the drilling program. We'll get more efficient as we move forward and we'll be able to lower costs, and it will just become a normal part of our investment in the Eagle Ford.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great, guys. I'll leave it there. Thank you.","Operator","And we'll move forward to our next caller, Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning. Bill, on the EOR process, you've done four pilots and tested it on 15 producing wells. Were the tests successful on all the wells, or could you just talk a little bit about the effectiveness that you've seen thus far?","Lloyd W. Helms - Executive Vice President-Exploration & Production","Arun, this is Billy Helms. Certainly, in each one of our tests we've learned a lot. I would say without hesitation that all of our pilot tests were successful. Certainly we continue to learn from each one. We started the project really with some laboratory experiments on just trying to understand what the fluid behaviors would be, and that certainly was very encouraging. Then we rolled it out to a single-well pilot and had positive results from that. And then we started applying it to more multi-well pilots. We had two four-well pilots and a six-well pilot, and each one of those was successful. So the next step, as we discussed, is to roll it out on more of a field-scale model, which is this 32-well pilot, and we'll certainly continue to learn from that. But yes, each one was very successful.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks for that. Then just my follow-up, Bill, in your prepared remarks when you're talking about the premium locations, you express confidence that you could replace these premium locations from an inventory perspective on an ongoing basis. Can you just give us a little bit more color around what's driving that confidence?","William R. Thomas - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, Arun. As you know, we believe we have very sustainable cost reduction and technology gains. We've done it every year we've been in the business, and we have a lot of confidence and we see a lot of upside going forward to continue that process. So as we increase productivity through being able to identify bedrock and precision targeting and get even better with our high-density frac techniques, we believe that the well productivity will continue to increase. That would be one way to convert.","And then we also believe that we have sustainable cost reductions. So two-thirds of our cost reductions during the downturn have been through technology and efficiency gains, and we do not see any end in that. So we're quite confident that efficiency and technology will continue to drive those costs down. And so we believe a large percentage of the inventory that we have in the Eagle Ford will be converted to premium. We also believe that in the Permian, and we believe we'll add continued premium in the Bakken and other plays too. So we're very confident that our premium inventory will grow much faster than our drilling pace.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks.","Operator","We'll move forward to our next question from Scott Hanold with Royal Bank of Canada Capital Markets.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yeah. Thanks, another question on the EOR process. And I know a lot of the stuff that you all did was proprietary. But when do you think it's the right time to actually put this application to work? So what I'm getting at is obviously these wells have a pretty steep decline rate in the first few years. But generally speaking, is it something that happens more typically earlier in the life compared to say, what occurs in conventional reservoirs when you apply a similar application?","Lloyd W. Helms - Executive Vice President-Exploration & Production","Yeah. Scott, this is Billy Helms. Typically, the governing part will mainly be \u2013 in actual field applications will be on how we develop each pattern. So as Bill mentioned earlier, the primary goal will be to go through and do a full-scale development on each and every lease with the latest high-density completions. That's the number one goal. And the pace of development from that will dictate as to when we roll out the secondary or the EOR process. But typically \u2013 I think we have a slide in the deck on I think slide four that shows that timeframe will be somewhere in the first two to five years. So I think that would probably be our initial guide.","There's really no detriment that we see as to if you wait too long to implement it, it's going to be detrimental. We think it's a great tool for just continuing to contact the remaining oil left in the reservoir. Certainly, economically there might be an advantage to doing it earlier than later. But more importantly, the advanced completions are driving probably incrementally more success to start with. So I don't know if that helps answer your question, but I would say that it will be somewhere in that first couple years, two to three years of development.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yes, absolutely, that does help. And I was just trying to gauge how this compares to say a refrac or something else through the life of the well, but great.","And as my follow-up question, and obviously, you all had I believe tried this up in the Williston Basin, some enhanced opportunities. Several years ago, that may not have been as successful, and I know it may not be applicable everywhere. But can you compare and contrast what occurred then versus now, and if what you learned in the Eagle Ford could actually be transferred up into the Williston?","Lloyd W. Helms - Executive Vice President-Exploration & Production","Yeah. The Eagle Ford, as we mentioned in the call, one of the primary factors in the Eagle Ford's success is the vertical containment. The Eagle Ford is very well encased and has good strong barriers for both upward and downward growth, which is key for the process. The Bakken and many other plays are going be more challenged in that area. That's probably the key primary difference that I would say lends to the success more readily to the Eagle Ford than maybe other plays.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll move forward to our next question from Subash Chandra from Guggenheim.","Subash Chandra - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Yeah. Thanks. First question is as you talk about these 50% efficiencies in 2016 and the continued focus on ROI over growth, how does this influence your desire to outspend in a normalized oil price environment?","William R. Thomas - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We have no desire or intention to consistently outspend. So the number one goal this year is to balance our discretionary cash flow with CapEx, and then of course we are working on property sales to help us reduce net debt.","And if prices continue to firm, we have a lot of confidence that we're on the road to accomplishing that. We do believe that because we're seeing significant cost savings in the current drilling, we think that's going to continue, and any extra capital that we would have from cost savings, we will apply to completing new wells. And that will be \u2013 we're going be disciplined. We're certainly watching the market to make sure that we're not in a temporary uptick on prices, that the prices are more sustainable. But when we feel good about that, we will apply those cost savings to completing additional DUCs later in the year, most likely in the fourth quarter. We want to enter 2017 on a growth mode, in an uptick, so we believe that we'll have the capital to do that.","Subash Chandra - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Okay. My follow-up is any update or guidance on, for lack of a better word, rank exploration, as we've the last couple of quarters talked about the refinement of your existing portfolio, how your progress on a new portfolio of opportunities?","William R. Thomas - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, we have a very robust exploration effort on new plays, and so we have various plays actually we'll be testing this year. We'll update you that when we have some meaningful results. And then we're also picking up acreage. It's been a great time to pick up low-cost acreage in places that we couldn't get acreage in, in previous years. So we have an active program going on. Of course, we're very selective. We only want premium plays to fit into our capital program. So we're identifying rock that would meet that category and deliver those kinds of returns. So we're not shortchanging that effort at all.","Subash Chandra - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","We'll move forward to our next question from Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you, good morning, Bill. Good morning, everybody. Bill, the Austin Chalk inventory, I realize it's early days, but you haven't added to your inventory, at least not in the slide deck so far. What do you need to see there? When do you expect that you'll be able to give us some updates? I'm just thinking about the development. Again, realizing it's early days, but will you develop this concurrently with same pipes (38:05) off the Eagle Ford, or how are you thinking about that in terms of relative economics?","David W. Trice - Executive Vice President-Exploration & Production","Yeah, Doug. This is David. On the Chalk, we drilled these two wells. We've taken a couple of cores here, and we've got quite a bit of log data to go with that. So we really mapped out the play. And we're feeling pretty confident that we can move this play into the premium category and have a meaningful impact to EOG. So we're going to go ahead and test \u2013 like I mentioned in my remarks, we'll test another seven wells this year to delineate the play. And then like I said, we'll go ahead and move that into the premium inventory account. So it will be developed along with the Eagle Ford.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, we'll watch for more details. My follow-up is I've got to say, as an old reservoir hack, you guys never cease to amaze us with the things you've been able to do. And those EORs are another example of that, but it also provides us with a bit of a modeling challenge. So I'm wondering if you could, to the extent you can, help us with some ideas how you would think about fitting that into the portfolio. What I'm really getting at is, is this an individual well situation? Is it a cluster of wells? Is there a minimum area that we think about? Anything you can help us in terms of framing what the relative scale of this would look like once you get going. And maybe as an add-on, what proportion of your Eagle Ford today is ready to go in terms of being able to move this thing forward?","Lloyd W. Helms - Executive Vice President-Exploration & Production","Doug, this is Billy. The second part of your question there, to the extent of the acreage that might be applicable to this, honestly we just don't know at this point. We do know that there are some areas that probably will be challenged to work economically, but we are still early on in that process in trying to determine how much of the acreage is applicable. We just don't know yet. Now the 32-well pattern is probably a good indication of maybe what we'll look at in the future. It will be subsets or leases that will dictate the size of how we develop it going forward. So maybe you guys think about it instead of a single well, it will be groups of wells that will be implemented at one time and not single wells.","So we're trying to give you some guidelines on what we think the capital cost is, and we tried to boil that down to a single well, just so you think about it and knowing that each lease will have different counts of wells, maybe 12 to 20 wells on a given lease. And then the production profile, we've given a cume curve out there that maybe gives you some insights on what the cume curves might look like.","The production response from this is pretty unique in the sense of secondary recovery projects in that it's probably the only process that gives you such a rapid production response. You get a response in the first three months essentially, which is pretty fast. And then it holds pretty steady for a number of years. So that may be \u2013 and so that's probably about as much detail on how we see how it would be rolled out. Again the pace it's on \u2013 I know it's tough to model economically. The pace of development is purely just going to be on the things we learn from this next pilot and then our development of existing units we've used in our high-density completions. So we do expect this to increase. I would say we expect to increase the number of wells each year as we roll out the new budgets, and it will become an ever increasing part of San Antonio's capital allocation.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I appreciate the answer, Billy. Thank you.","Operator","And we'll move forward to Charles Meade with Johnson Rice.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Good morning, Bill, and to the rest of your team there. I really appreciate what you've been able to offer as disclosures here on this EOR. It's really a thought-provoking development. And I wanted to ask if you could maybe add a little bit on what's driving that range on the 30% to 70% uplift versus the original EUR because it strikes me as a wide range. And I'm wondering if perhaps part of the explanation is a function of the vintage or density of the original completions this year you're working with.","Lloyd W. Helms - Executive Vice President-Exploration & Production","Charles, this is Billy again. You're exactly right. I think that's a part of it. First of all, we're early in the process. So you have to remember that our forecast started out with trying to model \u2013 trying to use simulation models to match our history from the pilot projects and then forecast what the future production might be from these. So we haven't actually seen long-term production from a pilot over the number of years it would take to demonstrate what the ultimate recovery is going be. We're trying to model that with some simulation techniques, I would say, that are challenged technically. So we're working on some enhanced models to better understand what the long-term production will actually be. So I think we just need further clarifications and tests from existing pilots that we're in and future pilots to really nail that down.","And then you're right. I think vintage of the completions will make a big difference. The new high-density completions we expect will respond better than some of the completions done several years ago. Our pilot projects to date have been older-style completions in large part, so we expect improvements to continue to improve. I think there's upside there.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","That's helpful color, Billy. And then if I could ask my follow-up on the Austin Chalk, I know that historically the way that play has worked is a lot of the successful wells have been a function of intersecting natural fractures. But I'm wondering if perhaps for your new concept, it's maybe the inverse of that. And if you're not avoiding natural fractures in the wellbore, perhaps you're trying to avoid them in the stimulation of the zone, and if that's part of what you're trying to figure out here.","David W. Trice - Executive Vice President-Exploration & Production","Charles, this is David. Yes, I think you're on the right path there. What we've learned is here where we're playing in the Chalk is the oil is stored a bit different than it has been in the previous history of the play. And what that does, it allows it to be a bit more predictable and also allows us to employ our completion techniques. And so I think going forward, it's just going give us a little more certainty on drilling repeatable high-quality wells.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Thanks for that.","William R. Thomas - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Charles, I'd like to add to that to expound on what David said. I think the same techniques that we're finding very successful in these other plays, by identifying the very sweet spots, the very best rock quality with our proprietary techniques, and then being able to keep that bit in a very small zone in conjunction with the high-density frac, that's really the key to all these plays, and it's no different from the Chalk. So we're just finding that we can identify quality pay in the Chalk, and we're very encouraged about that.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","That's helpful, Bill. Thanks a lot.","Operator","We'll move to our next question from Bob Brackett with Bernstein Research.","Bob Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hey, good morning, more questions on the EOR side. Is this a producer injector concept, or is a huff-and-puff?","Lloyd W. Helms - Executive Vice President-Exploration & Production","Bob, right now at this point we're not going to give you a lot of details around the process itself or how we're implementing it. But we will say that it is a miscible process. And so you can read into that what you might, but we're not really giving a lot of specific details about how we're doing that or the interaction between wells or those kind of things.","Bob Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","You guys were issued a patent for a thermal process for shale a couple years ago. This isn't that process?","Lloyd W. Helms - Executive Vice President-Exploration & Production","No, it's definitely not that process.","Bob Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","And could you give an idea of barrels per scuff in terms of how much gas injected versus how much incremental oil you get out?","Lloyd W. Helms - Executive Vice President-Exploration & Production","Again, we're not going to give a lot of details on how much gas we're injecting. But the important thing there is that \u2013 two things I guess. One is that we have gas readily available in the field. And then two, with our large footprint there and the facilities and infrastructure that we've been able to put in place for our field really enhances our ability to move gas around and get it to these leases to take advantage of this EOR process. It really helps position EOG uniquely to be able to take advantage of something like this.","Bob Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","And then a final one, should we trust Railroad Commission lease level production? Will that be able to help us figure out incremental volumes, or is it just all wrapped up at the pad level so we can't \u2013 or lease level so we won't be able to see it?","Lloyd W. Helms - Executive Vice President-Exploration & Production","We're reporting production on a lease basis as we're required to do under the Railroad Commission rules. And certainly, over time there may be some things you can glean from that data. We'll see. Honestly, I have not checked a lot of that data to see what does it look like versus what we see internally. But I think over time, you'll be able to discern what the actual results are, and I would expect that data will become apparent in the future.","Bob Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay, thank you very much.","Operator","We'll move forward to our next question from Pearce Hammond with Simmons Piper Jaffray.","Pearce Hammond - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","Good morning. On the Austin Chalk, is your acreage already held by virtue of your completions in the Eagle Ford since you would hold all depth above the Eagle Ford? And then are you leasing any additional acreage?","Lloyd W. Helms - Executive Vice President-Exploration & Production","Yes, Pearce. Yes, we would. We hold the Austin Chalk with our Eagle Ford production. So yes, it sits right above the Eagle Ford. And the second part of your question was?","Pearce Hammond - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","Are you leasing any additional acreage?","Lloyd W. Helms - Executive Vice President-Exploration & Production","As you know, there in the Eagle Ford the acreage is held pretty tight. So at this point, we're not leasing anything new on the Austin.","Pearce Hammond - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","And then my follow-up, with the EOR technology, what do you think this does to your base decline? It seems like it would cause your Eagle Ford base declines to moderate significantly over time once you apply this technology in full force.","Lloyd W. Helms - Executive Vice President-Exploration & Production","Pearce, I think that's right. I think overall benefit in the long term is it will help flatten the decline. The long-life decline from the field, we still haven't been able to quantify that yet. But we're certainly very optimistic that it will certainly be very meaningful to not only the individual leases but over the field in general.","Pearce Hammond - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","Thank you, Billy.","Operator","And we'll move forward to our next question from David Tameron with Wells Fargo.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning, a couple questions. One, on the Austin Chalk, I guess one, how prospective do you think this is? Like how big is that sweet spot as a subset of your total Eagle Ford position? And then as I just start thinking about what \u2013 and I don't know if you guys will talk about it, but what are you doing differently? What can you give us as far as \u2013 or give the Street as far as confidence that this isn't the same Austin Chalk that's in everybody's head?","William R. Thomas - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","David, this is Bill Thomas. As far as the potential on our acreage, we're encouraged because we see data, rock data and test data, on various parts of our acreage that are encouraging. And so we have seven wells, additional wells, additional to the two we've already drilled that we have planned this year that we'll be testing some of these concepts. And so once we get those done and we get some results that confirm the production like we've seen, then we'll be able to I think give people an update that will be more meaningful on what the scope could be. And then on the technical side of it, let me let David update you on that part of the question.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay, thank you.","David W. Trice - Executive Vice President-Exploration & Production","Like I mentioned before, we have collected a substantial amount of data. Pretty much all of the Eagle Ford wells that we've drilled have drilled down through the chalk. So we have a very good set of log data, seismic data, and like I mentioned before, core data to delineate this. So that's what gives us confidence. And as well, there have been other industry wells drilled. Some of the larger operators have not necessarily drilled very good wells, but some of the smaller operators have drilled some really good wells along this trend. Some of them have cum-ed 300,000 to 400,000 barrels of oil in the first year. So these are substantial wells. And like I mentioned before, based on the data we have, we think they're very repeatable.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay.","William R. Thomas - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","David, the technical advantages from a competitive standpoint are, I think, our ability to recognize these pay zones and then target those pay zones. That is before what we've learned on the other plays is applying to the Austin Chalk. So we're just taking this targeting, precision targeting a step further to the chalk, and we think that's very proprietary knowledge at this point.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay, I appreciate that color, just one more follow-up. If I think about \u2013 and if you covered this, I apologize. I don't think I heard anybody talk about it. But as far as the DUC balance going into 2017, I know some of the rigs are coming off contract. How should we think about the way you want to manage that going forward?","Gary L. Thomas - Chief Operating Officer","This is Gary Thomas, David. What we've shared before is we're just going be completing roughly 270 wells this year, drilling about 200 wells. So we'll be completing roughly 70 of our DUCs. And we're just, as Bill said, we've got these in inventory. When we see prices improve and we have additional capital, this will be just a source of assets that we can develop rapidly to bring on production when it's justified.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Appreciate it. Thanks for the time this morning.","Operator","And we'll move forward to our next question from Irene Haas with Wunderlich.","Irene Oiyin Haas - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.","Yeah. Very quickly, this enhanced oil recovery process, how sensitive it is to gas prices? Right now we're at an all-time low. But what if one of these days gas shoots up to $4.00 or $5.00 per Mcf, how would the process work then?","Lloyd W. Helms - Executive Vice President-Exploration & Production","Yeah. Irene, we've certainly taken a look at a lot of different pricing scenarios. But we've looked at it in the sense of what we're currently modeling and also incrementally up to $5.00 gas prices, and we still see incremental benefit and good economics even up to those levels. So our economic sensitivity is not really a factor of what we think gas prices could be anywhere in the near future. So I think it's going to continue to be economic even at what we see could be a foreseeable gas price in the future.","Irene Oiyin Haas - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.","Great, thank you.","Operator","And we'll move forward to our next question with Brian Singer.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you, good morning.","William R. Thomas - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Brian.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","I wanted to see if you can give us an update on your rig contracts. How many are rolling off at the end of the year? And more importantly, what is your minimum or what are your commitments for 2017, and to tie that in a little with the discussion here on EOR and DUCs, whether you can get to a point or whether it can be meaningful enough from your investment in EOR and reducing DUCs where you can essentially have rigless growth in 2017?","Gary L. Thomas - Chief Operating Officer","This is Gary. We have 11 rigs under contract currently, and that will decline to nine rigs at the end of the year. So we'll really average about nine rigs because we started with 15 rigs there in January. And then next year, we'll start with eight rigs and that will decline to four rigs, so we'll average about 5.5 rigs in 2017. So yes, we will have some DUCs, but we'll have quite a number of wells that we'll be able to drill. And we've got quite a few of these patterns we'd like to further develop, so we'll maintain certainly more than 5.5 rigs in 2017.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it, thanks. And then to follow up on both the DUCs and the EOR locations, on the DUCs, could you characterize how many of your DUCs would be locations you would regard as premium locations if you were drilling these wells now? And then on the EOR locations, can you characterize how many locations in the Eagle Ford over the last two to five years have been drilled in the area with the completion techniques where you could apply EOR right away if you wanted to?","Gary L. Thomas - Chief Operating Officer","Yes, first you had a long question here. As far as the premium DUCs, roughly 100 of the DUCs are in the Eagle Ford. Most all those are going be premium. We've got some there in the Permian Basin; they'll also be premium. The neat thing here is when you look at it on a finding cost basis, our new drilling is roughly $10 a barrel of oil equivalent. And when you look at the DUCs, having already spent the dollars to drill, it's probably in the $7 range. So those all look pretty darn good.","Now as far as on our Eagle Ford and plugged wells have the modern completion to fit with EOR. By the time we get these patterns developed, a large portion, the majority of our wells will have the more modern completion. So that's what Bill and Billy are talking about now. And just mentioning that, we want to go ahead and further develop these because we're still working on our spacing and we need get our spacing down there in the Eagle Ford. So with that, the vast majority of the wells will have modern completion, very fitting for EOR.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great, thank you.","Operator","And, ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks.","William R. Thomas - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","In closing, the first thing I would like to say is that we're extremely proud of all the EOG employees. They're doing an incredible job this year of resetting EOG to be successful in a lower price environment.","The second thought I'd leave you with is that EOG continues to focus on long-term value creation by making sure that every dollar we invest today is making a strong return, and growth should be a product of making great returns. So because of the tremendous technology and efficiency gains, the company has the ability to make strong returns in a $40 oil environment. And this uniquely positions EOG to continue its leadership in high-return U.S. oil growth as prices improve. So thanks for listening and thanks for your support.","Operator","And, ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference call. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"8899":["EOG Resources, Inc.

As a reminder this call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions I would like to turn the call over to the Chief Financial Officer of EOG Resources, Mr. Tim Driggers. Please go ahead sir.","Tim Driggers","Good morning and thanks for joining us. We hope everyone has seen the press release announcing third quarter 2019 earnings and operational results. This conference call includes forward-looking statements. The risks associated with forward-looking statements have been outlined in the earnings release in EOG's SEC filings and we incorporate those by reference for this call.","This conference call also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Definitions as well as reconciliation schedules for these non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures can be found on our website at www.eogresources.com. Some of the reserve estimates on this conference call and in the accompanying investor presentation slides may include estimated resource potential and other estimates of potential reserves, not necessarily calculated in accordance with the SEC's reserve reporting guidelines.","We incorporate by reference the cautionary note to U.S. investors that appears at the bottom of our earnings release issued yesterday. Participating on the call this morning are: Bill Thomas, Chairman and CEO; Billy Helms, Chief Operating Officer; Ken Boedeker, EVP Exploration and Production; Ezra Yacob, EVP Exploration and Production; Lance Terveen, Senior VP Marketing; David Streit, VP Investor and Public Relations. Here's Bill Thomas.","Bill Thomas","Thanks Tim and good morning everyone. EOG has a deeply rooted competitive advantage and that is our culture. Our culture drives innovation and a long history of continuous improvement and success. Most importantly, our culture drives resiliency.","In an ever-changing business environment, we have demonstrated this resiliency time and time again during the past 20 years, as we will continue to do so moving forward. In the 1990s when vertical prospects were in short supply, our culture fostered innovations that made EOG our first-mover in horizontal shale gas technology.","As natural gas prices came under pressure in the late 2000s, we introduced horizontal shale oil with the Eagle Ford discovery. As a result of our first-mover advantage, EOG is now the largest onshore oil producer in the Lower 48 states and among the lowest cost producers in the world.","In the wake of a pronounced commodity price down cycle beginning in late 2014 the company has remained a leader in low-cost, high-return oil growth by switching to a premium drilling strategy.","Our premium strategy uses a strict investment hurdle that produces strong economic returns using a flat $40 and $2.50 natural gas price scenario ensuring that the company will generate strong financial performance even in commodity down cycles.","After our third consecutive quarter of exceptional results, we believe that EOG's 2019 operational performance will be the best in company's history. To reflect our year-to-date performance, we have raised our U.S. oil growth target from 14% to 15% along with lowering our well cost and per unit operating cost targets.","Strong well results have compounded the benefit of cost reductions to further improve capital efficiency, allowing EOG to deliver strong above target production growth with lower-than-expected capital investment. With confident strong returns in growth in the third quarter, the company delivered over $330 million of free cash flow after paying the dividend.","EOG continues to deliver returns, growth and free cash flow competitive with the best companies in the S&P 500. In addition to outstanding operating results, we continue to organically grow our premium well inventory in both size and quality. This quarter we added 1700 premium net wells which represents a replacement rate of more than 2 times our 2019 drilling program and brings our total premium drilling inventory to 10,500 net wells. That is more than 14 years of drilling at our current pace.","EOG's diverse assets and exploration-led business model position the company to navigate political and regulatory changes. The company maintains tremendous flexibility to adjust operations and activity across 6 different basins and has identified over 5,400 premium well locations representing more than 7 years of premium drilling on nonfederal acreage.","In the Permian, one of our most active drilling areas approximately 90% of our federal acreage position is held by legacy production and we have 11 years of premium inventory on nonfederal leases. The 3.2 million net acres of nonfederal leases in the U.S. which is approximately 75% of the company's total acreage, we are confident that we will continue to organically grow our premium inventory in size and quality much faster than we can drill.","EOG has approached reducing environmental footprint in the same manner that it continues to improve operational performance. The company looks to innovate through returns focused initiatives aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions and expanding water reuse throughout our operations.","Last quarter we introduced our pilot project for a combined solar and natural gas-powered compression station in the Delaware Basin. This is just one of the many projects that our team is working on that, we believe will contribute to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and generate positive economic returns.","EOG and its employees are committed to environmental stewardship. We believe we are a leader in our initiatives to address environmental stewardship and we are focused on finding new opportunities to continue to improve going forward.","Finally as we close in on the end of the year, our focus begins to turn to 2020. While it's too early to discuss specifics of our plan next year, we can say the following: number one, our priorities have not changed. We firmly believe that investing in high-return production growth, generating substantial free cash flow and delivering strong dividend growth delivers the highest long-term business value.","Number two, our plan is based on a conservative outlook for commodity prices. At $55 WTI we can deliver mid-teens production growth, grow our dividend and generate significant free cash flow. Number three, we believe well cost and per unit operational costs will continue to decline.","Number four, we believe capital efficiency and F&D costs will continue to improve. Number five, we have high confidence in the ability of our organic exploration efforts to add and improve our premium drilling inventory faster than we are drilling. And number six, we have no plans for large expensive M&A.","Any potential bolt-on acquisition must compete with our premium drilling returns. As we look to the future we know that the business environment will continue to change. But our competitive advantage is rooted in our culture, ensure that we can meet these challenges head on.","EOG is a resilient company that will continue to differentiate itself as a leader among any company in any sector of the S&P 500 by creating significant long-term value for our shareholders.","Next up is Billy to review our third quarter operational performance and outlook for the remainder of 2019.","Billy Helms","Thanks Bill. For the third quarter in a row we exceeded expectations delivering more oil for less capital than we forecasted at the start of the quarter. Oil production beat the high end of our target range at over 464,000 barrels per day and we spent less capital than expected coming in right at the low end of the target range of $1.5 billion.","Well performance continues to drive production to the high end of our estimates. As discussed during the second quarter call the primary reasons for the improved well performance are enhanced completion designs along with the use of diverters and a heightened focus on target selection.","Capital expenditures continue to trend to the low end of expectations as our operating teams identified new techniques to lower well costs to improve capital efficiency. As of the third quarter, I can report that we have achieved our year-end goal of reducing well cost by 5%. We believe the cost reduction to be sustainable as it is driven by continued efficiency improvements not service cost reductions.","For example if you look at our two most active plays; the Delaware Basin and the Eagle Ford the average time to drill a well has collectively been reduced by 20%. As our drilling teams maintain their steady push to reduce drilling times, we require fewer rigs to execute our program compared to last year.","Specifically, we now plan to only average 36 rigs this year as compared to 40 rigs back in February. This is a tremendous testament to the efficiencies of EOG's drilling teams. They were able to realize faster drilling times with innovative advancements such as in-house designed, drilling motors engineered to improve performance and reduce failures. We still plan to complete about 740 wells this year and expect quarter-over-quarter production growth entering 2020.","As Bill stated earlier, if oil prices are in the mid-50s, we expect growth in 2020 to be similar to 2019. Capital expenditures -- capital savings from efficiencies realized throughout the year are beginning -- allocated to one of two areas: leasing acreage and new exploration plays and high-return infrastructure projects that are lowering lease operating expense.","Across the board, 2019 is shaping up to be the best year we've had operationally and is particularly notable across our company-wide per unit operating expenses. At the start of 2019, lease operating expense on a unit basis was initially forecasted to be flat year-over-year. However, we now expect full year 2019 LOE to be 4% lower than 2018.","At the midpoint of our 2019 DD&A guidance range of $12.65, we were on track to deliver the lowest rate since EOG's transition from a natural gas company to oil. Our permanent switch to premium drilling continues to transform the company, driving down finding and development costs, reducing D&A and enabling EOG to deliver double-digit returns throughout commodity price cycles.","Also of note during the third quarter, we entered into long-term gas supply arrangements with Cheniere Energy. Consistent with our strategy of having flexibility and diversity in marketing our products, these arrangements provide additional markets for off-take and pricing diversity for up to 440 million BTU per day starting in 2020 with the ultimate goal of maximizing the realized price for our growing production of low-cost natural gas.","Now I would like to provide some color on the Bakken and other Rockies plays. In the Bakken this quarter we completed 15 wells with an average IP-30 of 2150 barrels of oil per day, 300 barrels of NGLs and 2 million cubic feet a day of natural gas. Our strong well results reflect the impact of EOG precision targeting and our new completion techniques.","The highlight for the quarter was the Clarks Creek 18 well that was completed in the Three Forks with an IP-30 of 3800 barrels of oil per day. This well is our best well to date in the Bakken, which along with strong performance from other wells completed this quarter are a testament to the continued improvements we see across our entire inventory.","In the Powder River Basin, we completed a total of eight wells including four wells in the Parkman, three wells in the Turner and one well in the Niobrara. It is worth noting that our premium inventory in the Powder River Basin now includes the Parkman which we have combined with the Turner play.","The Niobrara completion, the Arbalest 473 had an IP-30 of 1250 barrels of oil per day with 250 barrels of NGLs and 4 million cubic feet a day of natural gas. We continue to be encouraged by the results of our program in the Powder River and look forward to its growth in the near future.","Next up is Ken to discuss the Eagle Ford.","Ken Boedeker","Thanks, Billy. Year-after-year, quarter-after-quarter EOG's Eagle Ford asset delivers strong consistent results and the third quarter of 2019 was no different. The Eagle Ford delivered high-return oil volume growth with a continued decline in well costs. We have exceeded our full year cost reduction goal of 5% in the third quarter by continued improvement in operational efficiencies.","Specifically, our drilling time has been reduced by 10% to 20% depending on the lateral length in the third quarter of 2019 compared to 2018. We also drilled our fastest well to date in Eagle Ford, the Meadowlark B2H, which was drilled to a measured depth of 17,288 feet with a 7,500-foot lateral section in a remarkable 2.4 days.","Even after nearly a decade of development our premium well inventory in the Eagle Ford remains strong at 1900 net locations representing over six years of drilling at current activity levels. We continue to have high confidence in our ability to grow our premium inventory in this play. Our best well to date has a cost that is 20% below our average 2019 well cost.","This difference in cost between our best well and the average well this year is evidence of the opportunity ahead to convert our approximately 2200 remaining non-premium locations to premium over time. EOG is in the best position it has ever been in to maximize the value of this flagship asset.","Now here's Ezra for an upgrade -- or an update on the Delaware Basin.","Ezra Yacob","Thanks, Ken. In the Delaware Basin we announced the addition of just under 1700 net premium locations including two new plays, the Third Bone Spring, which accounts for 615 net premium locations and the Wolfcamp Middle or M for short, which contributes 855 net premium locations.","The Third Bone Spring and the Wolfcamp M combined -- added approximately 1.6 billion barrels of equivalents of incremental resource potential net to EOG. Additionally, we added over 200 net premium locations from previously identified plays in the Delaware Basin. These locations not only benefit from this year's reduced well costs and increased well performance but also reflect further delineation and greater confidence in areas outside of our core acreage position.","The Third Bone Spring is an example of making an old play new again. EOG began drilling the Third Bone Spring sand in our core Red Hills area in Southeast New Mexico over 25 years ago through vertical and horizontal development to exploit these high-quality reservoir sands.","Fast forward to today, where modern drilling and completion technology along with the benefit of a large data set of core samples and logs has allowed EOG to exploit the tighter sands shales and carbonate rocks in the Third Bone Spring. While over 1000 horizontal wells have been drilled in the traditional Third Bone Spring sand target across the basin, less than 50 wells have exploited these tighter reservoir targets.","With the advantage of a rich trove of technical data, EOG has identified the sweet spots of these new targets and the result is an $8 per barrel of equivalent finding and development cost with a production decline profile somewhat shallower than other plays in the Delaware Basin.","We anticipate developing the Third Bone Spring at approximately 880-foot spacing between wells with per well gross reserve potential of approximately 1.2 million barrels of equivalents for a targeted completed well cost of $7.6 million. We also announced the Wolfcamp M with 855 new net premium locations identified across a wide expanse of EOG's acreage position in Lea, Eddy, Loving and Reeves Counties.","This combo play with 63% liquids sits below the Upper Wolfcamp plays and is planned to be developed on 1050-foot spacing. A typical Wolfcamp M well is expected to produce approximately 1.5 million barrels of equivalents over its life for a $7.7 million targeted completed well cost.","EOG began data collection analysis and delineation of this interval in 2014 and refined our precision targets to the highest quality portion of the reservoir. Utilizing proprietary steering software, we have reduced our specific drilling target by over 20% while simultaneously decreasing our drilling days by 50% compared to the 2014 delineation tests.","The combination of increased well productivity, operational efficiency lowering well costs and utilization of water, gas and oil infrastructure has delivered another premium play to EOG's portfolio. Altogether in the Delaware Basin, EOG now has an inventory of approximately 6500 future net premium drilling locations or 24 years of inventory at the current drilling pace.","This inventory is based on actual locations customized to the local geology across our over 400,000 acre position and includes multiple targets within the 5000-foot thick column of pay. We use proprietary core log and completions data to determine our targets and spacing and integrate real-time data from every well we drill to improve future wells.","In contrast, to one-size-fits-all manufacturing mode, our continual process of data collection, analysis and application allows us to continue improving our wells, lower finding and development costs and optimize returns and net present value for each development unit.","We're also confident in our ability to add future premium locations to our current inventory through lower well costs, increased well productivity and additional delineation of targets outside of our core area. For example, in the Wolfcamp oil play, the well count averages a single target being developed at 660-foot spacing across the 226,000 acre play.","During 2019 EOG has regularly drilled patterns of wells on tighter spacing including the State Atlantis seven Unit number 1H through 5H, a 5-well Wolfcamp oil development at 440-foot spacing. These two-mile laterals averaged less than a $7 per barrel of equivalent finding and development cost generate over $50 million NPV and average payouts in approximately three months. The bottom line is EOG is very confident that a lot of upside remains to the currently identified drilling potential in this world-class basin.","In addition to the updated inventory, EOG's outstanding operational performance during the first half of 2019 has continued through the third quarter in the Delaware Basin. Total well cost for the Wolfcamp oil play has already reached the full year goal of $7.2 million, while operating expenses in the Delaware Basin are also moving down notching a 7% improvement year-to-date compared to 2018. Well productivity in the Delaware Basin also continues to improve across our various plays.","Average cumulative oil production for the first 90 days compared to 2018 was up 15% in the Wolfcamp oil play and up 20% in the Second Bone Spring. The standout for the quarter is the McGregor D unit number 5H, which came online an initial 24-hour rate of 11,500 barrels of oil per day and nearly 20 million cubic feet per day of rich natural gas. For its first 30 days, the well averaged 6,400 barrels of oil per day.","The McGregor was drilled as part of a three-well package on 700-foot spacing in the Wolfcamp upper target. The entire package produced a staggering 445,000 barrels of oil and 1.2 Bcf of natural gas in the first 30 days of production. These wells benefited from EOG's highly integrated multidisciplinary technical approach to development.","Data collection and applying real-time analysis to improve well performance is a hallmark of EOG's approach to unlock upside potential across all of our assets and as highlighted with our announcement of additional premium plays in the Delaware Basin.","I'll now turn it over to Tim Driggers to discuss our financials and capital structure.","Tim Driggers","Thanks, Ezra. The benefits of EOG's balanced high-return growth strategy continued to shine through in the financial results in the third quarter. During the quarter, the company generated discretionary cash flow of $2 billion, invested $1.5 billion in capital expenditures before acquisitions toward the low-end of our guidance and paid $166 million in dividends. This brought $337 million in free cash flow.","Cash on the balance sheet at September 30 was $1.6 billion and total debt was $5.2 billion for a net debt to total capitalization ratio of 15%. A strong balance sheet is a strategic imperative for EOG. As Bill mentioned, our first priorities for capital allocation in 2020 will be investing in high-return drilling and supporting dividend growth. Two bonds totaling $1 billion are scheduled to mature in 2020. As those dates get closer, we will decide whether to use cash on hand to redeem the bonds or to refinance one or both of them.","I'll now turn it back over to Bill for closing remarks.","Bill Thomas","Thanks, Tim. In conclusion, there are several important takeaways from this call. First, EOG's 2019 operating performance is the best in company history. Our high-return disciplined growth strategy is producing strong returns, strong growth and substantial free cash flow. At the same time, we continue to get better in every area of the company.","Second, our premium inventory continues to grow in both size and quality much faster than we drill it. Third, the company continues to reduce costs and with our pleased-but-not-satisfied mindset, we see endless opportunities to continue to lower cost in the future. Fourth, our GHG reduction and water reuse efforts demonstrate our leading, innovative and returns-focused approach to environmental stewardship and sustainability.","And fifth, EOG is a resilient company. Our culture produces sustainable success. As we look ahead, we're confident and excited about the company's ability to continue to create significant long-term shareholder value with performance that competes with the best companies in the S&P 500. Thanks for listening.","Now we'll go to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] And the first question we have will come from Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Brian Singer","Thank you. Good morning.","Bill Thomas","Good morning, Brian.","Brian Singer","Can we start on the two new zones in the Permian Basin? First, how are these being integrated into the drilling program? And given the greater wet gas mix, what are the implications for gas NGLs growth and infrastructure needs? And second, in your prepared comments, you mentioned the Bone Spring three helps mitigate the decline profile of the company. Can you add more color on the reasons? And is this the type of decline rate improvement you've been referring to in the past? Or would that be driven by other exploratory projects under evaluation?","Bill Thomas","Brian, I'm going to ask for Ezra to comment on the two new zones.","Ezra Yacob","Yes, Brian. This is Ezra. Thanks for the question. There's kind of a lot there. So let me tear it apart piece by piece and maybe I'll start with the Wolfcamp Middle first, the Wolfcamp M. With regards to how it will be integrated into the -- into our development, that's a deeper zone across much of our core acreage position. So one great thing about being able to turn this new bench premium is that it has the benefit of having pre-existing well control seismic infrastructure for both oil, gas and water gathering.","And one way to look about that the greater wet gas mix is I think it's on slide 47 in our slide deck where we have the Delaware Basin play matrix. It's very similar to the Wolfcamp combo in per well reserves in the gas, oil and NGL make up kind of a combo percentage there. And it's also very similar in cost. And so that gives us great confidence in having a premium play there and the fact that it's going to be a high-return play for a long time. In the Wolfcamp combo, we've turned about 50 wells to sales in the past two years and they're generating over 100% rate of return and approximately $8 million of NPV per well. So we're very excited about that play.","On the Third Bone Spring sand shifting gears to that. As we talked about that's kind of a tale of two plays. We've got the more traditional sand target, which definitely because of the better porosity and the better permeability the decline rates are very similar to those in the First Bone Spring and the Second Bone Spring. And yes, I would say on a side bar that that is the type of reservoir quality that we're looking for in our exploration program.","And then the second part of that Third Bone Spring probably a little bit slower to integrate it, because it's really as you step outside of our core area and we're delineating some of the new acreage positions on it are these emerging targets that I talked about the Third Bone Spring, the shale and carbonate targets in there. Industry has drilled about 50 wells in those targets and we're very excited about the potential there again as we move into those new areas.","Brian Singer","Great. Thank you. And then my follow-up is if you could talk a little bit about the operational momentum into 2020. It is a daunting task to grow 15% from your large base of oil production. So how are you setting up in terms of late 2019 and early 2020 activity? And do you expect ratable growth through the year or a bit more back-end loaded?","Bill Thomas","Yes, as we said early in the remarks, Brian that our -- we're really having a fantastic operation this year in the operational momentum that we've got going and the company is going to carry over into 2020. So I'm going to ask Billy to comment a little bit more on the specifics about that.","Billy Helms","Yes, thanks Bill. Yes, Brian, as we go into 2020 first of all, it's a little bit early to kind of give you too much detailed guidance on where we are. We don't expect to be able to reduce our rig count any further in 2019. As we go into 2020 depending on what oil prices look like, we'll set what our activity is going to look like, but we certainly have the capability of increasing rig activity if the prices so warrant. The bottom line is we fully expect to deliver quarter-over-quarter production growth as we enter into 2020. So the growth of -- the amount of which would be dependent on what the oil prices look like.","Operator","Next we have Subash Chandra of Guggenheim Partners.","Subash Chandra","Yeah. Good morning. First question is on, I guess, deflation. Understanding that you're budget for next year and your capital efficiencies aren't dependent on it. I'm curious, if you're seeing any evidence as some of the other operators are slowing down, or at least say they are slowing down.","Bill Thomas","Subhash, yes, I think, just in general, the U.S. shale industry, I think, year-over-year production growth is slowing. That's certainly not the case for EOG. I think, we continue to differentiate ourselves by continuing to improve and our well productivity remains very, very strong and robust. We continue to -- as Ezra pointed out, we continue to drill record wells.","And we continue to have record drilling times and we're setting new records really literally almost every play on well costs. So the key to success in any business is getting better all the time and lowering your cost and getting your production up and maintaining a very, very strong performance. And I think the EOG culture is quite unique in the business and it really sets EOG apart.","Subhash Chandra","Yes. I guess, the question was, do you see cost deflation actually occurring?","Bill Thomas","Well, I'll ask Billy to comment specifically on that.","Billy Helms","Yes. This is Billy Helms. What we see on the service side, I guess, is the service industry is pretty much at a low. I wouldn't expect to see much further cost reductions on the service side. I think services are at a pretty low price point at this present time. And for them to stay healthy, to be able to service our industry, I think there's not much room to go any lower.","So I think the important thing for -- to differentiate, as Bill said, on EOG is that, we're not dependent on service cost to really continue to reduce our well cost. I think that's an important point to make. Our operating teams continue to find ways to drill the wells faster, figure out more efficient completion techniques drive our lease operating costs down to improve our overall economics. And that's really what's driving EOG's continued efficiency gains.","Subhash Chandra","Right. Okay. Got you. And then, my follow-up is, I guess, a philosophical question. And acquisitions, you've ruled out corporate. And maybe it's a moot point, because you have so much inventory that you can find organically. But it just seems that the A&D market is at sort of, at least in recent history, historical lows.","And the cost of your growth, I think, your slide suggests $30,000, $35,000 for flowing BOE per day. And there's acquisitions there equal to or less than that number. Do you see an opportunity to exploit what hopefully is a temporary divergence in the market?","Bill Thomas","So, I think, we want to be really clear on that. We do not envision doing any large M&A, expensive M&A, especially expenses. M&A is -- large M&As are just really not in our game plan. We have tremendous confidence in our organic ability to generate very strong, even better quality inventory than we currently have. And we can do that organically at a much, much lower cost, even compared to what you might think M&A could produce.","So our game plan will be continuing to focus on organic growth, low-cost growth, adding inventory that would be additive to the quality that we have and adding that at really low cost. And we believe we can add very much a large amount of inventory that way if we -- I think, we commented that we're looking -- we're operating in six different basins and we have active prospects in 10 different basins ongoing right now.","So it's the most robust exploration effort, I've been with the company 40 years, that I've seen in the company. So we've got a lot of confidence in our ability to more than replace and to improve our inventory going forward at very, very low cost.","Operator","Next we have Charles Meade with Johnson Rice.","Charles Meade","Yes. Good morning, Bill, to you and the whole team there. I want to just pick up, maybe, on the points you were just commenting on and try them a little bit differently. Going back to your prepared comments, I think, it was point three on your points to differentiate, you said, you -- for mid-50s oil, you expect to grow -- or, excuse me, mid-50 WTI you grow oil comparable to the rate in -- that you grew in 2019, grow the dividend and then I believe it was also grow free cash flow.","And it makes sense that you guys would have better capital efficiency in 2020 than you have in 2019. But can you give me an idea what is that increment that we should be looking for? And did I kind of get that whole setup correct?","Bill Thomas","Now, then you're exactly right, Charles. What we said, is -- what we say is that, we can -- we believe, we can deliver mid-teens growth. We can grow the dividend and generate substantial free cash flow with oil at about $55. So we want to continue to operate.","Obviously, if you look at the company right now, we're operating in a continual -- a very high level, an optimum level. And we're generating a lot of free cash flow. We're producing really, really strong growth. And if you look over the last two years, we've grown the dividend over 70%. So that's what we want to continue to do in the future.","We want to continue to make sure that, first of all, that we're maximizing our returns. Our company's focus has always been on returns and returns come first. And volume growth is just an expression of reinvesting at high returns. So we want to operate at a point, at a level, at a growth level where we continue to get better every year.","And so next year, because of the operational momentum, we have this year and the ongoing cost reductions, we see that continuing going into next year. And so, our focus is to get better and to make better returns next year. And that will help us to grow at a very healthy rate and it also help us to generate very substantial free cash flow.","And so, we're also focused on the dividend. We want to have -- as we've talked in the past, I think, we've kind of -- a very good indication over the latter of the last two years, with dividend increases of 30% or better per year. And we want to do that going forward.","We're not going to commit to the level we're going to increase the dividend specifically, but we want to continue to have strong dividend growth in the future. And so, of course, that all depends on the macro environment what the oil price is and we evaluate that every quarter, our Board does. And we'll make those decisions on a quarterly basis. But our goal is to get our dividend yield up to the 2% yield level as quick as possible.","Charles Meade","That's a helpful elaboration. Thank you. And then, if I could ask the follow-up on the Middle Wolfcamp perhaps of Ezra. Ezra, you talked a little bit about -- when you're talking about the Third Bone Spring's in response to an earlier question, how many other wells in the industry had targeted the carbonate and the shale. But do you have a similar sense for how many other industry wells have targeted this section in the Wolfcamp M?","Ezra Yacob","Yes, Charles. This is Ezra. I'm glad you asked that question. I was just sitting here trying to figure out if I had actually mentioned that or not. The Wolfcamp Middle, or M, as we call it, it roughly correlates to the Wolfcamp B and part of the C as known by some other operators.","And so, really across the Delaware Basin, there have been a few hundred wells drilled in a similar target there. And so we've got -- that's one of the reasons we've looked at all that data, they're landing zones, we've incorporated that with our own data to go ahead and announce this premium play.","Charles Meade","Got it. That's what I was after. Thanks Ezra.","Operator","Next we have Jeffrey Campbell of Tuohy Brothers Investment Research. Please go ahead.","Jeffrey Campbell","Good morning and congratulations on the quarter. I thought the supply agreement with Cheniere was both interesting and innovative and it brought up two questions. So the first one is, what sort of long-term price uplift versus Henry Hub do you expect from that portion of your supply that's indexed to the JKM Marker? And second, is this kind of a deal that you're looking at repeating again in the future, maybe with Cheniere or maybe another LNG exporter?","Bill Thomas","I'm going to ask Lance to comment on that one.","Lance Terveen","Yes Jeff. Hey, good morning. Thanks for the question. First, to start off, I mean, it kind of follows up with what Billy talked about. I mean, this new transaction and the gas sales agreements that we've done with Cheniere, it's really consistent with our marketing strategy in how we're trying to diversify our sales points and having multiple options.","And really when we undertook this process when you really look at Cheniere, I mean they are the industry leader. I mean if you look at the 7.5 Bcf a day that's being exported today on LNG, they represent 5.5. So expanding our business with them, we're very excited about. And just a reminder that starts at the 140,000 MMBtus a day starting in January of next year and that ramps up to the 440,000.","But on your question just on the price realizations as that contract starts up next year, we'll be incorporating that into our guidance. So I'm not going to give any specific color on that. But what I can tell you that's why it got us excited about it is just when you look at the amount of LNG demand growth that's going to be coming on especially over like the next 10 years, it's definitely all in the Asia Pacific region. And so tying it to that and to see especially with significant weather events in those areas it's -- it can provide as you look historically for significant upside. So that's what got us excited about that.","And then your last question there just about new structures and new deals. I mean, we're very excited about this first and we're going to stay poised. I think, we're going to continue to watch the market. We're always looking for new opportunities in diversifying our portfolio. So we'll definitely be staying active in the future as we look at new structures that may come in front of us.","Jeffrey Campbell","Thanks for that color, Lance. I appreciate it. My other question was earlier in the call there was some discussion of the corporate decline. And slide 49 notes that longer laterals exhibit shallower declines than shorter laterals, and I assume that's a comparison within a given play. I wondered if some of the portfolio plays as a whole exhibit shallower declines than others. And does this help influence attracting capital?","Bill Thomas","Yeah, Jeffrey. That decline rate is something that we're very much focused on in the company. And so as we continue to focus our capital and high grade our capital, we do consider that as part of the process. And so we're looking at low decline, lower decline plays particularly in our exploration efforts. Some of the newer plays we've announced in the last several years have lower decline than some of our historical plays. And then we're also looking and focused on lower finding costs.","So low finding costs, low decline plays are certainly preferred for us and that's a focus of our exploration effort. And it really is a function of the quality of the rock in combination with the completion technology and they work together to help in that regard.","So we're focused on that and that helps the company get better. That's part of the process. We've been going on the last several years. It's helped us get better in the last couple of years; certainly this year and we think that will continue to help us in the future.","Operator","And next we have Neal Dingmann of SunTrust.","Neal Dingmann","Just want to get through all the details. And you talked a little bit -- I see as you always done on your slide 5 you break out the premium sort of parameters. I guess my question is more around slide 36 and just what caused the changes in both what you were able to add but also to the Eagle Ford Bakken and Woodford, I think that was down a little bit on those. I'm just wondering what contributed to that?","Bill Thomas","Billy would you comment on that?","Billy Helms","Yeah, I think an important point to take away, Neal is that this represents our best estimate going forward on each play. The Eagle Ford as we've talked about it's an update relative -- taking into account the number of wells we drilled and then what we have remaining. The important point on the Eagle Ford is to recognize as Ken discussed, we have 2,200 remaining locations that we can continue to work on to convert to premium over time as we continue to move into areas that are less developed.","So I think that's the upside on the Eagle Ford. The rest of the plays it just represents kind of what we see as the remaining inventory at this point in time for each one of these plays that are mentioned here. And overall it's in keeping with replacing -- more than replacing what we drill every year.","Neal Dingmann","Very good. And then Bill maybe just one broad question. I'm just wondering when you look at what's been mentioned today about the growth versus the free cash versus shareholder return, I'm just wondering when you sort of put out there the 15% growth to $55 is your primary delta, kind of, what free cash flow you want to achieve? Or what shareholder return? I'm just wondering how you all go about thinking about that.","Bill Thomas","Yeah. Certainly the free cash flow is an important component of it. So it's a balance of allocating capital at the right that we can get better and can increase our returns every year. It is certainly focused on generating substantial free cash flow and continuing to increase the dividend in a very strong manner too. So we want to work on all three of those.","And then as you know we have been reducing our debt. And Tim talked about that in the opening remarks. And so we want to continue to pay off those bonds as they mature. So we look at all that but, primarily it's really focusing the capital on generating really strong returns and certainly working on the dividend.","Neal Dingmann","Very helpful. Thanks guys.","Operator","Next we have Leo Mariani of KeyBanc.","Leo Mariani","Hey guys, I fully appreciate that you guys don't have 2020 guidance out there. You certainly talked about the mid-teens oil growth rate at $55 WTI, which sounds great. I guess just from a high level philosophical perspective, in order to kind of achieve that, do you guys think you'd have to increase activity and CapEx at all? Or maybe a little bit to do that? Or do you think the efficiencies are such that you could do that with a similar type of activity?","Bill Thomas","I'll ask Billy to comment on that.","Billy Helms","Yeah Leo. This is Billy Helms. I think the takeaway would be we're going to be targeting as Bill said how do we continue to improve, what we do. We're not going to give you any specific guidance on how much capital that's going to deploy. We have the capability of increasing activity if the commodity outlook supports that. But we're going to stay extremely flexible at this point in time to make sure that as we go into the next year, we're doing so with the discipline that we want to maintain in each one of our programs.","So I guess we certainly have the capability of doing whatever the market shows us that is prudent to do. And our programs will support it. And we have the teams to execute any of those programs. So we'll just, kind of, leave it there for right now.","Leo Mariani","Okay. I guess just wanted to see if we can get maybe a little bit more kind of a high-level update on some of the new plays. I certainly realize you guys aren't ready to announce any of the exploration plays but I know you've drilled a number of wells in 2019. Really just wanted to get a sense of whether or not on some of the wells you've drilled you think that you're getting competitive economics even in these early stages here to the point where you can foresee some new premium drilling inventory? Any comments on that?","Bill Thomas","I'm going to ask Ezra to comment on that.","Ezra Yacob","Yeah, Leo. Thank you for the question. This is Ezra. As we've discussed previously, we're very excited about our exploration program. And Bill had mentioned that we're currently leasing and testing in over 10 different basins across all of our divisions, our focus primarily on oilier plays with higher rock quality that we've applied. We're searching for these plays. We're prospecting for plays that we've applied core and log data in our reservoir models developed from our multi-basin approach. So really leveraging off of our efforts in the Delaware Basin, the Powder River Basin, the Eagle Ford and Woodford oil window to really identify rock quality that will perform very well in combination with our horizontal drilling and completions technology and hopefully deliver slightly shallower declines. And hopefully we'll be very competitive with our current inventory. Again we want to increase the quality of our inventory not just add to the back end. As far as that, we're confident in our reservoir models. And hopefully we'll be able to update you on a future call.","Operator","And next we have Scott Hanold of RBC Capital Markets.","Scott Hanold","Yeah, thanks. You all talked about hitting some of your -- the cost reduction targets this year and it sounds like you've got some new efficiencies you're seeing in place. Is there anything specific you can point out to outside of, hey we're drilling faster but like specifically what's happening on the ground and maybe even from a technological side that's causing that improved uplift?","Bill Thomas","Yes, Billy will comment on that.","Billy Helms","Yes, Scott. It's not any one specific thing that helps us achieve these improved efficiencies. It goes back to what Bill talked about in his opening comments. It's the culture of the company. It's the drive of every one of our operating teams to continue to get better. And I couldn't be prouder of the execution those guys have made.","One example on the drilling side to help us get the wells drilled faster as I mentioned in the prepared remarks the innovations we've made on designing drilling motors that enable us to increase the speed at which we do and the reliability of those tools to keep them in the ground is just one example.","There's several examples on the completion side that go along with that to allow us to complete more of the lateral feet per day than we used to a year ago at a much lower cost and still deliver the same productivity improvements that we're seeing as we deliver the production from our wells. So it's just a number of different things. And it's hard for us to capture them all in one call like this, but just to say, that everybody in each division is working hard to try to continue to improve every day.","Scott Hanold","Okay, understood. And then if I could try a question on next year's activity just at a high level. I mean it seems like this year if I'm not mistaken you've got around $400 million of that $6.3 billion budget allocated to kind of research development and technological improvements. As you look into 2020 should we expect a very similar amount? Or -- and if I'm not mistaken I thought 2019 was going to be heavier. What does 2020 look like?","Billy Helms","Scott, we're not I think ready at this point to give you a specific number on that. But we do certainly have an ongoing exploration and leasing program and so we'll continue to keep that up. But we won't give you a specific number on that. We're still working through all those details.","Operator","And next we have Joseph Allman of Baird.","Joseph Allman","Thank you. Good morning. My question is on political risk. Bill, EOG has been very good at reducing political risk, for example, not operating in Colorado. What steps might you take to reduce the political risk that you addressed in your slides related to federal acreage?","Bill Thomas","Well, I think, as we've talked about I think in the opening remarks we do have a very active permitting process going on. So we're well ahead of that. We have two to four years of permits in hand. And we have the ability to modify our operations and we have a lot of flexibility with the different operating areas and shifting rigs here and there. And so we will -- we have been and we will continue to actively develop our federal acreage position very strongly. So we'll -- we've not really ever I think had a problem working with any of the regulatory changes. We have a great relationship with BLM and a great relationship with the state governments that we are active in. So it all works together. We try to be a good citizen, a good operator. And it really has worked out well for us in the past.","Joseph Allman","Thanks, Bill. And then my second question is on the Austin Chalk. What is preventing the Austin Chalk from making it to the list of premier plays? You clearly have many great wells. Do you just not have enough to call it a premier play? Or is it really on the cost side? And you're drilling a couple dozen wells a year. So it would seem to be -- it's at least a great play if not a premier play.","Bill Thomas","Yes. Well I think the first thing is when you think about the Austin Chalk, it's a really big play. It goes a long ways. And it's got all different kinds of aspects to it. And we've been very successful in our -- under our Eagle Ford acreage we have great results in the Austin Chalk. And it's certainly an exploration target for us. And we have multiple places in the play that we're looking and testing. And so they keep our competitive advantage on making sure we get the acreage in the right spot. We haven't talked about anything specific. But we will at some point and we'll give you some updates on our progress in the Chalk.","Operator","Next we have Arun Jayaram of JPMorgan.","Arun Jayaram","Hey, Bill, I wanted to talk to you or ask you about the potential sensitivity to your 2020 program to lower oil prices. I think you outlined a mid-teens oil growth at $55. If oil prices average closer to $50 per barrel would you adjust activity accordingly? And could you discuss broadly the sensitivity to your oil growth rate at a $50 number?","Bill Thomas","Well, we can't give you any specifics there Arun. But certainly we would adjust our capital. Again, we want to have great returns. That's numbers one. We want to have strong oil growth. We want to have substantial free cash flow. So we continue to work on the dividend. So we really balance all those. And we would set it appropriately based on our macro view of oil in 2020. And at this point, we don't want to speculate, whether it's going to be higher or lower. We're just trying to give you some guidelines of kind of where we see our efforts next year.","Arun Jayaram","Great, great and just a follow-up, I know the reduction in your rig count in the second half has garnered a lot of attention. But it sounds like this decline was driven by rig efficiencies.","I guess my question is, in 2019 Bill, you're delivering call it 740 net wells for $6.3 billion, in capital. If we were going to bake in the rig efficiencies, you're seeing today OFS deflation do you have any thoughts on what your CapEx dollar could do incremental to 2019? Could we see another call it 5% to 10% improvement in well cost next year?","Bill Thomas","Again Arun, we're not going to give you any specific numbers. So -- but we do certainly believe that, our capital efficiency will improve next year over this year. We definitely believe that our well costs will continue to decrease next year too. So and we're certainly hopeful operating costs will continue to go down.","So the company just incrementally is getting better every quarter. And our culture, and our people, and our divisions are just doing a tremendous job in doing that. And so, along with oil prices, we bake all that in and that will really determine what our plan will be.","Operator","Next we have Michael Scialla of Stifel.","Michael Scialla","Yeah. Good morning, everybody. If you are successful with these new exploration plays, they turn out to generate better returns than even your premium inventory. I just want to see how quickly they could move to the top of the drilling inventory.","And if they're not just additive, would that allow you to actually replace some inventory to where you could look at monetizing some of the inventory that's maybe at the end of the spectrum?","Bill Thomas","Yeah. And Michael thank you for your question, yeah the plays, the ones we're looking at these 10 different basins, most of them are in areas, where we could increase activity reasonably fast not jump in with 10 rigs in one year. But we could incrementally I think add rigs to each one of these plays and develop the infrastructure.","They're not in -- most of them are not in places where you couldn't do that fairly quickly. So, if they were incremental to our returns, we would certainly move that way on each one of them as quickly as possible.","And we have a lot of inventory obviously in the company. And we have sold, I think about $6 billion -- over $6 billion of properties over the last 10 years. And we'll continue to look to get value through possibly monetizing, any of that. But we don't think they'll ever get to a premium category. So, certainly that would be another avenue to add value to the company.","Michael Scialla","Okay. Thanks. And then, Bill you mentioned last quarter you were pleased with those first three Niobrara wells in the Powder. And then it looks like you added another one this quarter. ","One of your nearby competitors had some favorable things to say about the Niobrara this quarter. I just want to see, how you're viewing that zone relative to the other targets in the Powder River Basin.","Bill Thomas","I'm going to ask Billy to comment on that.","Billy Helms","Yeah. I think we're very pleased with the early results we're seeing from the Niobrara play. It's -- it looks to be something that we had hoped for. It's going to be more of an oily play in that Powder River Basin that we can grow oil volumes. And be competitive with the rest of our inventory.","And we're going at a pace now, that's really dictated by the learning's that we're taking into account, but also the infrastructure we have there now. And as we've mentioned in earlier calls, the pace of activity will be really married up with our level of spending on infrastructure to grow that play.","But it looks to be a play that we can see us growing another leg of growth that we'll have in the future.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference call back over to, Mr. Thomas for his closing remarks, Sir?","Bill Thomas","Yeah. So I'd just like to say that again, we're just so pleased with another outstanding performance by EOG in the third quarter. And we want to say many thanks to everyone in the company for making it happen. They're doing a fantastic job.","The company continues to improve in every area. Our costs continue to fall. Oil well results are very strong. Capital efficiency continues to improve. And our premium inventory continues to grow.","So our high-return organic growth machine is running at the most optimum level in the company's history. And most importantly, we're very excited about performing at an even higher level in 2020.","So again, thank you for listening. And thank you for your support.","Operator","And we thank you sir and to the rest of the management team for your time also today. Again, the conference call is now concluded. Again, we thank you all for attending today's presentation.","At this time, you may disconnect your lines. Thank you. Just take care. And have a great day, everyone."],"8946":["EOG Resources Inc.

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to the Chief Financial Officer of EOG Resources, Mr. Tim Driggers. Please go ahead.","Tim Driggers","","Thanks April. Good morning. I am Tim Driggers, CFO. Thanks for joining us. We hope everyone has seen the press release announcing first quarter 2014 earnings and operational results.","This conference call includes forward-looking statements. The risks associated with forward-looking statements have been outlined in the earnings release and EOG's SEC filings and we incorporate those by reference for this call.","This conference call also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation schedules for these non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures can be found on our website at www.eogresources.com.","The SEC permits oil and gas companies in their filings with the SEC to disclose not only proved reserves, but also probable reserves as well as possible reserves. Some of the reserve estimates on this conference call and webcast may include potential reserves or other estimated reserves not necessarily calculated in accordance with or contemplated by the SEC's reserve reporting guidelines.","We incorporate by reference the cautionary note to U.S. investors that appears at the bottom of our press release in Investor Relations page on our website.","Participating on the call this morning are, Bill Thomas, Chairman and CEO, Gary Thomas, Chief Operating Officer, Billy Helms, Executive VP, Exploration and Production, Mario Baldwin, Vice President, IR.","An updated IR presentation was posted to our website yesterday evening and we included second quarter and full year guidance in yesterday's press release. This morning we will discuss topics in the following order. I will first discuss our 2014 first quarter net income and discretionary cash flow, and then Bill Thomas and Billy Helms will review operational results, I\u2019ll then review EOG's financials and capital structure. Finally, Bill Thomas will cover EOG's macro view and hedge position and provide concluding remarks.","As outlined in our press release, for the first quarter 2014 EOG reported net income of $661 million or $1.21 per share. EOG's first quarter 2014 adjusted non-GAAP net income which eliminates the mark-to-market impact in certain non-recurring items as outlined in the press release was $768 million or $1.40 per share. Non-GAAP discretionary cash flow for the first quarter was $2.2 billion. At March 31, 2014 the debt-to-total cap ratio was 27%. Due to a buildup of cash on the balance sheet the net debt-to-total cap ratio was 21%, down from 23% at December 31, 2013.","I will now turn it over to Bill Thomas to discuss operational results and key players.","Bill Thomas","","Thanks Tim. We started 2014 delivering excellent first quarter results; our total oil production was up 42% year over year. In the US oil production was up 45% sequentially. Total company production increased 18% compared with the first quarter of 2013. Based on these first quarter production result and our confidence in the remainder of the year we are raising our full year 2014 oil production growth estimate from 27% to 29% and total company, total growth estimates from 11.5% to 12%. Our actual unit cost came in lower than guidance particularly for LOE and transportation, with DD&A also at the low end. ","In yesterday\u2019s press release, we announced we\u2019re adding 735 high rate of return net drilling locations in the sweet spots at four plays, with estimated reserve potential of 770 million barrels of oil equivalent gross or 400 million barrels of oil equivalent net to EOG. We\u2019ve identified approximately 10 solid years of drilling inventories in these four plays. Two of these plays are in the DG basin, primarily in Laramie County Wyoming and extending into Weld County Colorado. ","I\u2019ll first discuss the Codell play, this is a sandstone play that we have thoroughly defined geologically and with recent horizontal drilling results we\u2019ve identified the best acreage and are making very repeatable consistent wells. We have 72,000 net prospective acres in the sweet spot of this play in Laramie County Wyoming, where we\u2019ve identified 225 net well locations with estimated reserve potential of a 125 million barrels of oil equivalent net to EOG. ","Last year we drilled three net Codell wells and this year we completed four net wells, all of them have long nine thousand foot laterals and IP\u2019s in excess of 1000 barrels of oil per day. The wells average 78%, 36 degree API oil, we noted a few of these wells in our press release, this year we plan to drill 26 net wells, these wells had an expected average EUR of 695 mboe per well. Once we optimize well productivity through EOG technology and sourcing of completion materials and meet our target well cost of 7.3 million, this play should yield after-tax rates of returns greater than 100%. The second play in the DJ Basin is the Niobrara shale in Laramie County, Wyoming and Weld County, Colorado where we have 50,000 net acres in the sweet spot of this play. We have studied the Niobrara for a number of years and have found this part of the basin as quite consistent. We drilled three net wells in the Niobrara last year. The reserves are 71%, 35 degree API oil with the expected average growth EURs of 430 MBoe per well.","Target well cost for our 9,000 foot lateral are $9 million due to larger fracs and yield a direct a-tax rate of return of approximately 40%. We are currently completing our first long lateral. As we've done in all our resource plays, we expect to improve well productivity and decrease well cost and improve the rates of return on this play. We see plenty of room for upside. We've identified 235 net drilling locations with estimated net reserve potential of 85 billion barrels of oil equivalent. We plan to drill a total of 39 net wells in the DJ this year, 26 in the Codell formation and 13 in the Niobrara. We are currently operating a two rig drilling program and plan to add a third rig later this month.","We expect crude oil production growth from these two plays beginning this year. We also highlighted two plays in Powder River Basin. In the Powder River Parkman, we have 30,000 net prospected acres of high quality play. Last year we drilled 10 net wells and this year so far we completed six net wells. Initial production rates from shorter length laterals exceed 1,000 barrels of oil per day; and the 90 day cumulative oil production looks good. We expect results from longer laterals would be even better.","With 7,300 foot lateral wells have expected average growth EURs of 850 MBoe per well of which 69% is 41 degree API oil. With 5 million completed well cost direct after-tax rate of returns exceed 100%, making the Parkman the highest rate of return play of the four discussed today. We are already seeing improved drilling times and cost savings with regard to completion materials. Estimated net potential reserves are 75 million barrels of oil equivalent. We have identified 115 net drilling locations. Much like the Niobrara, EOG has been drilling in the Turner formation for several years. So this play is not so new, but our results have improved significantly.","Today, we have a much better understanding of the geology in the area and are now drilling in the best areas of the play. Through longer laterals and focused targeting our wells are improving, they are yielding higher EURs and higher oil mix. The wells we drilled in 2011 had 26% oil mix versus 34% today. Last year, we drilled eight net wells; the lateral lengths in the Turner will vary from 4,600 to 9,000 feet. The average gross EUR for an 8,200 foot lateral is 860 MBoe per well. The returns here average 100% direct after-tax with a 7.5 million completed well cost. The estimated potential reserves are 115 million barrels of oil equivalent, net on our 63,000 net acres in the Turner. We have identified 160 net drilling locations.","Running a two rig program, we plan to drill a total of 34 net wells in the Powder River this year; 28 in the Parkman formations and six in the Turner. Regarding explorations, we continue to actively search for additional new plays. As we\u2019ve previously mentioned, our new discovery the size of our estimated 3.2 billion barrels equivalent net Eagle Ford potential reserves would be difficult to repeat. However, the plays announced in yesterday's press release are significant and three of the four plays are oil plays with very strong direct a-tax rate of return. We are currently completing our first long lateral in the Niobrara and are optimistic on the overall economics of this play.","We plan to continue to add these types of high rate of return bolt-on oil plays to our portfolio. We\u2019ve set a high threshold at EOG with plays like the Eagle Ford, Bakken, and Leonard. Other plays that compete for capital require the same rate of return metrics. The plays we\u2019ve announced today are certainly in that category.","In the Eagle Ford, we\u2019ve increased activity compared to last year. We\u2019re on track to drill 520 net wells this year. We're currently running 26 rigs in the play and the Eagle Ford was the biggest contributor to our first quarter oil growth and the reason we exceeded our first quarter oil production guidance. We continue to make improvements in well productivity and as our press release cited, a number of recent Eagle Ford wells have IP rates in excess of 4,000 barrels of oil per day. The Eagle Ford continues to be our largest growth asset with the highest after-tax rates of return.","By mid-year, the vast majority of our drilling obligations for 2014 to hold our 564,000 net acreage position in the crude oil window will be essentially complete, giving us much more flexibility to efficiently manage our drilling and production operations.","We modeled our Eagle Ford production for the next 10 years. If we increase this year's 520 net wells by a modest amount and hold that number flat through 2024, our Eagle Ford oil volumes increase every year. The Eagle Ford will draw a free cash flow this year and every year through 2024.","In our model, we haven't assumed any improvements in well productivity or well cost. We've maintained the status quo. We\u2019ve talked about the 6,000 net remaining locations on our acreage. We used a 60% direct after-tax rate of return cut off point in moving these locations into our inventory.","We still have a large number of locations that don't meet this threshold, but we continue to improve, make improvements in well productivity and economics, and are working to move these locations into our drilling inventory.","I'll now turn it over to Billy Helms to discuss other areas.","Billy Helms ","Thanks Bill. Last year we increased the drilling density in the Bakken from two to four wells per spacing unit. Due to higher tighter spacing and configuration of leases, the majority of our 2013 drilling in the Core and Antelope Extension was based on 1,300 feet between wells. The successful 1,300 foot spacing across our acreage, we are now testing 700 feet and tighter spacing between wells in the Core and Antelope Extension areas.","Hoping to repeat what EOG achieved in the Eagle Ford, we will continually test downspacing until we've maximized the net present value in the overall play. We are early in the life of these tests and we will monitor production history to determine optimal spacing for development. If tighter spacing proves successful, a number of years would be added to our Bakken drilling inventory. The majority of our 2014 development program is in the Core area, where we already have pad drilling and completion infrastructure.","We are currently operating six rigs in the Williston Basin with plans to add a seventh this summer. During the first quarter, we completed a number of wells on our Core acreage, the Wayzetta 28-1424H, 29-1424H and 38-1424H were completed at initial oil rates of 1,060, 1,295 and 1,000 barrels of oil per day with 105, 125 and 100 barrels per day of NGLs, respectively. These wells were drilled off the same pad. Less than 2,000 feet from these wells, the Wayzetta 39-1424H and 40-1424H, were completed at 1,760 and 2,220 barrels of oil per day with 170 and 215 barrels per day of NGLs respectively. In the Permian, our 2014 activity is focused in the Delaware Basin, where we've more than doubled the number of wells we plan to drill this year compared to last year's total.","In the Leonard Shale, we continue to test various spacing patterns across our acreage to determine the optimal development program. Recent test were drilled with 660 feet or 80 acres and 430 feet spacing, 60 acres between the wells. The Dillon 31 number 1H, number 2H and number 3H were drilled with 430 feet between wells. This is our most dense, same zone spacing test to-date. The wells came online with 1,225, 1,395 and 1,315 barrels of oil per day respectively. Based on these successful results, we plan to test tighter spacing both between wells and across zones throughout our 73,000 net acre position.","We are currently testing 32 acre spacing across different zones. Through an active development program, we continue to better define our acreage. In the Delaware Wolfcamp, we drilled eight wells this year. The wells produced a lower initially oil rate than the Leonard but had a very flat production profile, which generates a very strong after-tax rate of return. To-date, we have tested three liquids-rich zones within the Delaware Basin Wolfcamp, and are testing various spacing patterns as tight as 50 acres between wells as we develop these zones. We're seeing improved well productivity in both the Leonard and Wolfcamp plays. Because we've now moved into development mode, our drilling operations are more efficient resulting in decreased drilling days and cost. We're currently operating a four rig program in the basin.","Completion costs have also decreased with the integration of EOGs sourced sand and other materials. Further enhancements in our geoscience and completions work continue to improve our two Delaware Basin plays, and we are confident. We realize ongoing improvements and additional success in the Basin. In Trinidad, we have a three well development drilling program planned for 2014, which will allow us to maintain flat natural gas production in later years. In the East Irish Sea, the Conwy prospect is still expected to be online in late 2014.","I'll now turn it over to Tim Driggers to discuss financials and capital structure.","Tim Driggers","Thanks, Billy. For the first quarter, capitalized interest was $14.2 million. Total cash expiration and development expenditures were $1.8 billion, excluding asset retirement obligations. In addition, expenditures for gathering systems, processing plants and other property, plant and equipment were $166 million.","EOG made $4 million of acquisitions during the quarter. During the first quarter, net cash provided by operating activities exceeded financing and investing cash outflows. At the end of March, total debt outstanding was $5.9 billion. At March 31, we had $1.7 billion of cash on hand. The effective tax rate for the first quarter was 36% and the deferred tax-rate ratio was 63%. Yesterday, we included guidance table with the earnings press release for the second quarter and full year 2014. For the second quarter and full year, the effective tax rate is estimated to be 35% to 40%. We have also provided an estimated range of the dollar amount of current taxes that we expect to record during the second quarter and for the full year.","Now, I'll turn it back to Bill to provide EOG's views regarding the macro-environment hedging and operations.","Bill Thomas","Thanks Tim. With regards to oil, we believe we are in a continued tight supply demand situation globally. Last year, the U.S. was the largest oil growth area in the world. However, the rate of oil growth in the U.S. is beginning to slow and 2014 non-OPEC supplies have been revised downward while global demand for oil from non-OECD countries continues to increase. Therefore, we expect to see strong oil processed for the remainder of this year barring a global recession.","Regarding North America gas, taking into account current store levels and assuming normal weather, we expect prices to remain stable in the $4.50 to $5 range due to summer of 2014. This is with a caveat that E&P companies stay disciplined at these gas prices and don't ramp up drilling activity. Once we enter the storage withdrawal season, we expect to see upward pressure on gas prices. Late next year, the first LNG plant at Sabine Pass is scheduled to begin exporting natural gas. This could signal the beginning of a structural change in natural gas demand. In 2016, a number of new petrochemical plants utilizing natural gas feedstock are expected to be commissioned, the remainder of the LNG commission plants are scheduled for start-up in \u201818.","For May 2014, EOG has crude oil financial price swap contracts in place for 181,000 barrels of oil per day at a weighted average price of 96.55 per barrel. For June 2014, EOG has crude oil financial price swap contracts in place for 171,000 barrels of oil per day at a weighted average price of 96.35 per barrel. For the period July 1 through December 31, 2014, EOG has crude oil financial price swap contracts in place for 74,000 barrels of oil per day at a weighted average price of 95.37 per barrel. These numbers exclude options that are exercisable by our counterparties.","For the period June 1 through December 31, 2014, EOG has natural gas financial price swap contracts in place for 330,000 million British thermal units per day at a weighted average price of 4.55 per million British thermal units. For the period January 1 through December 31, 2015, EOG has natural gas financial price swap contracts in place for 175,000 MMBtu per day at a weighted average price of $4.51 per MMBtu. These numbers exclude options that are exercisable by our counterparties. As it relates to EOG and the overall macro environment, EOG's marketing and midstream investments again prove invaluable in the first quarter. In the U.S., EOG realizations average $1.97 over West Texas Intermediate index process. However, we continue to sell the majority of our oil index of LLS pricing. ","Now let me conclude, there are five important takeaways from this call. First, EOG continues to demonstrate its ability to organically grow. Yesterday, we announced the addition of 735 high rate of return net drilling locations with 10 years of drilling inventory from the sweet spots of four high quality, high oil content onshore U.S. plays. This is proof of our very disciplined approach to adding new plays. First, we identify the potential. Second, we capture the acreage. Third, we apply technology to the play until results meet our rate of return criteria. What's significant is that these are predominantly oil plays that compares favorably with our current highest rate of return plays. Our goal is to increase EOG's ROE and ROCE and by adding these higher rate of return plays we are doing so.","Second, we increased our oil production growth target for the year from 27% to 29%. We've said all along that EOG has the best horizontal crude oil assets in the U.S. and they continue to deliver.","Third, the Eagle Ford continues to demonstrate improvements in well productivity from ongoing refinements and completion techniques. In modeling production from the Eagle Ford we are on a growth track for the next 10 years and I want to repeat in modeling production from the Eagle Ford, we are on a growth track for the next 10 years before we even begin to see production level out.","Fourth, we are testing additional downspacing patterns in the Bakken, Leonard, and Wolfcamp plays. We will continue to test downspacing until we\u2019ve reached maximum optimization for each of these plays.","To wrap it up, EOG turned in another outstanding quarter. Our U.S. oil plays continue to deliver. We continue to make improvements and completions even in our most mature plays, the Eagle Ford and Bakken. EOG is running like a finely tuned high performance engine.","Thanks for listening and now we\u2019ll go to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","Thank you, (Operator Instructions), and we\u2019ll first hear from Doug Leggate at Bank of America \u2013 Merrill Lynch.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, good morning everybody, I love the pronunciation on these calls, but thanks for all the color Bill on the new plays, I guess my question is on Slide 9 in your presentation. You show how they stack up on a relative basis with the IRR. So I guess what I\u2019m really trying to understand is, how should we think about capital allocation here as we go forward, as you grow your cash flow? And specifically, I wonder if you could address the 60% threshold in the Eagle Ford that you haven't included in your inventory. What's it going to take to get those into a competitive position and how will that theoretically change your capital allocation? Then I've got a follow-up, please.","Bill Thomas ","Yes, Doug, yes, on the capital allocation, as we go forward, we've given guidance in the past and we want to reiterate this, at number one, the first priority is to the dividend, and we want to continue our 15-year history of a healthy dividend increase. Next, the focus is on reinvesting that capital back into the highest rate of return plays, and now, we have more of those to offer up. ","And first, certainly the Eagle Ford is the highest rate of return play we have, and so the biggest amount of capital will go to that. The Bakken Three Forks next, the Leonard, the Delaware Basin, Leonard and now we have opportunities to reinvest at high returns in the DJ Codell, the Parkman and Turner play. ","So that's where we will focus our capital as we go forward. On the Eagle Ford and the remaining inventory that we haven't included because it has not made our 60% a-tax rate of return cutoff, we are focused on that and we have a pretty -- could be a pretty significant number of wells that we can drill and we're doing like we do on all of our plays, we're working on the cost to reduce the cost as we go forward. I think most importantly, we continue to see improvements in the well completions, in the frac technology, and so, we're hopeful that we go forward that those wells will get those returns up into the -- above 60% and down the road, as the years go down the road, we\u2019ll be able to include those in our inventory. So, the reason we haven't listed those really right now is part of our 7,200 well locations is we're just not really focused on those. We're not drilling a lot of those right now, so we just didn't include them.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","My follow-up hopefully is quite quick. I assume by the fact that you've revealed these four additional plays that you're done leasing, and I'm just curious as to -- do you have any additional opportunities to expand your position or have you moved on from those now in terms of new acreage, and I'll leave it there?","Bill Thomas","Yeah, on the new plays, I don\u2019t think -- we wouldn't talk about them unless we had felt like that we captured the sweet spots. We did a very thorough geological evaluation and we have a lot of data, and we have really narrowed down the acreage to the, what we believe are the highest return areas of the play. So, the acreage numbers listed for each play are really the sweet spots where we think we'd have the best chance to make the best wells. And so we think we've captured that and there is probably additional zones or probably additional areas that would be productive, but we're really focused on the sweet spots and we have those captured.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Appreciate the answers, thanks Bill.","Operator","Next we\u2019ll hear from Leo Mariani of RBC.","Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets","Hey guys, you made some interesting comments about the Eagle Ford here. Wanted to delve a bit more into your comment about holding the Eagle Ford by production by mid-2014; once you guys are able to achieve that, what type of efficiency gains do you think you'll be able to capture through the drilling program. Maybe you can kind of speak to how you might manage development differently post that.","Bill Thomas","Yeah, Leo, in the first quarter and then some in the second quarter, we drilled a lot of retention wells that means it's kind of the first wells on a unit to hold that acreage. And as we have completed that process, as we complete that process, it gives us the flexibility to go back in and really focus on each unit and begin to pad drill, drill those on pads, multiple wells on pads, and again, optimize our costs and then to focus on making the better wells and getting the spacing right and the completions right. And just able to, I think, have more efficiency and perform better as we go forward.","Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets","","Any kind of sort of big picture or quantification could we see 5% to 10% efficiency gain as a result over the next few years?","Bill Thomas","","Yeah, Leo, I'm going to let Gary Thomas address that question.","Gary Thomas","Yes, Leo, with this now having the majority of our acreage, HBP here second half and ongoing, not having to spend money on roads, location quite so much. Also, the facilities gathering, all of that will be much reduced. It just improves our overall operations. We've drilled some of these wells in as little as 5.3 days, so our days per well will continue to decline with pad drilling. So we'll see certainly the 5% to 10% cost reduction.","Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets","","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And I guess just quickly on the DJ Basin here, you obviously talked about some sweet spots. I guess historically, there has been a decent amount of variability in parts of the DJ in both the Codell and the Niobrara. I guess you kind of laid out some of the wells that you guys have drilled here. What are you guys using for well controls in your programs, are there other industry wells out there and other data that you\u2019re seeing that convinces you that the acreage position you\u2019ve laid out are not all that variable at this point?","Bill Thomas","Yes Leo, we are quite a bit of sub-surfaced well data. With this about 130 wells that are located near our acreage or on our acreage that have defined these sweet spots in the Codell, and in the Niobrara also. And so we believe, you\u2019re correct. The DJ Basin historically has been very variable, so there are sweet spots that really kind of set up by the basin architecture and it varies. We really believe with our good results that we\u2019ve had from the drilling in this area and with our geologic mapping that that we have a spot -- sweet spot that will give us very consistent results. So that's why we\u2019re focused on these areas.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Singer of Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs","Wanted to try to jack that up a little some of the macro comments you made, with just how you're thinking about your investment and growth at the EOG level. Maybe I\u2019ll start with gas here first. The outlook you delivered, I felt like, is a little more bullish on natural gas than what you\u2019ve delivered previously. Obviously weather has probably played a role in that. You highlighted that it is contingent on producers been disciplined. Given your free cash flow and the gas, the acreage you identify on one of your slides, how does EOG stay disciplined and what would it take if anything to allocate some capital to gas, not necessarily taking out of oil but just allocating more capital to gas? ","Bill Thomas","Yes, Brian, I think we're mildly bullish on near-term gas that we think it will be in $4.50 to $5 range, and we are really not prepared and we really don't want to invest any additional money at this time in any dry gas drilling. The reason is because we want to really see what the long-term gas price is going to do, and that's going to depend a lot on what operators do at $4.50 and $5 gas prices. There's so much gas potential out there that it could easily drill a lot of wells and the price of gas would decrease. So, we really want to wait and be patient on that. You're right, we have tremendous amounts of very high quality gas assets, and we really would need $5.50 or a better price, and we would need to believe that that $5.50 or better price would hang in there for multiple years before we'd even think about drilling dry gas.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs","Got it, thanks and my follow-up is going to oil, big picture, you highlighted you're accelerating oil production per year on a barrel a day basis. I think it\u2019s Slide 14 of your presentation, the midpoint of this year's guidance is about 64,000 barrels a day of growth. If we exclude the impact of the Conwy project, do you expect that this level will continue to accelerate in future years, and how does that juxtapose with your macro, your more optimistic macro view in terms of US light oil prices.","Bill Thomas ","Well, we remain bullish on light oil prices. Certainly as we talked about from the macro view, we continue to see a tight supply worldwide and we do not see any pending crisis on overloading the system, the U.S. system, the refinery system to be able to process all that oil. So our focus is going to be to reinvest back into the highest return plays and the highest return plays, we fully believe in the next few years will be our oil plays. We will continue to -- as they prove up and continue to give us high rate returns, we will continue to add capital back into those. Of course, the focus will be Eagle Ford, Bakken, but now we have a good set of plays that we have a lot of opportunity to reinvest in. So our focus is going to be oil for quite some time.","","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs","I mean you likely won't need 64,000 barrels a day of oil growth per year to have above peer average type growth, but do you see that 64,000 rising in terms \u2013 as a rate of growth.","Bill Thomas ","I wouldn't say it would rise, but we think it will be fairly consistent.","Operator","","Next we\u2019ll hear from Charles Meade of Johnson Rice.","","Charles Meade - Johnson Rice","Yes, good morning thanks for taking my question, Bill, when you were talking about those four new plays, you talked about applying technology to the plays. I can think of at least three things that might mean, it might be the D&C cost, it could be high-grading the acreage and locations and it could be improvement of completion designs and associated well productivity. Can you give a sense for at least maybe the newer plays, the Codell and perhaps the Parkman? What progress have you made that brought those into the portfolio? What do you think the opportunity is going to be for continued improvement on those dimensions going forward?","Bill Thomas ","Yes Charles, that\u2019s a good question, it starts with the sweet spot, so we drilled quite a few Parkman wells and with that data and the other geologic data available, we've really narrowed down this acreage in the Parkman to the very sweetest spot. So we're focused on best play, that \u2013 it is a start. Then we brought in the completion technology as we've learned on all these horizontal plays and shale plays, the completion technology continues to advance. We're now seeing even in the conventional \u2013 more conventional rocks like sandstones that the improvements that we've seen in the shale plays also apply to those two. So the completion process I think has allowed us to increase the initial production on the rate, on the rates on the wells and the reserve potential on the wells. That along with the EOG been able to come in and apply our kind of shale cost reduction efforts in these plays, to reduce the overall cost, it's really improved the rates of returns on all these plays. So it's a threefold thing really and it really fits into EOG strength.","Charles Meade - Johnson Rice","Got it, and then if I could go back and try one more time on the Eagle Ford inventory question, is this \u2013 the inventory that that's not in your number right now, is this in the oily window where perhaps the reservoir is not as productive or is this down dip in gassier acreage that maybe comes into the inventory when gas is it at 4.50 or 5 bucks.","Bill Thomas","Charles, no, it\u2019s all in the oil window. And it\u2019s in the areas where we may have a bit more geologic geo hazards. All thing and things like that. And it takes a little bit better effort on our part to get frac containment, and we have to change maybe the direction of the wells drilled in and we also have to work a bit harder at getting the frac more evenly distributed along the lateral. So, it's all oil and we have confidence as we go forward that we\u2019re going to be able to continue to make improvements in those areas.","Operator","And next we\u2019ll hear from David Heikkinen with Heikkinen Energy Advisors.","David Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","Good morning Bill. I liked your comments on your 10 years of growth in the Eagle Ford. Given that you model back, can you about how many years of growth do you see in the Bakken?","Bill Thomas","David, we have not done that extensive model in the Bakken yet, because we\u2019re really in the initial stages of downspacing, and I want to ask Billy Helms to make some comments on that.","Billy Helms","Yeah, David, for our Bakken as we illustrated, we\u2019re still very satisfied, very pleased with our 1,300 foot spacing test. But we realized that our NPV, net present value, was not maximized. So, we\u2019re going to be doing lots of additional testing, we did talk about 700 foot spacing pattern and we\u2019ll be testing some various spacing patterns as we try to define how to maximize net present value. This is a similar approach as we've done in most of our shale plays across the company. and until we really find out what that formula looks like, we're really kind of hesitant to state what the upside not be there, but certainly we will provide some more effort on that as we go forward the year, and we're very confident that we're going to have success there.","David Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","On the maximizing NPV, one of the things we've talked a lot about is your IRR doesn't change much, but your EUR may decline per well as NPV goes up. Is that a fair characterization of how your downspacing could actually roll forward?","Bill Thomas","Yes, that's correct. Naturally, as you push wells closer together, you're going to end up having some sharing between wells. That's just inevitable. Our rate of return is still very, very high as you stated, but what we end up doing is adding a lot more recoverable reserves, and there is a lot more net present value to each spacing unit that we drill. So, that's kind of our overall process. And we're still early on in the space, certainly in the Bakken as we try to define that.","David Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","And just If I may, one more follow-up on -- as you talked about NGLs, kind of 2016 plus. How does your significant combo play exposure factor into like your out-year plan and then we've seen -- we think we've seen a floor for NGL prices due to supply demand in exports, would you agree with that as you start thinking '15, '16 plus?","Bill Thomas","Yeah, David, I think NGLs kind of go along with the gas, and we are hopeful that the NGL demand will increase enough to firm up the price. But again, I think from a capital standpoint, we still are very focused on oil and really oil for the next several years is going to be where we're going to think we're going to get the highest return. So as we can get better NGL prices and gas price, both combo plays, we'll become competitive with our oil plays down the road and we'll put capital on those. But near term, we're still focused on oil.","Operator","Irene Haas, Wunderlich Securities has our next question.","Irene Haas - Wunderlich Securities","","Hello everybody. You guys have been super quiet and super stealth about these Rocky Mountain plays, and congratulations to your new drilling inventory in Wyoming and Colorado. And my question for you is really has to do with the Powder River Basin. Can you help me with the 35,000 net acres, so just one layer or is it two, do they overlap? And then really parallel to this is, can we have some color on the geology, are these really -- real continuous play or you just have nailed the sweet spot, and lastly sort of transportation differential things of that nature to ship the oil out of Powder River Basin?","Bill Thomas","Yeah Irene, the Parkman is about 30,000 acres in the sweet spot, net sweet spot and then the Turner is about 63,000 net acres in the sweet spot, and much of that acreage does overlap, but not all of it, and each of those are both sandstone plays. And so we have quite a bit of surface data, and we've mapped the thickest parts of those sandstones and the most productive parts of it. So that's what those two acreage numbers take in consideration and those obviously we're going to make the highest return of oil in each one of those. Let me ask Gary Thomas to answer your question on takeaway for the Powder.","Gary Thomas","We've been really pleased with the various midstream companies. We're working with several and we're looking at \u2013 they're looking at booking in crude line that would come down from North Dakota through Wyoming to be able to pick up our DJ and our Powder River oil. There's also processing in place and companies that are interested in, yes, the expansion as well as put in new processing facilities. So, it\u2019s looking very favorable.","","Operator","","Our next question comes from Pearce Hammond, Simmons & Co.","Pearce Hammond - Simmons & Company","Can you remind us the net resource potential or reserve potential for the Eagle Ford, when you first announced that play? Do you see the same thing unfolding with these new plays in the DJ and PRB?","Bill Thomas ","Yes Pearce, the first number, I mean, the first one come out, it was 900 million barrels equivalent net to EOG and I would say the plays, the four plays that we've announced today, they do not have that upside potential. Obviously, we had 564,000 acres in the Eagle Ford and it\u2019s a very continuous shale play. These plays in particular the Codell, the Turner, and the Parkman are sandstone plays. They're not really shale plays. So they are more defined geologically and really the acreage positions that we've outlined in each one of those is really the sweet spot and probably the best extents of those plays. On the Niobrara, of course it is a shale play, but again, we really think we\u2019ve identified a sweet spot in that 50,000 acres there, and we believe that we\u2019ll get consistent results there. Outside of that acreage that's not really proven to be consistent yet, so we'll just have to see as time goes on where we can maybe expand that, but right now we\u2019re really focused on these individual sweet spots. I would say in the Niobrara, there are multiple targets there and the reserves that we\u2019ve given in this guidance is just assuming one target and it\u2019s assuming six wells per section. So, there is downspacing potential, additional targets in the Niobrara and then in the other plays there could be some downspacing potential there, but that's undefined yet. We\u2019re just hopeful on all that. We\u2019ll have to test that as we go along and if that becomes clear we\u2019ll certainly talk about it.","","Pearce Hammond - Simmons & Company","And then my follow-up is, how do you see service costs right now kind of across the \u2013 all your positions, are you experiencing any tightness, any service cost inflation?","Bill Thomas ","","Pearce, we\u2019re not seeing much, we\u2019re seeing tightening on our drilling rigs. They\u2019ve probably gone up in some areas as much as 5%, but as you know EOG has got so much of our services locked in and self-sourced that we\u2019re not seeing any pressure otherwise. There is a little bit on just trucking, but that\u2019s why we\u2019re putting in our gathering system et cetera, just because these are going to be so long-lived properties, just to hold future costs down.","Operator","Next we\u2019ll hear from David Tameron of Wells Fargo.","David Tameron - Wells Fargo","Hi, just a couple of questions, and I think you've addressed this partially, but could you talk about your desire to ramp and your production (will flow) faster, one additional way to bring NPV forward. So can you talk, address that as \u2013 I know you are at the upper end of your large cap here. So just address that, and then I'll have a follow-up on the Powder.","Bill Thomas ","We're continuing to drill more wells, it's efficiencies in large part. And thinking of the Eagle Ford, yes, we're going to be drilling more wells this year than last, but with the same number of rigs. So we can say that's just continuing to improve our efficiencies and drilling more wells each year without a large addition of capital, even though we plan to spend additional capital on drilling and completion our E&P sector, future years.","Tim Driggers","Yes David, I'll kind of add to that. The Company is not so much focused on production growth. We're really focused on capital return, and that is what drives EOG. We're not interested in drilling low return wells to grow production. So we're going to very much stay focused and very much stay disciplined in our CapEx plans. So the plays have to have a very strong rate of return before we're going to spend money on them.","David Tameron - Wells Fargo","Okay and then just, okay, that\u2019s helpful and then thinking about the Powder, we've done obviously a lot of work on the play and just one thing that's always been a hiccup for people is kind of the gas processing or it seems to be at least the Powder, it has been a, I guess, maybe a more of a hurdle as a better way to approach that. Is that what you guys are running into? And if so, are there plans to address. I heard you talk about infrastructures specifically, is it more on the processing gas side or is it more crude takeaway. I assume those -- I know those are some rail projects out there et cetera. But can you just give us a little better snapshot on infrastructure?","Bill Thomas","We're working on the crude pipeline takeaway there. We believe that's going to be in place soon enough for us. As far the gas processing, that's probably the larger concern, but there is plant expansions in place. So we've got sufficient takeaway at this point and we think that it's going to keep us with our growth in the area.","David Tameron - Wells Fargo","Okay. I\u2019ll let follow somebody else jump in, appreciate it.","Operator","Next we\u2019ll hear from Amir Arif of Stifel Nicolaus.","Amir Arif - Stifel Nicolaus","On the DJ Basin, have you -- I know you mentioned in the EUR estimates only one time, but can you let us know if you've tested the different benches of the Codell and relative and similarly the Niobrara in the Laramie County?","Bill Thomas","Yeah Amir, on the Codell, you just have one target there and we've had good number of wells that we've talked about that we've drilled in that, so we feel great about that. On the DJ, in this area that we're focused on the sweet spot, we drilled one target so far, and it's been in the lower part of the Niobrara and that's the target we feel like will give us very very consistent results. We do have plans later in the year to drill a couple of patterns. The first pattern will be with four Niobrara wells in the lower target and three Codell wells and that's a seven well pattern. Then the second pattern later in the year, we're going to drill six Niobrara wells with three in the upper target and three in the lower target and then three Codell wells, so that's a nine well pattern. So as we drill those and learn how to continue to improve the completions and get into this pattern of drilling, we'll learn a whole lot more about the different targets benches in the Niobrara. And then also the Codell and how all those kind of relate with each other.","Amir Arif - Stifel Nicolaus","Okay, thanks for the color. And then the follow-up question is, just looking at the four new plays, I mean, great returns, great projects to add, but given that the size of 30,000 to 70,000 acres relative to your other plays. Can you just provide some color or comments in terms of the minimum acreage threshold you're looking at when you get into new plays and even some color in terms of where you think we are as an industry in terms of the resource capture and is that part of the reason why you sort of look at smaller acreage plays.","Bill Thomas","Yeah. I think we've learned off the plays, all these resource plays, that really to make the highest returns you really need to focus in the sweet spots and they're variable in size. Obviously, in the sandstone plays and that we talked about, they're a bit smaller. In the shale plays, they can be bigger, but in the case of the DJ basin, the basin has shown quite a bit of variability in the Niobrara there, so you have to be really careful. So that's why we've focused in only the 50,000 acres so far in the Niobrara there. But as far as additional play potential in the U.S., we do see opportunities and as we\u2019ve said before, we have plays that we\u2019re working on in different stages of identification and testing. And so we believe that it's going to be very difficult to find another Eagle Ford that have both the size and the quality, and another Bakken, which would have the size and quality. But we do believe that there will be additional plays that we can capture sweet spots on that will be additive to EOG\u2019s inventory and that will be significant enough for us to focus on. So, when you have multiple hundreds of wells, that\u2019s a nice play size and certainly a kind of thing we want to capture.","Operator","And next we\u2019ll hear from Bob Brackett of Bernstein Research.","Bob Brackett - Bernstein Research","Pretty morning, got a bit of a two part question I noticed you\u2019re carrying fairly wide spacing lifts in these new sandstone lithologies, is that because you think the footprints or the drainage areas are larger?","Bill Thomas","Bob, they do have -- they\u2019re better reservoirs so they have better probability. But I think that's to be determined. We will certainly be evaluating the wells as we get them on these spacings and the frac patterns and the potential interference between the wells. And there could be some room for additional downspacing in the place as we go forward. It\u2019s just typically EOG, we\u2019re very conservative on our reserve estimates when we start these plays out, but that will be our focus is to maximize the NPV, and that's one way to do it is through additional downspacing. ","Bob Brackett - Bernstein Research","And as a follow-up, if I think about going back as far as say the Jake well, what's your strategy for either avoiding or embracing natural fracture systems out there in the front-range?","Tim Driggers","Yes, Bob that\u2019s a good question, the Jake well was really targeted in a different part of the Niobrara than we're focused on right now, more of in the \u2013 what they call the chalk part, we call it the b chalk in the upper part of the Niobrara, and it's also, was very fracture driven. So, we have done extensive mapping on the Niobrara and this lower target, we believe will give us more consistency, number one, and then we also have 3D to identify the fracturing and identifying the faulting. Then I think the third thing is our completion technology has advanced quite a bit and those early wells we drilled were very small fracs with different completion styles. So we're going to be using our latest completion techniques and we think that will be beneficial also.","Bob Brackett - Bernstein Research","","But would you be targeting areas that are highly naturally fractured or you\u2019d avoid those?","Tim Driggers","I think we want to really avoid those. There's always fracturing that's involved in these plays, but really looking for resource play that would be consistent, or we can get excellent matrix contribution. So that's the approach that we're taking.","","Operator","And that does conclude today's question-and-answer session for today. At this time, I would like to turn the conference back over to Bill Thomas for any additional or closing comments.","Bill Thomas ","Thank you for listening. We appreciate all the questions. That's it.","Operator","That does conclude today's conference. Thank you all for your participation."],"8935":["EOG Resources Inc.

As a reminder, this call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to the Chief Financial Officer of EOG Resources, Mr. Tim Driggers. Please go ahead, Sir.","Tim Driggers","Good morning. I am Tim Driggers, CFO. Thanks for joining us. We hope everyone has seen the press release announcing second quarter 2014 earnings and operational results.","This conference call includes forward-looking statements. The risks associated with forward-looking statements have been outlined in the earnings release and EOG's SEC filings and we incorporate those by reference for this call.","This conference call also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation schedules for these non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures can be found on our website at www.eogresources.com.","The SEC permits oil and gas companies in their filings with the SEC to disclose not only proved reserves, but also probable reserves as well as possible reserves. Some of the reserve estimates on this conference call and webcast may include potential reserves or other estimated reserves not necessarily calculated in accordance with or contemplated by the SEC's reserve reporting guidelines.","We incorporate by reference the cautionary note to U.S. investors that appears at the bottom of our press release and Investor Relations page on our website.","Participating on the call this morning are, Bill Thomas, Chairman and CEO, Gary Thomas, Chief Operating Officer, Billy Helms, Executive VP, Exploration and Production, and Mario Baldwin, Vice President, IR.","An updated IR presentation was posted to our website yesterday evening and we included third quarter and full year guidance in yesterday's press release. This morning we will discuss topics in the following order. I will first review our 2014 second quarter net income and discretionary cash flow, and then Bill Thomas and Billy Helms will provide operational results, I\u2019ll then address EOG's financials, capital structure and hedge position. Finally, Bill Thomas will cover EOG's macro view and provide concluding remarks.","As outlined in our press release, for the second quarter 2014, EOG reported net income of $706.4 million or $1.29 per share. EOG's second quarter 2014 adjusted non-GAAP net income which eliminates the mark-to-market impacts and certain non-recurring items as outlined in the press release was $796 million or $1.45 per share. Non-GAAP discretionary cash flow for the second quarter was $2.2 billion. At June 30, 2014 the debt-to-total cap ratio was 26%. The net debt-to-total cap ratio was 22%.","I will now turn it over to Bill Thomas to discuss operational results and key plays.","Bill Thomas","Thanks,Tim. Once again EOG had an outstanding quarter. We posted year-over-year U.S. oil growth of 33% with total company production growth of 17%, which drove excellent financial metrics. We increased the dividend on the common stock by 34%, the second increase this year, and we also announced our success in yet another high return US crude oil play. ","EOG\u2019s workhouse assets, the Eagle Ford and Bakken continued to meet or in most cases exceed our high expectations. Although we\u2019ve been in the Bakken since 2006 and the Eagle Ford since 2010 we are steadily improving individual well results in both plays through continuing advances in completion designs. ","Also due to our ongoing ability to improve efficiencies, we continued to maintain good cost control, which was evident in our second quarter results. Together these plays are continuing to drive high return oil growth and are far from mature. We realized cost reductions during the first half partially due to efficiency gains from the increase in pad drilling in the Bakken and Eagle Ford. In both plays we are drilling longer laterals and utilizing larger fracs because we have secured sand supplies. ","With pad completions, a large number of offset wells are taken off-line. Wells take longer to flow back and new wells are brought on production and packages. As a result, production growth can be lumpy rather than linear. As many of you who follow state data have noticed. This doesn't change EOG\u2019s long-term growth profile. As mentioned in yesterday's press release, we announced success of the second Bone Spring Sand which lies beneath our Leonard shale acreage in the Delaware Basin. This is the fifth oil or combo plate EOG has added to its drilling inventory this year.","Now I will turn it over to Billy Helms to discuss this play and our operations.","Billy Helms","Thanks Bill. In the first half of 2014, we were in the exploratory phase on our Delaware basin Leonard acreage. As we mentioned on our May call we were testing various spacing pilots and zones across our acreage. We also tested the potential of the Second Bone Spring Sand. The second Bone Spring Sand sits beneath our Leonard acreage position primarily in Eddy and Lea counties, New Mexico. We drilled our first horizontal wells here 10 years ago and shifted capital to the Leonard and Wolfcamp shale plays and now we\u2019ve gone back to our proprietary completion techniques. ","In Southern Lea County we drilled and completed two very successful wells in the Second Bone Springs Sand. The first was a short link lateral and the second was drilled with 4500 foot lateral. The Mars 3 State #1H and the Jolly Roger 16 Sate #1H had initial production rates of 1270 and 1450 barrels of oil per day with 150 and 210 barrels per day of NGLs and 1.1 million and 1.5 million cubic feet per day of natural gas respectively. The production stream is 70%, 45 API gravity oil. We have 73,000 net Leonard acres and estimate the second Bone Spring Sand is highly perspective over the majority of this acreage. We still need additional drilling to test all portions of our acreage, but these initial results combined with the industry data from over 500 wells rate our expectation for the play\u2019s high rate return growth potential. The estimate completed well cost of $6 million with gross reserves of 500 in BOE per well yielding 100% direct after-tax rate of return. ","We are very pleased with the addition of the second Bone Spring Sand to our drilling portfolio. It\u2019s a high rate of return black oil play on existing acreage. We plan to drill a few more wells this year and increase activity in the play in 2015. Over time we will determine proper spacing and the ultimate resource potential to EOG. ","In the Leonard shale, we are still testing down spacing in the same zones and across zones. Over the last 12 months we tested numerous patterns from 660 foot spacing down to the 300 foot space Gemini wells highlighted in the press release. We are very pleased with the preliminary production results.","We've also had initial results from two recent B-zone wells and from tightly spaced wells drilled in a pattern across the A and B zones. It is a little too early to reach firm conclusions on optimum spacing or the ultimate number of possible well locations from each zone. But we are encouraged by our results today.","In the Delaware Basin Wolfcamp, we\u2019re focused on making improvements in well productivity through the application of completion technology. In Reeves County, the State Apache 57, #11 07H was completed with an initial production rate of 1600 barrels of oil per day with 460 barrels per day of NGLs and 3 million ft.\u00b3 per day of natural gas. This is the best Wolfcamp well we drilled to date. We are testing various spacing patterns and the prospectivity of different pay intervals in the play. We are on track to complete 14 net wells this year and have been encouraged with our progress and results to date. ","In the Bakken, we've shifted to more multi-well pad drilling this year with most of our activity focused in the core area. We\u2019re encouraged by the very early production flow back results from our first 700 foot spaced wells. As Bill mentioned earlier these are wells -- these are wells drilled from pads and completed with larger fracs. The wells are taking longer to flow back and therefore it is too early to report any individual well results. We've noticed a marked improvement in production rates that reflect changes we\u2019ve made to completion techniques over the last two years. After achieving peak rates, the well production is flattening out nicely, delivering excellent rate of return.","During the second half, we plan to drill both Bakken and Three Forks wells on our Antelope Extension acreage. We also plan to test various benches of the Three Forks formation on both our core and Antelope extension acreage. Later this year we expect to get our first data point after we test the third bench of the Three Forks on our Antelope extension acreage.","In the Wyoming DJ basin we plan to drill 39 net wells this year in the Codell and Niobrara. One notable new well completed in the second quarter in the Codell was the Jubilee 586 \u2013 1705H. It came online in 1145 barrels of oil per day with 445 MCF per day of rich natural gas. We have a 75% working interest in the well. Since May we've added 13,000 net acres in the Codell, increasing our position to 85,000 net acres. In the Powder River Basin, we plan to drill 34 net wells this year in the Parkman and Turner reservoirs. Two recently completed Parkman wells are the Mary\u2019s Draw 404-21H and 468 \u2013 34H which had initial production rates of 1045 and 980 barrels of oil per day respectively. We have 99% and 100% working interest in the wells respectively and we are drilling on multi-well pads in both the Powder River and DJ.","I'll now turn it over to Bill to discuss the Eagle Ford and our international operations.","Bill Thomas ","Thanks Billy. In the Eagle Ford, we\u2019re in the sixth inning of understanding and progress in the play and we\u2019ve not yet reached the peak from a learning curve standpoint. We\u2019re constantly experimenting with the completion designs and are seeing improved production responses from these tweaks. We still have ongoing spacing pilots in certain areas. We highlighted multiple high initial production rate wells in our press release. ","During the second quarter of the 29 wells we drilled in Gonzales County, 21 had IP rates exceeding 2500 barrels of oil per day. This distinct statement shows our Eagle Ford quality is holding up quite nicely. During the second quarter we drilled a number of lease retention wells. Our drilling plans for the second half include fewer of these one-off wells that we expect to realize efficiency gains from pad drilling and other improvements in costs and logistics. We are drilling longer laterals with a 50% increase in the number of stages from where we were three years ago. We\u2019re also seeing productivity improvements during early flow back, but we need more time to evaluate the results.","We\u2019re on track to drill 520 net Eagle Ford Wells this year. By midyear we had brought 260 wells to sales. On our last earnings call we talked about the depth and longevity of oil growth from our Eagle Ford asset. Nothing has changed in our view.","In Trinidad we have a three well, net well development drilling program planned for 2014, which will allow us to maintain flat natural gas production in coming years. In the East Irish Sea, the Conway project is now expected to be online early 2015 due to certain scheduling matters with the platform operator.","I\u2019ll now turn it over to Tim Driggers to discuss financial and capital structure.","Tim Diggers","Thanks Bill. Before getting into the specifics on CapEx and guidance I want to point out a new IR slide on page 14 using actuals and sell-side estimates we compared EOG\u2019s 2013 and 2014 estimated ROE and ROCE to the average of the majors integrated independent E&Ps for the same period. What stands out from the chart is EOG\u2019s financial returns relative to the other sectors. ","In the energy space, there are sectors known for growth and those known for returns. But rarely does the company or sector combine high production growth with outstanding financial returns. We believe EOG is currently exhibiting among the best financial returns in the entire industry combined with excellent production growth. For the second quarter capitalized interest was $14 million. Total cash exploration and development expenditures were $2 billion excluding asset retirement obligations. ","In addition expenditures for gathering systems, processing plants and other property plant and equipment were $237 million. EOG made $74 million of acquisitions during the quarter. At the end of June total debt outstanding was $5.9 billion. At June 30 we had $1.2 billion of cash on hand. The effective tax rate for the second quarter was 36% and the deferred tax ratio was 62%.","Yesterday we included guidance table with the earnings press release for the third quarter and full-year 2014. For the third quarter and full year the effective tax rate is estimated to be 35% to 40%. We've also provided an estimated range of the dollar amount of current taxes that we have, that we expect to record during the third quarter and for the full year.","In terms of our hedge positions, for the period August 1 through December 31, 2014 EOG has crude oil financial price swap contracts in place for 194,000 barrels of oil per day at a weighted average price of $96.19 per barrel. For the first half of 2015 we have 69,000 barrels per day of crude oil options that could be put to us at an average price of $95.20 per barrel. For the period September 1 through December 31, 2014 EOG has natural gas financial price swap contracts in place for 330,000 MMbtu per day at a weighted average price of $4.55 per MMbtu. For the period January 1 through December 31, 2015 EOG has natural gas financial price swap contracts in place for 175,000 MMbtu per day at a weighted average price of $4.51 per MMbtu. These numbers exclude options that are exercisable by our counterparties. For the period January 1through December 31, 2015 we have 175,000 MMbtu per day of options that could be put to us at an average price of $4.51 per Mmbtu for each month.","Now I\u2019ll turn it back to Bill to provide the EOG\u2019s views regarding the macro environment and a summary.","Bill Thomas","","Thanks Tim. We remain bullish on crude oil prices. We are advocates of free markets and are proponents of condensate and crude oil exports. While the opening up of condensate exports will create more headroom for refiners to process light oil even without exports we still see several years of headroom in the US refining complex. ","Regarding North American natural gas, we don't have any plans to reinvest in dry gas drilling opportunities at current prices, as we expect that the strength we saw in gas prices earlier this year was only a temporary and driven by the coldest winter weather in 14 years.","Recent high storage injection numbers again have verified the enormous supply deliverability on untapped Shale gas in the US. This provides solid support for rapid approval of additional LNG export terminals. Our 2014 plan remains consistent with what we outlined at the beginning of the year. We continue to reinvest in high rate of return crude oil weighted drilling opportunities. We increased our crude oil growth forecast in May 29%. And this quarter we are increasing EOG\u2019s total company production growth estimate to 14% from 12%, based on growth from associated NGL and natural gas production from our crude oil plays. ","Our CapEx estimate remains unchanged. We have now increased the common stock dividend twice this year. Now let me conclude there are five important takeaways from this call. First, EOG is focused on returns. EOG\u2019s high return production growth is showing up as strong growth in cash flow, net income and through increasing ROE and ROCE metrics. The Bakken, Eagle Ford and Leonard have the potential to sustain above average long-term growth with very high returns. EOG is well-positioned to be a long-term leader in returns on capital in the energy sector. ","Second, EOG is a growth leader and it's organic. EOG\u2019s estimated 2014 oil growth on a barrel per day basis is greater than any other company in the peer group and this growth is all organic. We have the assets and the inventory depth to sustain this growth. Please take a look at the new IR slide on page 7, growing oil as we did 33% in the Lower 48 this quarter is a remarkable achievement.","Third exploration and technology focus, we\u2019ve again increased our high return drilling inventory on existing acreage with the addition of the Second Bone Spring Sand. We also reported good preliminary down spacing results from the Leonard A and B zones. The Second Bone Spring Sand and the Leonard Down spacing results are two examples of how EOG generates new plays through exploration and the use of in-house technology.","Fourth, we're committed to generating long-term value for our stockholders. We increased the dividend on the common stock for the second time this year. This combined with net debt reduction has been our plan for discretionary cash flow.","Finally our return on growth profile is unique. As Tim pointed out, based on 2014 estimates we are at the head of the class in terms of combined production growth and financial returns among all upstream sectors including the majors, integrators and independents. That's a powerful statement and our IR slide on page 14 is quite impressive regarding financial returns and we plan to maintain this lead by continuing to reinvest in high rate of return oil plays. Thanks for listening and now we\u2019ll go to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","","Thank you, the question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. (Operator instructions)","We\u2019ll take our first question from Amir Arif with Stifel.","Amir Arif - Stifel Nicolaus","","Good morning guys, a quick question on the Bone Springs. The 73,000 acres that you talked about for the Second Bone Springs, is that just on the New Mexico side? Or does that also include acreage on the Texas side? ","Billy Helms ","Yeah Amir, our 73,000 acre position both in Leonard and the Bones Springs does cross the state lines. So it is both located in the Mexico and Texas. What\u2019s interesting to note about the second Bone Springs Wells is they are about 5 miles apart, they do help confirm the potential on a lot of our acreage and certainly with the well-control we have in the play. We feel good about the extent of what we've seen so far. We are early in the testing of those zones but it is they do represent two of the most South-East wells in the play as far as wells completed in the Second Bone Springs Sand. So we certainly feel good about what we see so far. But we\u2019ll have to evaluate long-term production to assess the potential to the company.","Amir Arif - Stifel Nicolaus","Okay, and as a follow-up, I know it\u2019s still early days in the play like you just mentioned. But could you just give us how you are thinking about the development right now in terms of the Leonard AP and the Bone Spring in terms of , is one going to be your primary target or infrastructure build out the support one versus the other or each one is given a return, each one could be a primary target.","Billy Helms ","Well I think that\u2019s a good way to think about it. I think each one can be a primary target on zone. Infrastructure is certainly in place for our current activity and takeaway capacity and certainly we try to stay ahead of that as we develop the plays. We will be testing as we mentioned in the in the call or in the press release we have tested number patterns for the Leonard, especially the A zone and are Gemini wells that are spaced to 300feet apart in the Leonard A- zone in and certainly we're excited about potential we see there. But we\u2019ll have to determine what the ultimate spacing will be in each zone as we progress. These two wells in the Palm Springs of mentioned earlier they are about 5 miles apart. So there have not been any spacing tests conducted on the Bone Springs yet. And so we\u2019ll have to go through that exercise and it will take care several months to work through that and why additional wells planned in the in the rest of the year to try to assess how we move forward that program.","Operator","","We\u2019ll take our next question from Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I wonder if I could try two quick ones. First of all, Bill, in your prepared remarks you did mention the Eagle Ford. I wondered if you could help dig a little bit deeper into the impact of the need to change to drill retention wells, is the way you put it on the call. And if we might expect to see the growth rate accelerate again in the second half as you get back to your more normal order of business. That's my first question. ","Billy Helms ","Yeah, good morning Doug. Yeah, the retention wells we talked about, we were mainly in the western part of our acreage where we go out and we drill wells on the initial unit just to the hold the acreage and we\u2019ve completed most of that drilling for this year the first half of the year. So in the second half of the year we will be doing as we talked about in early remarks, will be doing considerably more pad drilling. So that means we come back in and follows retention wells and other areas and we drill multi-well pads and we drill these wells in large groups and we complete these wells in large groups and so they, when we do this , we do get more efficiencies and cost. But the production is a bit more lumpy as we go forward, as we do the more of the pad drilling. So the main benefit is the efficiencies and cost to do the drilling, being able to drill wells on multiple well pads. ","","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Bill, just to be clear, I'm guessing your average -- we don't obviously have the full disclosure on this, but the average well rates then out of the average well and not in the second quarter would presumably have been lower. But you're basically saying that really was more of an anomaly than something that's changing in the program? Is that a good way to think about it? ","Bill Thomas","Yeah, the average rate on the wells have been improving over time. We\u2019re still making in completion improvements. Steady will slide in our IR presentation particularly on the western wells and so the new better completion techniques we\u2019re doing on wells, continue to make better wells. But really we don't see a significant change from the first half of the second.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","My follow-up is really more of a philosophical question. Obviously you've done a terrific job on the returns per your slide presentation compared to the different peer groups. By putting yourself in that -- it's fun to look at those big oil metrics if you like. I wonder how you think about the dividend. Obviously a big dividend bump this quarter again, but it's still a very modest yield. How do you think longer term about what the right level of dividend is for a company of your size with a growth trajectory and calls on capital that you have? Because, again, when you start to compare yourself to that wider peer group, some of those guys have 3%, 4%, 5% dividend yields and obviously you're substantially below that. Longer-term, how should we think about your allocation of capital to the dividend on a go forward basis?","Bill Thomas","That\u2019s a good question, Doug, we don't have a policy, so as we go forward the board will just continue to look at our cash flow and where we are at the company, on what we need to do to continue to grow the company. And we will give dividends appropriately based on the situation of the company. So certainly we\u2019ve had a good track record 16, increases in 15 years and we\u2019re certainly committed to long-term shareholder value creation. ","Operator","We will go next to Leo Mariani with RBC Capital. ","Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets ","Just wanted to dive into some of the new plays. Obviously you talked about the Second Bone Springs here today. Last quarter you introduced a number of new Rockies plays as well. Can you give us a sense of how you plan to allocate capital to these new plays this year and next? Is there any plays there that are a priority? Are there any limitations on infrastructure or any need to hold acreage that governs any of that? Maybe talk to how we should see activity levels in those new plays over the next year or two.","Bill Thomas","As far as the new play, they are all in a bit different situation, certainly plays that we talked about in the first quarter call in the Power River basin and DJ basin, we\u2019re moving ahead with the development on those most of it\u2019s on multi-well pad drilling and we\u2019re defining spacing patterns and optimizing our completions and costs and those will get capital allocation as we see the results of the wells and again the plays with the best rate of return will get the most capital as we go forward. On the Bone Springs we are new into that, as Billy talked about, we drilled two really strong wells and we will be evaluating that play as we go forward. But as we look in to the future everything EOG does is focused on return on capital invested, so each play will get rewarded based on that.","Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets ","Switching gears a little bit, you guys did take your gas and NGL production guidance up here in 2014. You talked about associated gas in liquids from your oil plays. Could you give us a little bit more color on specifically where that's coming from in terms of the incremental associated gas here? ","Bill Thomas","Yes, Leo we had a couple things in the first half of the year and the second quarter. We have added infrastructure particularly in midland that\u2019s helped our gas takeaway situation there and deliverability. We did in our Barnett combo play, we had a number of wells on restricted flow rates due to pressure control and we did open up some of those in the second quarter a little bit. But just in general as we stated in the opening remarks we increased our oil in the first quarter and this is kind of a follow up as we have associated gas with all of our crude oil plays, our base decline in our natural gas is slowing due to not much natural \u2013 but no natural gas drilling and no property sales and so our associated gas with a crude oil plays is beginning to overcome that decline.","Operator","We will go next to Pearce Hammond with Simmons. ","Pearce Hammond - Simmons & Company ","Bill, I noticed a change in the completed well costs in the Eagle Ford. Looked like it moved up to $5.7 million from $5.5 million. Is that just more longer lateral, more sand? And does that $5.7 million yield bigger wells? ","Gary Thomas","Yes, you are exactly right, we\u2019re drilling the longer laterals, they are about 10% larger -- longer and with that of course roughly $1000 traded lateral, that\u2019s adding quite a bit of additional cost but we\u2019ve been able to reduce that with just continued efficiencies and our number of days per well has dropped quite lot here this last quarter, as a matter of fact, we set a new record this quarter once again with a 4.3 day well to 15,600 feet, so we are seeing improved wells, I think that was placed 20 in our chart shows that the wells are about 15% better this year than last.","Pearce Hammond - Simmons & Company ","Then my follow-up is, Bill, can you provide some color on your \u201815 oil hedging strategy?","Bill Thomas","Historically and I think business wise we would like to have a good hedge position going forward in oil and gas, the difficulty has been that backwardation in the forward curve on both gas and oil we don't see as reflective of what\u2019s going to happen in the future, so it's difficult to get a good hedge. But we\u2019re certainly looking for opportunities as we go forward in the second half of the year to add some hedges in oil and gas if they are available. ","Operator","We will go next to Subash Chandra with Jefferies ","Subash Chandra - Jefferies & Company ","A Permian question for my first one. So casual reading of these well results indicate that there's not a vast difference in the IPs that were quoted. Yet Wolfcamp, much higher EURs expected, and a much higher resource potential expected out of the Wolfcamp itself. Could you just add perhaps a bit more color to what you saw after these IPs that indicate that the Wolfcamp is 60% higher in terms of EURs per well than say, a Leonard, and a comp to the Second Bone Springs? ","Billy Helms","This is Billy Helms, I will answer this Permian question. For the Leonard and in both the Wolfcamp each one independent zones, the Leonard is more of a oil play, it has a different production profile certainly than that the Wolfcamp which is more of a combo-ish kind of play. So the production profiles although they may start at somewhat similar IPs on oil, production profile is certainly different because they are different types of reservoirs, so the decline rates will be different, the product mix is certainly different. And so it's going to yield different EURs over the life of the well. We\u2019re also -- that will also play into how we develop the field and the ultimate spacing of the wells as well. So the Leonard as you saw we\u2019re testing down to some wells that are at 300 foot spacing and Wolfcamp we\u2019re generally testing closer to 750 foot spacing as we go through the play, so those are just some differences between the two different reservoirs, they are quite different certainly and have different zones of targets but that's the basic difference between the two.","Subash Chandra - Jefferies & Company ","And Billy, what do you see happening with the rig count in the various Permian plays over the next year? ","Billy Helms","Well certainly I expect this with success we would expect activity to increase in the Permian over time. The luxury we have right now is we have just a large number of really high quality plays in the company where we can allocate capital, so what it does is it gives us the time to go through and make sure we understand the proper completion techniques and the proper spacing before we really start increasing activity in each play. That helps make us a little bit smarter on overall development and still provide long-term growth for the company. So we\u2019re pretty excited about the potential we see there in the Permian and we\u2019re taking our time to really make sure that we understand how to complete and what the proper spacing of each one of those zones will be before we really ramp up activity too quickly. ","Subash Chandra - Jefferies & Company ","And my follow-up. I don't know if EOG participated in the Turner Mason study or not. I guess the net conclusion is that they're arguing for a riskier packaging number, but essentially no change in the type of railcar to carry Bakken crude. As you're obviously on the upstream and the midstream side of the transportation side of it, what are your takeaways?","Bill Thomas","We are certainly conservative on everything we do or we\u2019re concerned about safety and we\u2019re certainly all in favor of many of the things that have been proposed and I guess the new guidelines didn\u2019t really catch us by surprise, we are prepared for those as we go forward and we\u2019re solidly behind - the activity to increase the safety of rails as we go forward. ","Subash Chandra - Jefferies & Company ","Or more specifically, do you think there needs to be a change in the 111 railcars to carry Bakken crude? ","Bill Thomas","We are very well-positioned there with the contracts that we have and we\u2019re still reviewing these rules but as our cars that go off the least we will be going with the cars of the future, so we really like the way we\u2019re positioned to be able to have the most safe and regulatory compliant rail fleet. ","Operator","We will go next to Irene Haas with Wunderlich Securities.","Irene Haas - Wunderlich Securities","My question is on the land that's also called Avalon. You mentioned earlier that is a different beast from the Wolfcamp Shale. So can you shed a little light on whether it's a true shale or is it something else? And then does it have really high IPA and how does it drop off? Because I think it can get pretty steep. And also in your past PowerPoint in July, I think you mentioned about three zones in the Leonard. These are my questions. ","Bill Thomas","The Leonard is a shale, and it\u2019s really the third best reservoir in terms of shale we really have in the company. It\u2019s a very high porosity shale with really we've identified at this point two zones, the A and B zone and the content of the reserve is about 50% oil and they start off at very high rates and have excellent rates of return in the shale. So we\u2019re fortunate our acreage position we believe has captured much of its weak spot of the play and we\u2019ve had, as Billy talked about we've had very good success on increasing the per well productivity with our new completion techniques and also been able to test wells at very tight spacing with at least initial good results. So we think we can continue to improve the play and add value as we go forward in our development process. ","Irene Haas - Wunderlich Securities","How is the declines?","Billy Helms","I would say the decline in the Leonard play \u2013 I would say it's not too different than many of our other shale plays in that they are hyperbolic in nature, they fall off fairly fast and I don't know \u2013 couldn\u2019t quote a number right now as far as the initial decline on the well but they are very similar to most of our other shale plays, very hyperbolic in nature but they produced a level out produced for a long time at very good rates. So they do provide excellent economics as we would \u2013 as we reported earlier, the current rate of return for that play is over hundred percent as well. So we\u2019re very excited about the potential of development of the play and economics of that play. ","Operator","We will go next to Joe Allman with JPMorgan.","Joe Allman - JPMorgan ","One quick question on down-spacing, it seems like there's an awful lot of down spacing going on at EOG. So could you run us through the various plays, so for example, on the Leonard shale, I know you did 300 foot inter lateral spacing and you\u2019re doing some additional pilots, are you testing down to 150s and then in the Eagle Ford, you\u2019re doing some additional pilots, are you going down to 20s, there, could you talk about down spacing in the Bakken and in Wyoming, and what the implications are for the increase in locations?","Bill Thomas","Yeah, Bill, let me just go through -- that's a good question -- each one of those plays a bit. So in the Eagle Ford we\u2019re currently developing that play on about 40 acre spacing and there are some areas where \u2013 and That\u2019s about 300 feet between wells on average. There are some wells where the well spacing is greater than 300 feet and we are doing a bit of infill field work, in some of those areas we don't have any news to report on that other than the early results look good. And we need some long-term results on that before we can determine if that\u2019s the best way to do those areas. ","In the Bakken, we\u2019re on our third set of down spacing in the Bakken and we have had very good success with 1300feet between wells which is approximately 4 wells per section. Now we are testing approximately 700 feet between wells, that would be eight wells per section. And as Billy reported on that we have a few wells that are flowing back and those initial results look good. But we do need quite a bit more time to watch the long-term production of those wells and then also watch additional wells as we bring them on line on those spacing patterns. And in the Leonard, we've gone from 660 foot spacing and we tested various spacing patterns down to 300 feet between the wells. We do not have any plans to go less than 300 feet in the same zone between wells, so where we are on that process is we\u2019re just evaluating all those different spacing patterns to determine what's the proper spacing to fully develop the field. ","Joe Allman - JPMorgan ","If you could comment on Wyoming as well, that would be great. And then a follow-up question. Then comment on the implication for locations, if you can give us any specifics on that. But follow-up question would be, you're talking about increasing E&P activity in 2015 versus 2014. So is your plan to be free cash flow positive in 2015 and increase the balance sheet as you suggest in some of your comments, or do you plan on matching fairly closely cash flow to CapEx and talk about what the optimal debt level is in that context?.","Bill Thomas","Yeah, Joe, that certainly we\u2019re beginning to think about 2015 but we just don't have any specific guidance on that other than we\u2019re going to reinvest the majority of our growing cash flow. We\u2019re going to continue to reinvest that back into the highest rate return plays that we have and we will be looking at certainly the drilling program this year, and the results and all these different spacing patterns and the well productivity and the return on all these and we will just allocate that to continue to grow the company very strongly. But to really to focus on returns and our net debt to cap ratio continues to fall in the company and we want to continue to strengthen the balance sheet as we go forward and allocate our capital based on those metrics. ","Joe Allman - JPMorgan ","Any comments on the spacing pilot you're doing in Wyoming? ","Bill Thomas","Joe, in Wyoming, in the DJ basin, we\u2019re drilling alternating Niobrara and Codell targets and those spacing patterns on various different spacing between wells but there are approximately 800 feet apart and so we will be looking at those, initial patterns and see how those respond. And then in the Parkman zone, we\u2019re currently developing a 1300 feet between wells and drilling longer laterals in that particular play and in the Turner we\u2019re developing on 1355 feet between zones. And again each one of these we\u2019d like to get multiple patterns established and we\u2019d like to get long-term results to see how much sharing \u2013 if sharing the risk between wells and then we make appropriate adjustments as we go forward. So it\u2019s kind of the long-term process. And we\u2019re very focused on maximizing the net present value of each of these properties and to maximize the reserve recovery and the value of the property, so that's kind of the status on those plays. ","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Bob Brackett with Bernstein. ","Bob Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein ","Good morning. Quick question on new ventures. Can you talk a little about the lower tests in the Three Forks? And maybe anything on East Texas you're willing to share? ","Bill Thomas","Good morning, Bob. Thanks for the question. In the Three Forks we do have some wells planned particularly in our Antelope acreage. We do have a third match plan, the test later in the year and some, I believe, probably first and second batch also test to continue to evaluate that. ","Yeah, I would say Bob, on East Texas, you know everybody knows we are drilling a few wells over there and evaluating the play, as well as plays in other parts of the country too. So it's just a part of our continuing exploration effort in the company to define new play potential. As you know we have a very very high cut-off for new play. So we\u2019re not interested in pursuing plays that have a 20% or 30% rate of return potential, we\u2019ve really set the bar high and we\u2019re looking for plays and only would be able to generate say north of 50% rates return going forward and we\u2019re still \u2013 we\u2019re very focused on crude oil plays. So the East Texas is just a part of that mix, and we will continue testing that and when we get some information that\u2019s meaning, and something that we will go forward on, we can talk about that later but right now that's all the information we have.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs ","I wanted to follow-up on a couple of earlier topics, starting with the Leonard. The potential for a 300-foot spacing in the Leonard would seem to imply tighter spacing, at least at your base case lateral length relative to some of the other plays out there. Can you just talk about unique characteristics you see in the Leonard relative to other plays in other parts of the Delaware basin? And how you're thinking about both recovery rates and the trade-off of longer laterals versus tighter spacing? ","Billy Helms","Yeah, Brian, this is Bill Helms. On the spacing for the Leonard, this is the same approach we\u2019ve really taken in every play that we undertake. It\u2019s to try to understand what\u2019s the right spacing given the current state of our completion technology in each lateral to maximize the net present value of every acre that we have under lease. And so for the Leonard, we started out with 660 foot spacing and we continue to test tighter spacing in each one of our subsequent patterns to understand what is the right formula to maximize our net present value and certainly the Gemini wells that we highlighted in the press release are encouraging for 300 foot space well. I would say that we need a little bit more production time to really understand what the optimal spacing pattern is going to be for that Leonard A zone as we go forward. And then similarly we will do the same thing for the Leonard B zone as well as the Wolfcamp zones in the Delaware as we start through the development in each one of those.","So it\u2019s a similar process we go through in each play. For the Leonard it's just -- it's really \u2013 as Bill mentioned earlier it\u2019s a high quality shale across the good mechanical properties, that allows us to really focus the fracs near wellbore and maximize recovery of each well and that's different than some of the other plays. Of course each play has its own characteristics and mechanical properties that dictate what the proper spacing will be and that's why these very methodical spacing tests are needed to try to determine what the optimal will be on each pattern. ","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs ","And then in the Eagle Ford, you have a slide -- slide 20, where you're showing further improvement in well performance this year relative to last year. You talked about the greater, the more complex fracs and slightly higher well costs. Is that what's reflected here or is there further upside to EURs? Are you just getting oil out of the ground earlier via completion efficiencies? And are there any changes to your thoughts on recovery rates in oil in place in the Eagle Ford? ","Bill Thomas","It\u2019s a little early to determine what recovery factors is now with these enhanced completions. But, yes, we\u2019re really excited about what\u2019s transpired here just this year in the Eagle Ford, because more of our wells are being drilled in the West side which previously thought -- we thought was maybe less productive. But with more wells there, then we\u2019re drilled longer laterals, enhanced completions, then overall \u2013 the average of the wells drilled in 2014 is quite lot better than the wells \u2013 the average of the wells drilled in 2013. It\u2019s just improved completions.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs ","And are you seeing any change in the decline rates being greater? Or should one expect that these greater rates should carry into, and well performance through 60 days, should carry into EUR? ","Bill Thomas","We would expect \u2013 that we would see with the same kind of IPs, and the wells even holding up better 60, 90 days that we would see improvement there as well, as far as long-term production. We do have longer laterals and we just need additional time on these.","Billy Helms","Yeah, I think the important thing on that Brian is that it is really critical that we get long-term data on each one of these plays and that goes for the Eagle Ford in particular is that we just want to see more than 90 days production to determine what the ultimate EUR will be, and especially as we continue to work the spacing issues, it\u2019s very critical to take our time and to get enough data before we can say whether there is an EUR the increase or not.","Operator","We will take our next question from Arun Jayaram with Credit Suisse.","Arun Jayaram - Credit Suisse ","I did want to talk to you a little bit, maybe a follow-up to Joe's question. But as you sit here today, Bill, you have a bigger opportunity set than you had perhaps 6 or 12 months ago, given the Rockies oil opportunity. The Delaware Basin opportunity looks bigger. So I just wanted to get your thoughts on potentially, as you look forward to perhaps increasing CapEx beyond cash flows. You're pretty bullish on oil. Your debt to cap is down to 21%. And you did have a big dividend increase. So just some thoughts, given the increasing opportunity set at EOG, to take that CapEx to accelerate your returns profile even more.","Bill Thomas","Arun, I think what you can expect from EOG going forward is discipline -- capital discipline is at the top of our list and so we are really focused on operating the company relatively within our cash flow going forward. We\u2019re very focused on keeping the balance sheet solid as we go forward, at net debt to cap at a low level and really discipline -- each of these plays, as you focus on rates of return, capital rates of return and maximize the value of the plays, it\u2019s important not to grow or accelerate them too fast. And so we\u2019re really focused on doing that correctly and continuing to focus on crude oil, not interested in gas drilling and that we\u2019re really focused on growing the cash flow of the company forward, of investments in our crude oil really. ","Arun Jayaram - Credit Suisse ","And that would, again, suggest maybe staying within cash flows? ","Bill Thomas","I think we want to operate the company with discipline in spending and certainly not outrun the cash flow of the company. ","Arun Jayaram - Credit Suisse ","And just a quick follow-up, switching gears to the Delaware basin. Bill, you talked about 550 million barrel resource opportunity in the Leonard, two zones there. Just wondering what the spacing assumptions were that underpin that. And perhaps, given the successful downspacing tests, you're perhaps looking at maybe even 16 wells for each of the zones. I was wondering if you can comment on what that 550 was underpinned by from a spacing perspective? ","Bill Thomas","So I will ask Bill Helms to give some color on that.","Billy Helms","The Leonard, we originally arrived at our EURs the ultimate recovery from that field, from that play, using a 660 foot spacing for all the Leonard wells and certainly we have potential for some multiple pay zones in some areas, although we will need to consider all the targets perspective over all the pay zone, over all the acreage but in general it's a 660 foot between wells which is roughly an 80 acre spacing per well, and as mentioned we're \u2013 our Gemini wells, we did test down to 300 and while it\u2019s still early we still need some production time to understand what the ultimate spacing will be for that play.","Arun Jayaram - Credit Suisse ","And that would be for the A and B zones?","Billy Helms","Yes, that\u2019s what we used in our initial estimates, yes. I would mention too that we wouldn't have considered all the zones perspective over all the acreage, so I caution you there .","Arun Jayaram - Credit Suisse ","And I know it's early days, but how is the Bones Spring -- little bit more oil content. Are the returns compared to the Leonard, at least on your initial wells, similar? ","Billy Helms","Yeah, I would say they are very similar as far as returns, we\u2019re -- honestly we just had the first two wells down this acreage position and we\u2019re very excited about it. But as you mentioned it is early and we will certainly need to watch production for a while and as Bill mentioned we like to have a little more than 90 days of production, I\u2019d say more than 90 days production to evaluate the ultimate recovery from all these wells. ","Operator","At this time I would like to turn it back to Mr. Thomas for additional or closing remarks. ","Bill Thomas","Well thank you for listening and thank you for all the good questions, and just know that EOG as we go forward is a company that's unique, we\u2019re focused on returns, continuing to improve our ROE and ROIC numbers and strong crude oil growth.

Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.","Thanks, Tim.","As we look back, 2016 will be remembered as truly historic for EOG because it's the year we permanently shifted to premium drilling and reset the company to be successful in a lower commodity price environment. To remind everyone, our premium well is one that earns a minimum of 30% after-tax rate of return with flat $40 oil and $2.50 gas prices on a direct basis. We set the minimum at 30% to ensure that fully loaded well returns are accretive to corporate returns.","I want to emphasize that this shift to premium is permanent, which means that the return hurdle and the inventory of premium wells did not change with improving oil prices. Going forward, EOG's capital will be focused on wells that are profitable at $40, meaning with modest increases to oil price, our returns have the potential to soar. You can see this on slide 24 of our investor presentation.","Our list of accomplishments in 2016 include a few company records and first-time achievements. In 2016, we achieved one of the highest returns on capital expenditures in company history, and we did it at the low point of the commodity price cycle. Our shift to premium drilling and improvements in operating costs resulted in record low finding cost of $5.22 per BOE when you exclude revisions due to commodity price.","Over the course of the year, we increased our premium drilling inventory nearly 9% to 6,000 locations and over 5 billion barrels of oil equivalent. The company added 3.7 billion barrels of oil equivalent of new drilling potential in the Delaware Basin.","Since the downturn began in late 2014, we slashed unit operating costs by 22%. As a result of drilling low-cost premium wells, the company grew oil production within cash flow during the second half of 2016. We announced the world's first technically successful enhanced oil recovery in shale that delivers strong project economics. EOG completed the largest transaction in the company's history with the Yates Petroleum acquisition. Finally, we accomplished all this while maintaining a healthy balance sheet and posting the best safety record in the company's history.","To sum up 2016, record setting capital efficiency gains and a significantly larger and improved drilling inventory have reset the company to achieve outstanding results in the years to come. This is why we are confident that we'll be one of the lowest cost producers and competitive in the global oil market.","Now looking ahead to 2017, we're more excited than ever to resume our leadership in high-return oil growth. Transforming EOG into a premium-only driller means we expect to deliver 18% oil growth within cash flow during 2017. Remarkably, EOG can deliver strong 18% oil growth plus the dividend within cash flow if prices were to average $50 oil and $3 gas. We believe this is unique in the industry and sets EOG apart as the most capital efficient operator in the U.S.","Furthermore, each of EOG's major basins will be contributing to that growth in 2017, the Eagle Ford, the Delaware Basin, the Bakken, the Powder River Basin, and the DJ Basin. That's a testament to our diverse portfolio of high-return assets.","Our plan was finalized last month when strip prices were closer to $55 oil and $3.50 natural gas. If current prices hold, we will reach our goal of generating free cash flow. Our number one priority for that cash is to reinvest into high-return premium drilling. We also want to continue firming up the balance sheet with non-core asset sales. And if the business environment continues to improve, we will want to refocus on our commitment to the dividend.","Looking beyond 2017, I want to talk about EOG's return prospects, specifically return on capital employed [ROCE]. If a company is earning the well-level returns we and many of our peers assert, we should eventually see those results reflected in ROCE. For EOG specifically, we expect returns and finding costs to continue to improve in the years ahead as premium wells become a higher percentage of total well completions. As new premium wells are drilled, their DD&A rate will converge towards premium finding costs. The lower DD&A rate along with lower cash operating costs such as LOE [Lease Operating Expense] and transportation should significantly improve EOG's ROCE over time.","With our shift to premium drilling, our goal is to generate ROCE that exceeds our historical average of 13%. We believe this performance will make us competitive not only among our peers, but with other industries outside the energy sector. ROCE has been a very important performance metric at EOG and remains a top priority in our long-term vision. EOG is rate-of-return driven. Returns are the number one criteria for incentive compensation, and it drives capital allocation within the company. We believe EOG's best days for ROCE still lie ahead of us.","Up next to provide details on our operational performance in 2016 and review the 2017 game plan is Gary Thomas.","Gary L. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.","Thanks, Bill.","The 2016 accomplishments I'm most proud of are the capital efficiency gains from cost control and operational efficiencies. At the start of 2016, our plan was to drill 200 and complete 270 net wells within cash flow for $2.5 billion. By year end, due to our astonishing progress on cost control and efficiency gains, we drilled 280 and completed 445 net wells for $2.7 billion, all within cash flow. That's a 40% and 65% increase in drilling and completing activity with only an 8% increase in capital compared to our initial guidance. Almost 60% of these completed wells were drilled but uncompleted wells, so we are beginning 2017 with our normal inventory of 137 DUCs. Furthermore, our fourth quarter average oil rate of 312,000 barrels of oil per day set an all-time high from our previous record set in the fourth quarter of 2014.","Here are a few highlights from our 2016 operational accomplishments. We expanded electrical power and gas lift infrastructure in South Texas and the Delaware Basin. We also expanded our water handling infrastructure in the Delaware Basin and Rockies to better reuse and more efficiently transport drilling, completion, and production water, which will reduce transportation and disposal costs. We extended our in-house chemical program and other cost-cutting practices to the Yates properties, and we continue to see significant cost reduction opportunities.","For 2017, we have line of sight into sources of savings to further improve on cost control initiatives from 2016 in spite of potential service cost increases. Four significant sources of service cost savings in 2017 are: our average daily rig rates are down 25% compared to last year. Fourteen of our drilling rigs or 60% of the total are under long-term contracts, and nine of these rigs are at bottom-of-market rates. We've locked in three-quarters of our casing needs at prices 30% below our 2016 costs. To further control cost, we've also locked in 50% of our frac fleets. And we have diverse sources of frac sand, and our aggregate sand costs are expected to decrease by 18% year over year.","Furthermore, I'm confident we'll be able to further improve operational efficiencies in 2017. During the downturn, we took the opportunity to upgrade our rig fleet to one of the most modern and highly efficient fleets in the industry. We are drilling 20% longer laterals and increasing the use of multi-well pads. Our expanded water infrastructure systems are expected to reduce our well cost by another $100,000 per well. And because of the combination of operational efficiencies, we expect to complete 15% more wells per frac fleet this year. We expect 2017 can be another great year for improvements for EOG's capital efficiency, maintaining our position as the low-cost, high-return leader in the E&P industry.","I'll turn the call over to Billy Helms, who will update you on our Eagle Ford and Delaware Basin plays.","Lloyd W. Helms, Jr. - EOG Resources, Inc.","Thanks, Gary.","The Eagle Ford has seen consistent year-over-year improvements in both production performance and operational efficiencies that have been the hallmark of EOG's advancements in horizontal technology. We continue to test multiple targets and spacing patterns to determine the optimal development pattern for each area of the field. The wells completed in 2016 as a group are outperforming wells from previous years, largely as a result of the precision targeting and advanced completion designs. During 2016, 210-day cumulative production improved 13% for wells drilled in our western acreage, while wells drilled in the east improved 10%. We also reduced completed well cost by $1 million to $4.7 million, and believe further reductions are possible in 2017.","I'll leave you with one final important note about this play. There's still a tremendous amount of upward potential in the Eagle Ford. To date, we have drilled less than one-third of the total identified locations in this world-class play. The efforts to update the total resource potential are underway and can only be assessed with longer-term performance from each of the various targets and spacing tests. Our technical team continues to integrate the latest results into our future plans to assess the full potential of this asset. Suffice it to say it continues to grow.","Eagle Ford oil production is expected to grow during 2017 while drilling less than half the number of wells we did during the peak of activity in 2014. Using our 2017 rate of approximately 195 net completed wells, we have over 20 years of inventory. The Eagle Ford has been and will continue to be a growth asset for the company.","Last year we announced early success in the first enhanced oil recovery project in horizontal shale. In 2015, we tested four pilots, comprised of 15 wells across a geologically diverse area, and the results were consistently positive and highly economic. In 2016, we initiated a larger 32-well pilot to test how well EOR technology can be implemented on a larger manufacturing type scale. The pilot has been a success and confirms our initial results for field-scale implementation. As with the 2015 pilots, the 32-well project delivered premium economics with a finding cost of less than $6 per barrel.","This 32-well project provided insights into EOR's impact across a wide variety of completion styles and spacing patterns. The results were favorable for wells completed from 2011 through 2016, with well spacing ranging from 200 feet to 500 feet. This gives us further confidence of the applicability of EOR across major areas of the field.","And in addition, our technical understanding of this first in the world EOR process is increasing. The 300,000 barrels of net oil production from EOR in 2016 was within 5% of our forecast, further validating the consistency of the results observed in the four pilots prior to 2016. This data supports our previous estimates that the incremental recovery due to EOR is adding 30% to 70% more oil to our primary recovery estimates.","In 2017, we are eager to expand our EOR project by testing approximately 100 additional wells in six different areas. The result of this program will provide additional data on EOR's uplift to the Eagle Ford's resource potential and EOR's effect on field production decline. This data will help determine how we will incorporate EOR into our long-term Eagle Ford capital program.","2016 was a breakout year for the Delaware Basin, setting up this play to be our fastest growing asset in 2017. First, EOG completed some of the industry's best wells in the Permian Basin through the application of our leading-edge technology, including precision targeting and high-density completions. This technology has proven to deliver step change in well performance. And with an improved wellbore design, we began testing longer laterals in the second half of the year, with promising recovery results on a per foot basis. Our goal is to achieve the same recovery measured by EUR per foot of lateral as we increased lateral length. In 2017, we expect to use longer laterals on a larger percentage of our program, so we're excited to watch the well performance continue to improve.","Second, the Yates transaction was truly transformative. The acreage obtained in the Delaware Basin is not only adjacent to our existing program, but it's also generating highly economic results. Our technical capabilities combined with this transformative transaction resulted in adding a record-setting 3.7 billion barrels of oil equivalent of estimated resource potential last year alone.","In addition, we've already identified almost 3,500 premium oil locations across three targets in the Delaware, the Wolfcamp, the Second Bone Springs, and the Leonard. This is almost a mile of stacked pay in this world-class basin, and our exploration efforts are just getting started.","And third, we are well positioned on infrastructure. Over the last few years we've made strategic investments in oil and gas gathering and takeaway, gas processing, water sourcing and handling, and sand rail car unloading facilities. As an example, the water sourcing and handling infrastructure is helping to reduce both our initial well cost as well as reducing our long-term cash operating cost. Some of the assets obtained in the Yates transaction included water gathering systems that support our existing systems. In our major areas of activity, we will deliver a significant percentage of our produced water into these systems. We're also increasing the volume of recycled water for use in our operations.","These examples along with other cost initiatives have rendered the lease operating expense in the Delaware Basin to be among the lowest in the company. We believe these investments will provide us a competitive advantage now and in the future as we grow in the Delaware Basin.","The Delaware Basin Wolfcamp is arguably the most prolific tight oil play in North America, and EOG consistently delivers the best Wolfcamp results in the industry. Please see slide 9 of our investor presentation for a plot of our 2016 well performance versus the industry. In 2017, the Wolfcamp will again be the primary focus of our drilling program, as we plan to complete 110 net wells.","Here's David Trice to review the progress we've made in the Austin Chalk and our Rockies, Bakken, and international activity.","David W. Trice - EOG Resources, Inc.","Thanks, Billy.","Last year, our Eagle Ford team took a fresh look at the Austin Chalk and discovered that within our current Eagle Ford footprint, there are areas where the Austin Chalk is prospective. Using proprietary petrophysical analysis, we can identify and map the best reservoir properties using our existing well controls. We are then able to target the best rock with horizontal laterals and apply EOG-style high-density completions.","The result is consistent premium Austin Chalk wells. These wells can be very prolific. And in fact, some of the best wells drilled by the company last year were in the Austin Chalk. In 2016. we completed 14 Austin Chalk wells with an average 30-day rate of 1,700 barrels of oil per day and total equivalent rate of 2,200 barrels of oil equivalent per day from an average lateral of 4,400 feet.","We continue to drill delineation and spacing tests, analyze subsurface data, and create detailed mapping throughout the field to understand the prospectivity of the Austin Chalk across our South Texas position. During 2017, we'll drill approximately 25 net wells in the Austin Chalk. Those well results along with the work we did last year should get us closer to providing a resource estimate for this emerging play.","In the Rockies, we had great success in the Powder River Basin and Wyoming DJ Basin during 2016. In the Powder River Basin, we focused predominantly on the Turner interval in 2016. Turner wells compete with the best inventory in the company. Our 2016 drilling program in this play averaged over 1,600 barrels of oil equivalent per day rate-restricted for the first 30 days and cost about $5 million to drill and complete.","During the fourth quarter, we returned to the Parkman interval and applied our latest techniques with excellent premium-level results. Three Parkman wells had a 30-day rate that averaged 2,200 barrels of oil equivalent per day. With the addition of the Yates acreage, our core position in the Powder River Basin has grown to 400,000 acres. We are expanding this program in 2017 to complete 30 net wells. And we look forward to blocking up acreage, applying longer laterals, adding to our premium inventory, and exploring the 4,800 feet of stacked pay.","In the DJ Basin, we added 200 premium Codell wells through sustainable cost reductions and precision targeting during 2016. We also completed installation of water and gas infrastructure that should further reduce cost and enhance returns as we increase our development in 2017. We plan to complete approximately 15 net wells in the DJ Basin Codell this year.","The Bakken is another area we've been investing in water takeaway infrastructure that should further reduce costs to support and enhance returns of our ongoing drilling program. In the fourth quarter of 2016, we completed a majority of the remaining pre-2016 DUCs. As a result, our 2017 drilling program will be focused on drilling premium Bakken core and Antelope Extension inventory. We expect to complete 35 net wells during 2017.","In Trinidad, we continue to get great results from existing wells, which led to outperformance versus forecast in 2016. Production in Trinidad was virtually flat despite drilling just one additional well that came online in December of 2016. In 2017, we expect to drill an additional five net wells throughout the year.","Here's Billy to review our year-end reserve replacement and finding costs.","Lloyd W. Helms, Jr. - EOG Resources, Inc.","Thanks, David.","We replaced 163% of our 2016 production at a very low finding cost of $5.22 per BOE, excluding revisions due to commodity price changes. That's less than half of our 2015 finding cost. The proved developed finding cost excluding leasehold capital was $6.50 per BOE.","Notably, sustainable LOE reductions drove positive reserve revisions that more than offset negative revisions due to lower commodity prices. As a result, our proved reserves increased by 1.4% year over year, driven by a 7.7% increase to crude oil and natural gas liquids reserves. These are record low finding costs and demonstrate the tremendous capital efficiency gains we made this year resulting from our permanent shift to premium drilling and laser focus on cost reductions.","I'll now turn it over to Tim Driggers to discuss financials and capital structure.","Timothy K. Driggers - EOG Resources, Inc.","Thanks, Billy. I'll begin with a few comments about our capital spending last year and in the fourth quarter. These amounts exclude the Yates transaction, which I'll cover separately.","Capitalized interest for the fourth quarter of 2016 was $6 million. Total exploration and development expenditures were $748 million, including facilities of $122 million excluding acquisitions and asset retirement obligations. In addition, expenditures for gathering systems, processing plants, and other property, plant, and equipment were $31 million. For the full year 2016, capitalized interest was $31 million.","2016 capital expenditures excluding acquisitions and asset retirement obligations were $2.7 million, [sic] (billion) (2603) in line with the updated guidance provide on last quarter's call. This amount includes facilities of $375 million and expenditures for gathering systems, processing plants and other property, plant, and equipment of $92 million.","Total discretionary cash flow was $2.75 billion. We are pleased to have reached our goal of balancing CapEx and (26:28) discretionary cash flow in 2016.","In addition, proceeds from asset sales were $1.1 billion, which included natural gas assets in the Barnett Shale and Haynesville plays and marginal liquids plays in the Permian Basin and Rockies. We also completed the sale of Argentina assets during the year.","Total property acquisition costs other than Yates were $14 million for the year. Capital additions related to the Yates transaction are: $3.1 billion of leasehold acquisitions; $735 million of proved property acquisitions; and $17 million of other property, plant, and equipment. We also recorded $1.1 billion of deferred taxes related to the transaction. To fund the Yates transaction, EOG issued 25 million shares of common stock and paid cash of $16 million for a total consideration of $2.4 billion.","At year end, total debt outstanding was $7 billion, for a debt to total capitalization ratio of 32%. Considering $1.6 billion of cash on hand at year end, net debt to total cap was 28%.","In the fourth quarter 2016, total impairments were $298 million. For the full year 2016, total impairments were $620 million. Impairments to proved properties of $116 million were primarily the result of a write-down to fair value of legacy natural gas assets, which have since been divested. Impairments for both the fourth quarter and full year 2016 included charges for firm commitment contracts related to the divested Haynesville natural gas assets and obsolete inventory.","The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 27% and deferred tax ratio was 44%.","Yesterday we included a guidance table with our earnings press release for the first quarter and full year 2017. Our 2017 CapEx estimate is $3.7 billion to $4.1 billion excluding acquisitions. The exploration and development portion excluding facilities will account for about 81% of the total CapEx budget. The budget for exploration and development facilities and gathering, processing, and other accounts for approximately 19% of the total CapEx budget for 2017. We plan to concentrate our infrastructure spending in the Eagle Ford, Delaware Basin, and Rockies to support our drilling program in those areas and enhance operating efficiencies.","Now I'll turn it back over to Bill.","William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.","Thanks, Tim.","In closing, I will leave you with a few important points. First, our improvement to well performance has been accomplished through the use of proprietary technology to identify high-quality rock, drill precisely targeted laterals, and execute leading-edge completions. We're now beginning to drill longer laterals. And we believe our industry-leading well performance combined with longer laterals will drive significant productivity gains in the future. Slide 10 in the IR deck illustrates this conclusion.","Second, EOG has not and has never been a one-trick pony. We have top tier positions in the big three producing North American oil basins and strong positions in what we believe are the best emerging plays. Our diverse portfolio of assets and decentralized operating structure provides incredible flexibility to invest in the basins with the highest returns, particularly as technology, infrastructure, and netbacks change.","Third, the recent downturn has highlighted one of EOG's core values, and that's capital discipline. There are two guiding principles to our capital discipline, a strong balance sheet and return-based capital allocation. EOG generated near record capital returns at the low point of the commodity price cycle last year. In addition, we not only maintained but improved our balance sheet without issuing equity to pay down debt or cutting the dividend. EOG is a leader in capital discipline, with a relentless focus on returns and a commitment to spend within our means. We are committed to delivering industry-leading oil growth and returns and delivering this within cash flow, including dividends, even in a flat $50 oil environment.","Fourth, EOG's exploration focus is still in high gear. We have never been more excited about the leading-edge technology that we are developing in-house and the new exploration concepts we continue to discover. Everything we learn from our existing plays is being applied to generate new exploration concepts and leasing efforts. With new knowledge, we continue to see significant opportunities to add to and improve our inventory through exploration. Better rock makes better wells, and that's our exploration focus. Do not count us out. We're not through.","And finally, in my 38 years with EOG, I've seen many downturns. Every time we emerged from the downturn in better shape than we entered it. This downturn, however, is unique in every respect except direction. We're not simply in better shape. We've vaulted ahead with record-setting achievements in cost reduction, productivity gains, inventory growth, and capital efficiency improvements. We have the deepest inventory of premium inventory in the industry, and it's growing rapidly. We are poised for amazing growth. And more importantly, our goal of returning to the historic levels of company ROCE performance are in sight.","Thanks for listening, and now we'll go to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our first question from Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you, good morning.","William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.","Good morning, Brian.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","My first question is on the Eagle Ford from a primary drilling perspective. You talked about the increase in oil rates. Slide 40 shows some of this in terms of your wells in 2016 versus 2015 versus 2014. What are the implications for EURs and spacing from the improved well performance that you're seeing over multiple days? And if not yet certain there, can you just talk to the milestones that you're looking for to have more confidence?","Lloyd W. Helms, Jr. - EOG Resources, Inc.","Brian, this is Billy Helms. So yes, you're seeing on that slide that we see continued improvement in production performance year over year in the play. And that's really accomplishing lots of things, but it's really driven by our technology that we're bringing, mainly the targeting and the enhanced completions that we're doing now. Those two things have made a step change. So we're still testing some spacing patterns in different areas of the field and applying this new technology to understand longer-term performance. And as we've stated in the past, as we make these changes, we want to further understand the longer-term performance before we do our resource estimate increase.","We are encouraged that the Eagle Ford is going to continue to improve with time, but we still are watching that data. The Eagle Ford has been essentially a very large laboratory for us to continue to experiment with. So as we continue to gather this data, we'll have a better idea of what that implication means to the long-term performance. So I can't really give you a timeframe yet, but I'd say that we're encouraged with what we see.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks. Then my follow-up is with regards to well costs. On slide 14, you talked about some targets for further cost reductions, which seems in the face of an inflationary environment we may be going into or are already in. Can you just talk about the achievability and whether these are more one-off we'll get there, or whether these are ultimate averages? What happens if prices aren't $50, they're a little bit higher in the inflation environment and assumptions that you've baked in?","Gary L. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.","Brian, this is Gary. Yes, we look at each of the wells in the area. And what we see is about 40% of our well cost is subject to inflation because we've got contracts in place, we've got sole-source, all that sort of thing. When we do that and we look at what kind of opportunities we see for just other efficiency improvements, we believe that we'll be able to meet these targets that we've set here for each of these plays that's listed on this Exhibit 14.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Is there any upside? If oil prices are $55, then I guess one, we just apply the inflation to that 40% to get to something modestly higher.","Gary L. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.","As far as \u2013 irregardless of oil price, this is where we think that we'll be able to get here on this 2017 target.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great, thank you very much.","Operator","We'll go next to Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning, guys.","William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.","Good morning.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","You guys highlight more prominently exploration in the presentation and in your 10-K and in your comments this morning. Let me start. How derisked does a new play need to be before you'll disclose it? And outside of securing acreage, what are the key parameters necessary before you'll show it to investors? And I raise it from the context of peers, both U.S. and global, that have unveiled unconventional plays at much earlier stages, raising the risks as data is released.","William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.","The first thing, Evan, is the play has to be premium quality, so it has to meet the investment hurdles that we've set for premium drilling. And then second of all, we like to have multiple tests, and we like to be really convinced that the play is going to work up to our expectations and we have some consistency about it. We don't want to drill a one or two-well wonder, then come back and some of the other wells are not so good. So we do take a little bit more time. I think it's because we're just more thorough and we want to be more sure about it.","And then there's always, in every one of these plays, you mention acreage. Acreage is the critical thing. And we want to \u2013 as we test them, we learn more about where the sweet spots could be in the plays. And so we're only focused on tying up the sweet spots of that acreage. So we have a large number of plays in the company that we're working on. As you know, we're very decentralized, and each one of our operating divisions has a full set of exploration folks, and we're spread out all over the U.S. And so we're working multiple plays at the same time, and we're quite optimistic about new plays providing additional premium inventory in the future.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great, I look forward to hearing results as we move through the year. My second question on the Permian, you guys are running 11 rigs and targeting 140 wells in 2017. Implied spud to spuds are up year over year. Any color there on maybe how many well completions in the 2017 program are being carried into 2018, or does the lower number of wells reflect a larger appraisal program? Or just some color around that sequentially would be helpful.","Lloyd W. Helms, Jr. - EOG Resources, Inc.","Evan, this is Billy Helms. So what we're seeing there in the Delaware Basin is we've had a steady rig count, and we're typically going be drilling longer laterals in 2017 than we did in 2016. So the drilling times are going increase slightly just as a result of that.","On the number of well completions, I believe we're going to complete about 140 total wells in the Delaware Basin this year, most of those in the Wolfcamp. And we're down to a normal level of inventory in all of our major plays, including the Delaware Basin. So we're not really carrying over into 2017 an abnormally high amount of DUCs, you might say. So I think we'll just \u2013 the rig count there has increased relative to last year. We will be going to longer laterals, but we'll have about 140 net wells completed this year.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Is there a carryover into 2018 I guess was my question because it seems as there would be on those numbers.","Lloyd W. Helms, Jr. - EOG Resources, Inc.","No, no, there's no carryover into 2018 that we see.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. Thanks, guys.","Operator","And we'll now go to Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning. My first question is just on the overall guidance. Bill, you guys issued essentially in line oil production guidance, but you're using quite a bit of a lower oil price perhaps relative to strip and consensus, around $50. I was wondering if you could comment on how you plan to address the CapEx budget and guidance for the year. Do you plan to look at it on a quarterly basis or reassess things around the middle of the year? Because on our numbers, your cash flow would be closer to just under $5 billion using the strip.","William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.","Arun, we set the $50 marker just to give a reference point there. That's where we would be able to have a balanced cash flow to our CapEx and our dividend. So if prices are higher than that, we're going to have free cash flow, and that's certainly one of our goals every year is to generate free cash flow.","As far as how we're going to deploy that, it's a bit early to give you specifics. The overall guidance would be that we're going to stay disciplined, obviously watch commodity prices, watch our drilling results and our cost and watch property sales. And we'll just update you every quarter on where we are on all that. I can say this. We have an extreme amount of flexibility. So with our decentralized structure and multiple high-return plays, it's very easy for EOG to redeploy capital, and we can do it relatively quickly. If one area, say, heats up and maybe it's difficult to get a frac spread or something in one area, we've got other areas that it's easier and they have high return. So we can ramp up relatively quickly.","The priority for the free cash flow is to reinvest. That's the number one priority is obviously reinvest into high-return premium drilling. We also want to continue to firm up our balance sheet. We're going to do that primarily with non-core property sales. So we need to watch how that process proceeds. And then EOG's got a great track record of increasing the dividend, 16 times in the last 17 years. So consistent with that commitment to the dividend, as the year unfolds we'll continue to evaluate the business environment as it relates to the dividend. So again, I think we've got a lot of flexibility, and we'll give you more details on a quarterly basis.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","That's helpful. My follow-up is perhaps a follow-up to Brian's question. In terms of the Eagle Ford, you did show a positive rate of change in both the east and the west. My question is regarding the Q4 activity. If you look at some of the 30-day rates on the 75 wells, they're a touch below our expectations or type curve. Can you comment perhaps on what you saw in terms of productivity between the 45 wells which were drilled prior to 2016 versus the 30 that you drilled last year in terms of the impact perhaps of precision targeting in terms of well results?","Lloyd W. Helms, Jr. - EOG Resources, Inc.","Arun, this is Billy Helms. Certainly you're picking up on it there. In the fourth quarter, about 60% of our well completions were DUCs carried over from prior years. And those wells didn't benefit from the precision targeting that we have done more recently. And so you're seeing some of the 30-day initial IP rates from those wells being below those of previous quarters. But I think overall, after time you can see on that productivity chart that after about 120 to 150 days, they start to \u2013 because of the advanced completions, long-term performance is still improving. So we're continuing to be pleased with our technology and what it's yielding there both in longer-term performance as well as initial upfront productivity.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, thanks a lot.","Operator","We'll go now to Scott Hanold with RBC Capital Markets.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks; good morning.","William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.","Hello, Scott.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey. Just as a follow-up to the question on looking at a higher commodity price and your ability to deploy that to more drilling, can you specifically discuss when you look at the market as it sits right now, strip probably closer to the mid-$50s, how do you internally look at that to make that decision whether to increase activity or not? So what I'm trying get to is what are the key indicators that provide you the confidence that oil's going be $55 or $60 rather than say $50?","William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.","Scott, I think we're watching the oil market, particularly inventory levels. And I think just in the last week or so, we're starting to see very encouraging signs on inventory drawdown, and I think we're getting close. It won't be in the next month or two. I think we're going to know a lot about how the OPEC cuts have affected supply\/demand dynamics and the drawdown of that inventory. So we're about there, but we just need a little bit more time on that.","I think the other thing is, with the rapid ramp-up of drilling rigs in the U.S., we don't want to ramp up too rapidly to decrease the capital efficiency. So we're very committed to keeping the capital efficiency of the company extremely high, and we really only want to increase the capital efficiency. So part of our ramp-up strategy will be certainly to stay very disciplined, to allocate the capital to obviously the highest return investments that we have, and then do it in a systematic manner where we're bringing in really good equipment, really good people, and we don't lose performance there.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay; appreciate that. And as my follow-up, just in terms of the progression of activity right now, where are we at in terms of your current activity, your rig count relative to what the budget contemplates? Are we there yet, or is there still a little bit of ramp to go in some areas?","Gary L. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.","Scott, this is Gary. We've ramped up pretty rapidly here in 2017 because we ended 2016 with 17 drilling rigs, and we've now just this week reached 23. So we're a little bit heavier in the Delaware. We run about 11 rigs there. And then we're running in the seven to eight rigs in the Eagle Ford and a couple in the Rockies. So we're close. And like we mentioned earlier, yes, we've really been working hard just to get the very best available rigs in the industry. So we're pretty well there.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","I appreciate that; thanks.","Operator","We'll go to Paul Sankey with Wolfe Research.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Good morning, everyone. I think a lot of people when they hear you talk get very bearish on oil prices, and I don't think that's the way you look at the world. Bill, can you remind us why what you're doing isn't replicable across the industry, which is I guess the reason why people would be very bearish? Thanks.","William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.","Sure, Paul. The productivity that EOG has, the capital efficiency, which goes really back to our ability to contain costs and renew costs on a sustainable basis, and particularly as we've shifted to premium drilling over the last several years and we've applied the new technology. There's a chart on page 10 that we referred to in the opening remarks. And it shows well productivity for the industry as lateral lengths increase. And generally, when you look across all these plays, there's been quite a bit of studies, not just our studies, but this is basically IHS data that anybody can duplicate. It shows that as lateral lengths increase, obviously the well productivity is increasing. But EOG is in the red there. And if you look at that chart, you can see that our productivity is increasing much, much faster than generally the industry. Even our wells are much more productive even at a short lateral versus some of the laterals that are almost twice as long. So --","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Bill, would you put that down to technology or acreage? Is there any way to \u2013 I know it's a very simplistic question for a very complicated...","William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.","Well, it's two parts. It's better rock and you have to capture that better rock. So with our exploration focus over the years, we've really honed in on capturing the sweet spots of the best play. So that is the beginning of it.","And then the second part of it is identifying the specific targets in those sweet spots, and then executing the lateral and a large percentage of that really great rock, and then using our very advanced, very proprietary completion techniques. So it's a combination of all that technology, and that is not very duplicable. It has taken us really a decade to get to this point. We have very proprietary petrophysical models that we do, obviously take a lot of cores, and we've tied that back into productivity data. And so it's a cumulative effect of a large amount of years in time and a lot of data, and it's not easily duplicated.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Yes, understood. Can I ask a follow-up as well? I think you're also somewhat unique in the way that you pay your staff. How does it in a sense like the company to think if you're returns focused? Why would you \u2013 I guess I'm trying to get around to the idea that you're still incentivized to grow. If you could, just remind us how the staff payment through returns works and how that affects your strategy. And I'll leave it there, thanks.","William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.","Sure. The bonus system has three metrics for each division, certainly for the folks here in Houston, and then it goes down to each employee. So the number one criterion on the bonus pool on the compensation is returns. So the capital returns that your division is responsible for and that you helped execute is the number one.","Number two is how you meet your volume targets. So volume is second. Volume growth is second and returns are first. And then number three is how well you're setting yourself up for the future. So of course, we have a very strong culture of generating new inventory and better inventory all the time. And it all ties together. If you invest your money and you get a very, very high rate of return, you're going to grow your volumes spectacularly at the same time. So it all fits and it's very focused.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Why don't you think other people do it? Why do you think it's unique to you guys to use that methodology? I would have thought everyone should do that.","William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.","I would say the same. I would agree. I think it's just a culture that's been in the company for decades and it just keeps getting better every year.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Thank you, sir.","Operator","We'll go to Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","John H. Abbott - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Good morning. This is John Abbott speaking on behalf of Doug Leggate. We appreciate you taking our questions. Our first question relates to 2017 activity levels. How do you see the pace of completions throughout the course of the year? And then our follow-up would be, it looks like you exit 2017 with significant momentum. Could you provide an early look at the exit rate for the year and a preliminary view for 2018? Thank you.","William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.","Let me just answer the second part first. We have given a long-term outlook. That's provided on one of our slides. I'll give you the number here in a minute, but we've given an outlook at $50 to $60 oil. We can grow at a compounded annual growth rate of 15% to 25%. So you can look at that. That means that in the year 2020, EOG would be producing 500,000 to 700,000 barrels of oil per day. And so you can use that as a guide.","As far as the specifics on 2017 about how we're going to schedule our completions, I'm going to let Gary Thomas comment on that.","Gary L. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.","John, we've got our completion schedule pretty well balanced each quarter through the year. And as I mentioned earlier, we had maybe a little slow start as far as just the ramp up of the rigs. And we also mentioned that once we take our rigs up that it's two to three months before you really start to see production from each of those rigs. So we do have a ramp from first quarter through 2017.","John H. Abbott - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","We appreciate it, thank you.","Operator","We'll go to Mike Scialla of Stifel Financial.","Michael Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hey, good morning, guys. Looking at your 2017 CapEx increase over 2016, it doesn't look proportional to the number of wells. I think the CapEx up over 40%, the number of wells is about 7%. I know you had the benefit of completing some DUCs in 2016, and you alluded to this earlier, but I think a lot of that is due to longer laterals in 2017. So one, is that fair? And then two, if it is, do you have an average lateral length for the 2017 wells versus 2016?","William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.","Mike, the reason that the CapEx is going up \u2013 it's several reasons. Number one is the DUCs. As you mentioned. we had a little bit of a benefit there. The wells were already drilled. So we haven't drilled more wells this year than last year. But the wells are much better this year due to the technology and the higher shift to premium. The more capital per well on the completion side is due primarily to the Permian. We've increased the Permian well count substantially more than the other plays. And the wells are a bit more expensive in the Permian than they are in the Eagle Ford or the Bakken, and also because the wells are getting longer too.","Michael Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Any sense of the lateral length 2017 versus 2016?","Gary L. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.","It's up about 20%. As you say there, Mike, that's a part of our increase. The big part is just the increased drilling since we had so many DUCs in 2016.","Michael Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. I wanted to follow up on the Austin Chalk. Tim made some comments on that; that those wells do look really strong. Can you say where the 14 wells are located that you drilled so far? Are they all in the Austin Chalk, or is it spread across your Eagle Ford acreage? I know you want to see the results from this year's drilling program before you start talking about resource potential. But I just wanted to get any sort of sense on how much of that Eagle Ford acreage could be prospective. Are we talking maybe up to half, or is that way too optimistic?","David W. Trice - EOG Resources, Inc.","This is David. On the Austin Chalk, that's really what we're focused on right now is delineating the play. So the 14 wells that you mentioned, those are really across the play. And so we continue to evaluate that. And so we're going to \u2013 the encouragement we saw from 2016, we're going to up that this next year in 2017 to 25 wells. And we'll do the same, we'll be testing some spacing patterns and then stepping out and seeing what the prospectivity is across the entire position. But we just want a little bit more time with the data.","Michael Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Just to follow up on that, did it look like it could be a resource-type play, or is it going be more one-off areas where you've got little isolated pockets that work?","David W. Trice - EOG Resources, Inc.","One thing in the Austin, it's a little bit more geological than the Eagle Ford. And so we have multiple zones there that we're looking at, so we'll be testing each of those zones. So that's really why we want the opportunity to see the data and look at the spacing tests.","Michael Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay.

This morning, we'll discuss topics in the following order. Bill Thomas will review 2015 highlights and our 2016 capital plan. David Trice and Billy Helms will review operational results in year-end reserve replacement data. Then I will discuss EOG's financials, capital structure, and hedge positioning. And Bill will provide concluding remarks.","Here's Bill Thomas.","William R. Thomas - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Tim.","EOG is committed to a returns-focused capital discipline, and we've demonstrated that commitment in 2015 with a simple decision. After four years of 40% compound annual oil growth, we slammed on the brakes and decided to defer production growth. It was an easy decision. Outspending cash flow to grow oil into an oversupplied market makes no sense.","Rather than chasing production growth through the down cycle, we focused on three main goals. First, we concentrated more than ever on resetting the company to be successful in a lower commodity price environment by reducing cost and improving well productivity. Second, we wanted to add high-quality drilling inventory through organic exploration and tactical acquisitions. And most importantly, our third goal was to protect our balance sheet.","As a result, EOG had a record year in reducing costs, improving well productivity, and adding new drilling potential to the company. We accomplished all this and ended the year with one of the strongest balance sheets in the industry.","Here are a few highlights from the year. We reduced capital more than 40% from 2014 and maintained flat U.S. oil production. Total cash operating cost per unit decreased 17% compared to 2014. We drilled two industry record wells, one each in the Bakken and Delaware Basin Wolfcamp. We added a company record 1.6 billion barrels of oil equivalent and net resource potential and over 3,000 net locations. That means we replaced more than six times the inventory that we drilled in 2015. And we acquired 34,000 net acres in the sweet spot of the Delaware Basin.","2015 changed how we think about EOG's position in the industry long term. It's no longer enough to be the low-cost producer in U.S. horizontal shale. EOG's goal is to be a competitive low-cost oil producer in the global market.","Now let's talk about our plan in 2016. Our first objective this year is to achieve strong returns on our capital program through sustainable profitability gains. In order to maximize return on capital invested, we are shifting into what we call premium drilling mode. Like last year, we will concentrate our efforts in capital in our top plays, the Eagle Ford, Delaware Basin, Bakken, and Rockies. The difference in 2016 is that we have the flexibility to direct capital only towards our large inventory of premium quality wells. Premium inventory is defined as wells that generate direct after-tax rates of return of at least 30% at $40 oil. We have identified over 2 billion barrels of equivalent of net resource potential and 3,200 net drilling locations that meet this hurdle. At our 2016 pace, and we expect to complete 270 wells this year, that represents 12 years of drilling potential.","In addition, we are confident our premium inventory will continue to grow in size and quality. Our proven track record of organic exploration and sustainable gains through technology and efficiency will continue to add premium inventory for years to come. What that means, and this is the most important point, is that between our existing premium inventory and our confidence that we can replace it, EOG will be in premium drilling mode from now on. EOG's shift to premium drilling in 2016 is not just simple high-grading. It is a permanent upgrade for all our future drilling.","It's important to realize that this is much more than a small incremental shift in our drilling program. It's a major step change in terms of per well productivity. For the average 2016 well, we estimate a 50% increase in the first 120 days of production per foot of treated lateral versus wells we completed in 2015. Our shift to premium drilling allows EOG to quickly return to triple-digit, and I'll say this again, to quickly return to triple-digit capital rates of return as oil prices improve to modest levels.","So the next logical question is what becomes of the remaining inventory? Our non-premium inventory is still very high-quality. By any industry standard, it is Tier 1 quality with tremendous value. Due to the quality, a large percentage of this inventory will be converted to premium through technology and efficiency gains over time. The remaining high-quality inventory will add value to property sales or trades as part of our ongoing upgrading process.","Our second objective in 2016 is to protect our balance sheet. Two years in a row we have cut capital by more than 40%, demonstrating our commitment to capital discipline. In addition, as a result of our ongoing evaluation of our portfolio to upgrade our asset base, we are marketing certain valuable but non-core properties.","EOG prioritizes profitability and a healthy balance sheet to prepare the company for uncertain commodity cycles, and the strategy has paid off. EOG entered 2016 in excellent financial and operational shape. The combination of EOG's high-quality assets, sustainable cost reductions, and well productivity improvements allow the company to lead the industry in returns year after year. EOG is uniquely positioned with a large and growing inventory of high-return drilling, even in a $40 price environment. Achieving strong returns in the current environment positions EOG to achieve tremendous returns as commodity prices improve.","Now I'll turn the call over David Trice, who will update you on the Eagle Ford and Rockies plays.","David W. Trice - Executive Vice President-Exploration & Production","Thanks, Bill.","Year after year, the Eagle Ford continues to impress us with the quality of its resource potential. In 2015, we grew production while completing 38% fewer wells compared to 2014. Six years ago, we estimated the Eagle Ford had 900 million barrels of oil equivalent of net resource potential. We've since updated that net resource potential three times, and our latest estimate from early 2014 was 3.2 billion barrels of oil equivalent.","In 2015, we've done a number of things that hold promise for further upside to the Eagle Ford's resource potential. First, refinements to our high-density completion techniques continue to improve well productivity in 2015, as can be seen in the cumulative production charts in our investor presentation on page 10.","Second, to complement high-density completions, we've made tremendous progress on what we have termed precision targeting. This is one of the most promising developments, not only for the Eagle Ford, but for all of our plays. Precision targeting starts with first identifying and then mapping the key petrophysical properties that make the difference between a good well and a great well. Once all the data has been integrated, we found that the real sweet spot in any given target can be very narrow. Where we previously landed our wells in 150-foot window, we now precisely steer them in a window as narrow as 20 feet. In addition, this work on precision targeting also revealed that, in some areas, we may have two distinct sweet spot targets in the lower Eagle Ford alone.","Finally, we conducted a pilot test by drilling adjacent wells in a W-pattern that alternate between the two targets within the lower Eagle Ford. This allows for surface downspacing closer than the 300 feet used in our current development spacing and resource potential estimates. Early results from these tests are encouraging.","In 2016, we have more program flexibility, as 91% of our Eagle Ford acreage is held by production. We plan to complete 150 Eagle Ford wells while continuing to test the W-pattern, spacing wells 200 to 250 feet apart. Our advancements in precision targeting and completions, along with cost efficiencies, may have significant implications on our resource potential. and will allow us to continue to upgrade additional Eagle Ford locations to premium status.","In our Rockies and Bakken plays, we proactively scaled back activity due to commodity prices. With the lower activity level, we were able to sharpen our focus on sustainable operational improvements. We are very pleased with the progress. And in fact, the magnitude of operational improvements in these plays were the best in the company.","Here are the highlights. First, we upgraded our Bakken net resource potential to 1 billion barrels of oil equivalent and added almost 1,000 net locations. Second, we reduced Bakken completed well cost 18% and drilling days over 30%. Third, we built water handling and water pipeline infrastructure that significantly reduces long-term LOE. Fourth, we drilled several high-quality wells in the Powder River Basin, highlighted by the Flatbow 602-1621H that came online in the fourth quarter. This Turner well averaged over 1,100 barrels of oil per day and 1.7 million cubic feet per day of rich natural gas in its first 90 days of production.","Finally, we also drilled an industry record well in the Bakken. The Riverview 102-32H produced an average of 2,700 barrels of oil per day over the first 30 days, and 2,200 barrels of oil per day for the first 90 days of production. This well was the first high-density completion on our Antelope Extension acreage and is an industry record, even though it is only a 4,300-foot lateral. Going forward, we will continue to develop this area at a moderate pace as we build out the infrastructure that will allow us to lower long-term operating costs.","We're encouraged by these 2015 accomplishments in the Rockies and Bakken. And while the activity level will remain low in 2016, our focus on operational and well performance improvements will continue. We expect to see additional cost efficiencies and well productivity advancements through completions and targeting refinements. We plan to complete approximately 35 wells in the Rockies in 2016. As we continue progressing technically and reducing costs, we expect the premium location count to grow significantly.","Finally, a quick update on our Conwy project in the East Irish Sea; all work for startup has been completed by EOG, and we are working with the platform operator to reach final acceptance, which we believe is imminent. We expect first production by the end of the quarter.","Here's Billy Helms to review our activity in the Permian Delaware Basin.","Lloyd W. Helms - Executive Vice President-Exploration & Production","Thanks, David.","Our Permian Delaware Basin team has made tremendous amount of progress last year. Prior to 2015, we developed a successful winter program and had encouraging results with the Wolfcamp and Bone Springs intervals. As we entered 2015, we laid out a specific plan to: one, increase our technical knowledge to better understand the potential of these complex plays; two, improve our operational execution and cost performance; and three, expand the scope and impact of the basin to EOG.","Our efforts paid off. Here's a recap of our progress. First, we made tremendous progress utilizing two techniques: precision targeting and high-density completions. Our enhanced understanding of the regional stratigraphy of the basin helps us to delineate the most productive target intervals within each formation. This technique requires a significant amount of technical data and data analysis expertise and, coupled with our high-density completion technique, generates solid improvements in well productivity, as evidenced by our industry record-setting Wolfcamp well.","The Thor 21 #702H produced an average of 3,490 barrels of oil equivalent per day over its first 30 days of production. After 120 days, average production was an impressive 2,100 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Notably, the well was completed with a shorter lateral, yet still exceeded the longer lateral wells in absolute production. In fact, on average, our 2015 Wolfcamp wells produced 40% more than the next best operator during the first three months of production, as displayed on slide nine of our investor presentation.","Second, we made significant progress generating sustainable cost reductions. For example, in the Wolfcamp oil window, we reduced average drilling time 33% and lowered completed well cost 35%, despite adding incremental cost to each well for high-density completions. In addition, we secured a long-term brackish water supply that, as we move into 2016, is expected to save us $200,000 to $300,000 per well.","And finally, we increased the net resource potential for the Delaware Basin by 1.0 billion barrels of oil equivalent and added 2,200 net locations, essentially adding decades of drilling inventory. This solidifies the position for the Delaware Basin as one of our high-return growth engines. We also executed on another 8,000 net acre acquisition in the fourth quarter, bringing total 2015 Delaware Basin acquisitions to 34,000 net acres. This adds to our sweet spot acreage, with significant upside potential through multiple stack targets.","Thanks to the well productivity improvements and cost reductions achieved in 2015, the Delaware Basin delivers returns that compete for capital alongside the Eagle Ford. A large portion of the Delaware Basin is already considered premium. And with our continued advancements, we expect to dramatically increase our inventory of premium locations in the next few years.","For 2016, we are continuing the momentum. The Delaware Basin will again be EOG's second most active basin next to the Eagle Ford. We plan to complete the same number of wells as we did in 2015, about 75, and we'll focus primarily on the Wolfcamp. Drilling the Wolfcamp generates excellent returns while allowing us to collect data on the shallower targets at the same time.","I'll now address reserve replacement and refining cost. All in, proved reserves decreased 15% in 2015, driven primarily by price-related revisions. Excluding revisions due to commodity price changes, we replaced 192% of our 2015 production at a low finding cost of $11.91 per BOE.","For the 28th consecutive year, DeGolyer and MacNaughton performed an independent engineering analysis of our reserves, and their estimate was within 5% of our internal estimate. Their analysis covered about 86% of our proved reserves this year. Please see the schedules accompanying this earnings press release for the calculation of reserve replacement and finding cost.","I'll now turn it over to Tim Driggers to discuss financials and capital structure.","Timothy K. Driggers - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Thanks, Billy.","I'll begin with a few comments about our capital spending last year and in the fourth quarter. Capitalized interest for the quarter was $8.9 million. For the fourth quarter of 2015, total expiration and development expenditures were $737 million, including facilities of $116 million and excluding acquisitions and asset retirement obligations. In addition, expenditures for gathering systems, processing plants, and other property, plant, and equipment were $35 million. There were $105 million of acquisitions during the quarter.","For the full year 2015, capitalized interest was $41.8 million. Total exploration and development expenditures were $4.4 billion, including facilities of $765 million and excluding acquisitions and asset retirement obligations. In addition, expenditures for gathering systems, processing plants, and other property, plant, and equipment were $288 million. For the full year, capital expenditures excluding acquisitions and asset retirement obligations were $4.7 billion, $200 million below the low end of our original 2015 guidance.","Total cash flow from operations was $3.6 billion. In addition, proceeds from asset sales were $193 million. Total acquisitions for the year were $481 million. At year end, total debt outstanding was $6.7 billion, for a debt to total capitalization ratio of 34%. Taking into account $719 million of cash on hand at year end, net debt to total capital was 31%.","In the fourth quarter of 2015, total impairments were $168 million. $94 million of these impairments were the result of significant declines in commodity prices during the fourth quarter. For the full year 2015, total impairments were $6.6 billion. $6.3 billion of these impairments were the results of declines in commodity prices and were related to legacy natural gas assets and marginal liquids plays. The remaining impairments for both the fourth quarter and full year 2015 were ongoing lease and producing property impairments.","The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 29%, and the deferred tax ratio was 92%.","Yesterday, we included a guidance table with our earnings press release for the first quarter and full-year 2016. Our 2016 CapEx estimate is $2.4 billion to $2.6 billion excluding acquisitions. The exploration and development portion excluding facilities will account for almost 80% of the total CapEx budget. Our 2016 CapEx estimate represents a 47% decrease from 2015 and is 70% less than 2014 capital expenditures, demonstrating our commitment to capital discipline. The budget for exploration and development facilities and gathering, processing, and other accounts for approximately 20% of the total CapEx budget for 2016.","We plan to concentrate our infrastructure spending in the Eagle Ford and Delaware Basin to support our drilling programs in those areas and enhance operating efficiency.","In terms of hedges, for natural gas we have approximately 60,000 MMBtu per day hedged at $2.49 per MMBtu for March 1 through August 1, 2016. We currently have no hedges in place for oil.","Now I'll turn it back over to Bill.","William R. Thomas - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Tim.","Now for a few comments on the macro, during the fourth quarter of 2014, EOG was early to respond to the price signals in the market. We cut CapEx, scaled back activity, and focused on returns instead of growing oil into an oversupplied market. As we start 2016, we are encouraged by the discipline operators are demonstrating around the world. This disciplined capital reduction is rapidly slowing U.S. oil drilling and reducing significant amounts of future supply worldwide. We believe the pace of market correction is increasing in 2016.","Now in summary, I will leave you with a few important points. First, 2015 was a record year for EOG in terms of improving the company. We had record well and operating cost reductions and a record year in improving well productivity. We also had our best year ever in adding new high-quality deep drilling inventory.","Second, we are rapidly resetting the company to be successful in a lower commodity price environment. We are focused on improving returns and lowering operating cost instead of growing oil at the bottom of the market.","Third, our shift to premium drilling this year should yield strong capital returns in a low commodity price environment. Premium wells generate after-tax rates of return of 30% or better at $40 oil and over 100% after-tax rates return at $60 oil. Therefore, EOG is uniquely positioned for tremendous performance as oil prices improve.","Fourth, we do not view premium drilling mode as a temporary bridge to get through low oil prices. With over 2 billion barrels of oil equivalent, a premium net resource potential, and 12 years of premium inventory, this is a permanent shift in the quality of EOG's future wells. We believe the company will continue to grow the size and quality of premium inventory for years to come.","Fifth, we remain long-term focused. We continue to do the things that will add significant upside to the future of the company, like investments in exploration, secondary recovery, and other new technologies. Our focus is creating long-term shareholder value through sustainable productivity advancements.","And finally, our goal has always been to be the low-cost U.S. horizontal oil producer. As we look to the future, that's not enough. Our goal is now squarely set on being one of the lowest-cost producers in the competitive global oil market, and we are well on our way to reaching that goal.","Thanks for listening, now we'll go to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And we'll take our first question from Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey. Good morning, guys. My first question is your premium locations appear higher than most peers' core or comparable locations. Can you discuss what you think differentiates EOG's premium locations and what's proprietary and represents a barrier for peers to achieve similar results? And also, if I could, you mentioned upside at locations. Any color on what percentage of the average locations have already been reviewed?","William R. Thomas - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Evan, certainly we believe moving into premium drilling mode is a step change in the future of the company. It's a substantial increase, as we said. Over the last two years, it's about a 95% increase in the quality of the wells we're going to drill and a 50% uplift for this year. So we're moving more rapidly than what maybe we might have even thought a few years ago.","What's driving that is the quality of the rock. The quality of the rock is the most important factor in the productivity of the well. So we made extremely strong technical advancements in identifying the best rock in the best plays over the years, and certainly we believe we've captured the premier acreage in the premier plays in the U.S. And then also, in each one of those plays we've developed petrophysical techniques, seismic techniques. We've used a lot of core data and our combined over 10 years' experience in these horizontal plays to identify the best target zones in each one of the plays. And so that is the main driver. It's the rock quality, capturing it first and then being able to take all the technical knowledge and tools that we've developed over the years and to, in our experience, to be able to pick out the best targets.","And then we've developed proprietary techniques to not only identify but to place the laterals in those targets and to keep the lateral in those targets for a long portion of the well. So our goal is to keep those targets, those laterals in the best rock about 95% or better on the well. And so that's really the main driver. We think that's a very unique, very proprietary ability of EOG, and will be very difficult to duplicate in the future.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","And a follow-up, if I may. You discussed the 55% jump in expected performance per foot in 2016. But since your DUCs are completed on largely a FIFO basis, I presume that many of the wells you complete this year are 2015 vintage. So my question is, is that right? And would that then mean there's another step change in performance for 2017 as you complete and turn more of those newly identified premium locations, all other things being equal?","William R. Thomas - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Evan, a large percentage of our wells that we're going to complete in the first half of the year are carryover DUCs from 2015. The majority of those wells are very beneficial to what we've been learning about targeting and identifying the rock. So those will be fantastic wells, and we'll get extremely strong returns on those. But the learning curve is not over. We continue to refine our knowledge and our ability to execute. And so, we see this as really just the beginning of a continuing, we believe, sustainable productivity increase in our drilling going forward.","As we said in the opening, we've identified 3,200 locations and over 2 billion barrels of oil equivalent so far that's premium, and we expect that to grow over time, in numbers and quality. So this is really a big game-changer for the company. We think it's very proprietary, and so we think it's going to give us an extremely competitive edge going forward. So we believe, as oil prices improve, we will be able to rapidly be able to generate triple-digit rates of return going forward. So this is a very meaningful step for the company.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","I appreciate that.","Operator","Next will be Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Good morning, everybody.","William R. Thomas - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Doug.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Bill, the production range for the year is obviously pretty wide. I guess what I'm trying understand is, there's a fairly large proportion of DUCs, I'm guessing. I would have thought that would have given greater certainty to the outcome, so I'm just wondering if you can help us reconcile the \u2013 are you being relatively conservative with the range that you're giving us, or is it something else? And I've got a follow-up, please.","William R. Thomas - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Doug, I'm going to ask Gary Thomas to give you some color on that.","Gary L. Thomas - Chief Operating Officer","Doug, I didn't get completely your question here.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So what I'm getting at is, I would have thought, if you're completing wells you've already drilled but haven't completed, it would have given greater certainty to the outcome and the production outlook for the year. But the range for the year is still very, very wide. I'm just trying to reconcile those two things.","Gary L. Thomas - Chief Operating Officer","Okay. On the DUCs, yes, as Bill mentioned, we're going to be completing quite a number, about 70 of our DUCs. We're going to be completing additional DUCs than that. We're going to be completing at least 100 first quarter wells that we drill as DUCs. And those DUCs are all premium. They generate a 30% rate of return at $40 oil. And our guidance is very similar to what we've had in previous years. We're saying anywhere from 260,000 to 280,000 barrels of oil per day for 2016. That pretty well duplicates what we had in 2015. Does that answer your question?","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes, well I guess I was talking about BOE guidance, which is still quite wide, but I'll take it offline with Cedric [Burgher]. My follow-up is really more balance sheet related. So I think in the past, though in a more robust oil price environment, you talked about a 30% ceiling on your net debt-to-cap. You're slightly above that right now. I'm just wondering how you're thinking about that. And this is not in any way disparaging to the industry, but a lot of very strong companies with very strong balance sheets have taken advantage of their relative outperformance by, obviously, issuing equity. I'm just curious as to how you feel about the uncertainty of the outlook and how you might balance the priorities to reinforce the strength of your balance sheet, given how well your stock has done relative to the market?","William R. Thomas - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Doug, first of all, EOG has no current plans to issue equity at this time. Certainly we entered the year, we came into the downturn with a strong balance sheet, and we've been disciplined throughout the process. And so, when we look, as we go forward for this year, we have tremendous flexibility to make further adjustments to capital throughout the year. We do anticipate selling non-core properties, as we consistently do every year. We're pretty far along in that process. We have what we believe are very high-quality, strong buyers for properties. And this could be \u2013 this is not a small amount of money; it's very significant. So we're quite confident in that process.","And so our goal going forward is to maintain a strong balance sheet. And fortunately, our balance sheet right now is one of the strongest in the peer group. So, that's certainly a focus for us. It's certainly been a hallmark. A strong balance sheet has been a hallmark for EOG for years, and we've not taken our sight off that. And we're going to be committed to maintaining a good strong balance sheet going forward.","Operator","The next question is from Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Bill, I was wondering if you could elaborate a little bit more on the premium drilling inventory. You guys cited, I believe, 3,200 premium locations and 2 billion barrels, I believe, of gross recovery. That would equate to an EUR of 625 MBoe, if you just average that out. About half of that premium inventory is in the Eagle Ford. So I guess my question is, your overall Eagle Ford guidance is for 450 MBoe recovery, and that's after royalties. So I was wondering if you could just maybe comment on the differences in the premium inventory in the Eagle Ford relative to that 450 MBoe average?","William R. Thomas - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","The first thing, the 2 billion barrels is net.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","That's net? Okay.","William R. Thomas - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, that's net. So the gross EUR per well would be quite bigger than what you stated. And let me let David Trice comment a little bit more on the details on the Eagle Ford and what we expect there going forward.","David W. Trice - Executive Vice President-Exploration & Production","Arun, in the Eagle Ford, like we stated in our remarks, we've done a lot of work there. Obviously, over the years, we've collected a tremendous amount of data. Even this last year in 2015, we drilled quite a few pilot holes where we actually drilled down through the Eagle Ford and collected a lot of data. And so what that allowed us to see was that we have a lot of additional upside there as far as working on the targeting. Like I had mentioned, we're drilling 20-foot target intervals and doing multiple targets within the lower Eagle Ford. We're seeing very good results with that, and we're quite encouraged.","So I think really going forward, we see a real opportunity to continue to add premium locations. We stated in our slides that we've got approximately 1,500 premium locations in the Eagle Ford, but we certainly see that as a starting point as far as being able to continue to add premium locations.","William R. Thomas - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Let me just add, to answer your question specifically on the 450 net MBoe per well in the Eagle Ford. That is for an average Eagle Ford well, and that is not a premium well. Premium wells would be quite a bit better than that. And then that number is stale. So we haven't updated that 450 net MBoe per well for several years, and we've made quite a bit of advancements since then in the high-density frac technology, and now we're making advancements in targeting also. So those numbers, it takes a little bit of time to get confirmation on what the new EUR number is. So when you make these advancements, you want to make sure you get at least a year of production, and then you can adjust them up accordingly.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you, Bill. And my follow-up, Bill, in some cases you now stratified the inventory a little bit between premium and other locations. You mentioned in your prepared remarks about EOG potentially being open to upgrading or trading inventory, and I was wondering if you could maybe elaborate on that for the non-premium inventory.","William R. Thomas - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","The non-premium inventory will have two avenues. The first avenue will be that we believe the majority of it will be converted to premium over time as we continue to learn how to target the rock more correctly and we continue to be able to be better at picking out the high-quality rock in the target zone. So it's an ongoing process in every one of these plays, and we expect continued improvement. If it doesn't make it to the premium inventory level and it never gets in our CapEx, then certainly it has a lot of value. All this non-premium inventory that we have, if you compared it to the rest of the industry, it would be Tier 1 inventory. It's very high quality. So that gives us a chance to market this as we go forward down the road through property sales, as we normally do in our asset upgrading process. Hello?","Operator","And we'll go next to Brian Singer.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you, good morning.","William R. Thomas - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Bill, in your opening comments, you mentioned a focus, more specific focus of EOG being a competitive low-cost producer in the global market, not just U.S. shale. Before we run with this too far, do you still expect to do this predominantly through U.S. shale, or is this any signal you're willing to pursue international shale or global non-shale investment opportunities to a greater degree? And is it still your view that you can do this from the premium focus areas that you talked to and then that you have in the Delaware Basin, Eagle Ford, and Bakken?","William R. Thomas - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Brian, we have no intention of expanding international efforts, so we are going to be very much U.S. driven. We see tremendous opportunity in the U.S. And so this whole direction towards being not only the low-cost producer in the U.S. horizontal, we think we're clearly there. And our sight now is really set on being one of the lowest-cost producers in the world market. And we believe that we can accomplish this with our very high-quality assets that we currently have and continuing to improve them and continuing to come up with new technology as we go forward.","And we also believe very strongly that we can continue to grow that quality asset much faster than we're drilling it. And that would be through converting existing inventory in the premium and also through new plays. So we see tremendous opportunity the U.S., and we're going to stay focused there. And we're quite confident that we can continue to lower our operating cost, lower our well cost, and improve well productivity to become more than competitive in the world.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it, thanks. And then on the follow-up side, I've got two little questions. One, you highlighted exploration here, and I wondered if you could just give an update on whether you expect to bring any meaningful projects to the finish line and ultimately announce that in 2016, or whether the reduced budget is prohibitive in that regard. And then on the asset sale front, have you worked any production impact from potential asset sales into the guidance that you've provided?","William R. Thomas - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","For the latter part of your question, we've not put any asset sales volumes into the production guidance. And so the first part of it \u2013 what was the first part of the question?","Timothy K. Driggers - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Exploration.","William R. Thomas - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, exploration. We did not want to take any short-term cuts that might affect the long-term benefit of the company this year. So we left in a considerable amount of money in the current budget for exploration, both in acreage, buying acreage on emerging plays. And we'll also have several tests of new plays continuing this year. So we'll see how all those go. We're quite hopeful and quite optimistic that we have maybe some plays that will be premium plays. We won't move them forward unless they would be premium, of course, but we're quite optimistic on the exploration front.","Operator","And your next question is from Pearce Hammond with Simmons & Company.","Pearce Wheless Hammond - Simmons & Company International","Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. My first question is what commodity price assumptions are embedded in your 2016 capital plan?","William R. Thomas - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Pearce, we use the strip, and we used the strip that was in the first part of January. And so we haven't got any \u2013 we don't really put in a lot of upside to the current prices. I think it was based on prices around $40 was the current strip we used.","Pearce Wheless Hammond - Simmons & Company International","Okay, perfect. Thank you. And then my follow-up, this is a hard question to ask, so just bear with me, but it follows up on Brian Singer's question. On the exploration front, for the past number of years you guys have worked on various plays. And obviously you've had tremendous success, with the Eagle Ford as an example. But now those plays weren't really \u2013 some of those plays weren't economic or couldn't compete with your really core plays back when oil was $80 to $100. And now obviously oil is a lot lower. And I know service costs have come down.","But when you look at those plays and you also look at what you mentioned in the press release about this premium inventory and how much success you're having at improving your existing inventory, would it make sense instead of spending the money on exploration on trying to discover new plays to actually use that money to buy existing acreage around the core around plays, whether it be the Eagle Ford, the Permian, the Bakken, SCOOP\/STACK, or whatnot, and then take your core competency and expertise, which is clearly in making something better? Would it be a better use of the capital and generate a higher return for shareholders?","William R. Thomas - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Pearce, let me let Billy Helms comment on that. We're very focused both on tactical acquisitions. I'll let him give you some color on that.","Lloyd W. Helms - Executive Vice President-Exploration & Production","Good morning, Pearce. What we were able to accomplish last year is a good example of that. We focus in first \u2013 the first effort is understanding where the premium acreage is that Bill described earlier. It gets down to basically understanding the rock. And we have to understand where that rock exists. And then those pieces that are added to our portfolio that compete for capital in our existing portfolio certainly will add to that, as we exhibited last year in our Delaware Basin acquisitions. And we'll continue that effort as we go into the next year. That's just part of our ongoing philosophy of how we continue to grow the company. And we balance that off with, as you know, we also manage to sell off properties every year. And so we balance those two with the overall capital discipline we have in the company. So that's always been part of our strategy and will continue to be.","Operator","And the next call is from Paul Sankey with Wolfe Research.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Hi. Good morning, everyone.","William R. Thomas - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Paul.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","I was wondering if your drilling contracts are committing you to more drilling than you would otherwise do, all things being equal. It just feels as if you're somewhat dependent now on the oil price recovering. But more importantly, I was wondering whether if you didn't have those locked-in drilling contracts, you would actually be completing more wells and drilling less. Thanks.","William R. Thomas - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Paul, we did enter the year with 13 rigs under contract. I think the average this year will be 11 rigs. We looked very hard at trying to buy out those contracts to reduce that, since we do have so many DUCs in place. But when we ran the numbers, it just didn't make economic sense. Those rigs are the best quality rigs in the business. The efficiency is tremendous, and it just didn't make economic sense to buy those out. And so we're really focused on going forward. We didn't want to grow oil, obviously, this year in the low part of the cycle, and so we didn't want to accelerate the DUCs. And so I'm going to let Gary Thomas give you a little bit more detail on the rig situation and our DUC situation.","Gary L. Thomas - Chief Operating Officer","Yes, Paul, this is Gary. And if we didn't have these rigs under contract, we would certainly be completing more of our DUCs, with them all being premium wells, but we're just honoring those contracts. And as Bill said, yes, we're going to average \u2013 we were at 27 rigs under contract in 2015. It's 11 rigs this year, and we average 5.5 rigs next year. So yes, in 2017 we'll be able to certainly accelerate the completion of our DUCs, which will be very beneficial to us.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","And the follow-up would just be I assume at these prices CapEx would be lower but for the contracts.","Gary L. Thomas - Chief Operating Officer","That's right, yes.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","And you would be simply neither completing nor drilling as much if it wasn't for the fact that you're committed and it would be too expensive to buy the contracts out.","Gary L. Thomas - Chief Operating Officer","That's correct. Yes, sir.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Thank you, that clarifies it.","Gary L. Thomas - Chief Operating Officer","That's more flexibility.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Got it, understood. Thank you.","Operator","Next is Biju Perincheril with Susquehanna Brokers.","Biju Perincheril - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Hi, thanks. Good morning. Bill, I had a question about the high-density completions. It almost sounds like when I look at it, you're taking the unconventional rust warren (52:33) and transforming it into something close to a conventional rust warren (52:36) near the wellbore. And I don't expect it's a fair way to characterize it, but I guess my question is do you think there are any implications for the longer-term shape of the decline curve of these new completions? I'm thinking several years out. I would like to hear your take on it. Thanks.","William R. Thomas - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","The high-density completions, what they do, you described it fairly accurately, is that they contact enormous amounts of surface area of the rock, and they hit it very, very, very close to the well bore. So obviously, the better the rock and the more that you connect to the well bore, especially close to the well bore, has the tremendous effect on the uplift of wells. And I'm going to let Billy Helms comment on the long-term effect of this uplift.","Lloyd W. Helms - Executive Vice President-Exploration & Production","Biju, you did characterize it fairly accurately. I think the one way to think about is, certainly the more rocky contact in the reservoir, basically yes, you're going to increase the initial potential of that well. But by contacting more of that rock, you're also increasing the ultimate recovery from every well. So you will see good initial production rates. But your decline, we're seeing the benefit of declines flattening, with more production from these high-density completions. So the overall effect has been quite uplifting.","Biju Perincheril - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","So when we compare the shape of the decline curve in the longer term, do you think it will remain fairly similar? So, when we look at the terminal rates, would you expect a higher decline for the higher-density completions, or no?","Lloyd W. Helms - Executive Vice President-Exploration & Production","No, no. Actually, we're not seeing that at all. We're seeing, longer term, the wells will produce longer, and the initial decline is little bit less steep than the older completions are, just simply because you're connecting a lot more rock to the well bore.","Biju Perincheril - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Perfect, thanks. Appreciate it.","Operator","Our next question is from David Tameron with Wells Fargo Securities.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi, good morning. Bill, how do you think about a ramp as you go into \u2013 assuming we get some upward pressure on prices a year from now, how quickly can you ramp? I know you talked about prior \u2013 the availability of people, maybe the services industry can't respond as fast. Can you just walk us through how you would see a scenario, if oil goes back to $55 tomorrow, like how does that play out for EOG?","William R. Thomas - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","David, we're set up tremendously well. Of course, we're going to have a very large, very high-quality DUC inventory. We have rigs in place, and we have a substantial amount of frac spreads running. We delayed the work schedule on some of the frac spreads to maybe five days a week instead of seven days a week type scenarios, so that we could keep a number of frac spreads in place that would be easy to accelerate.","When the oil prices begin to recover, we're going to be disciplined going forward. We don't \u2013 obviously don't want to be fooled again, like the industry was fooled last year by a little bit of an uptick in oil price and it is not sustainable. So, we're going to be disciplined and cautious going forward on ramping up capital until we're very much convinced that this is not a short-term uptick in the price, and that the market is more in balance, and that the price is more sustainable. But we think, obviously, EOG is in a fantastic shape to generate extremely strong \u2013 we're talking about triple-digit rates of return \u2013 as oil prices improve, and we have ability to grow oil when the time comes.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And then, if I think about it, I've asked a couple others the same question. But if I think about \u2013 if you make the decision tomorrow to add rigs, and obviously, with the DUCs, you can cover some of this gap. But how long \u2013 you say tomorrow, you say, let's add a rig. How long does it take before we see that production, given the laterals and pads and everything else? Is that a six month before you start to see that production in the numbers?","William R. Thomas - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","David, I'm going to ask Gary Thomas to give some color on that.","Gary L. Thomas - Chief Operating Officer","David, the benefit to EOG is having these. By end of year, we'll have 230 of these DUCs to complete.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Yes.","Gary L. Thomas - Chief Operating Officer","And with having those, and then having the number of frac fleets that we have currently that we could ramp up, as Bill was saying, besides being able to add, when you just start with the completion and bringing on, you can see a pretty substantial increase in volumes within three to four months. Now when you would just be starting grassroots with drilling rigs, it would be almost twice that long, like you're mentioning, the six months. It would be about half that time.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. No, that's helpful. Thanks for all the color.","Operator","Our next question is from Mike Scialla with Stifel.","Michael Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Maybe a follow-up to David's question, it sounded like you're not inclined to want to go back to growth mode unless you see a significant price increase. But looking at that inventory of 3,200 premium locations that generate a 30%-plus IRR with $40 oil, if it looks like that's all that we're going to get out of a recovery, would you go back to a growth mode, if that were the case?","William R. Thomas - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I think, Mike, that would give \u2013 $40 oil would give us obviously a bit more cash flow, but we would be certainly wanting to stay balanced, discretionary cash flow to CapEx. So that's really going to control the amount of growth that we have, and along with making sure that the oil price is really sustainable. So we can generate the returns, but the growth of the company will be regulated by, obviously, the number of wells we complete and the continued improvement we have, but it would be regulated by the cash flow of the company.","Michael Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. And then can you talk about in terms of that premium count, you said, Bill, that you could grow that over time. You alluded to how you would do that with better targeting. But I wanted to see where you anticipate if you can say where most of that will come from. Is it downspacing in the Eagle Ford? Is it primarily from the Permian or somewhere else?","William R. Thomas - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Mike, it will be from really multiple sources. We're learning in every one of the plays that we're in, and it's really just being able to identify those target windows within those good plays and then executing on those. So we were still working on downspacing in every one of the plays. So it will come from multiple plays, improving the inventory there to premium, and then it will come from new plays too. We have quite a bit of confidence that through our learning process on existing plays that we can identify very high-quality rock in emerging plays, and so we're actively engaged in buying acreage and testing wells in those too. So it will come from a multiple source.","Historically, even though the uptick when we had $90 \u2013 $95 oil and we were growing very quickly and drilling a lot of wells, we were able to add twice as many wells each year than what we actually drilled. And so we're very confident that we can continue that kind of multiple on the premium going forward.","Michael Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great, thank you.","Operator","And the next question is from Subash Chandra with Guggenheim.","Subash Chandra - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Good morning. Are we looking at a permanent shift to better wells but fewer wells, and how exacting your premium process is and how reliant it is on massive data analysis? And then I have a follow-up. Thanks.","William R. Thomas - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Certainly, when you're drilling twice as good a well, you don't have to drill nearly as many of them. And so that certainly helps keep your CapEx down and you're able to have a lot more efficiency there. So as we go forward, the learning process will be incremental in each one of these plays, and it's just an ongoing theme. We learn this and then we try it. And as we get good positive results, we're able to apply that to additional wells. And then the sustainable technology gains that we have in the company have been very, very continuous and very steady over the whole life of our involvement in horizontal drilling. It's over 10 years of experience, combined knowledge, and we have quite an innovative culture in the company. And we expect that to continue to improve the wells as we go forward.","Subash Chandra - Guggenheim Securities LLC","And the follow-up is, and no question, you're light years ahead in many ways. When we think about the additional inventory in that it's dependent on data that where you have more wells is likely where we'll see more inventory over time? And so the other side of that is how applicable is this to new exploration concepts?","William R. Thomas - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Correctly, when we have an ongoing drilling program and we're collecting data all the time in an existing play, that's certainly how you make advances. But we also are able to take that learning experience and apply it to new plays. So the high-density frac techniques, the kinds of rocks that would respond to high-density techniques, and then the petrophysical properties of rocks in emerging plays and then the core work where we do an extensive amount of very detailed core work, and we integrate all this data along with 3-D seismic. And so all that goes into bear on defining new plays with high-quality rock. And so it's a learning process that spills over, and it really helps us keep the momentum and to keep adding premium inventory as we go forward.","Operator","That concludes today's question-and-answer session. Mr. Thomas, at this time I will turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks.","William R. Thomas - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","EOG has got a strong track record of game-changing events that have made the company successful over time. Our shift to premium drilling mode this year with an estimated 50% year-over-year increase in well productivity is another step-change to the company's performance. Premium drilling allows EOG to generate solid capital returns at $40 oil, and quite frankly spectacular returns if oil prices recover. With our focus on improving returns instead of production growth during this down cycle, EOG is now positioned for tremendous performance as prices improve. We believe the best times for the company are ahead of us. So thank you for listening and thank you for your support.","Operator","This concludes today's call.

As a reminder, this call is being recorded.","And at this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of EOG Resources, Mr. Mark Papa. Please go ahead, sir.","Mark G. Papa","Good morning, and thanks for taking the time to join us on election day. We hope everyone has seen the press release announcing third quarter 2012 earnings and operational results.","This conference call includes forward-looking statements. The risks associated with forward-looking statements have been outlined in the earnings release and EOG's SEC filings, and we incorporate those by reference for this call. This conference call also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation schedules for these non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures can be found on our website at www.eogresources.com.","The SEC permits oil and gas companies in their filings with the SEC to disclose not only proved reserves but also probable reserves, as well as possible reserves. Some of the reserve estimates on this conference call and webcast may include potential reserves or other estimated reserves not necessarily calculated in accordance with or contemplated by the SEC's latest reserve reporting guidelines. We incorporate by reference the cautionary note to U.S. investors that appears at the bottom of our press release in Investor Relations page of our website.","With me this morning are Bill Thomas, President; Gary Thomas, Chief Operating Officer; Tim Driggers, Vice President and CFO; and Maire Baldwin, Vice President, Investor Relations. An updated IR presentation was posted to our website last night, and we included fourth quarter and updated full year 2012 guidance in yesterday's press release.","This morning, I'll discuss topics in the following order: I'll initially review our third quarter 2012 net income and discretionary cash flow. Then Bill, Thomas and I will provide operational results. Tim Driggers will discuss financials and capital structure. I'll then follow with our macro view, our preliminary 2013 business plan and concluding remarks.","As outlined in our press release for the third quarter 2012, EOG reported net income of $355.5 million or $1.31 per diluted share.","For investors who focus on non-GAAP net income to eliminate mark-to-market impacts and certain nonrecurring items as outlined in the press release, EOG's third quarter 2012 adjusted net income was $468.7 million or $1.73 per diluted share. Our third quarter non-GAAP earnings versus guidance was a result of a pleasant trifecta, higher oil volumes, higher oil price realizations and lower unit costs.","For investors who follow the practice of industry analysts who focus on non-GAAP discretionary cash flow, EOG's DCF for the third quarter was $1.6 billion.","I'll now address our operational results in key plays. For the third quarter, all 3 of our production components met or exceeded the high end of our guidance. Our total company crude oil and condensate production was up 42% year-over-year, and total liquids were up 40%. Total EOG production increased 12.4% year-over-year for the third quarter. North American gas was down 10% as predicted, but Trinidad gas increased 17% due to higher than expected contract takes.","I'll also note that essentially all of our unit costs were below midpoint projections and several, such as LOE and DD&A, were below the low point of our guidance range. The benefits of high volume growth on our unit cost is showing up in the numbers.","We're also pleased to note that our G&A per dollar of revenue is one of the lowest in the peer group.","As we did following both first and second quarter results, we are again increasing our full year total company liquids production growth target, this time from 35% to 38%, boosting our crude oil growth target from 37% to 40% and our NGL growth target from 31% to 33%. Our total company growth target has also increased from 9% to 10.6%. These increases are the result of continued outperformance from our top oil plays.","As we've repeatedly stated, we're not interested in growing hydrocarbon volume simply for the sake of, growth. In fact, we purposely shrunk our North American gas production for 4 straight years simply because it's a money loser. We are, however, very interested in growing our financial metrics, such as EPS, adjusted EBITDAX and DCF.","In the third quarter, our year-over-year increase in non-GAAP EPS was 108%, adjusted EBITDAX growth was 39% and DCF increased 37%. We believe we're one of very few large cap E&Ps who have shown a substantial increase in these financial metrics in both 2011 and 2012.","The biggest single driver for this growth in our financial metrics has been our high organic crude oil growth rate: 35% in 2010, 52% in 2011 and projected 40% this year in spite of $3.3 billion of total assets sales over the same period.","On a go-forward basis, we expect to continue to have the best organic oil growth rate of any large cap independent, although the year-over-year percentage numbers will be smaller as we become a large oil company.","I'll now discuss the plays driving our high organic crude oil growth rates, starting with the Eagle Ford. The play was again the biggest driver of our quarterly oil growth outperformance as it has been all year. We're the largest crude oil producer in the play with 109,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day net after royalty for the quarter, 75% of which was oil and 13% was NGLs.","I'll now discuss 4 key points regarding the Eagle Ford. First, during the August call, I may have caused a flurry of comments among sell siders when I mentioned that during the second quarter, we completed 16 monster wells, which I defined as having IPs between 2,500 and 4,800 barrels of oil per day plus gas and NGLs. This reflects the quality of our acreage plus our completion methodology.","During the third quarter, we added 12 additional monster wells, one of which, the Baker-DeForest Unit #4H, tested at 4,598 barrels of oil per day which -- with 4 million cubic feet a day of rich natural gas at a normal choke rate flowing into production facilities. We have 100% working interest in 10 of 12 of these monster wells, several of which are outlined in our press release.","Second, we have drilled in our flow testing several multi-well pilots spaced more densely than our current 65 to 90 acres spacing. We expect to have some spacing conclusions in the effect on the recovery factor from these pilots during the first half of 2013.","Third, the majority of our Eagle Ford crude is currently priced off an LLS premier market index, providing an advantage over WTI pricing. Additionally, with the cost advantage of our self-sourced frac sand and further efficiencies, our average well costs have been drifting back down towards our $5.5 million per well target instead of the $6 million I reported last quarter. Together, the LLS indexed oil price and the lower well costs have further improved the excellent economics of the play.","And fourth, we're currently running 20 rigs and expect to drill 320 net wells this year. Our current average drilling time has decreased to 13 days per well.","Overall, we've significantly slowed our total company capital activity to stay within our capital budget. We're currently running 52 rigs across the company compared to an average of 70 in the first half.","To even further slow capital activity, we've dropped the number of completion crews and the number of days per crew. This is the primary reason we expect fourth quarter total EOG liquid volumes to be slightly down from the third quarter. Besides, 40% year-over-year oil growth is plenty strong for a company our size. We have to catch our breath so we can come out of the starting gates strong in January.","I'll now turn it over to Bill Thomas to discuss other North American plays.","William R. Thomas","Thanks, Mark. We continue to be particularly upbeat about the Bakken and Three Forks potential on our acreage in the Williston Basin.","In the Bakken Core area, the 320-acre downspacing has proven to be successful, and 2 recent wells further confirmed the strength. The Fertile 46-1608H tested at 1,732 barrels of oil per day, with 90 barrels per day of NGLs and 363 Mcf per day of natural gas. The Fertile 47-712H (sic) [Fertile 47-0712H] tested at 1,258 barrels of oil per day, an  83 barrels per day of NGLs and 332 Mcf of gas. We have 92% and 78% working interest in these wells, respectively. We'll be testing 160-acre downspacing in the Core late this year, and we hope to have some results from our pilot waterflood project by February.","In the Antelope area, we're applying improved frac technology to our current well completions. We recently completed an outstanding Antelope Three Forks well, the Hawkeye 100-2501H, for 3,196 barrels of oil per day with 5.5 million cubic feet per day of rich natural gas. EOG has a 73% working interest of this well. Other recent Antelope wells are listed in the press release.","In 2003 to 2015, we plan to spend most of our North Dakota capital in these same 2 areas, primarily downspacing in the Bakken Core and further development of both the Bakken and Three Forks targets in the Antelope Extension area. We plan to develop our Bakken lot and Stateline areas in subsequent years.","Shifting our focus to the Permian Basin Wolfcamp and Leonard horizontal plays. We're seeing Wolfcamp results similar to previous quarters. But in the Southeast New Mexico Leonard, we're seeing improved results. We previously said the returns on these 2 plays were equal, but we now rate the Leonard above the Wolfcamp. The Wolfcamp well quality hasn't declined, it's just that the Leonard has improved.","Three recent Leonard wells, or the Diamond 8 Fed Com 3H, 4H and 5H, were tested at 962, 1,148 and 1,162 barrels of oil per day with approximately 1 million cubic feet of rich natural gas each. We have 90% -- 96% working interest in these wells.","Our press release, we have several recent Wolfcamp wells and we continue to feel comfortable with our 430 Mboe per well growth factor. Most of our Wolfcamp completions are in the middle zone, with several good wells noted in the press release. We completed the Mayer SL 513LH (sic) [Mayer SL #5013LH] in the lower Wolfcamp with an initial production rate of 1,290 barrels of oil per day with 946 Mcf per day of rich natural gas. We have 77% working interest in this well.","This is our first long lateral completion in the lower zone, and we're encouraged by the results. To date, we have completed 3 long laterals in the upper zones with mixed results.","We continue to evaluate the economic extent and productivity of the upper and lower zones across our acreage.","Overall, both the Wolfcamp and Leonard are good plays, but they are combo-type plays and are inherently less economic than the Eagle Ford and Bakken, which are black oil plays.","The same is true of the Barnett Combo, where results continued to be consistent with past quarters. The typical Combo well recovers 80,000 barrels of oil, 140,000 barrels of NGLs and 850 million cubic feet of gas gross for $3.4 million completed well costs and yields a 25% after-tax rate of return at current product classes. This year, we drilled a number of successful step-outs, extending the product -- productive acreage of the play.","In addition to these plays, we have smaller levels of horizontal activity in the Mid-Continent Powder River Basin in Southern Manitoba. Also, we continue to test new greenfield horizontal oil ideas in North America.","Now I'll turn it back to Mark.","Mark G. Papa","Thanks, Bill. Outside North America, we expect our 100% working interest East Irish Sea Conwy crude oil development project to start up in the second half of 2013.","In Argentina, our horizontal Vaca Muerta oil well yielded lower-than-expected results. The production results were similar to a nearby vertical well we had completed, indicating no multiplier effect for the horizontal versus the vertical. We're still evaluating results and plan to proceed cautiously during 2013.","In Trinidad, our third quarter gas takes were higher than expected due to incremental short-term market demands. There's nothing new to report on the Kitimat LNG project.","I'll now address 2 other EOG differentiators, oil margins and sand plants. You'll notice that for the third quarter, our U.S. crude oil price realization was $5.45 over WTI. Considering where our crude is produced, this is likely the most advantageous realization of any similarly situated company.","Our 2 biggest production areas are the Eagle Ford and Bakken. As I previously mentioned, our Eagle Ford crude is currently priced off on LLS index. In the Bakken, almost all of our crude plus some third-party crude is being railed to our St. James, Louisiana terminal and receiving LLS prices. Additionally, we're railing a portion of our Wolfcamp crude to Louisiana.","On the well cost side, our sand plants continue to function smoothly and provide the frac cost savings we've described in previous quarters.","EOG's success is based on a simple equation: higher crude oil volumes and higher crude oil price realizations combined with lower well and unit costs and less money-losing North American natural gas volumes equals more net income.","I'll now turn it over to Tim to discuss financials and capital structure.","Timothy K. Driggers","Thanks, Mark. Capitalized interest for the quarter was $12.7 million. For the third quarter 2012, total cash, exploration and development expenditures were $1.6 billion excluding asset retirement obligations. In addition, cash expenditures for gathering systems, processing plants and other property plant and equipment were $161 million.","Year-to-date total cash, exploration and development expenditures were $5.5 billion excluding asset retirement obligations. Cash expenditures for gathering systems, processing plants and other property plant and equipment were $477 million.","Acquisitions cost year-to-date totaled $435,000.","Through September 30, proceeds from asset sales were $1.2 billion. Our goal is to close on an additional $100 million prior to yearend for a total of $1.3 billion of asset sales for the year.","At September 30, 2012, total debt outstanding was $6.3 billion and the debt to total capitalization ratio was 31%. At September 30, we had $1.1 billion of cash on hand, giving us non-GAAP net debt of $5.2 billion for a net debt to total cap ratio of 27%.","The effective tax rate for the third quarter was 37%, and the deferred tax ratio was 52%.","Yesterday, we included a guidance table with the earnings press release for the fourth quarter and full year 2012. Our updated 2012 total CapEx guidance is approximately $7.6 billion excluding noncash items. For the fourth quarter and full year, the effective tax rate is estimated to be 35% to 40%.","We've also provided an estimated range of the dollar amount of current taxes that we expect to record during the fourth quarter and for the full year.","Now I'll turn it back to Mark.","Mark G. Papa","I'll now provide our views regarding macro hedging and concluding remarks.","Regarding oil, we think the current NYMEX plus $2 to $3 per barrel reasonably reflects likely 2013 prices. We continue to believe that U.S. shale oil won't flood the global market for the reasons I articulated on our previous earnings call. Likewise, we think any meaningful supply effect from shale oil outside North America is many years away and will be very slow to develop.","For the first half of 2013, we have 98,000 barrels of oil per day hedged at $99.39 per barrel. And for the second half, we have 68,000 barrels per day hedged at $99.45 per barrel.","We also have some options next year that may be exercised and would increase our hedge position by an average of 42,000 barrels of oil per day at an average price of $102.16.","Regarding gas, we expect 2013 prices will be better than 2012, but not good enough to provide a cost of capital full cycle return on North American gas well drilling. Our current 2013 hedge position is 150,000 mmbtu per day at $4.79 per mmbtu excluding unexercised options.","Please see the table that was included in our earnings press release for the details of our hedging contracts.","Now let me provide a brief outline of our 2013 business plan. As usual, we'll provide our specific 2013 plan with volumes, CapEx, et cetera, in our February call. But today, we can provide 4 directional guidelines.","First, we expect our overall 2013 CapEx to decline below 2012 levels, primarily because we've accomplished our goal of converting our dry gas resource play acreage to held by production status. This year, we spent roughly $700 million, primarily in the Haynesville, Marcellus and Horn River converting leases to held by production, and we expect to spend only about $100 million next year on dry gas drilling. This 2013 reduction in dry gas CapEx will also boost our 2013 overall reinvestment rate of return.","Second, our 2013 pattern of volume growth by product will continue to be dictated by returns, and the trend will be similar to the past several years. In 2013, we expect another peer-leading oil growth year, although the year-over-year percentage increase won't be as robust as in the past since we're becoming a bigger oil company. We expect decent year-over-year NGL growth, but a lower rate than our higher rate of return oil trajectory.","We also expect another year, our fifth year, of declining North American gas production since it's unprofitable. In Trinidad, we'll likely have flat year-over-year gas production since this year, we sold at close to maximum deliverability.","Third, in 2013, we'll continue to fund North American greenfield oil ideas, as well as concepts to improve recovery factors. Because NGL prices how weakened relative to oil, we'll likely shift capital from the Barnett and Permian Combo plays toward the Eagle Ford and Bakken.","And fourth, if one assumes that 2013 oil prices, WTI oil prices, average in the low 90s, then our preliminary plan of combined lower CapEx and increased oil volumes essentially shrinks our 2013 funding gap to a very manageable amount. This is important because for the past 3 years, one recurring theme from investors has been EOG's significant outspend of our organic cash flow, i.e., would we blow up our balance sheet while developing our oil reserves.","Today we sit at 27% net debt to total cap and A-, AAA credit ratings. And unless oil prices drop significantly, in 2013 we'll approach neutral from a cash flow versus CapEx point. Since our strong oil growth will continue past 2013, this cash flow versus CapEx trend is positive for 2014 and should potentially allow us to return more cash to stockholders post 2013.","Now let me conclude. In summary, I want to leave you with one thought. In this business, there continues to be a lot of hype. The advent of oil resource play has allowed many companies to talk about capturing billions of barrels of oil or billions of Boes as if they're talking about apples on a tree. Be careful of the hype. Go with the company that's putting the points on the board quarter-after-quarter, year-after-year, whether it's financial metrics or operational metrics, such as organic oil growth. Results matter and they're easy to measure.","Thanks for listening, and now we'll go to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll hear first from Pearce Hammond with Simmons.","Pearce W. Hammond - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","In the Eagle Ford and the Bakken, what inning do you think we are in regarding drilling efficiency improvements? Essentially, are there more substantial leads ahead in drilling efficiency?","Mark G. Papa","Yes, there are. To give you an idea, last quarter, we said that our average drilling comp is 14 days; this quarter, it's 13 days. And we're now -- some of our fastest wells, we're drilling in 8 days. So we have room to beat the 13-day average timeframe. If you would have asked me 18 months ago whether we'd be able to drill our fastest wells in 8 days, I would have frankly told you, no way. So I would expect that we're going to see further improvements over the next 12 months in the average time to drill the wells, which is going to give us a good chance to drive the average well cost down even further. I mean, right now, the direction we're seeing is the rig comps are trending down, some of the service costs are trending down. So I think that the average well cost of $5.5 million for 2013 is eminently achievable for our wells in the Eagle Ford. And that probably beats the industry average in the Eagle Ford by $2 million a well.","Pearce W. Hammond - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Great. And then a follow-up, in the Eagle Ford and the Bakken, do you think we're getting to a point of diminishing returns on the number of frac stages? Or do you think we will see the average number of frac stages per well gradually increase?","William R. Thomas","We're getting close. We've continued to increase the number of stages. We may do it slightly more here in 2013.","Mark G. Papa","Yes, I don't see us going doubling the number of frac stages over the next 2 or 3 years from where we are today, if that's the direction of your question, Pearce.","Operator","Next question will come from Leo Mariani with RBC.","Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I want to see if I can get a little bit more color on the rig drop that you talk about. You talk about going from 70 to 52 rigs here. Like in your slide deck, you mentioned going from 5 to 4 in the Wolfcamp and from 7 to 5 in the Bakken. But just a little bit more color on other areas that you've sort of dropped rigs. If you'd give us any kind of numbers around that, that'd be great.","Mark G. Papa","Yes. And let me kind of segue that into kind of the production targets that we've given you for the fourth quarter, specifically the oil production numbers. The simple way I'd explain it is, we've -- we spend about $6 billion through the first 3 quarters of the year, and we gave you an estimate that basically says we intend to spend about $1.6 billion in the fourth quarter. So we have very roughly a $2 billion a quarter run rate, and now we're telling you we're going to spend $1.6 billion in the fourth quarter roughly. And the growth rate of the company, the oil growth rate, I'd say, is very similar to a coin-operated machine. EOG right now is very similar to a coin-operated machine. You put dollars in, and you have 100% efficiency. There is no inefficiency due to exploration, and there is essentially no operational inefficiency. So our growth rate for the fourth quarter and -- is essentially going to be a function of how many dollars we spend. And that's why our growth rate in the fourth quarter is going to be less than it was in the first 3 quarters. And we basically are just curbing our spending to stay within our capital budget, and we're just slowing down pretty severely, really, in all of our plays. But the most severity is going to be in the Eagle Ford where we are cutting completion units, cutting rigs and just slowing the process down. So -- and I've also seen a couple early comments there on our -- where people are saying, \"Well, you're probably sandbagging on your oil volumes in the fourth quarter.\" I know we've beaten the volumes in the first 3 quarters on the guidance, but don't assume that we're sandbagging in the fourth quarter because we are putting the brakes on it quite hard on the CapEx spending. And frankly, I expect it will hit about the midpoint of our 8-K target for the fourth quarter on our oil volumes and not overachieve. It's not due to lack of prospectivity. It's not due to well quality. It's just flat due to a coin-operated machine that we're putting less coins in there in the fourth quarter.","Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","That's very helpful. I guess, can you maybe just kind of address how that might ramp up in the Eagle Ford? I mean, I guess, obviously, you're pulling back to stay within your budget this year. But if you do spend slightly less, and you're spending quite a bit less on gas, might you start ramping the Eagle Ford back up kind of next year? Just any color on sort of directionality and how to think about that?","Mark G. Papa","Yes, the directionality is, what we intend to do, specifically in Eagle Ford is, the last 2 weeks in December, we are going to start dropping coins back in the machine at a pretty heavy rate. And it's not going to show up in any December volumes, but it's going to give us a headstart in January. It will start showing up in early January volumes. And we've got this ground into our numbers. So our intention is, is to get a pretty fast start out of the gate in early January. So I wouldn't -- don't assume that because we're losing momentum in the fourth quarter, that loss of momentum is necessarily going to carry over into the first quarter of 2013. We are adjusting for that, and we'll be reversing that momentum in December. And it should show up in the January volume numbers.","Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","All right. That's really helpful. And I guess in terms of the Eagle Ford, it looks like your step-out wells away from Gonzales County were really strong in this quarter. I know that you had kind of said that the overall average in the play may be lower. We've had a lot of wells that are 700,000, 800,000 Boe in around Gonzales, but it looks like they're pretty strong. Is this kind of maybe biased, the EUR is up a little bit in Eagle Ford?","Mark G. Papa","Yes, are you talking about the wells in the West there, Leo, that we highlighted on that map?","Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Yes. The LaSalle and McMullen stuff that you guys have announced.","Mark G. Papa","Yes, yes, yes, the -- I would still say that the direction that we hope to be heading with the downspacing, if the downspacing's successful, is more likely to be that we end up with more locations at the 450 Mboe net reserve average as opposed to increasing the 450 Mboe average. So although certainly in certain areas, the wells are greater than 450 Mboe. But what we would hope the downspacing does for us is give us more locations with an overall aggregate average of 450 Mboe as opposed to raising that average across the entire acreage block. And that's what we hope the outcome is sometime in the first half of next year. And where we stand on the downspacing is we've got multiples, tighter spacing pilots than the 65 to 90 acres already drilled. We have initial tests on those tighter spacing pilots. They look good. And what they need now is time. We just need some time to observe the performance of those tighter spacing pilots to just see how they do and then cross check them against our computer models. And that's the phase where in now, it's just the -- some time to watch the production history on these tighter pilots.","Operator","We'll now hear from Brian Lively with Tudor, Pickering.","Brian Lively - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Mark, the operating results this quarter were substantially better than the expectations you laid out in Q2. Just curious on the LOE side, could you kind of bucket some of the categories where you're seeing the biggest improvements?","Mark G. Papa","Yes, Gary?","Gary L. Thomas","Yes. We're seeing improvement in our SWD, salt water disposal, disposal because we've spent some money and facilities installing additional SWD takeaway. And also, yes, we've made some improvements on chemicals. And it's just kind of across the board, just working all of our efficiencies on lease operating expenses.","Brian Lively - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","So there's really no reason to not think that those cost improvements will continue to get better and at least stay the same through 2013?","Mark G. Papa","Yes, we should see that. We're -- if you check the 8-K, we're forecasting them to go up a bit in the fourth quarter, that's weather-related, particularly for the North Dakota side where you get this snow issues and things like that. But directionally, particularly on the oil side, as you look at the full year 2013, we expect to have another year of robust oil growth. I think you're going to see the unit cost trending in a good direction.","Brian Lively - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just for my follow-up question, Mark, you made a comment about in 2014 hoping to return more cash to shareholders. Implication there is you expect to be free cash flow positive. I just wonder if you could put some more color around your expectations. I know we're not even at 2013 yet, but in terms of the free cash flow generation as you get into 2014.","Mark G. Papa","Yes. The overall point I wanted to make is, I consider 2013 to be kind of an important year because really for the previous 3 years, we have clearly been fighting a large kind of a chronic organic free cash flow deficit each year. And it has been a shareholder concern issue. And 2013, I think, as long as oil prices are in the low 90s for WTI, I think we are finally going to free ourselves from that burden. And then as you project 2014, 2015, 2016, we're still going to have, I believe, peer-leading large cap group oil growth during those timeframes. And it's going to put us in a position where we're going to have flexibility to do some things that we haven't been able to do in the past, such as consider more significant dividend increases, consider accelerating our oil growth by additional CapEx increases if we wanted to. It certainly would put us in a position where we don't have to sell properties or possibly even buying in shares. So what I just wanted to note is that the one shareholder concern that people have had the last 3 years about us, in my opinion, is going to go away starting next year, and it's going to turn into a positive starting in 2014.","Operator","Our next question will come from Arun Jayaram with Credit Suisse.","Arun Jayaram - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I just wanted to talk to you maybe bigger picture. Obviously, you have a giant resource here in the Eagle Ford. You've talked about 1.6 billion, 1.7 billion barrels of reserves. I just wanted to see if you could provide us on longer term thoughts on how you milk the cow, so to speak, or to develop this resource to maximize value. You've been running this year a little bit more than 300 well completions. Do you plan to accelerate that, Mark? Or how do you think that it's -- that's fit to develop this in terms of a well count?","Mark G. Papa","Yes, and it kind of gets into our 2013 kind of capital allocation situation. The first thing we have to do is get a handle on what is the true resource here. Is it 1.6 billion barrels as it currently stands, which is our 65 and 90 acre spacing? Or is it some other number depending on what our spacing tests show. So that's kind of job 1, and we think we'll have that answer, as I mentioned earlier, within 6 months. And then based on that, then we decide how -- what's the most intelligent way to develop this thing. But I will say the direction for 2013 is to -- we are more likely to attempt to accelerate development above the 320 well level as opposed to decelerate the development below the 320 well level in 2013, assuming oil prices stay at current levels.","Arun Jayaram - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Right. Interesting. And then the reduction in year-over-year CapEx, is that just from rig efficiencies or completion efficiencies, plus a little bit less spending on gas, plus maybe less infrastructure spending? Is that fair?","Mark G. Papa","Yes. I mean, the direction I could give you is, and without trying to give you the exact numbers, but we're -- it's kind of like filling the pieces, we're telling you we're spending $7.6 billion this year. And if you say we spent $700 million on dry gas this year and we're going to spend $100 million next year, that ought to give you a pretty good direction on what we are thinking at this point in time our CapEx is going to be for next year. That's all I'll say about it at this point. But you can kind of fill-in the blanks there.","Arun Jayaram - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","That's very helpful. And last question, Mark, obviously, the returns have gone down as you frontloaded spending in your oil plays. And obviously, given the high reinvestment opportunities in the Eagle Ford, high return opportunities, your returns should rise over time. I guess, as you think about the longer term focus on growing your returns, do you -- where does EOG stand in terms of adding 1 or 2 more unconventional plays? Where are you in that process?","Mark G. Papa","Yes, well, again, our position is different than most peer companies. Most peer companies, when they -- it seems like, to me, when they acquire acreage on a potential new play, they make a big announcement about it often before they even drilled the well. And our position is just the opposite. Whenever we have a play that we have confirmed through multiple wells that works and whenever we've tied up whatever acreage level we want, that's the first time you'll hear about our greenfield play. And so, we're working on multiple ones, and the first time you hear about it is when we have everything tied up as closely -- as tightly as we can. So we're not going to give you an indication of any timeframe or anything related to them, other than to let you know we're working on some.","Operator","Now we'll take a question from Brian Singer of Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","There's a glass half-empty and a glass half-full way of looking at your guidance here. The glass half-full way is you're disciplined in spending, building a backlog of uncompleted wells, particularly in the Eagle Ford where we should see a sharp step-up as you reengage completions in the first half. And the glass-half empty way, maybe, okay, $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion in CapEx per quarter would drive lower oil productions, so therefore, your maintenance costs to just have flat production would be higher than $1.6 billion a quarter. Can you just address these, how you think about that backlog shift and what you think is closer to reality?","Mark G. Papa","Well, in general terms, I'd say that you'd be a pessimist to say a glass half-empty view of EOG's earnings report. I'd say that the previous quarter and this quarter, we've pretty much blown the doors off the earnings, particularly relative to most peer companies. So I'd -- in a polite way, I say I reject the glass half-empty view. So we have the advantage of having a -- the poker hand and looking at our cards for 2013. And what I can tell you, Brian, is I like the hand we have that we're playing for 2013. I wouldn't change it with anybody else's hand. I feel pretty comfortable. I would tell you, frankly, that the only thing that can sink the EOG's ship in 2013 is a disastrous decline in crude oil prices, and that's why we've hedged reasonably aggressively for 2013. So absent the major collapse in crude oil prices, what I would predict is that if you like what you saw of EOG in 2012, you're going to like 2013 from EOG. So that isn't a direct answer to your question, but I hope it gives you a feeling of the confidence that I have in our 2013 story.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That's great. And then separately, can you give us any additional color on some new venture areas, maybe your thoughts on the Pearsall Tuscaloosa Marine Shale and whether we should expect you to consummate any new joint ventures as you've kind of talked to a little bit before, either in some of these new venture areas or in less Core plays?","Mark G. Papa","Yes. I would say, in the Tuscaloosa Marine Shale, the only reason we even came public on that was that a trade magazine had basically tracked our acreage position there and published it in a trade magazine. And so, the current status of that is, probably on the next earnings call, we will have a report from our first well. We have drilled a horizontal well and we'll be frac-ing it soon. And so we'll have some data on it, and of course, we're in a joint venture on that. And we'll just see what the results are. And in the Pearsall, we are aware that the Pearsall zone exists below the Eagle Ford on portions on our acreage. Frankly, we are not as enthusiastic regarding the Pearsall as some other companies are. And so, you don't see any advertisements in any of our books trumpeting the Pearsall. And so at this stage, we're not thinking that the Pearsall is going to be the next big huge stealth play for EOG.","Operator","Now moving on to Biju Perincheril with Jefferies.","Biju Z. Perincheril - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Just a couple of questions. In the Eagle Ford, if you are targeting something more than 320 wells next year, does that mean rig count going back up to sort of high-20s? Or are we looking at something lower because of the efficiency gains you've already achieved there? And also, can you give us some color on the completion increase, how many earning you are running earlier and what the current number is?","Mark G. Papa","Yes. On the first question there on how many rigs we might run next year in the Eagle Ford again, I don't want to get too specific on there. But, I mean, we'd -- based on the efficiencies we're seeing in the days per well and the reduction in days per well, I mean, we might be in the range of 25 rigs next year or something like that. It doesn't look like it's going to be in the high-20s or anything like that for the Eagle Ford in there. And the completion crews, I think we're running 4 right now completion crews. And I don't have right now what number we would be running to for next year in terms of it. But like I say, in our next quarter, we'll be giving you a specific well count as to how many wells we would intend to drill in the Eagle Ford, and we can give you specifics on the completion crews and exactly how many rigs we would intend to run, as well as the Bakken, Three Forks, well count in the Wolfcamp and so on and so forth. So we're not trying to be evasive, but February is the time when we provide those level of specifics, and we'll give it to you at that time.","Biju Z. Perincheril - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay, no, that's very helpful. And then, if I look at your current Eagle Ford production, it looks like roughly cash flow neutral if I look at the activities this year. First of all, is that a fair assessment? And when I think about longer term development in the Eagle Ford, is it fair to think that you will keep activities up, sort of more or less match cash flows there?","Mark G. Papa","Yes. Your first part of that statement is correct that in rough terms, we're roughly cash flow neutral currently in the Eagle Ford. As far as on a go-forward basis, we don't look at just the Eagle Ford in terms of, did our -- our plan would be to run the Eagle Ford 2013 or 2014 on a cash flow neutral basis. We -- our decision on what we do with the Eagle Ford on a go-forward basis is going to be more a function of what we think the true total reserves are in the Eagle Ford and what are our alternative investment opportunities and what's the reinvestment rate of return in the Eagle Ford versus other areas. So it's -- we don't look at it just on Eagle Ford alone, really, Biju.","Biju Z. Perincheril - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","And one more question, if I could. Some of your peers have talked about a restricted choke program in the Eagle Ford, and maybe that's yielding higher EURs. If that's something you've tested, any plans to test that? And does the efficacy of a program like that depends on the gas-oil ratio?","Mark G. Papa","Yes. The -- all this stuff about -- the stuff about what size choke and people producing in a link to the EURs, we probably have more knowledge, I mean, than any company, certainly on the Eagle Ford oil production than anybody. And what we have found is that the higher the gas-oil ratio, the more sensitivity the choke management -- the more important the choke management is. For example, in the Haynesville and in our Barnett Combo, we actively pursue choke management, and we are looking at, right now, choke management for our Wolfcamp areas. In the Eagle Ford, in the position where our acreage is, which is the black oil area or the area where we fortunately have very high oil portions of the mix, the choke management is not very important. Where other companies have acreage, where they have higher gas-oil ratios, the choke management may be important to ultimate recoveries. But we can't speak about their positions and whether choke management works or doesn't work on their acreage. What we can say is that on our acreage, choke management, in our opinion, is not that critical to EURs. And that's because we have the preferred acreage, frankly. It's just more oily. So that would be our response to that issue.","Operator","Next question will come from Charles Meade with Johnson Rice.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","I wanted to go back to those Baker-DeForest wells in the Eagle Ford that you announced this morning. Could you tell us where on that 65- to 90-acre spacing range those wells are? And more generally, when you have those monster wells, are they more likely to be on tighter spacing, reflecting more oil in place? Or are they more likely to be on a wider spacing, reflecting more conductivity and better fracs?","Mark G. Papa","Yes. Those probably -- the Baker-DeForest wells, I don't have the exact numbers, but they would be on the tighter spacing areas. I can't tell you whether they're on 65 or 90, but I would say they're probably closer to the 65- than the 90-acre spacing in terms of that. So what -- all -- essentially, all the 12 well -- monster wells that we would have related to you here in this particular quarter will be on pretty tight spacing on there. So it's -- what's happening is, it's -- the quality of acreage plus we're giving these wells larger fracs in terms of pounds of sand and number of stages relative to the fracs we would have given these identical wells, say, 12 or 18 months ago, and some other tweaks that are proprietary tweaks to the fracs. So those are the 2 things that are the keys to these monster wells.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","Great, that's great detail. And it sounds like there's just more oil in place, and so there's just more to come out there.","Mark G. Papa","Yes. And it's just a more effective stimulation than we would have given to these high oil-in-place areas even a year ago or 18 months ago.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","Got it. And then one quick follow-up. Going -- on the Bakken, going back to your comments, I think they were on the -- your last earnings call when you talked about the response of the original offset wells to the downspacing, the subsequent downspacing, that when you put a frac in, you saw that sustained response in the original well. Is there any update that you can offer on that, whether you've seen that -- whether you've seen that sustain in wells or whether you've seen that replicated in new areas as you've downspaced?","Timothy K. Driggers","Yes, Charles. We do continue to see that in our downspacing, like in the Fertile wells that are on -- that are in the press release. When we do the aggressive fracs, and we've been working on our frac technology in the Bakken, as well as we have in the Eagle Ford, and we're making really good progress there. So when we do the more aggressive fracs in the downspacing, we do see response from the offset -- the older offset wells. So they -- generally, they come up and they kind of double in production. And then they go on a decline and, eventually, they'll get back on the original curve that they were on, but there is some -- certainly some additional reserves in oil that we're contacting with these more aggressive fracs. So we're really pleased that our Bakken results are certainly improving because of the frac technology in the downspacing.","Operator","It looks like we have time for one final question, that will come from Bob Brackett with Bernstein Research.","Bob Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Quick question, what assets are relying on salt water disposal that you'd mentioned earlier on the LOE comments?","Gary L. Thomas","That's principally the Bakken.","Bob Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. And then the other, crude-by-rail, what role do you think that ultimately plays? Is that something that simply is run until pipelines come into place? Or is that something that's going to be ongoing as part of the mix forever? And what's the payout period on those crude-by-rail facilities?","Mark G. Papa","Yes, Bob, I really think that crude-by-rail is going to be around for a long time in EOG's system. I think the lag time on getting pipelines built is really something like 5 to maybe 8 years. So it's -- the crude-by-rail is not just to stop gap measure, in my opinion. In other words -- and I see the crude-by-rail destinations perhaps changing 3 years, 5 years from now, such that perhaps Louisiana is not the optimum destination to deliver the crude to depending on what market conditions are at that point in time there. So but I would guess that 5 years from now, 10 years from now, crude-by-rail is still a significant kind of a market uplift for EOG's crude marketing. And did you have a second part to the question there?","Bob Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Yes. What's the sort of payback period on a loading terminal?","Mark G. Papa","There, at least in EOG's experience so far, it's in months rather than years.","Operator","And that's all the time we have for questions. I'll turn the call back over to Mark Papa for any further remarks.","Mark G. Papa","Okay. Thanks, everyone, for listening.

As a reminder, this call is being recorded.","At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Chief Financial Officer of EOG Resources, Mr. Tim Driggers. Please go ahead, sir.","Timothy K. Driggers - EOG Resources, Inc.","Thank you. Good morning. Thanks for joining us. We hope everyone has seen the press release announcing third quarter 2017 earnings and operational results. This conference call includes forward-looking statements. The risk associated with forward-looking statements have been outlined in the earnings release and EOG's SEC filings, and we incorporate those by reference for this call. This conference call also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation schedules for these non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures can be found on our website at www.eogresources.com.","The SEC permits oil and gas companies in their filings with the SEC to disclose not only proved reserves but also probable reserves as well as possible reserves. Some of the reserve estimates on this conference call and webcast may include potential reserves and other estimated reserves not necessarily calculated in accordance with or contemplated by the SEC's reserve reporting guidelines. We incorporate by reference the cautionary note to U.S. investors that appears at the bottom of our press release.","Participating on the call this morning are Bill Thomas, Chairman and CEO; Gary Thomas, President and Chief Operating Officer; Billy Helms, EVP, Exploration and Production; David Trice, EVP Exploration and Production; Lance Terveen, Senior VP, Marketing Operations; Sandeep Bhakhri, Senior VP and Chief Information and Technology Officer; David Streit, VP, Investor and Public Relations.","An updated IR presentation was posted to our website yesterday evening and we included guidance for the fourth quarter and full year 2017 in yesterday's press release. This morning, we'll discuss topics in the following order: Bill Thomas will review third quarter highlights, followed by operational results from Gary Thomas, David Trice and Billy Helms. I will discuss EOG's financials and capital structure, and Bill will provide concluding remarks.","Here's Bill Thomas.","William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.","Thanks, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone. EOG is focused on returns. We demonstrate that focus in the third quarter. We added two new premium oil plays, continued cost reductions and delivered strong well performance. The Woodford oil window in the Anadarko Basin and the First Bone Spring in the Delaware Basin add 800 premium drilling locations and 750 million barrels of oil equivalent resource potential net to EOG.","As a reminder, for a well to be classified premium, it must have an after-tax rate of return of 30% or greater at $40 oil. Combined with additions made earlier in the year, we have increased our premium inventory by 2,000 locations, which is four times as many wells as we planned to complete in 2017. EOG continues to improve both the size and the quality of its inventory, organically adding better and better locations, substantially faster than our drilling pace.","Strong operational execution was also highlighted from the quarter. We exceeded all our production targets and we delivered beyond expectations across all per-unit costs: LOE, transportation expense and DD&A. Our 2017 plan is coming together nicely. We're on target to deliver 20% oil growth and pay the dividend all within cash flow.","This morning, I'd like to take a moment to discuss EOG's multi-basin premium portfolio. As we've discussed many times before, the most important point to understand about exploration is that not all rocks are equal. Every play has geologic sweet spots, with superior rock quality that drives well productivity.","We do not want to own the whole play. Our focus is to capture only the best rock in the best plays. We did that in the Bakken in 2005, we did it again in the Eagle Ford in 2009, and last year we solidified sweet spot acreage in the Delaware and Powder River Basin with the Yates acquisition. Our ability to identify and capture the best rock is the major reason EOG wells consistently outperform the industry in productivity and returns.","With the addition of the Woodford oil window in the First Bone Spring, our premium inventory now totals a massive 8,000 crude oil drilling locations contained in geologic sweet spots across all six major horizontal oil plays. We don't think there's another company in the U.S. with comparable assets. Specifically, the enormous size and quality of EOG's premium inventory. This premium inventory will fuel EOG's industry-leading returns for many years to come.","The diversity of our portfolio is a powerful competitive advantage with multiple benefits. One is that single-basin risk is minimized. EOG is active across multiple basins, therefore, temporary conditions in a single basin, such as market tightness or weather event will have limited impact on our performance. Additionally, EOG's diverse multi-basin portfolio allows the company to grow each asset at the optimum pace to maximize its profitability and long-term value. Each play is unique and has a technical and cost optimization learning curve. It's easy to go too fast and potentially risk the long-term value of asset.","There are two other points I want to drive home this morning. First is that our decentralized structure was instrumental to accumulating the premium portfolio we have today, and will continue to be critical to our success in the future. We have seven teams operating in North America. These are dedicated individual offices covering every major basin and specializing in each play. That means seven prospect-generating machines and seven cost-savings idea teams, focused team dedicated to each asset armed with our powerful information technology, drive down costs, increase well productivity and maximize the value of each play.","Exploring rock and developing wells in multiple diverse basins means generating multiple sets of diverse data. While each play is unique, geologic learnings and technical innovation often transfers to other plays and in turn accelerates the pace of learning across all basins.","The final point I want to make is that since our formation, EOG has been a return-incentivized company. Last quarter, we discussed EOG's history of disciplined, return-based capital allocation. The capital discipline this company has demonstrated since its founding is driven by a transparent return-based incentive structure that runs through the entire organization. Evidence of that discipline can be calculated directly from our financial statements as return on capital employed. Our historic ROCE performance averages over 13%.","Return-based decision-making is the reason we initiated our premium strategy last year. Rather than patiently wait for commodity prices to improve and allow the cycle to drive our profitability, we permanently redefined our investment hurdle rate and reset the company to be successful in a low commodity price environment.","EOG's ability to capture the best rock in multiple plays is the core reason we have been able to permanently shift to premium drilling. We believe our drilling inventory is the largest and highest quality in the U.S., and it's the reason we're able to grow U.S. oil production this year by 20% and cover the dividend all within discretionary cash flow. Most importantly, our diverse and industry-leading acreage positions are the reason we are generating the best reinvestment returns among our peers.","Now I will turn it over to Gary Thomas to discuss our third quarter production and cost achievements in more detail.","Gary L. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.","Thank you, Bill. In the third quarter, Hurricane Harvey presented EOG with a first of its kind operational challenge, one that our decentralized, multi-disciplined teams in Corpus Christi and San Antonio did an excellent job tackling. Our largest concern was the safety of our employees and facilities, and I'm happy to report we experienced no major damage or environmental incidence related to the storm. I want to thank and congratulate our employees in Corpus Christi, San Antonio and Houston for their exceptional performance during a very difficult time.","During the third quarter, there were a few notable achievements to highlight. Time is money and our teams continue to reduce drilling and completion time in every play. After 10 years of drilling Eagle Ford wells, we reduced spud to TD time another 5% this year and in our newer Delaware Basin place, the wells are being drilled in 15% less time.","The DD&A rate continued to decline coming in below the low end of our targeted range. The benefits of ongoing operational efficiencies, record low finding and development cost and the addition of premium well reserves are beginning to show up in our financial performance.","Per-unit LOE beat expectations despite the double impact from Harvey of both cleanup and repair cost and curtailed production. As noted in the 8-K we issued September 5, the production impact of Harvey on all our oil volumes was about 15,000 barrels oil per day during the quarter. With a few adjustments to our completion schedule, we expect to offset the production impact in the fourth quarter. To accommodate the new schedule, we were able to secure additional completion crews and based on their performance and tightness in that market, we elected to tie up those crews for the remainder of this year. This was a performance and rate of return decision. As a result, we're completing approximately 25 additional wells bringing the total to 505 net completed wells for 2017.","Due to the timing of the additional 25 wells late in the year, there will be a limited impact on our volumes for the full year. We now have 28 rigs working and we have the best performing services EOG has ever assembled. We do not want to release any of these top-tier service providers. The additional rigs and crews give us a head start as we plan for 2018.","Due to the stellar cost savings and efficiencies gained throughout this year, we don't need to change our capital guidance. However, it is likely we will spend towards the high end of the range. EOG is one of the few E&P companies with the ability to commit capital right now, and as a result, we are securing favorable pricing agreements. We've locked in a major portion of services and suppliers to further lower cost and improve our returns in 2018.","Next up is David Trice with the exciting news about our new Oklahoma play.","David W. Trice - EOG Resources, Inc.","Thanks, Gary. This morning we introduced a new premium oil play in the Eastern Anadarko Basin. Located primarily in McClain County, Oklahoma, adjacent to the gas condensate plays properly known as the SCOOP and the STACK, the Woodford oil window is a black oil play with a concentrated sweet spot of high quality rock. Our discovery of the Eastern Anadarko-Woodford oil play is a great example how EOG's decentralized structure is a perfect fit for exploration-driven organic growth. Our team in Oklahoma City identified the potential of this area based on historical log and production data and began leasing in 2013.","We accumulated our 50,000 net acre position at an average cost of just $750 per acre. Over the last four years, we collected additional data through vertical logs, core and 3D seismic to delineate the sweet spot. We were then able to compare and model this data against the vast amount of proprietary data collected in other EOG plays to determine the viability of the Woodford oil window as a premium play.","Similar to the Eagle Ford, the Woodford is a shale play with very good rock quality and fairly consistent geology. We completed three horizontal wells in the Woodford oil window and applied EOG's refined targeting techniques and EOG-style completions to confirm the premium return potential of the play.","The Curry 21X #1VH, which IP-ed in August, was the third well drilled and had the longest lateral at 10,500 feet. Data collected on the first two wells was used to dial in the correct target before drilling the two-mile Curry well. The average 30-day initial production was over 1,700 barrels of oil equivalent per day, while the 60-day average is holding up at over 1,600 barrels of oil equivalent per day with an oil cut of 85%. The relatively low decline is evident in the performance of all three wells drilled and speak to the premium rock quality of this sweet spot.","Based on analysis of publicly available production data, we believe that the Curry is potentially the most prolific horizontal Woodford oil well drilled to-date in Oklahoma. Furthermore, the NPV on the Curry well, using the current strip, is about $10 million. So we've essentially paid for a quarter of the entire play's acreage cost with this one well.","We currently estimate that EOG's position in the Woodford oil window will support 260 premium locations using 660 foot spacing. The estimated ultimate recovery is 1 million barrels equivalent per well on a gross basis and 800,000 net after royalty for a total estimated resource potential of 210 million barrels of oil equivalent, 70% of which is oil. To reiterate what Bill said earlier, we are not interested in leasing entire plays, but instead. we are focused on leasing the geologic sweet spots at low acreage costs to maximize long-term ROCE growth.","The Woodford oil window in the Eastern Anadarko Basin is a perfect example of this strategy. Within EOG, all projects compete for capital, based on returns, and the Woodford oil window is more than competitive with the rest of EOG's premium inventory on a rate of return and NPV basis.","Billy Helms will now tell you about the new First Bone Spring play in the Delaware Basin and provide an update on the Eagle Ford.","Lloyd W. Helms, Jr. - EOG Resources, Inc.","Thanks, David. Our 2017 development plan in the Delaware Basin has been focused on increasing our understanding of the geological complexities of the various target intervals, testing spacing patterns and delineating our acreage position. As a result, we are providing our initial assessment of yet another target, the First Bone Spring sand. After 15 successful tests across our position, we have the confidence to define the net resource potential of 540 million barrels of oil equivalent from 555 locations, of which 540 remain to be drilled.","The seven wells completed in 2017, span a distance of 30 miles and produced on average 1,825 barrels of oil equivalent per day, with initial oil cut of 66% over the first 30 days. For the play, a typical well will target 7,000 foot laterals with a well cost of $7.3 million. We estimate that EUR for a 7,000 foot lateral in the First Bone Spring sand is 1,185,000 barrels of oil equivalent, gross, and 975,000 barrels equivalent net after royalty.","The oil cut through the producing life of the well is estimated at 55%. It is important to point out that all the wells in our resource estimate meet or exceed our initial premium rate of return hurdle and will compete for capital with the rest of the Delaware Basin program.","Our technical team in Midland has defined multiple horizons across our acreage position and used the latest interpretation to geosteer the drill bit into the best target intervals. Targeting, along with our high-density completions, is yielding industry-leading performance, as evidenced in slide number 17 of our latest investor presentation. Our total Delaware Basin premium well inventory now stands at almost 4,700 locations, which represents over 25 years of drilling inventory at our current pace of development.","For the third quarter, we completed 22 wells in the Wolfcamp Oil and Combo plays. All of the active areas continue to meet or exceed our expectations for both well performance and reserves. Out of the third quarter activity, I would like to highlight a three-well package drilled in Southern Lea County. The Antietam wells are 660 feet apart and average 30-day IPs of 2,725 barrels of oil per day each from laterals that averaged about 7,000 feet.","This year has been another stellar year for the Delaware Basin team, as we explore and define the potential of this target rich area. We are advancing our development plans to address the well spacing and timing needed to maximize the net present value of this asset. We have over a decade of experience with large horizontal programs and we use this knowledge to address the challenge of developing this multi-target inventory.","Once again, our culture and decentralized organization allow our technical teams to focus on these challenges in order to maximize the recovery and the economics of our acreage. We are excited about the tremendous potential we see in the basin.","The Eagle Ford continues to be a consistent source for delivering both production volumes and economic reserves. In the third quarter, the average 30-day initial oil production rate from the 44 wells completed was about 1,340 barrels of oil per day, with an average well cost of $4.5 million. Acreage in the Eagle Ford is close to 99% held by production and our efforts are focused on maximizing the net present value of every acre through multi-well pad government with increasing lateral-lengths. The vast majority of the wells are drilled on larger multi-well pads which are well suited to the rigs and completion crews that allow for quick moves and efficient operations. In many of these drilling units, we are targeting additional pay intervals within the Lower Eagle Ford, as well as adding the Upper Eagle Ford where appropriate. As a result, we are harvesting more of the resource in each drilling unit and the productivity per well continues to deliver steady and predictable results.","The Angus pattern identified on slide number 33 of our investor presentation, is an example of the tightly spaced targeted development program that generated improved results with staggered 200-foot spacing.","Another important point to remember about EOG's Eagle Ford asset is its proximity to a higher priced market. All of the oil from the Eagle Ford receives LLS prices and typically trades at a premium to WTI. This provides a boost to the already premium results and with more than 2,400 premium locations remaining, the Eagle Ford will continue to be a solid foundation for EOG's success.","Now here's David, again, for a quick update on the Austin Chalk in Trinidad.","David W. Trice - EOG Resources, Inc.","Thanks, Billy. In the South Texas Austin Chalk we continue to drill very prolific and highly economic wells. We've delineated a sweet spot in Karnes County that consistently delivers premium well economics that compete handily with the rest of our portfolio.","In the third quarter, we completed eight wells in this sweet spot that delivered a 30 day average IP rate of almost 4,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day each from an average treated lateral of about 6,000 feet.","Well costs remain low, averaging under $4.5 million. The most impressive well during the quarter was the Elbrus Unit 103H whose 30-day IP exceeded 7,700 barrels of oil equivalent per day on a lateral length of only 3,700 feet. Incredibly, this well paid out in less than a month. Our exploration work in the South Texas Austin Chalk is focused on identifying additional sweet spots across our acreage. The play is geologically and stratigraphically complex and we expect our ongoing exploration efforts will take time.","In Trinidad, we've stepped up activity and continue to drill really good wells in the prolific shallow water reservoirs offshore Trinidad. We completed two wells during the third quarter in the Banyan and Osprey areas, each with initial production rates in excess of 30 million cubic feet a day of natural gas.","We expect to complete another three wells before the year is out and estimate that some of these wells have the potential to produce 100 billion cubic feet of gas over their economic life. This will allow us to maintain production in the years ahead and generate strong rates of return from this cash generating asset.","I'll now turn it over to Tim Driggers to discuss financials and capital structure.","Timothy K. Driggers - EOG Resources, Inc.","Thanks, David. We are maintaining our full year 2017 capital expenditure guidance of $3.7 to $4.1 billion. As Gary mentioned, we are more likely to be at the high end of the range in order to hold on to equipment and services as we prepare for 2018.","Total exploration and development expenditures for the third quarter were $1.1 billion including facilities of $147 million and excluding acquisitions, non-cash property exchanges and asset retirement obligations.","In addition, expenditures for gathering systems, processing plants and other property plant and equipment were $50 million. Capitalized interest for the third quarter was $7 million. During September, we repaid our $600 million 5.875% senior notes. At quarter-end, total debt outstanding was $6.4 billion for a debt-to-total-capitalization ratio of 31%. Considering $846 million of cash on-hand at September 30, net debt to total cap was 28%. In the third quarter of 2017, total impairments were $54 million. The effective tax rate for the third quarter was 31% and the deferred tax ratio was 175%.","Now I'll turn it back over to Bill.","William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.","Thanks, Tim. In closing, I will leave you with a few important points. Over the last few months, the investment communities' emphasis on capital discipline has certainly grown. I'll repeat what I said at the end of 2014 when the downturn began and what we have repeated virtually every quarter since. We are committed to returns, living within our means and maintaining a strong balance sheet. We believe production growth should be the result of investing in high-return drilling and have never been fans of outspending cash flow to pursue growth for growth's sake.","Second, we have become a permanently premium company. Our track record of adding premium-level inventory over the last two years is evident that our premium strategy is sustainable. Our premium resource potential now totals more than 7.3 billion barrels of oil equivalent in 8,000 locations. That's more than double the resource potential and more than double the locations from the start of 2016 when we introduced the premium strategy. Furthermore, we are still exploring, still improving existing plays, and we don't see any end to the opportunities to expand our portfolio further.","Third, the benefits of a diverse portfolio drive a real competitive advantage for EOG, a strong, stable growth profile that generates high returns and maximizes the value of each asset. It's difficult to sustain both high growth and high returns without the flexibility that multiple premium assets provide. With diverse assets, the result is a focused, disciplined, high-return road to growth.","And, finally, EOG is like the Houston Astros. We never give up. We are never satisfied. We never quit getting better. Quarter-by-quarter, we are adding low-cost premium wells to drive down our cost and deliver strong growth. Going forward, our return focus and sweet spot portfolio of assets, supported by a bottoms up, flat, decentralized organization will drive differentiated ROCE performance in the E&P space. Our number one goal is getting ROCE back to our historical average of 13%, or better. We believe this is the best way to create sustainable long-term shareholder value.","Thanks for listening. Now we'll go to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We'll take our first question from Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey. Good morning, guys.","William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.","Good morning, Evan.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey. Congratulations on the organic premium location additions. On the Woodford, what drove the timing of the reveal? I mean, is it that you believe you've acquired all you could? And you mentioned it as a sweet spot, yet how prolific or extensive do you see the Woodford with premium characteristics in the SCOOP?","William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.","Yeah. Evan, first of all, the Woodford play, we've got a lot of confidence in it. We drilled three wells, but we have a lot of data. And it's a pretty simple play with the modeling we've done and the analysis we've done and the history we have in shale plays. So I'm going to ask David to kind of expound on this and give you some, a little bit more color on the detail.","David W. Trice - EOG Resources, Inc.","Yes, Evan. Yes. Like Bill mentioned, the difference with the Woodford and some of the other plays is that the Woodford is a shale play. So it's fairly simple from a geological standpoint. And we started work in this area back in 2012, 2013 and had a pretty good idea that it could be premium and so we began collecting data. So we've got nearly 400 full petrophysical models built in and around our acreage that's tied to core data. And then what we've been able to do over the years drilling all of these horizontal oil plays is we've been able to collect the data and we've gotten very good at building some sophisticated reservoir models.","And so what we did on this particular play is we modeled it ahead of time. We took industry data. We took all the petrophysical models and compared it against, in this case, particularly the Eagle Ford. And compared the completions, versus the reservoir response. And so going into it, we felt very confident that we could make premium wells here in the Woodford. And so we were able to confirm that with the well results that we've had. And so we feel confident about the premium status of this. And then just the timing of it, it's pretty tightly held acreage in this part of the world so we felt comfortable going ahead and releasing the results on it.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Let me just follow up to your responses. I mean, is 50,000 acres sufficient to scale and develop?","David W. Trice - EOG Resources, Inc.","Yeah. I think just like we talked about in our prepared remarks, our focus is on identifying sweet spots and drilling sweet spots, but be that the Austin Chalk or the Woodford, we want to drill premium wells that are going to continue to lower our finding cost over time and increase our ROCE. So for us, I mean this is a \u2013 as a decentralized company it works really well. This is an instance, like Bill had said, where we can allocate capital to a different play and develop it at the appropriate speed. And so, yeah, we think it's sufficient scale.","Operator","We'll go next to Paul Sankey with Wolfe Research.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Hi. Good morning, everyone.","William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.","Good morning, Paul.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Bill, it's very impressive from a growth standpoint. I was wondering when will we get a bigger dividend? When are you going start growing the direct cash return to shareholders? Thanks.","William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.","Paul, the dividend is a very strong priority for EOG. We've increased the dividend 16 times in the last 17 years. And consistent with our commitment, our board continues to evaluate the business environment every quarter with the goal of returning cash to shareholders through the dividend and increasing that when appropriate. So that's very high on our list and we are evaluating it. And hopeful as the business environment proves to be stable and improving that we will continue to work on that.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Yeah. If I could just observe, it has to really be at least above the S&P 500 yield to be worth paying. I'm looking here at $100 million a quarter. It doesn't seem too onerous to at least double it. Bill, the other thing I'd like to ask you about is the scale of the company. How big, with all of the success that you're having geologically and operationally, how big \u2013 is there an optimal size at which you're going to have to perhaps think harder about disposals and taking stuff off the table as opposed to just adding and adding? Thanks.","William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.","I'll ask Billy Helms to talk about our divestitures.","Lloyd W. Helms, Jr. - EOG Resources, Inc.","Yeah. Paul, this is Billy Helms. I think, it's fair to keep in mind that all these plays we're adding are certainly premium quality, so they're adding to the high end of our portfolio, which we think adds to the net present value of the company. At the same time, we always managed the bottom end of our portfolio. If you look back over the last several years, we've sold over $6 billion of assets. And so that's not to be overlooked. It's a big part of managing our overall asset base and it's part of our long-term strategy to continue to do so. And every year fluctuates, depending on where that property is in the life cycle of its development and play. So it's something we constantly look at and evaluate and actually do each year.","Operator","We'll go next to Bob Morris with Citi.","Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you. You just addressed my question on effectively high grading the inventory with continuing to add to these premium locations which, congratulations by the way, on that. As you look at your opportunity for continuing to do that, I notice you continue to spend about $150 million a quarter on exploration. And with a lot of companies focusing on capital discipline and sort of turning to manufacturing mode, has that created more opportunity for you to identify further premium locations as others focus more on manufacturing and do you have the flexibility to look for new plays or repeatable type things like the Woodford that you announced this morning?","William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.","Yes, Bob. That is our focus, and that's the reason that we continue to have a very robust exploration effort. We don't need more locations. We just are looking for better locations and to be additive to the quality of our already high-quality inventory. So the two plays we talked about today, the First Bone Spring and the Woodford, already will fall in the upper part of our premium inventory. So they'll get more focus than some of the other even premium inventory we have in the company. So we believe \u2013 as we said, we've said many times before, the geology makes a huge amount of difference in the productivity of the wells. And we've had a two decade learning curve on horizontal technology and rock quality, and so we're going to continue to use that to increase the productivity of our wells and the plays that we're looking for. So we want to get better. We're never satisfied. And we see a lot of opportunity out there to continue to increase the quality of the plays we're in.","Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","That's great. My second question is you're one of the very few, if maybe only, companies that didn't add to hedges in the quarter and you're still very minimally hedged in 2018. What does that say, or how does that speak to your view on the commodity price and managing that?","William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.","Yes. Our view on the macro is we're, I think, certainly encouraged by the improving market conditions as we look forward. The market, obviously, is continuing to rebalance nicely. Inventories are moving towards the five-year average, and we are watching the market closely for opportunities. Now I'm going ask Lance to comment a little bit more on that.","D. Lance Terveen - EOG Resources, Inc.","Yeah. Bob, good morning. Really, as we think about it, we're going to stay poised. As Bill mentioned, inventories continue to draw globally, but also in the U.S. And then you look at the market, it's in backwardation, too, for WTI and Brent, so. Also, in our view, we think U.S. production hasn't been growing quite as prolific as what others have originally estimated. So as we look at those dynamics in the market, we're going to really stay poised here. And we've been disciplined since 2015, and we've been waiting for this turn. So we're going to continue to watch here going into 2018.","Operator","We'll go next to Leo Mariani with NatAlliance Securities.","Leo P. Mariani - NatAlliance Securities","Yeah. Hey, guys. Just quick question on the First Bone Spring here. Obviously, the Bone Spring has been a target for a number of years out there in the Permian Basin. You guys have been active drilling wells here for a little while. Was there some dramatic change that happened recently that caused you guys to kind of move this up into a premium position? Maybe you could just discuss that a little bit.","Lloyd W. Helms, Jr. - EOG Resources, Inc.","Yeah, Leo, is this Billy Helms. For the First Bone Spring, it's just yet another pay zone that we've been \u2013 certainly have been identified and we've been testing over the last several years. And most of our activity in the past year or two has been focused on, certainly, the Wolfcamp, which is highly prolific and we've got multiple zones there. We've also previously announced the Second Bone Spring's resource estimate. So this is just the next step.","The First Bone Spring is certainly a highly prolific and very competitive zone with those targets and we've now delineated the program with about 15 wells over a fairly extensive area and had confidence enough to come out and delineate the resource potential on our acreage there. So it was really just the next step in the evolution of the Delaware Basin.","Leo P. Mariani - NatAlliance Securities","Okay. That's helpful. I just wanted to kind of follow-up a little bit on some of the 30-day oil production rate data you guys provided in the third quarter. Just in the various different Delaware plays, Eagle Ford and DJ, just noticing that your 30-day oil rates, while still strong, were down a little bit from second quarter averages. Just wanted to see if there was anything in particular sort of driving that.","William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.","No, there's nothing out of the ordinary there. They vary from quarter-to-quarter based on lateral lengths and where we're drilling in each part of the play. There's no, really, distinct trend you can draw from it. It's kind of up and down a little bit every quarter. We are doing appropriate spacing tests, especially as we're pretty new in the Delaware Basin. And so that may affect volumes a little bit from quarter-to-quarter. And then the parts of the play vary quite a bit. So there's nothing unusual there. I wouldn't try to read anything in any of that that would be out of the ordinary.","Leo P. Mariani - NatAlliance Securities","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Operator","We'll go next to Doug Leggate with Bank of America.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Bill, I wonder if I could ask a slightly different question about the premium inventory. The Woodford, as it's disclosed, I mean, obviously great news, but it's 3% of your locations. The Bakken is now about 4% of your locations. And I guess my point is that is there a point on the line where you start to think about monetizing some of these high-quality smaller portfolio positions, given how long dated your premium location inventory now there's a cost of these (41:56). I'm wondering if there's another optimization decision to be had here as you bring these smaller assets into the portfolio?","William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.","Doug, the Woodford and the Bakken, you mentioned specifically, those would not be ones that we would think about monetizing at this point because, obviously the Woodford has got tremendous upside to it and is on the high end of our quality of the premium inventory, and we also believe the Bakken has too. It's still got a lot of upside. We have, as I said in the opening, that we captured the sweet spot there, and continue to think that there is quite a bit of additional premium drilling to go on both of those.","And so we like having multiple high-quality assets because it allows the company to increase capital or disburse capital with discipline. And it allows us to put to work capital with a lot of confidence that we can continue to have very, very strong returns and execute each one of those plays at the proper speed to maximize the NPV and the finding costs. And that is what really will drive the ROC improvements in company going forward.","And in each one of our plays, we have a slide in the slide deck, I believe it's slide 16 that shows you that the returns that we have in each one of our plays, if we drill premium wells, is very, very strong. And they're all fairly equal. And so that's the advantage of having multiple plays and having a decentralized organization that can focus, reduce the cost and improve the quality of wells at the same time and maximize the value of each one of them.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I know it's a bit of a stretch, but I think I wanted to just take your opinion on the portfolio high-grading. So my follow up, Bill, it seems the 15% to 25% at $50 to $60 with the well results you've had, it strikes us you can probably do that same range of growth at a lower oil deck. So I guess my question is as we see oil starting to get a little bit healthier at least in the out years, how would you think about incremental allocation of capital? Would it be the 15% to 25% is sacrosanct and anything beyond that goes back to shareholders or just how are you thinking about the upside case for production growth? And I'll leave it there.","William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.","If prices rise, obviously, our discretionary cash flow is very, very strong. It's increasing even if prices don't rise. So the first thing is, when we decide to reinvest additional cash we're going to do it with discipline. We're not going to sacrifice returns to grow faster. We only incrementally invest if our returns are equal or better. And, again, that is I think an advantage of multiple plays in a decentralized system that we have in place to execute that.","What I'd say the highest priority in the company is really to continue to reinvest in the premium inventory because we believe that's the best way to increase shareholder value. But we also want to continue to firm up the balance sheet and we want to work on that and getting our net debt down lower than what it is now. So that will be a priority.","And then the third thing, as I talked about already, is we have a very, very strong commitment to the dividend, so we want to continue to increase cash to the shareholders through the dividend going forward.","Operator","We'll go next to Scott Hanold with RBC.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yeah. Good morning. Could I ask a little bit more on the Woodford? You drew a box on your presentation of where you, I'll see that as perspective and marked it above 50,000 acres. Can you talk about the working interest you have in there? And do you expect \u2013 where do you expect that to go over time?","David W. Trice - EOG Resources, Inc.","Scott, this is David. Yeah. So far the wells we've drilled there in the Woodford, they've been very high working interest, probably close to 100%. I would think going forward right now, we're probably on average, it's going to vary quite a bit across the play, but, probably on average it's probably around 50%. So we've got work to do there as far as (47:11) and things like that. So right now I'd say it's probably around 50%. But the numbers we've given you as far as resource estimate, that's all net numbers, the 260 net locations and acreage position there.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Right. So on a gross location you've got a good 500 plus it sounds like. And so when you talk about ramping that opportunity up in 2018, what kind of pace are you generally thinking about now?","David W. Trice - EOG Resources, Inc.","Yeah. I think we're going to wait to give any kind of specific guidance until the next call on our plan, but we would say that we do intend to ramp that up next year.","Operator","We'll go next to Charles Meade with Johnson Rice.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Good morning, Bill, to you and your team there.","William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.","Good morning, Charles.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","And congratulations to your teams for maturing those two new premium plays. I'd like to go back to an earlier question. I believe it was from Bob Morris, was asking about your macro outlook given that you're unhedged. But there was another comment you made in your prepared remarks that you're going to be near the high end of your CapEx guidance to secure the services you guys need going into 2018. And to me putting those two together really looks like the management team is pretty bullish on the commodity and activity levels. And I'm wondering if that's a fair read, not just on the commodity but on the activity levels. And if it is, if you have any concerns or any lookouts for pinch points on service availability in 2018.","William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.","Charles, just first off on our, I think, our confidence in the macro and the oil price. We do feel like the market is in an improving situation. There's no doubt about that. But even if oil prices stay at $50, no better than they are this year, our discretionary cash flow is growing substantially. So I'm going to ask Gary Thomas to kind of comment on the services and the availability of equipment and maybe the pricing there.","Gary L. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.","Yes, Charles. As was brought up this morning, all of our decisions is really based on increasing our rate of return. And you mentioned pinch point, and pinch point would probably be in just thinking about the various services that are available. There's been little equipment added over the last couple of years. And that's one of the main reasons that we've increased our activity here with the additional 25 wells; it's just to ensure that we have top-tier services available to continue to reduce our cost and just develop and produce more of the low-cost oil, which is going to increase our return on capital investment.","But our divisions have just done an outstanding job assembling our best-performing drilling rigs, completion services, all those services, probably the best ever. And we just want to be careful not to lose those, because our intent is just to continue to reduce our cost over time.","Charles, I'd also like to add that we always built in the flexibility to respond to whatever oil price presents itself next year. So we're always thinking about that and built that into our thinking on what equipment and how much of it if we put a long-term contract versus short term and how we manage our business.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Thank you, Bill and Gary. That's helpful color. And then, if I could have one other question, my follow-up question on the Delaware Basin, perhaps this would be best for Billy Helms. Billy, you guys had the emergence of this First Bone Springs this quarter, but as I look at maps or the charts you guys have in your investor book, the Wolfcamp section is about as thick as that whole Bone Springs section put together, and you're just identifying one target there right now. So could you talk about what are the prospects over the next coming quarters for you guys to mature another horizon within the Wolfcamp?","Lloyd W. Helms, Jr. - EOG Resources, Inc.","Yeah, Charles. I'd say, yeah, our focus there has been mainly on identifying the best target intervals within the Wolfcamp, so we've tested a number of different perspective pay targets. And then, really, what we're trying to better understand is \u2013 and as we move into development mode, how is the best way to develop the asset, and so we're testing a lot of different \u2013 along with testing different target intervals, we're testing a lot of spacing patterns. What's the right spacing pattern within each well, between wells, between target intervals, and those kind of things.","So, as you know, as you get into these large horizontal programs, you have to be able to manage the parent-child interference, the offset depletion appropriately to maximize the recovery and the economics of every play. Just a reminder, we've got over a decade of doing that kind of thing in various plays. So we're utilizing all that knowledge that we've gained in all these different plays to better understand how to do that.","So I'd tell you it's a little bit early to think about what we would roll out next, but I'd say that there's certainly upside we see in the basin for continued growth, and we're very excited about what we see for the potential of the Delaware Basin.","Operator","We'll go next to Ryan Todd with Deutsche Bank.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good. Thanks. Maybe a question on allocation to capital. I mean, how should we think about the relative prioritization to capital within the portfolio amongst the assets as we look into 2018? I know you're working on the budget right now, but should we expect a similar mix of Eagle Ford versus Permian versus other as we saw in 2017? Or is there going to be additional relative shift towards some other? Then, in particular, how should we think about allocation to capital for the two new assets? So maybe start there.","William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.","Ryan, yeah. The capital allocation, certainly, the Permian would be a high priority. Obviously, the Eagle Ford continues to get a lot of capital. And then the plays in the Rockies, and certainly the new Woodford play, as David talked about, will get quite a bit more capital than it had obviously this year. We'll get into a development mode on that. And I think it's the advantage again that we have in the company is that we can disburse capital very easily and have a lot of confidence that we're generating really high returns. And because of our decentralized structure, and all the plays are very, very high quality. So it's pretty easy for us to disburse capital out and have a lot of confidence in it.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And within that framework, I guess, in the past at some point, you had talked about in that kind of $50 to $55 world that the Permian would be the largest growth driver, the Eagle Ford would be probably more of a mid to high-single digit trajectory. Is that kind of the right way to think about the Eagle Ford within this current framework?","William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.","Ryan, yes. That's a good way of thinking about it. The Permian, the Delaware is our primary driver of growth and the Eagle Ford is in the secondary position on that right now. But all of them are getting fantastic returns. And that's the way we want to do it. We're really focused on returns first. And that's the top priority of the company and to maximize the ROCE.","Operator","We'll go next to Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey. Good morning. Bill, I was wondering if you could give us some commentary on how you're thinking about 2018. On slide 19, you've given us, kind of, your 15% to 25% long-term growth CAGR. The Street for 2018 is at 18% growth. I was just wondering if you could just give us how you're thinking about your planning for next year?","William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.","Arun, we're not going to give out a specific number at this point. So, everybody, you'll just have to wait until our February call on that. Certainly, our long-term outlook that we've given, 15% to 25%, is still valid. But we'll work through the plan and then we'll let everybody know the specifics in February.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Can we read into anything, the fact that you've added a couple of rigs and have added frac crews as any indication about next year?","William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.","No. You shouldn't read really anything in that. We wanted to secure those because they're very, very high quality, that that kind of equipment is hard to get if you're trying to add something new. And so we didn't want to let it go. And then we captured it at very low cost, too, so we wanted to lock that in. But I wouldn't read anything really, into anything. We're still working through our plan and we'll let you know that in February.","Operator","We'll go next to Dave Kistler with Simmons Piper Jaffray.","David Kistler - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Good morning, guys. Speaking a little bit about the decentralized structure and a lot of questions regarding capital allocation, can you talk a little bit about, even though it's decentralized, how flexible you can be to redirect capital or activity to basically optimize returns in not just an annual basis, but in a shorter term basis? So, for example, LLS prices are great right now. Service environment in Eagle Ford isn't quite as pressured as other areas. How quickly can you redirect capital or do you think about doing that in a decentralized environment?","Gary L. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.","Dave, this is Gary Thomas. Really the decentralized nature of EOG helps us to turn on a dime. We've got all of these different plays working. We can ramp up, ramp down. The way we've structured our contracts with our vendors, we can move equipment from one to the other. And as far as \u2013 and Bill brought this up, is us being able to share what the breakthroughs are, the efficiencies. We often get together with our technical groups. We have those conferences that are going be starting up here right after the first of the year. So there's a tremendous amount of sharing among divisions to ensure that these different divisions that are working different plays, finding new and better ways to improve our efficiencies are just continually shared. So we like to think of it as having various think tanks and it works really well for us.","David Kistler - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Well, I appreciate that tremendously. And then, one last maybe macro question, in the past, you guys have talked about scarcity of premium resources across kind of the total U.S. and that you obviously feel advantaged, and rightfully so, with what you've been able to put together. But that has enhanced your macro outlook. As you guys continue to grow premium resources organically within your current acreage base, but also as an example with the Woodford outside of it, does that change your thoughts in terms of total resource content in the U.S. or total premium inventory and what that might mean to macro supply on a longer term basis?","William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.","Dave, no, it really doesn't. We think the highest quality sweet spot parts of the crude oil plays are relatively small compared to the total. And when you look across the U.S. horizontal oil plays, there is a very large percent of wells that, we believe, are not economic, certainly at $50 oil, and need a much higher oil price to be economic. So these premium plays, the sweet spots are really the economic parts of these horizontal oil plays, and those are the ones we're focused on, obviously, only. We're not really interested in most of the acreage. So we believe if oil stayed at $50, the economic limits of the industry, U.S. horizontal oil, are somewhat limited by that.","Operator","At this time, this does conclude the question-and-answer portion of today's call. At this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Thomas for any final remarks.","William R. Thomas - EOG Resources, Inc.","In closing, EOG's third quarter results were remarkable in many ways. As reported today, the company is focused on delivering strong returns by reducing costs, completing great wells and increasing the size and quality of our drilling inventory. We have a sustainable business model and we're excited about EOG's ability to create long-term shareholder value. In addition, I would like to say thank you to the EOG family for the tremendous contribution of time and money to Hurricane Harvey relief. Our combined efforts raised over $2.8 million. Thank you for listening, and thank you for your support.","Operator","This does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation.

Just as a reminder, this call is being recorded. And at this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of EOG Resources, Mr. Mark Papa. Please go ahead, sir.","Mark Papa","Good morning, and thanks for joining us. We hope that everyone has seen the press release announcing first quarter 2013 earnings and operational results. This conference call includes forward-looking statements. The risks associated with forward-looking statements have been outlined in the earnings release and EOG's SEC filings, and we incorporate those by reference for this call.","This conference call also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation schedules for these non-GAAP measures to comparable measures can be found on our website at www.eogresources.com. ","The SEC permits oil and gas companies in their filings with the SEC to disclose not only proved reserves but also probable reserves as well as possible reserves. Some of the reserve estimates on this conference call and webcast, including those for the Delaware Basin and Eagle Ford, may include potential reserves or other estimated reserves not necessarily calculated in accordance with or contemplated by the SEC's latest reserve reporting guidelines. We incorporate by reference the cautionary note to U.S. investors that appears at the bottom of our press release and Investor Relations page of our website.","With me this morning are Bill Thomas, president; Gary Thomas, chief operating officer; Tim Driggers, vice president and CFO; and Maire Baldwin, vice president, investor relations.  An updated IR Presentation was posted to our website yesterday evening, and we included second quarter and full-year 2013 guidance in yesterday's press release.","This morning we\u2019ll discuss topics in the following order.  I\u2019ll first discuss our 2013 first quarter net income and discretionary cash flow, then Bill Thomas and I will provide operational results.  I\u2019ll then discuss our 2014 to 2017 business plan and Tim Driggers will discuss financials and capital structure.  Finally, I will cover our macro view, hedge position, and concluding remarks.  ","As outlined in our press release, for the first quarter of 2013, EOG reported net income of $494.7 million, or $1.82 per share.  For investors who focus on non-GAAP net income, to eliminate mark-to-market impacts and certain nonrecurring items as outlined in the press release, EOG\u2019s first quarter 2013 adjusted net income was $489.9 million, or $1.80 per share.  For investors who follow the practice of industry analysts who focus on non-GAAP discretionary cash flow, EOG\u2019s DCF for the first quarter was $1.7 billion.  ","I\u2019ll now address our operational results in key plays.  We hit on all cylinders in the first quarter.  Our oil, NGL, and North American gas volumes considerably exceeded our guidance and for the same quarter in a row, our unit cost beat guidance and domestic oil prices were at a significant premium to WTI.  Therefore, we beat on volumes, costs, and net backs.","The biggest profit driver of course was oil, and 100% of our oil outperformance emanated from the Eagle Ford.  Oil production from all other sectors of the company was at expected levels during the quarter.  Taken as a whole, EOG\u2019s first quarter financial performance shows the power of scale and efficiency when applied to sweet spot oil resource plays.","I\u2019ll now discuss our key oil plays, starting with Eagle Ford.  The Eagle Ford surprised us in an upside manner, similar to what it did during each of the first three quarters of 2012.  You may recall that EOG grew its oil production domestically 46% last year, primarily because the Eagle Ford significantly outperformed for the first nine months.  ","During the fourth quarter, we reduced the Eagle Ford capex for budget reasons and the production scaled back accordingly.  Some people may have misread the fourth quarter as an indicator that the Eagle Ford growth rate was slowing.  During the first quarter of 2013, EOG\u2019s U.S. oil production increased 24,200 barrels per day over the fourth quarter of 2012, primarily due to the Eagle Ford.  ","As these first quarter results indicate, the Eagle Ford continues to outperform our estimates as it did over the course of 2012.  The rate of change from this asset is not slowing.  During the first quarter, we completed 27 monster wells in the Eagle Ford, with IP rates greater than 2,500 barrels of oil per day.  Nine of these had IP rates greater than 3,500 barrels of oil per day.  Note that these rates are oil per day, not barrels of oil equivalent per day.  ","Additionally, the wells on our western acreage continue to improve as we drill longer laterals and approve our fracks.  Many of these western wells exhibit flatter declines that the prolific wells from our eastern acreage and have net reserves of 500,000 to 600,000 barrels of oil equivalent per well, which is outstanding.","As we continue to develop this asset, we continue to add additional drilling locations in both the east and west.  As expected, our first quarter direct drilling after tax reinvestment rate of return in the Eagle Ford exceeded 100%.  To summarize the Eagle Ford, this asset has the best large play economics in North America, and continues to provide upside production surprises.","One additional positive occurrence we\u2019ve noted throughout our domestic operations is that there is currently more downward, rather than upward, pressure on service costs.  Because our capex dollars will go farther, we now plan to drill 425 net Eagle Ford wells this year.  ","I\u2019ll now turn it over to Bill Thomas to discuss other domestic plays.","Bill Thomas","Thanks, Mark.  I will start with our good news from the Bakken\/Three Forks.  We have two important items to report for the first quarter.  First, we continue to have excellent results from our 160-acre downspacing test in the Parshall Core area, and second, we tested the second bench in the Three Forks on our Antelope Extension acreage with outstanding results.","Two recent 160-acre downspace wells in the Parshall Core area are the Van Hook 20-107H and 127-107H, which came on production for only 2,375 and 2,170 barrels of oil per day respectively.  We have 55% working interest in these wells.","Along with the new wells, our previously reported 160-acre wells continue to outperform our expectations, and the vast majority of the planned 53 completions in 2013 will be drilled on 160-acre spacing.  As we continue to gain confidence in downspacing results over the course of 2013, we will likely increase the level of drilling activity in 2014.","As I noted, we just completed our first well in the second bench of the Three Forks in the Antelope Extension area with outstanding results.  The River View 3-3130H came online, producing 3,150 barrels of oil per day.  We have 94% working interest in this well.","We also completed another Three Forks well in the first bench, or our uppermost zone.  The West Clark 101-2425H had initial production of 2,205 barrels of oil per day.  We have 100% working interest in this well.","The Three Forks and Bakken results on our Antelope Extension acreage continue to look strong, and we are particularly excited about the potential of the Three Forks second bench.  Early looks indicate that this target may have better potential than the first bench and the Bakken phase in this area.  We plan to test the third bench of the Three Forks in this same area next year.","In summary, we are encouraged by our solid downspacing results in the Parshall Core area and excellent results from multiple Three Forks pays in the Antelope Extension area.  As reported on our February call, we are applying new frack techniques in the Parshall Core and Antelope area, and the new wells are outperforming the original wells that we drilled several years ago.  ","This has resulted in improved, direct after-tax rate of return from our drilling program, giving us current Bakken returns that are comparable to our Eagle Ford program.  The results continue to set us up for many years of excellent drilling in the play.  With our new techniques, we believe EOG will continue to lead the industry in Bakken and Three Forks drilling results.  ","In the Delaware Basin, we continue to have excellent results in the Leonard Play.  We have four new wells to report.  During the first quarter, we completed the Vaca 24 Fed Com #2H, #3H, and #4H, flowing 1,230, 1,410, and 1,205 barrels of oil per day respectively, with 140, 140, and 230 barrels of NGL per day and 780, 760, and 1,290 Mcf per day of natural gas respectively.  We have 90% working interest in these wells.","We also completed the Vanguard 30 State Com #1H, with an initial flowing rate of 1,540 barrels of oil per day, 165 barrels of NGL per day, and 915 Mcf of gas per day.  We have 100% working interest in this well.","Our Leonard results remain strong, and we continue to work on improving the recovery sector by identifying multiple pay targets, improving frack technology, and testing the optimal downspacing.  We also completed our third Delaware Wolfcamp well, which confirms our positive outlook on the potential of our newest pay, which we discussed in February.","We completed the Apache State 57 #1101H in the upper Wolfcamp play and turned it to sales flowing 815 barrels of oil per day plus 600 barrels of NGL per day, and 3.8 Mcf of gas per day.  We have 100% working interest in this well, which is located in Reeves County, Texas.","Pilot logs from this well confirmed excellent Wolfcamp pay on our acreage, and a microseismic survey performed on our second completion, the Harrison 56-1001H provides further confirmation of good frack geometry.  Every piece of data we receive on the Delaware Wolfcamp is most encouraging.  This particular play has excellent shale rock properties and, when combined with the massive amount of resource in place on our sweet spot acreage, has the characteristics of a high-quality horizontal resource play.","In this new play, we\u2019ve identified over 1,100 drilling locations, with EURs of 700,000 barrels of oil equivalent net per well.  On our 114,000 net acreage in the play, we\u2019ve estimated 800 million barrels of oil equivalent of net potential reserves.  We\u2019ve now drilled three horizontal wells to date, and recently have over 200 penetrations in data points from previously drilled vertical wells.","In summary, the Delaware Basin and Wolfcamp plays have a combined reserve potential of 1.35 billion barrels of oil equivalent net to EOG using a conservative 2-3% recovery factor.  We hope to improve this over time.","Regarding the Midland Basin Wolfcamp play, during the first quarter we continued to make steady progress on optimizing our frack technology.  This is an important process to help determine the optimal well spacing and to increase the recovery factor of the play.  ","Recent pattern completions include the Munson 105H, 106H, and 107H, flowing 965, 970, and 1,290 barrels of oil per day plus 55, 60, and 100 barrels of NGL per day and 400, 430, and 730 Mcf of gas per day, respectively, from the middle zone of the Wolfcamp.  We have 85% working interest in the Munson wells.","Other new wells are the University 40D #701H and 702H that began producing at 705 and 660 barrels of oil per day plus 95 and 75 barrels of NGL per day and 685 and 550 Mcf of gas per day respectively.  We have 80% working interest in these wells, which are also producing from the middle zone.","The Midland Basin Wolfcamp was a solid play, but it is technically more challenging than our Delaware Basin plays.  It is taking more time to establish optimal frack techniques and spacing, but we are making progress, and will update our reserve potential in this play as we learn more in the future.","In our Barnett Combo play, a combination of good well results and lower well costs netted solid returns during the first quarter.  This is an area where we\u2019ve accomplished excellent drilling and completion performance, and seen reductions in service costs.  We are seeing a 10-15% decrease in well costs for the play as compared to last year.","Examples of excellent wells are the [Reed B] unit #1H and #2H, which came online flowing 605 and 515 barrels of oil per day with 65 and 60 barrels per day of NGLs and 445 and 390 Mcf per day of gas, respectively.  We have 100% working interest in these wells.  We have reduced our Barnett Combo activity to three rigs, but drilling times and well costs continue to improve, and we are still on track to drill approximately 130 net wells in 2013.  ","We are also continuing to look for new greenfield North American liquid plays.  We believe we have the technical advantage in identifying the best rock and capturing the best acreage.  Our positions in the Bakken and Eagle Ford confirm this.","Now I\u2019ll turn it back to Mark.  ","Mark Papa","Thanks, Bill.  I\u2019ll briefly discuss our plays outside North America.  In Trinidad, our first quarter production was as projected.  We\u2019re in the midst of a drilling program off our Osprey platform that will help to maintain flat over production in 2013 and 2014.  ","In the East Irish Sea, the startup of our Conwy oil project has been delayed until early 2014.  For this reason, we\u2019re keeping our full year total company oil growth target at 28%, even though we significantly outperformed in the first quarter.  We have, however, increased our U.S. oil growth estimate by 4% this year, due to our Eagle Ford strength.","In addition to having captured sweet spot positions in crude oil resource plays, another EOG differentiator is our domestic crude oil realizations in margins.  During the quarter and currently, our Eagle Ford crude is priced off an LOS index as is our Bakken and part of our Permian crew, which is being railed to our St. James terminal.  ","The majority of our domestic crude volumes are linked to LOS rather than WTI prices.  This access to premium markets resulted in a $12.23 per barrel premium over WTI during the first quarter for EOG\u2019s U.S. crude oil volumes.  We expect to achieve a $9.25 premium in the second quarter using the midpoint of yesterday\u2019s guidance.","Now I\u2019ll discuss some longer term implications emanating from our asset base.  On this call we\u2019ve described our three main domestic oil assets in the Eagle Ford, Bakken, and Delaware Basin.  We feel the addition of the Delaware Basin Leonard and Wolfcamp assets that we announced in February moves EOG past a key threshold and allows us to talk with confidence about what EOG will look like five years out.","Today we have sufficient confidence in our asset base to provide directional guidance for 2014 through 2017, with the caveat that WT oil prices remain at or above $85.  Under that assumption, we believe EOG will continue to have the highest oil growth rates during 2013 to 2017 of any large cap independent, similar to our performance of the past three years.","We expect our 2014 to 2017 NGL growth to be at or near top tier.  Our 2014 to 2017 North American gas production should reverse its negative trend and begin to increase, even though we drill very few dry gas wells.  This is the result of our combo play activity and associated natural gas production.   ","Outside of North America, EOG produces natural gas in Trinidad and China.  We expect that production to be essentially flat during the 2014 to 2017 timeframe.  When you combine this mix, you\u2019ll likely calculate strong overall total company production growth underpinned by very strong high-margin oil growth.  ","The conclusion from this overview is that EOG is likely to exhibit one of the highest overall production growth rates, combined with the single-highest oil growth rate of the large caps for at least the 2014 to 2017 period.  And all the growth is sourced domestically.  This should yield significant net income and overall free cash flow, even at a flat $85 WTI oil price.  ","When considered on a debt-adjusted basis, the growth rate is even higher.  EOG can accomplish this production net income and cash flow growth while maintaining a strong balance sheet.  ","I\u2019ll now turn it over to Tim Driggers to discuss financials and capital structure.  ","Tim Driggers","Thanks, Mark.  Capitalized interest for the quarter was $10 million.  For the first quarter of 2013, total cash exploration and development expenditures were $1.6 million, excluding asset retirement obligations.  ","In addition, expenditures for gathering systems, processing plants, and other property plant and equipment were $92 million.  As compared to the first quarter of 2012, total cash expenditures decreased by $315 million.  There were no acquisitions during the quarter.  ","Through May 1, we have closed on asset sales of approximately $500 million.  At the end of March 2013, total debt outstanding was $6.3 billion, and the debt to total capitalization ratio was 31%.  At March 31, we had $1.1 billion of cash on hand, giving us non-GAAP net debt of $5.2 billion, or net debt to total cap ratio of 27%.  The effective tax rate for the first quarter was 35%, and the deferred tax ratio was 75%.  ","Yesterday, we included a guidance table with the earnings press release for the second quarter and for full year 2013.  For the second quarter, the effective tax rate is estimated to be 30-40%.  For the full year, the effective tax rate is estimated to be 35% to 45%.  We\u2019ve also provided an estimated range of the dollar amount of current taxes that we expect to record during the second quarter and for the full year.  ","Now I\u2019ll turn it back to Mark.","Mark Papa","Thanks, Tim.  Now I\u2019ll provide our views regarding the macro environment, hedging, and crude by rail.  Regarding oil, we believe full year WTI prices will average in the low 90s, similar to the past two years.  However, as our total company cash flow becomes more dependent on oil, we have changed our oil hedging philosophy such that we plan to target an approximate 50% hedge position for the full year.","For the second half of this year, we had 93,000 barrels of oil a day hedged at $98.44.  Currently, we have 42,000 barrels of oil a day hedged for the first half of 2014 at $95.86.  These numbers exclude options that are exercisable by our counterparties.","Regarding North American gas, we recently added some May through October 2013 and some full year 2014 hedges.  We don\u2019t have a target hedge percentage, and have viewed the April gas price upsurge as a hedge opportunity.","Our crude by rail continues to be a highly profitable venture and although the WTI-LOS differential has recently contracted from $20 to $11 a barrel, it\u2019s still very advantageous for us to move oil by rail from the Bakken, Permian, and Barnett combo to St. James.","Additionally, we have contracted capacity on a Houston Tahoma pipeline later in the year, and will have the flexibility to move our Eagle Ford oil east from Houston to refineries in Louisiana, which are priced off the LOS index.","I\u2019ll now briefly address our 2013 business plan, which is consistent with what we outlined on our February call.  We still expect our total capex to be between $7.0 and $7.2 billion, and proceeds from dispositions to be approximately $550 million.  Our full year production growth targets are unchanged at this time, and we slightly reduced our full year LOE and DD&A estimate.  Even though natural gas prices have strengthened, we don\u2019t intend to drill any additional dry gas wells this year.","Now, let me conclude.  There are eight important takeaways from this call.  First, as evident by our results, EOG is firing on all cylinders: volumes, unit costs, price realizations, and returns.  Second, our first quarter reinvestment rate of return on our drilling capital program was the highest in the company\u2019s history, led by the Eagle Ford and North Dakota Bakken investments.  ","Third, the Eagle Ford is leading the pack and drove our first quarter oil outperformance.  Fourth, our first quarter Bakken drilling rate of return rivaled our outstanding Eagle Ford triple-digit returns and our initial test of the second bench of the Three Forks floated 3,150 barrels of oil per day.  Our overall North Dakota results are much better than the industry average because we are drilling 160-acre downspace wells in the best acreage in the entire play.  ","Fifth, our recent Delaware Basin Leonard performance has been excellent and we\u2019ll ramp up this play in 2014.  Additionally, our third Delaware Basin horizontal Wolfcamp test confirms this area as our third key asset in our portfolio.","Sixth, we\u2019re seeing downward cost pressure across the board.  Seventh, I\u2019ve walked you through our five-year outlook.  We have all the assets in place to achieve best-in-class, organic, high rate of return domestic crude oil and NGL growth and our North American natural gas production should flatten out next year and then begin to increase.  Beginning in 2014, provided WTI oil prices stay at current levels, we expect to have strong total company production growth and begin to generate free cash flow.","And finally, our succession plan is consistent with what we previously reported.  I will step down as CEO on July 1 of this year.  Bill Thomas will succeed me at that time as CEO.  I will remain as executive chairman until Bill replaces me when I retire on December 31 with the title of chairman and CEO.","Thanks for listening, and now we\u2019ll go to Q&A.  ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions.]  We\u2019ll take our first question from Leo Mariani with RBC.  ","Leo Mariani - RBC Capital","Question on your second bench well in the Three Forks.  It looked like a very strong well.  I think you guys drilled out in the Antelope Extension area.  Do you guys think that the second bench can be prevalent across a lot more of your acreages trying to get a sense of your geologic mapping and where you think that might exist on your acreage.","Bill Thomas","We certainly think it\u2019s prospective across our Antelope Ridge area.  We have enough logs and data there to kind of verify that.  On the remainder of our acreage, like in the core area, it may be prospective.  We\u2019re taking additional looks at that as we speak.  But it\u2019s not as clear there as it is in Antelope.  But you know, we\u2019re really excited about the second bench, and we\u2019re going to be testing another second bench well down the road, and then I think next year we\u2019ve got plans for drilling down in a third bench.  So we\u2019re very excited about the Three Forks potential there at Antelope.","Leo Mariani - RBC Capital ","And then I guess in terms of gas production, you guys said you weren\u2019t drilling any more dry gas wells this year, but you did say that you\u2019d probably see gas production flat in North America to slightly up next year.  Would you anticipate any dry gas drilling next year?  Or is that going to be exclusively from associated gas?","Mark Papa ","The outlook through 2017 that we gave you we generally are assuming no dry gas drilling, or essentially no dry gas drilling, throughout 2017 in the outlook we provided.","Leo Mariani - RBC Capital ","And I guess you guys obviously didn\u2019t quantify overall growth.  Should we think of the EOG as firmly being in double digit growth of the company over the next four years?","Mark Papa ","We don\u2019t want to give specific numbers, but I\u2019d just say that some of the numbers that might have been penciled in previously for overall growth are probably too low, and I think we\u2019ll have surprising overall growth during the next four or five years, really.  The 4% growth that we\u2019re projecting this year is not what you should expect in the 2014 to 2017 period.","Operator","Next we\u2019ll hear from Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.   ","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch ","My question is on your guidance.  Obviously the costs have been pretty strong here relative to what you were expecting in the first quarter.  But you\u2019re guiding us higher again for the back end of the year on a whole number of levels.  What\u2019s different?  Why should costs move back up again given the level of success that you\u2019re having?  And are you just being conservative?  Or should we be thinking about Q1 as the more repeatable?","Mark Papa ","In terms of the budget expenditures?  Capex?","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch ","More the unit costs.  The LOE and the transportation and the exploration guidance and so on.","Mark Papa ","We\u2019re a little bit surprised by how well we came in on our overall costs for the first quarter, so we\u2019re a little bit conservative in the guidance that we\u2019ve given for the remainder of this year, although we do think it will be a little bit back end loaded.  So I\u2019d say on the unit costs, there is a possibility we may beat the full year guidance on some of those, but we\u2019re going to wait another quarter to see how repeatable this first quarter really is.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch ","And that would apply to the other guidance actions as well?  The impairment charges and the exploration charges, you\u2019ve guided that back up as well.  [unintelligible] a big ticket item.  Is there any reason why that should be trending higher?  ","Mark Papa ","We\u2019ll just be looking at it at the end of the second quarter.  We just want to see what the trend is.  But right now we just want to be fairly conservative.  On the production side, though, we\u2019re not signaling that we may beat on production on there, at that time, so we would guide you to the full year production of the 28% oil growth and not higher than that at this time.  There may be some room on some of the costs, and we\u2019ll reevaluate that at the end of the second quarter.","Operator","Next we\u2019ll hear from Irene Haas with Wunderlich Securities.","Irene Haas - Wunderlich Securities","Sounds like a lot of good news coming out of the Bakken.  My question is what\u2019s your feeling on the Bakken differential as it stands now, understanding that [unintelligible] has come down a little bit.  Just want a little color from you.","Mark Papa ","It\u2019s hard for us to guess on these differentials kind of where they\u2019re going.  I\u2019d be hard press to really hazard a specific guess.  We do believe that the differential, Gulf Coast to WTI, is likely to stay more compressed than it was in the first quarter.  We don\u2019t see that ballooning out.  But where the Bakken is relative to the WTI or the Gulf Coast, I can\u2019t give you any specific guidance on that that would be very specific, unfortunately.","Irene Haas - Wunderlich Securities ","And how about on natural gas?  I know you guys put on some hedges, so your general view probably still has not changed?","Mark Papa ","I guess our view at this point is we don\u2019t see any return to the high twos or low threes for gas in terms of 2013 or 2014, or 2015.  We think we\u2019re now in a timeframe, in 2013, 2014 and 2015, we\u2019re somewhere in the range of likely $4-5 gas prices.  So we have become slightly more bullish than in the past, but we certainly are not in hyper-bullish mode.   ","Operator","Next we\u2019ll hear from Joe Magner with Macquarie.","Joe Magner - Macquarie Capital  ","Just curious how we should think about the guidance through 2017.  I know you don\u2019t want to get into specifics, but should we expect to see a rolling update on what you\u2019re going to guide to on an annual basis?  Or will there be more framework to it if you have more visibility on future commodity price?","Mark Papa ","We will probably continue just to give an annual update.  It\u2019s been our experience that companies that try and give a three- to five-year guidance, they almost immediately miss their guidance the first or second year, and so we\u2019re not likely to do that.  So it will be likely that in February we\u2019ll give full year 2014 guidance and we might give a little more framework around the 2015 to 2017 guidance, but don\u2019t look for us to provide firm numbers for more than one year out as we go forward.","Joe Magner - Macquarie Capital ","And along those lines, how should we start to think about capex required to support that growth?  To date you\u2019ve been pretty disciplined with the balance sheet, but if you have continued confidence in the quality of your assets, will your treatment of the balance sheet change, or will this growth be supported by internally generated cash flow?","Mark Papa ","I\u2019ll just say that we ran a case at a flat WTI oil price of $85 and we believe that over the aggregate period of 2014 to 2017, we will generate some significant free cash flow during that period at a flat $85 WTI oil price.  So during that entire period, we\u2019ll be guided by the same maximum debt limit of no higher than 30% net debt to total cap, and we think that we should be in a free cash mode during this period, certainly at current oil prices.  If you just take flat oil prices, current levels, through 2017, we will be at significant free cash flow [unintelligible] based on our internal growth projections.","Operator","Next we\u2019ll hear from Pearce Hammond of Simmons & Company.  "," ","Pearce Hammond - Simmons & Company","In a prior forecast, you had put out some slides where you talked about total U.S. oil production growing by like 2 million barrels a day by 2015?","Mark Papa ","We still are of the belief that total U.S. oil production growth that happened in 2012 was perhaps the peak that is going to occur.  That production growth was about 800,000 barrels of oil a day, and we expect that the total growth in 2013 to be less than that, and 2014 to be less than that.  We\u2019re already seeing a lesser rate of growth in the Bakken.  The Eagle Ford, of course, is still steaming ahead at a quite high rate of growth.  ","And so we believe that we\u2019re not going to see stupendous overall U.S. growth rates as we go forward.  We think there\u2019s only really two major driving forces of U.S. oil growth: Bakken and Eagle Ford.  Eagle Ford is going to surpass the Bakken likely this year as the biggest oil growth rate.  Bakken is slowing down.  Permian is really not on that fast of a track.  And then there\u2019s what I would classify as all others.  And the all others are not growing at a very fast pace at all.  ","So we\u2019re not as concerned as others that U.S. oil growth is going to flood the total market and ruin global oil prices.   ","Pearce Hammond - Simmons & Company ","And then you my follow up, in the earnings release, related to the Eagle Ford, you stated that if crude oil prices remain at or above current levels, that you\u2019ll further augment your drilling program in 2014.  How many rigs do you think that augmentation might imply?","Mark Papa ","In terms of rigs, not all that many rigs.  I mean, to give you an idea of rigs, in the first quarter of \u201912, we ran up to 76 rigs.  In the first quarter of \u201913, we ran 52 rigs.  Now, some of those rigs last year were drilling some gas wells.  This year we weren\u2019t drilling hardly any gas wells.  But what we\u2019re seeing is the rig count\u2019s probably not going to go up that much, even if we ramp up the number of wells we plan to drill, because we continue to drill at a faster pace in days per well.","So what I would say is, if the constant oil price continues to occur in 2014, we\u2019ll probably ramp up activity in the Eagle Ford, the Bakken, and the Permian from the activity level that we expect to achieve in 2013.  And we expect we can do that and still have significant free cash flow in 2014.","Operator","Next we\u2019ll hear from Charles Meade with Johnson Rice.","Charles Meade - Johnson Rice ","Just a clarification.  With respect to the increased activity in both the Bakken and the Eagle Ford in \u201914 in current prices, does current prices mean $95?  Or are we talking more the flat $85 that you referenced in your five-year plan?","Mark Papa ","The current prices I was just referring to would be the $94-95.","Charles Meade - Johnson Rice ","And then the second question I had, on those Karnes County well, I think the general impression has been that that has been maybe a tier below the fabulous acreage you have up there in Gonzalez County.  But with the results that you turned in here, it seems like the rate of change of the results there, the second derivative of what you\u2019re getting there, is better.  And I\u2019m curious, has your view evolved on the relative prospectivity of these two areas?  And does Karnes have a chance to be as good as Gonzalez?","Mark Papa ","As an overview, I\u2019d say Karnes is still not as good as Gonzalez.  But on the rate of change, while we\u2019re continuing to make better wells, given equal acreage, the rate of change is still quite positive in the Eagle Ford.  ","In other words, if you take essentially any piece of our acreage, whether it\u2019s in the west, the middle, or the east, are we making better wells today than we were a year ago, than we were two years ago or three years ago?  The answer is unequivocally yes.  So that\u2019s why you\u2019re seeing the fact that we continue to beat our production targets relating to the Eagle Ford. ","Because we project and say, okay, based on what we think the productivity is going to be, based on drilling X wells for the rest of this year, we project a number and give it to you as our 8-K estimate.  And then what we find out is gee whiz, the productivity of those wells is better than projected based on typically our completion efficiency.  ","So I can\u2019t overestimate the quality of this Eagle Ford asset.  And I think a lot of people, when we purposely restricted the money in the fourth quarter, to the Eagle Ford, and we had clearly signaled this to the investment community before we did it, we said we\u2019re going to slow down activity in the fourth quarter to the Eagle Ford because of budget constraints, and then production slowed down.  ","I think a lot of people misread the production slowdown in our fourth quarter and felt that the Eagle Ford rate of change had inflected downwards, and that was clearly not the case.  It was just that the capital, the coin operated machine received less coins in the fourth quarter.  So we upped the coinage in the first quarter and you see the results.   ","So that\u2019s why we\u2019re so optimistic, not only of what we can do this year, but what we can do in the period 2014 through 2017.","Operator","Next we\u2019ll hear from Arun Jayaram with Credit Suisse.","Arun Jayaram - Credit Suisse ","I wanted to elaborate a little bit more on that rate of change topic.  I guess going to your slides on 21, saw a real noticeable improvement in the 30-day averages, and just wondering if you can put this in context given your shift towards tighter spacing patterns and the move out west.  So I was just wondering if you could put that into context.","Mark Papa ","Yeah, that\u2019s a new slide we put in there, and glad you caught that.  It\u2019s pretty impressive, really, as to what we\u2019re seeing on these averages.  And this is on our IR slides we posted on our website this morning.  And you can see a steady increase, if anyone wants to go take a look at that.  We\u2019ve got a chart there that shows the 30-day production average and then on the right hand side of that chart, it shows the number of drilling days versus time, and you can see improvement in there.","Generally, the 30-day average is a function of the completion efficacy of what we\u2019re doing, and it also could be a function of the location of the wells.  And so on the completion efficacy, I\u2019d say that we do have a bit of a secret sauce in our fracks that we really aren\u2019t going to talk much about, but we are doing some things differently than other operators down there.  This has been a change that we\u2019ve fully implemented, really in just the last six months.  And we are seeing clearly differentiating results from that, and at this point we\u2019ll just call it our own secret sauce.","Arun Jayaram - Credit Suisse ","And the follow up is if this continues, do you see some upward momentum perhaps to your EUR that you updated last quarter?","Mark Papa ","Yeah, but we won\u2019t update that.  I wouldn\u2019t look at that EUR.  First point is, at the current 400 MBOE net after royalty, and our current well costs, we are achieving greater than 100% after-tax direct reinvestment rates of return.  So that, for a large hydrocarbon play, I would say is likely the absolute best rate of return anyone\u2019s achieving, clearly, in North America, perhaps the world, except for the NOCs.  And so it\u2019s very adequate returns, certainly more than adequate.  ","And we will look maybe annually at whether we could bump that reserve estimate, but that\u2019s not something we\u2019re going to adjust on a quarterly basis.","Operator","Next we\u2019ll hear from Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs ","In the fourth quarter, you slowed activity in the Eagle Ford, to stay within your capex budget.  But when we see how strongly you grew production during the first quarter, wanted to see if there are any operational benefits to an end of year slowdown and whether for financial or operational reasons, you\u2019re expecting any slowdown in activity and completions this year.","Mark Papa ","Well, at this juncture, no, we\u2019re not anticipating any year-end slowdown, as we would see it.  There probably was kind of a catch your breath kind of advantage, particularly in the Eagle Ford last year, in the fourth quarter, and we were running so hard and so fast that there probably was a bit of an advantage to just slowing down for a period.  But I would say at this point, it would be best to project that we would not slow down at this point.  ","In terms of our capex burn rate, if you check the numbers, we consumed almost exactly 25% of our capex in the first quarter.  So right now, our burn rate is pretty much, if we continue to burn at that rate, we\u2019ll be exactly on our budget plan.  So right now that\u2019s pretty much our plan.  ","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs ","And much has been made so far here on the call about the end of the period of negative free cash flow and the forthcoming positive free cash flow.  In your expectations for superior growth as well as free cash flow, assuming $85 a barrel, what\u2019s your plan on what to do with that free cash flow?  Would you have even more superior growth by reinvesting back in the ground to further accelerate activity?  Would you more meaningfully reduce your debt or debt to tangible capital below the 30-35%?  Or would you more actively return cash to shareholders?  And how soon could we see some manifestation of that?","Mark Papa ","That\u2019s a high-class problem to have.  At this juncture, I would say that our priorities would likely be to establish some kind of meaningful dividend increase, whether it\u2019s a percent per year or something linked perhaps to cash flow increases or something like that.  ","The second thing would be we\u2019d potentially might set some sort of floor as to what would be the minimum net debt to cap debt leverage that we think would be reasonable for an E&P company.  And we wouldn\u2019t just plan to pay our debt down below a certain minimum level.  We\u2019re not aiming to be a debt-free company or anything like that.","And the third thing that would be likely, once we hit that minimum debt level, would be to look at ramping up the capex.  We have so many projects, at these kind of reinvestment rates of return, ramping up the capex further might be the proper path.  But that would be an evolutionary type decision.  Obviously on a year-to-year basis, it would depend on the price of hydrocarbons.","But the key takeaway, I think, that we want to convey to you at this point, is that during this forthcoming four-year period, that the company would be able to achieve, even at a flat $85 WTI oil price, twin goals: a very robust production growth, particularly oil growth, as well as significant free cash flow.  And so that\u2019s pretty important to note.  I\u2019m not sure there\u2019s many companies at a flat $85 oil price that would be able to say they could achieve those dual objectives.","Operator","Next we\u2019ll hear from David Tameron with Wells Fargo.   ","David Tameron - Wells Fargo","","In the Bakken, can you just talk about the downspace wells, how much production historically you have, and what those wells are doing as you get up to 60 and 90 days?  Do you have any color there?","Bill Thomas ","We\u2019ve got 15 or so wells that are in various phases of production that we\u2019ve completed as downspace wells.  And certainly as we talked about earlier, the original wells, which were more like 320-acre spaced wells, they certainly, with the improved frack techniques that we use, they\u2019re certainly, on a per-foot of lateral basis, when you normalize that, they\u2019re outperforming our older wells.  ","And it\u2019s still really early on the tighter spacing wells.  They\u2019re equivalent, really, of 160-acrew wells.  And of course these are long laterals, and the per-acres per well is variable.  But they\u2019re tighter spacing.  We don\u2019t have a lot of production history on those.  We put the first ones online early in the first quarter, and so we\u2019ve only got maybe 90 days of production on those. ","And we\u2019re really watching that carefully, because we certainly want, before we do a lot of accelerated drilling, we want to be careful and make sure that we\u2019re adding [MPV], and we\u2019re not overdrilling or sharing production between wells.  So we\u2019re watching that, and our plan is to drill the remainder of the wills this year.  ","It\u2019s about 53 wells we\u2019re going to complete this year.  Most of those will be the 160-acre type downspace wells.  And so it\u2019s really kind of a pilot program, and we\u2019re going to watch the production throughout the year.  And it usually takes like 6 to 9 months to kind of verify that you\u2019re doing things correctly.  ","So we\u2019re kind of in the first part of that process, and so hopefully by the end of the year, we\u2019ll know a whole lot more about that, and be able to give you more color on that.  But certainly, we think the improved frack techniques certainly, at this point, we\u2019re very positive about it.  We\u2019re contacting more rock, and we\u2019re really enhancing the recovery factor of the Bakken on our core acres.  So it\u2019s going well right now.","David Tameron - Wells Fargo ","And then as a follow up to that, if I start to think about the industry, obviously, whether you believe the land grab or not is over, it seems like it\u2019s moving much more toward a manufacturing type phase as opposed to an exploration phase.  And I wanted to see what you think about that concept, and what North America looks like three years down the road, just lower 48, however you want to run with that.  I just wanted to throw that out there and see if you had any comments on that.","Bill Thomas","","Certainly as far as the oil plays, as we talked about, and I think we\u2019re not really expecting to get another Eagle Ford or Bakken resource play of that quality and that size all tied together.  So we have a decent list of new greenfield plays we\u2019re working on on the oil side.  But the quality of rock for oil plays and shales is really limited.  And then the thermal maturity of the oil, the window there, of the right maturity of the oil, is really critical too.  ","So the sweet spots are really small, and so what I think you\u2019re going to be seeing is, and I think you\u2019re correct on this, you\u2019re not going to be seeing people announcing billion barrel new oil play discoveries.  But hopefully we\u2019ll be able to announce some success in some plays that would be maybe in the 50-100 million barrels, or maybe even bigger than that, which is a significant value in North America.  ","So we\u2019re not going to lose our exploration edge.  The industry as a whole, I think, is certainly at a point right now where they really have a lot of acreage [leased], and people are testing a lot of ideas and plays.  I think as we\u2019ve talked about all along, you\u2019re seeing the cream of the crop of the plays rise to the top, which are certainly the Bakken and the Eagle Ford.  And we feel very fortunate that we have very large, substantial positions in those, and we hope to add a few more smaller ones as we go along.  ","","Mark Papa ","I\u2019ll just add one thing to that.  There are some combo plays that we hope to uncover that could be substantially larger in terms of oil content, that I think are yet to be found, and we\u2019re still chasing those.  So there are still some substantial plays, I think, that will be uncovered, that may be similar to what we\u2019re talking about out there in the Delaware Basin.","Operator","Next question will come from Joe Allman with JPMorgan.","Joe Allman - JPMorgan ","In the core of the Bakken, what kind of Three Forks drilling have you done so far?  And is it possible that the Three Forks two or three could be prospective without the Three Forks one being prospective?","Bill Thomas ","In the core, I believe we\u2019ve only completed like maybe three or four wells in the Three Forks there, and those I believe are the first bench.  And so I think what we\u2019re noticing, industry wide, that there\u2019s a bit more success on the Three Forks than what maybe we had anticipated a few years ago.  And so we\u2019re really taking a second look at all that.  And we\u2019ll just have to see how that goes as we move on down the road.  I\u2019m sure that we\u2019ll be analyzing that and thinking about maybe drilling, on Three Forks, our core acreage as we go forward.","Joe Allman - JPMorgan ","And then in the Midland Basin, in the Wolfcamp, you indicated that it\u2019s more technically challenging than the Delaware Basin.  Could you talk about in what way it\u2019s more technically challenging, and what would you expect to be the outcome after you do your analysis?  And are your wells overall there in line with your 430,000 BOE type curve, or EUR estimate?","Bill Thomas ","The answer to the first question is yeah, we haven\u2019t changed our EUR per well.  It\u2019s still a growth, 430 MBOE per well.  The challenge there is just kind of twofold.  Number one is the rock quality in the Midland Basin is not quite as strong as what we see in the Wolfcamp and the Leonard plays in the Delaware Basin.  ","And then the second thing is that frack containment is more of an issue in the Midland Basin.  As you know, they have, at least in the areas we\u2019re working, we have three potential [pay zones], and so you drill a lateral in one of the pay zones and you frack a well, and it has a tendency to grow up into the other pay zone.  ","And then also, laterally, horizontally, away from the well bores, we\u2019re seeing that you have the interference between wells there if you\u2019re not careful.  But I would say this, we\u2019re optimistic that we\u2019ll be able to solve those issues, and to be able to contain the frack better vertically and horizontally.  ","And that\u2019s what it\u2019s going to take to add the multiple pays to the play, multiple pay targets, and also to decrease the spacing size.  So we\u2019re working diligently on that, but it\u2019s certainly more challenging than the plays in the Delaware Basin.  ","Operator","And that is all the time that we do have for questions today.  Mr. Papa, I\u2019ll turn things over to you for any additional or closing remarks.","Mark Papa","I have no additional remarks.  Thanks, everyone, for listening in.  "],"8897":["EOG Resources, Inc.

As a reminder, this call is being recorded.","At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Chief Financial Officer of EOG Resources, Mr. Tim Driggers. Please go ahead, sir.","Tim Driggers","Thank you. Good morning, and thanks for joining us. We hope everyone has seen the press release announcing first quarter 2019 earnings and operational results. This conference call includes forward-looking statements. The risks associated with forward-looking statements have been outlined in the earnings release in EOG's SEC filings, and we incorporate those by reference for this call.

EOG's goal is clear and simple, be one of the best companies across all sectors in the S&P 500 by realizing double-digit returns and double-digit organic growth through the commodity cycles. Our stellar first quarter performance demonstrates that we are lowering the cost of oil required to achieve that goal. We're confident in our ability to continue to decouple our performance from the commodity price cycles and that our sustainable business model will consistently deliver excellent results in the future. As a result, the Board of Directors approved a 31% increase to our dividend rate. The annualized dividend is now $1.15 per share and represents the largest single dollar increase in EOG's history. This is a tremendous vote of confidence in EOG's future and demonstrates a strong commitment to capital discipline and returning cash to shareholders through the dividend.","Our premium combination of high returns and organic growth is evident in every area of the company with 2019 shaping up to be one of the best operating performances in the company history. Well costs and operating costs are falling, and well productivity is strong. EOG is growing all volumes at lower cost per barrel than ever before. We are excited about 2019 and the outstanding operational and the financial results we are delivering.","Some of the highlights this quarter include year-over-year oil growth of 20%, exiting the high-end of our crude oil production target, capital expenditure below the low end of expectations, strong year-over-year lease operating and transportation per unit cost reductions, additional reductions and completed well costs. And we secured significant crude oil export capacity increasing our ability to receive the best prices. EOG continues to improve unit costs, capital efficiency and profitability. In fact, we made the same amount of net income compared to the first quarter of last year with significantly lower oil prices, a remarkable achievement demonstrating EOG's resiliency to low oil prices and the company's sustainable ability to continuously improve.","In addition to great results this year, we're excited about the steps we're taking to improve future results due our organic exploration of new high-quality plays. Our exploration focus in 15 years of experience drilling horizontal oil wells has generated mountains of proprietary data that gives us an edge in identifying new plays. We have 13 years of premium oil inventory. So we are squarely focused on further improving the quality of our inventory rather than just adding more quantity. Adding a low-cost organic inventory with better [rock] [ph] will enable the company to grow oil at lower costs and higher margins for years to come.","At EOG, we have an unwavering commitment to creating shareholder value through our long-standing business model, exploration-driven organic growth, operational excellence, technical leadership all underpinned by a distinctive culture. Our decentralized structure and focus on returns combined with our entrepreneurial, pleased but never satisfied mindset, continues to produce outstanding result today, and is set to produce sustainable improvements in the future. EOG has never been in better shape. And the company has never had a brighter future.","Next up is Billy to review our first quarter operational performance and outlook for the remainder of 2019.","Billy Helms","Thank you, Bill. Before I go into the quarter results, I want to be clear on this point. We will not increase CapEx. We remain confident in our 2019 plan, and activity will be adjusted throughout the year to achieve our production and capital objectives.","Now, onto the first quarter, our results reflect our tremendous efficiency gains that were beginning to emerge late last year and materialized more fully early this year. We delivered more oil, producing 436,000 barrels per day, exceeding our forecast. To be more specific, the wells completed at the end of last year are outperforming our forecast. And that trend has continued into the first quarter of this year.","Of equal importance, we spent less capital than expected. Our capital was well below our forecast for the quarter, as we are realizing the increase in efficiencies across our operations. Unit operating cost performance was also stellar, coming in at the low end of our forecast. And in the case of lease operating expense, we were well below our forecast. It\u2019s important to note that our strong operational execution is not related to the reduction in service costs, it\u2019s driven by our relentless quest for continuous improvements and our intense focus on developing new technology. All areas of our operations contributed to EOG's first quarter execution and capital efficiency.","First, our drilling teams continued to markedly improve their drilling times and performance. More importantly, the consistency of the improved performance can be seen across our entire rig fleet. This is a result of two factors. One, we made the decision to maintain the high performing drilling teams and services that are now consistently executing our internally engineered drilling program. In each of our major areas of activity, we continued to achieve new record drilling times and costs. And two, our drilling teams continued to adopt new technology processes and specialized tools that improve both drilling performance and repeatability. Ideas are developed in-house and deployed by partnering with service providers. For example, eliminating even one trip where the drill bed must be brought back to service can save up to $100,000. To capture those savings, we first analyze then design the best down hole motor to use in our bottom hole assembly and took additional step of bringing quality assurance in-house. As a result of having direct control of this equipment, we have observed a pronounced reduction in the number of trips, while also improving the rate of penetration. Together, reducing the trips and increasing the penetration rate is saving up to $400,000 per well. It\u2019s this type of innovation that helps EOG continue to deliver best-in-class drilling performance across all of our plays.","Second, our completion teams are experimenting with new design advancements that combine both technique and the use of new diverting agents. This proprietary formula is noticeably improving well performance, and equally important reducing completion costs. Well performance in these low permeability reservoirs improves due to enhanced fracture complexity. Completion costs are reduced due to lower material costs, and faster execution allows us to complete more lateral feet per day. The result is a solid improvement in our capital efficiency. Further testing and production time will yield more fulsome data and place specific recipes for each of our operating areas. But suffice to say that the early results are encouraging.","Finally, investments in strategic water, oil and gas infrastructure along with gathering partnerships allow us to leverage our scale in our core operating areas and are having a long-term sustainable impact on our operating costs, particularly lease operating expenses. We continue to evaluate additional high return, long-term impact opportunities to further reduce costs.","In summary, we've had a great start to 2019. Our operational teams are on track to deliver on our improved capital efficiency goals. Average well costs across our portfolio are down about 2.5%, halfway toward our 5% goal for the year. We've made significant progress towards our goal to reduce per barrel finding costs. These improvements will continue to drive down our DD&A rate over time, and along with unit operating costs improvements, enable EOG to achieve our return objective in low commodity price environments.","Here's Lance to provide a marketing update highlighted by our recent progress to secure Gulf Coast export capacity.","Lance Terveen","Thanks, Billy. EOG has established marketing agreements that provide access to crude oil export markets in Corpus Christi and Houston. Our capacity in Corpus Christi will ramp up from 100,000 barrels of oil per day in 2020 to 250,000 barrels of oil per day in 2022. We expect to sell crude oil to export markets from multiple plays, including the Eagle Ford and Delaware Basins.","As we illustrate on Slide 19, EOG will control its crude volumes from the basin all the way across the dock as our agreements provides for pipeline capacity, terminal tankage, and dock access. With the options of price our crude oil further downstream, we expand our flexibility to sell products to domestic or international markets, whichever provides the highest margins.","This optionality ensures strong price discovery and liquidity for EOG barrels. Our export marketing agreements are an example of our integrated marketing strategy, which is designed to achieve four objectives. First is control. Control means firm capacity of our product to the point where margins are maximized. Second is flexibility. We plan ahead to establish multiple options to deliver product to the highest net back market. Third is diversification. We take a portfolio approach knowing the optimal net back price will move around faster than we can adjust transportation agreements. Fourth is duration. We prefer shorter term contracts to avoid long-term high costs fix commitments. This strategy is reflected in advantage positioning of oil take away in the Permian Basin. EOG controls these barrels from the wellhead to the sales point. Delaware Basin barrels are transported out of basin on a fit for purpose gathering system for five pipeline interconnect points, which can transport the well anywhere from Cushing, Houston, Corpus Christi and even Midland. And we have accomplished this with limited long-term commitments and competitive transportation rates.","This strategy paid off in the first quarter. Despite the volatility of oil and natural gas prices in the Permian, EOG was able to flow all of its production and realize strong prices during the quarter. In aggregate, EOG's realized U.S. oil price was $1.21 above WTI in the first quarter, and our U.S. gas price is only $0.36 below Henry Hub. This is a tremendous achievement in navigating the volatile market. Crude oil and natural gas marketing is an integral part of EOG's value creation strategy. We anticipate future infrastructure needs to protect flow assurance and diversify our marketing options so that we can maximize our price realizations, net of transportation costs. We accomplish this by working closely with our operating teams in each of our major plays and divisions to understand the potential future development plans and by keeping up both on market fundamentals of each product and marketing point.","Our proven marketing strategy has helped EOG successfully navigate bottlenecks across all areas of operations, including most recently in the Permian basin. We measure the success of marketing efforts through our price realizations, which we highlight on slide number 20, as well as the transportation costs we incurred to deliver our production to market.","Next up is Ken to review the Eagle Ford highlights.","Ken Boedeker","Thanks Lance. The Eagle Ford remains the workhorse asset for EOG, earning high returns and delivering sustainable growth, while generating strong cash flow. EOG has been developing the Eagle Ford for about 10 years. However, less than 40% of the identified locations have been drilled.","Last year Eagle Ford production grew 9%. We forecast the Eagle Ford is capable of growing, for at least 10 more years at premium rates of return, while generating significant cash flow in excess of capital expenditures each year. More importantly, we believe the capital productivity of the Eagle Ford will continue to improve in the years ahead.","Sustainable cost reduction has been a key theme throughout our 10-year history developing the Eagle Ford. Even in a play that is already accumulated significant operating efficiencies, we were able to reduce drilling costs by 7%, and increase completed lateral fleet per day by over 50% in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 2018. In fact, the first quarter of 2019 was our best drilling efficiency quarter that we've ever had in the Eagle Ford on a dollar per foot basis, highlighting our culture of always getting better.","On the production side, we're continuing our efforts to further optimize artificial lift and manage water production, which will help us control lease operating expenses longer term. Drilling in our Western Eagle Ford acreage continues to deliver strong premium returns, net present value, finding costs and capital efficiency. Our Western acreage will be a crucial component of long-term growth for the play, and we expect it will make up the majority of our Eagle Ford drilling program by 2021, growing from about 40% of our program in 2019. Capital efficiency in the West is caught up over time and is nearing parity with the East as illustrated on Slide 39. Compared to the East laterals in the West are longer and per foot drilling costs are lower, so productivity and economics per well are competitive.","Our proprietary enhanced oil recovery process in the Eagle Ford continues to perform the technical and commercial expectations. EUR is a secondary recovery process in this play and primary development remains the main focus of our operations in 2019. The EUR footprint will be expanded after a larger portion of the play has been fully developed. The best days of the Eagle Ford are still ahead. We continue to convert non-premium inventory to premium status through sustainable cost reductions, productivity improvements and leasehold consolidation. The Eagle Ford is a strong growth asset for EOG, and we expect it to remain one for many years ahead.","Now here's Ezra to discuss the Delaware basin.","Ezra Yacob","Thanks, Ken. In the Delaware basin, we continue to improve on operational momentum we gained last year. Retaining top-performing drilling rigs and completion crews toward the end of 2018 had an immediate impact on the first quarter. We drilled and completed 78 gross wells across six different premium targets with just 18 rigs and seven completion crews. Compared to the first quarter of 2018, we drilled and completed 42% more lateral fleet. However, we use one less rig and one less completion crew. As a result, we\u2019ve made strong progress towards our full year cost reduction goals.","In addition, we reduced drilling days by 29%, transferred 99% of our water by pipe, which reduces traffic and saved $2 per barrel compared to trucking. Source more than 70% of our water through reuse and reduced total wells cost by 5%.","Finally, first quarter wells are outperforming our expectations and we beat our production and financial targets for the first quarter, including capital expenditures. The result is a first quarter development program that achieved in all-in finding costs below $10 per barrel of equivalent, while earning $9 million of MPB per well, and an average 100% direct rate of return.","EOG is a vast industry leading 400,000 net acre position in the core of the Delaware Basin. The rock is about one mile thick and geologically complex. Due to our 15 years of experience drilling horizontal oil wells, we have accelerated the learning curve in this basin. As a result, even though the Delaware Basin is still early in its evolution and one of our highest growth areas, this asset is already creating significant value through high return drilling, low operating expense and positive cash flow just three short years since focusing on its development.","I\u2019ll now turn is over to Tim Driggers to discuss our financials and capital structure.","Tim Driggers","Thanks, Ezra. EOG had strong financial performance in the first quarter. The company generated discretionary cash flow of $1.9 billion, invested $1.7 billion in capital expenditures before acquisitions, which was below the low end of our guidance and paid $128 million in dividends. This left $55 million in free cash flow. In addition, we invested $303 million in bolt-on property acquisitions located in new exploration areas. As part of our debt reduction plan, we expect to repay the $900 million bonds scheduled to mature on June 1 with cash on hand, which, as of March 31st was $1.1 billion.","I\u2019m happy to report Moody\u2019s recognized EOG's growing financial strength last month upgrading EOG's credit rating to A3 with the stable outlook. To quote the Moody\u2019s press release announcing the upgrade the company stated. The upgrade of EOG's rating into the A category recognizes the company\u2019s high capital productivity, backed by operating excellence and a long life high quality asset base that will continue to underpin the strong credit profile and that a number of oil price scenarios. The A3 rating is also supported by the company\u2019s conservative financial policies.","Last but not least, we announced the dividend increase of 31% in the yesterday\u2019s earnings release. The indicated annual rate is now $1.15 per share. EOG have added hedges for 150,000 barrels of oil per day at an average price of $62.50. This covers about one-third of our crude oil production over the remainder of 2019. For natural gas, we added hedges for 250,000 MMBTU per day at an average price of $2.90, which is about 20% of our U.S. natural gas production through October. We believe the decision to lock in a portion of our crude - our current crude oil and natural gas prices is prudent considering the volatility and prices and high return on investment of our capital program at these prices.","I\u2019ll turn it back over to Bill for closing remarks.","Bill Thomas","Thanks, Tim. I have a few highlights to leave you with. First, we are running under plan on capital and over plan on volumes, and we\u2019re not raising capital. Second, EOG has tremendous momentum across all facets of the business, drilling, completions, operating expenses, marketing and exploration. Third, we're still getting better. Along with continuous cost reduction and strong well performance, we're optimistic our low cost organic exploration efforts this year will increase the quality of our inventory even further and lower the cost of future oil production. Fourth, our export marketing agreements provide direct access to international markets and expand our ability to capture the best prices. Fifth, the dividend increase shows our confidence in our sustainable business model to deliver performance through the commodity price cycles.","And finally, our sustainable business model is driven by our culture. We have an insatiable drive to continue to get better. We're confident EOG can deliver double-digit returns and double-digit growth and achieve our goal of being one of the best performing companies in the S&P500 through commodity price cycles, long into the future.","Thanks for listening. And now we'll go to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions] Your first question will come from Neal Dingmann of SunTrust Robinson, Humphrey. Please go ahead.","Neal Dingmann","My first question, maybe, Bill, for you. Could you all speak to your plans of -- you've done a great job of balancing growth for shareholder return. And, really, when you look at that, you've almost doubled now your dividend in the last year, while production growing about 30% here over the last year. So oil was up only about 15%. So my question would be, specifically if oil stays here or goes higher, would you stick with the 12% to 16% oil growth plans? And if so, what would you do with the potential material amount of free cash flow?","Bill Thomas","First of all, I think it's really clear we said that on our first call of the year that we're not going to be shifting into a lower growth mode. And we don't have specifics on 2020 oil growth. But certainly, you can think of the company in the -- our 14% oil growth target this year is really a bit on the low end. And so we're really focused on high return oil growth. And that's the way we believe will create the most value for our shareholders on the long-term. You heard, I think from Ezra, the tremendous rates of return and the NPV we're creating on each well we're drilling. So that's the priority for us in the future. And that's way we think we're going to continue to generate the most value in the long term.","Neal Dingmann","Very good. And maybe my second question would be for Billy or Ezra, could you just discuss, particularly in the Perm, your PDP decline expectations, I mean, in the prepared remarks, I think you all commented just how much better these new wells are than a year ago. So I'm just wondering is that true as far as how these wells are holding up? Or just anything you could discuss towards how you're seeing these wells after a number of months?","Billy Helms","Yes, Neal. This is Billy. I think in general across all of our plays, you see that as we drill longer laterals that doesn\u2019t necessarily translate to directionally higher IP 30s per well. But we see the performance hang in there longer, you see little bit lot lower decline over time. And I think that's really, if you look at the first quarter results, that's what's driving a lot of our performance, sustained improvement in all our programs. And it's a function of just the quality of the wells, the better execution across the wells and the focus of the teams. Ezra, you want to add anything or?","Ezra Yacob","I'll just highlight too that the team's done a great job in the Permian in the last year really learning a lot about the reservoir, figuring out across our acreage position, which targets need to be co-developed together, the spacing both horizontally and vertically. And when you combine that increase in well productivity with our excellent operational execution, that's why you're seeing the lower finding cost I discussed in the opening remarks and the higher capital efficiency, which we've great success, is going to continue throughout the year.","Operator","The next question will be from Doug Leggate of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Doug Leggate","So I would just like to touch on the acquisition capital and, obviously you're not going to tell us where you're acquiring, I guess. But some ideas to what we can expect that plays to look like going forward was -- first quarter very much one off or should we expect some kind of sustainable level of acquisition spending as we go forward?","Bill Thomas","Doug, your question, because it's difficult to hear you, it was a little bit garbled. So could you be a little bit more clear there?","Doug Leggate","I apologize. I'm on my cell phone. I'd be coming in okay now Bill.","Bill Thomas","Yes, go ahead.","Doug Leggate","So my question was on the level of acquisition capital going forward. Was first quarter very much a one-off or should we expect acquisition capital to be something of a repeating pattern as we go forward for a period?","Bill Thomas","Okay. Thank you. That was better. Yes, we, as you know the company, we're not really focused on corporate M&As. But we do occasionally look at bolt-on type acquisitions and they're focused primarily in our exploration plays. And these acquisitions are very low cost and very, very high potential, obviously, or we wouldn't be interested in doing them. And they're kind of one-offs. And so it's not something you're going to see repeatedly over every quarter. And so I'm not saying we're not going to do another one this year or not. We don't have any plans at this point to do anymore. But they're really opportunistic drilling, opportunistic given and certainly our focus on very, very high return and low cost drilling potential.","Doug Leggate","I appreciate the answer. Hopefully you can still hear me. My follow-up is just a quick one. Obviously, really pleased to see the dividend increase, I'm sure a lot of people would applaud that. But I'm curious, what do you think the right payout ratio as for an E&P company in other words, as you get to where your longer-term plans go, what do you think that right percentage of your operating cash flow should be being returned to shareholders? And I'll leave it there. Thanks.","Bill Thomas","Well, certainly, I think that's operator or company dependent, I don't think there's any one answer for any company. For EOG, specifically we\u2019re generating super high, fantastic returns on every dollar we spend. And so we believe our allocation on reinvesting in very, very high rate premium drilling is a number one priority. We also strongly believe as we\u2019ve demonstrated this quarter in strong, sustainable dividend growth. And we think that\u2019s the best way to get cash back to shareholders. And then, we're also very focused on having a pristine balance sheet. And we think that\u2019s just a fundamental good business practice. And it gives us an enormous advantage, especially for counter cyclic opportunities in the future. So that\u2019s kind of our allocation. And I think that's very unique to EOG's business model. And I think it\u2019s very sustainable for us.","Operator","The next question will be from Charles Meade of Johnson Rice. Please go ahead.","Charles Meade","I have a question about your CapEx just year-over-year. If you look at the way you guys have had posted 1Q, and your guidance for 2Q, you have a first half is heavier than the back half. And we saw that same pattern in 2018. So my question is that a feature or manifestation of your planning process? Or was that more just a coincidence with the way that 2019, 2018 had shaken out?","Billy Helms","Yes, Charles. This is Billy Helms. So yes, our first quarter CapEx was about 27% of our total annual budget. And in the first half, you can look at our guidance will be slightly more weighted towards the first half than we are in the second half. And we have confidence that we\u2019ll be able to meet our capital on production goals for the year. So I expect as we go through the year, you\u2019ll see us adjust our schedule, probably slight reduction in the second half. But also it\u2019s not just related to the cadence of rigs. We also have infrastructure spend and lease hold spend that happens in a quarter. So I think we\u2019re very - what I would say is we\u2019re very confident. We\u2019ll be able to make our production goal and stay within our CapEx that we\u2019ve outlined. And it\u2019s really kind of early to provide guidance for how we\u2019ll ratio that down through the year. And we have a lot of flexibility operating multiple basins. So it will fluctuate as we go through the year.","Charles Meade","And then one, I guess kind of more targeted question on the Delaware Basin position. I noticed that the - your Bone Springs laterals are significantly shorter. I think its 5,500 lateral feet versus really 7,500 or 7,800 on other zones in that same basin. Can you elaborate a little bit on what maybe going on there? Is it about the lease configuration where you\u2019re developing those Bone Springs? Or was a more decision about the way you need to stimulate that formation?","Ezra Yacob","Yes, Charles, this is Ezra. That\u2019s a great question. Really, you picked up on there in the lateral half of your question, it really just comes down the lease configuration where shape of our drilling units are. I think in general, as you\u2019ve seen, as we look back at our well results quarter-over-quarter, we\u2019re trying to get longer with our laterals across all of our plays. And the reason for that is that simply the cost per foot is so much less that are really increases the capital efficiency. And so I'd look in the future to see that Bone Spring getting longer as well.","Operator","The next question will be from Tim Rezvan of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.","Tim Rezvan","Eagle Ford inventory depth remains a focus for investors. And I noted pretty interesting comments in the release about high grading the residual 4,900 non premium locations. Is this just a matter of sort of cheaper well costs, longer laterals and the new completions? Or is it really more toward from a delineation or aspiration point of view? And kind of how high is getting that number up? How high is that on your priority list this year?","Ken Boedeker","Yes, Tim, this is Ken. As far as converting those non premium locations to premium, we look at that several ways, we look at that, we're trying to reduce the well costs and improve the productivity of the wells. So we're always looking at being able to do that and looking at all the different areas. We're actually doing several different packages and tests to improve our conversion of non-premium to premium throughout the year and throughout our acreage position. So we have a significant number of those laterals to drill this year and we have a significant number to convert in the future. We're also drilling a lot longer laterals as we go towards the West. And that'll help convert some of those non premium wells to premium.","Tim Rezvan","Okay. So you expect to see that number, maybe grand higher throughout the year?","Ken Boedeker","That's what we're working towards.","Tim Rezvan","Then my follow-up, your proxy came out in March, and it's stated that less than 90% of wells drilled in 2018 qualified as premium. I was hoping to better understand what that means. Does that mean that well level returns didn't hit threshold? Or does it mean that there was more exploratory drilling in that year? And just thinking about maybe how we should think about that in 2019 given the exploratory focus? Thanks.","Bill Thomas","Yes, Tim, it means that a few of the wells that we drilled, and there is a very few in the total package of wells we drilled last year were either step-out wells or exploration wells in areas where we did -- maybe didn't have the infrastructure in place or we're on the learning curve in some of the spacing tests didn't quite make the 30% after tax rate return at $40 flat. It doesn't mean those wells didn\u2019t or weren't really strong economics. Those wells are fantastic economics, probably better than the -- probably are non premium. Those are better than the average for the whole industry on returns. But it was just a very few of those. And that's what we have.","Tim Rezvan","And just to push, do you have a number on that? Is that 11% or is it kind of higher number?","Bill Thomas","I\u2019m sorry. Off the top of my head, I don't have the number.","Operator","The next question will be from Paul Grigel of Macquarie. Please go ahead.","Paul Grigel","In the release you discussed testing additional targets in the Woodford. Could you elaborate on what you would be seeing there? And what timeframe we could see results from that portion of the program?","Ken Boedeker","Yes, this is Ken. We're continuing to test other areas in the Woodford. As we get additional information on that and anything material we\u2019ll release to you guys. I would like to make a point we've really made great strides in the operational efficiency in that. In the Woodford play this year, we've almost dropped our drilling costs down and met our target for the year. So we do still plan to complete about 30 wells in the area this year, and we're real pleased with the progress that we've made.","Paul Grigel","Okay. And then earlier in the call there was a comment made as the Eagle Ford program matures and there's more development opportunities, the expansion to EOR program will occur. Could you elaborate on -- is that by area? Is that geological testing? Is that simply you just need to make sure that the wells are matured in the pit at certain level? Just trying to understand when the EOR program could see expansion throughout the Eagle Ford?","Ken Boedeker","This is Ken again. We'll expand the EOR as we really finish up with our primary development in those areas. We'll expand that in the areas that make sense based on some of the results that we've seen already with the EOR program. So it's really a matter of finishing up primary development in a lot of those areas.","Paul Grigel","Is that a certain number of years after initial development or just trying to understand when primary development is considered to be finished?","Ken Boedeker","I would guess, I would classify primary development as finished when we quit drilling wells in those areas and we can begin the EOR process.","Operator","The next question will be from Leo Mariani of KeyBanc. Please go ahead.","Leo Mariani","Hey guys, just wanted to follow-up a little bit on the dividend increase here. Obviously, as you pointed out very material increase for EOG, why do you get a sense is to whether or not you guys might be seeking a yield that's a little closer to kind of the 2% that the S&P 500 has you know out there? And then additionally, just with respect to the dividend, is there some kind of price level, for example, on the oil side that you guys may stress test that too? Or for example, you say hey, at $45, we need to be confident that we can manage that and still target our production growth? Just any color you had around that will be helpful.","Bill Thomas","Leo, yes, this is Bill. Yes, certainly the dividend increase is evaluated every quarter. Obviously, the macro view of oil prices and our ability to sustain the dividend is a very important thing. We've never cut the dividend ever in the history of EOG, and we don't ever want to do that. So when we make a commitment on the dividend, we make a commitment. And our commitment, the last two years has been, as we stated, we wanted to increase the dividend faster than our 19% historical average. So the last two years, we've increased to 31%. And so our focus on the future is to continue to do that. We will give a specific number, but certainly we want to have very strong dividend growth for a long number of years. And that's a commitment that we're making to our shareholders.","Leo Mariani","And I just wanted to jump over to the exploration front. I guess, clearly you guys made a couple of bolt-on acquisitions in the first quarter, and I hope that bolstering that effort. But I certainly sensed a fair bit of excitement around the exploration effort this year from your comments. I'm supposing that you're not going to be ready to share results. But just based on sort of what you're seeing out there, can you qualitatively indicate whether or not you think some of this is working, and might we get some announcements here in 2019 from EOG on that front?","Ezra Yacob","Yes, Leo, this is Ezra. Thanks for the question. As we discussed earlier in the year and in the opening comments like you suggested, we\u2019re pretty excited about the exploration opportunities. We're really focused on applying our drilling and completions techniques to higher quality unconventional reservoirs. And what really drives our process of having a multi-basin dataset that allows us to compare contrast different reservoir characteristics of each of the sweet spots in the established plays that we\u2019re in. And we apply that to new ideas and areas. As Bill highlighted, we\u2019re not just interested in adding quantity, but really increasing the quality of our premium inventory. And that really should continue to reduce our finding costs, lower our DDNA, and help achieve our long-term goals of double-digit growth and returns. And when we have a little more insight and color, something little more material, we\u2019ll certainly update you guys.","Leo Mariani","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And I guess could have noticed the marketing sort of arrangement for the export capacity that you folks signed up here. I just wanted to get a sense has EOG already been exporting oil barrels internationally at this point? And it certainly seems that there is a potential big increase coming over the next couple of years. Just wanted to get a sense of whether or not you've already got some relationships there to international buyers out there that you\u2019re hoping to expand?","Lance Terveen","Yes, Leo, good morning. This is Lance. So thanks for the question. Yes, when you think about the existing business, I mean we\u2019ve been very active in Houston for quite some. I mean Houston is really kind of been our warehouses, especially since 2012 with a lot of our pipeline capacity that comes into the Houston market. But since the export bans unlisted, we\u2019ve been actively engage there. We\u2019ve got a tank position is there as well. So we\u2019ve been making spot sales for quite some time, especially looking in the last year too. So we\u2019ve been active on that front. And so we\u2019re very excited too about our new capacity that's going to be starting up moving into next year. Really when you think about and you look at the balances in the U.S., you look at supply growth, you look at imports -- exports are going to be here the same. And we really want to have a very large position there. And having that control at the dock, we feel that just going to give us a lot of price discovery. But again it\u2019s about portfolio approach. I mean we want to protect those realizations. And so moving into the next year and you look - we feel we\u2019re going to be very well positioned with our -- its just unique that we\u2019re going to have our Permian, and also our Eagle Ford that we\u2019re going to be able to show across the dock. So we feel we\u2019re very unique relative to when you look at the producer group on the different quality. So we\u2019re going to be able to show to the domestic market, but then also our international customers too.","Operator","The next question will be from Jeffrey Campbell of Tuohy Brothers Investment Research. Please go ahead. ","Jeffrey Campbell","I just wanted to touch basic on the various technological efforts there analysis all the stuff you\u2019re doing. You called it up again. And it sounded like it was, perhaps getting even more and more into the daily field operations. So I was wondering if you just give us a little bit color on that? Thank you.","Billy Helms","Yes. Jeff, this is Billy Helms. I can add a little bit of color to that. I think part of that goes down to our very culture of the company, we\u2019re always trying to get better of what we do. And the way we do that as we look at all the details, and we gather lots and lots of data and we\u2019ve had these systems in place for some time. And then, the key part of that is delivering that data back to our team, so they can exercise good decisions on how to improve our operations and the way we just do our business in all aspects. And we're seeing that manifest itself on the drilling highlights that we offer today as well as the completion highlight improvements that we\u2019re seeing. So on the drilling side we\u2019re monitoring the daily rate of penetration on all of our drilling rigs, and making sure our drilling times are not just keeping up with what we're doing, but how do we continue to get better. And so the results we're seeing today are direct reflection, our ability to gather the data and transport that back and analyze it and deliver it to the field and have the guys making the decisions. So it is part of our culture, real time returns focused decision making.","Jeffrey Campbell","So for example, the thing that you talked about earlier today, where you're coming up with new completion methods that are using diverters more effectively and you're cutting costs accordingly. These kind of efforts are emanating from all this data analysis that you just talked about?","Billy Helms","Absolutely. And we're using -- more importantly, and we're using that data real time. So we're actually making decisions based on the pressure rates -- pressures and rates we're seeing on the wells we're not only fracking, but the offset wells to make decisions about how to implement our formula. And so that's why the formula is not a cookie cutter formula you can apply everywhere, its tailored, its specifically designed by each well, by each zone, depending on the target zone and their offsets. It takes an integral approach to be able to analyze the data real time and make the right decisions.","Jeffrey Campbell","Okay. And if I could just ask a quick follow up to that. This is -- when we're thinking about it, is this part of the 5% goal to get costs down? Or is that 5% goal more based on logistics and contracting and that sort of thing?","Bill Thomas","No. That's a good question, Tim. I would add to that that really none of the cost savings we're seeing today are a factor of service cost reductions. It is strictly improving efficiencies, lowering our costs by doing things better as well as making better wells. So we're seeing the double effect reducing costs, improving well performance. And it's all directly related to our ability to analyze -- collect the data and analyze it real time.","Operator","The next question will be from Jeanine Wai of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Jeanine Wai","My question is on sand. A sand provider recently commented that some E&Ps are switching back to northern white from local sand due to crushing reasons, which I guess there could be production and cost implications through E&Ps. And I know EOG does a lot of its own testing, and I believe you are an early mover in this area. So you probably have more data than anyone on this. Can you discuss your thoughts on kind of the treatment commentary and how much exposure you have to local sand? Any basins specifically you have would be really helpful too?","Bill Thomas","Yes, Jeanine, this is Bill. Certainly, we got a tremendous -- we got 20 years of history in horizontal shale plays. And we use every kind of sand pop-up material that's been available over the years. Currently, we're focused on using local sand, certainly in the Permian. That\u2019s a big cost saver for us, and certainly the industry too. So we're going to continue to do that. And we're also, I think shifting to local sand in the other play, such as Eagle Ford, and many of the Rocky place, and in Oklahoma too. So that's the direction that we're focused in. And along with a diversion material, we're making significantly better wells and lower cost wells. We do have our own testing facilities. We've been engaged in capturing sand in multiple sources. And we screen it and test it. And we're very confident at the sand we use in every play. It's kind of tailor fit for each play. We're very confident that the compressive strengths and the quality of sand that we use in each play is the right mix for long-term well performance.","Jeanine Wai","Okay. I think the commentary that's kind of chain leading around, I think maybe the Eagle Ford and the Midcon outside of the Permian. And so you do use local sand in those areas as well and you're satisfied?","Bill Thomas","Yes. We're satisfied.","Operator","The next question will be from Brian Singer of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Brian Singer","One of the debates out there is whether for EOG, but also for industry is whether the best of the inventory infield is drilled from either a productivity perspective or rate of return perspective. And I think for EOG, you're more specifically pushing back on this point with the comparison of the Eagle Ford East versus West area. I was wondering if you could touch on two other areas. The first is the Permian, and your outlook for the ability of efficiency and productivity gains from here to overcome movement from core to less core over time. And the second is exploration. I think there was a comment earlier that you expect your exploration efforts will lower the cost of future oil production. What has given you confidence that that is the case if it is truly exploratory?","Ezra Yacob","Yes, Brian, thank you for the question. This is Ezra. Let me start with the back half of that question first on the exploration side. And what we're excited about on our exploration opportunities is we feel like we've identified multiple opportunities where we have an opportunity to apply some of the data and the techniques that we've been learning on the Eagle Ford, the Woodford, the Permian and the Powder. We can take some of these techniques and apply them to basically higher quality reservoir. That's still should be considered unconventional by nature. And we think that well productivity should be on par with some of our best wells with shallower decline, basically due to the reservoir quality. The other important thing, obviously is that you've touched on is being a first mover in these basins and being able to capture the sweet spots of each of these plays.","If I transition now, and sorry, I did this in reverse order, but if I go to the Permian, for example, I think the way to think about the Permian and one reason we spent the time highlighting the progress that we've made in the Eagle Ford is that every year one of the benefits of working in multiple basins is yet to combine datasets from multiple basins. And those learnings, as you roll them in and integrate them into the front end of both your geologic models, your drilling and your completions techniques, that's what allows us to improve some of what today might be considered a non-core area and really improve those well productivity results and continue to drive down our costs to increase the returns of those areas. So the best example I would say for the Permian is really looking back at that Eagle Ford, example, and how we've taken our Western Eagle Ford results today, and really improve them to a point where they are above and beyond what we're doing in the Eastern Eagle Ford just a few years ago.","Brian Singer","And then my follow-up is with regards to the Powder River Basin. You highlighted that made some progress on the infrastructure front. Can you add some more color there, particularly in how big you're sizing that infrastructure, and how significant you think production to be, especially given the competitive profitability you\u2019ve highlighted at least as it relates to that Niobrara and Mowry zones on your Slide 41. The turnover wasn\u2019t there maybe that would be another point to touch on.","Billy Helms","Yes, Brian. This is Billy Helms. Yes, the first quarter we really tested more Turner and apartment zones, particularly. And as we build out infrastructure for the bigger development, it\u2019s, I think our infrastructure build will be -- build out in segments to keep pace where there are plans for drilling in that year\u2019s program. We\u2019re not going to get out ahead and build infrastructure this made for a longer-term drilling program just because of the capital efficiency if that erodes. So the size though the scale of the infrastructure will be able to handle, certainly even the plan that we have in place for those areas. So we\u2019ll be adequately sized, but it\u2019ll be scheduled and pace that keeps up with the current drilling plans for that period. So we got off to a slow start really in the Powder, really due to weather, we plan to ramp up activity as we go through the year. And we\u2019re still very excited about the initial results we\u2019re seeing from the Mowry and Niobrara tests. And as get more data on those, certainly we\u2019ll provide more color there. But we\u2019re still excited about the Powder opportunities we see in front of us.","Operator","The next question will be from Ryan Todd of Simmons Energy. Please go ahead.","Ryan Todd","Maybe a couple of follow-ups and some other things. And I appreciate the clarity you have given on the Eagle Ford. And if we look at the -- on the improvement that you\u2019re seeing out to the West, as we look at the type curve that you carry in the Eagle Ford, it\u2019s got 5,300 foot lateral lengths with the concerned level of productivity there. The lateral there feels like it's clearly trending higher. Is it safe to say that as the lateral lengths increases? And as the West is improved, is that type curve probably conservative relative to what we should expect to see going forward?","Kenneth Boedeker","Yes, Ryan. This is Ken, again. We are really pleased with the way the wells have been reacting out there and our well productivity is meeting the expectations. We do see the performance variations across the 120 mile long acreage position. And as we extend our - as we extend the laterals in the West, we'll be seeing well productivity increase, well rates and capital efficiency increase out there as well as reducing finding costs.","Ryan Todd","And then maybe a follow-up on some of the acquisition activity and exploration versus your core basins, your - you\u2019ve obviously been spending money picking up acreage in some of your core basins you\u2019re really excited about. And is this -- do you still see opportunities to add the positions in your core areas of operations? Or is the valuation outside of those basins just far more compelling at this point?","Bill Thomas","Ryan, this is Bill. Certainly, we have a very decentralized exploration effort. All seven of our domestic divisions have very strong exploration staff. So we\u2019re working, literally every basin, in the U.S., probably not a well being drilled. We don\u2019t know something about. And so, we\u2019re leasing in multiple plays this year at very low cost. And we believe the prospects that we're leasing on have premium economic potential due to the rock quality as Ezra talked about.","And so, some of them are in basins that have had a lot of historical production, some of them are in places where there's not really much historic production at all. But they're all very high quality. And the size of the prospects we're working on, we use an example, couple of years ago, we talked about the Woodford oil play we introduced. That's about 200 million barrels of net EOG. That's kind of on the small size. So we're not looking for things smaller than that. But 200 million barrels, net to a company, discovery of that top anywhere in the world is very significant. So, last year, we announced two new plays in the Powder River Basin that totaled 1.9 billion barrels. So that's a very large one. So that's a good way to put the brackets on the size of them. But the good thing is, as Ezra talked about, we believe we can continue, and it'll organically generate significant prospects potential in the future. And added at very, very low cost, much, much lower costs than doing M&As. And so when we do these bolt-on acquisitions, there are large amounts of acreage are very, very low cost, and very, very high potential in our mind. And so we've been generating premium inventory twice as fast as we've been drilling it. And the quality of our inventory is going up at the same time. So some of the previous questions are based on, is EOG's inventory quality declining? And I can tell you-- we can tell you with absolute confidence that we believe our inventory quality will continue to improve. So the quality is going up. And we're not having any problem replacing at much faster than we\u2019re drilling it.","Operator","The next question will be from Arun Jayram of JP Morgan. Please go ahead.","Arun Jayram","I wanted to see if you could elaborate on your comments on 2020. I know you don't have an official growth target for 2020. But your comments this morning seem to indicate your confidence that the company could grow the oil production, call it, greater than 14%.","And I just wonder maybe qualitatively, what would drive you to have that level of confidence because it would be off of a larger base of production this year?","Bill Thomas","Yes, Arun. We have that confidence because, I think of the culture of the company and the structure of the company and our ability to continue to add new plays to the system. We have a chart in our IR deck, I believe, it's on Page 11. That shows EOG's existing plays and their maturity phase. So most of the things that we're doing right now still have a lot of growth opportunity. And we're adding additional premium locations in each one of those plays. So that's a big source of new potential. And then, we're working on all these emerging plays. And as they come into the development mode, that will keep shifting more and more activity and inventory into the growth mode of the company. And the growth mode for each one of these plays are not a few years, they're multi years, 10 plus, 15 years growth mode for each one of these plays. And then the structure of our company, because it's decentralized, we can execute on the large number of multiple plays at the same time with a lot of discipline. So we have very expert strong staff in seven different operating divisions. So we can truly execute in multiple basins and continue to reduce costs, improve technology, be very entrepreneurial and act quickly and make really quick, crisp, good high rate of return decisions on each one of the plays at the same time. So the company has got a tremendous ability to continue our high return growth profile for a very, very long time. And I think that's quite unique in the industry.","Arun Jayram","And just one question in terms of the agreements they are in place to expand your export capacity from 100,000 barrels to 250,000. For those barrels that you are able to even with that capacity, how should we think about the uplift relative to WTI from those types of barrels? One of your peers has highlighted maybe the ability to get in 60% of the Brent TI spread, let's call $3 in transportation. I was wondering if there's maybe a formula, anyway we could think about the uplift that you get on those barrels?","Bill Thomas","We won't go into the detail on what we may or may not speculate on what we think the uplift. The most important thing right is it\u2019s a portfolio approach to us. When we have the diversification, we're going to have the capability there to sell domestically. So if that's a higher realized net back for us, then we can sell them domestically. And as you think about our export capacity, it\u2019s capacity that we can optimize. So again, like if you if you look back over time, you look at our experience, our goal is to maintain our price realizations, and being purely in price realizations. So we feel that dock capacity that we have there just positions us that we have agreements in place that we can transact very quickly and we can make sales into the spot business, and we can keep it on the international index like the Brent indices or we can keep it at the local markets. But we can take advantage of where the pricing leads us, and we can move very quickly. That's the way you probably need to think about that from our standpoint, which is we can move quickly and we have the capacity. And we can also -- we can meet that capacity with the Permian and also the Delaware. I think that's also very unique.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to hand the conference back over to Mr. Thomas for his closing remarks.","Bill Thomas","In closing, we first want to say thank you to the tremendous work by everyone at EOG. The company is starting 2019 with our best operational performance in company history. Costs are coming down and allow us -- allowing us to deliver more oil for less money than ever before. The best part of EOG's culture is that we're not through getting better. We're excited about where we are, but we're even more excited about our future. Thanks for listening. And thanks for your support.","Operator","Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, the conference has concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Chief Financial Officer of EOG Resources, Tim Driggers. Please go ahead, sir.","Tim Driggers","Good morning, and thanks for joining us. We hope everyone has seen the press release announcing fourth quarter and full year 2014 earnings and operational results.","This conference call includes forward-looking statements. The risks associated with forward-looking statements have been outlined in the earnings release and EOG's SEC filings, and we incorporate those by reference for this call.","This conference call also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation schedules for these non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures can be found on our website at www.eogresources.com.","The SEC permits oil and gas companies in their filings with the SEC to disclose not only proved reserves, but also probable reserves, as well as possible reserves. Some of the reserve estimates on this conference call and webcast may include potential reserves or other estimated reserves not necessarily calculated in accordance with or contemplated by the SEC's reserve reporting guidelines.","We incorporate by reference the cautionary note to U.S. investors that appears at the bottom of our press release and Investor Relations page of our website.","Participating on the call this morning are, Bill Thomas, Chairman and CEO; Gary Thomas, Chief Operating Officer; Billy Helms, EVP, Exploration and Production; David Trice, EVP, Exploration and Production; Lance Terveen, VP, Marketing; and Cedric Burgher, Senior VP, Investor and Public Relations.","An updated IR presentation was posted to our website yesterday evening and we included guidance for the first quarter and full year 2015 in yesterday's press release. This morning we will discuss topics in the following order. Bill Thomas will review 2014 highlights and our 2015 capital plan, David Trice and Billy Helms will review operational results and year-end reserve replacement data. Then I\u2019ll discuss EOG's financials, capital structure and hedge position, and Bill will provide concluding remarks.","Now here is Bill Thomas.","Bill Thomas","Thank you, Tim. 2014 was another record year for EOG. Our results continue to demonstrate our return-focused capital discipline and EOG\u2019s superior ability to apply technology to the exploration and development of [tight] plays. Here are the highlights.","Number one, EOG demonstrated its capital efficiency by earnings peer leading returns. ROE for 2014 was 16% and ROCE was 14%. For the year we increased crude oil production by 31% driven by our top three oil plays, the Eagle Ford, Bakken and Delaware Basin. NGL production increased 23% and natural gas production held flat, yielding total company production growth of 17%.","We announced five new plays, four in the Rockies, DJ and Powder River Basins, and the Second Bone Spring Sand play on the Delaware basin side of the Permian. These plays add flexibility to our portfolio of options to grow production in the coming years. Also in the Delaware Basin we identified an oil window in our existing Wolfcamp acreage. Early in 2014, we increased the reserve potential in the Eagle Ford to 1 billion barrels of oil equivalent to 3.2 billion barrels of oil equivalent net to EOG.","Between that Eagle Ford reserve increase and the new Rockies play alone, we added 1.4 billion barrels of potential reserves to our portfolio and 2300 high return net drilling locations. In recent years, we have consistently added twice as many locations as we drilled. Finally EOG remained laser focused on cost by driving down per well expenses in all of our major plays while simultaneously driving up well productivity.","Before I move on to 2015 I would like to expand on that last highlight. We have demonstrated a unique ability to get the most out of tight oil plays from both a cost and well productivity standpoint. Over the last 10 years, we have developed expertise over all the disciplines required to drill in shale and other tight rocks and make that drilling highly economical. This proven ability is why we posted strong returns in 2014, and why we are so well positioned to not only weather the current low price environment, but to take advantage of it.","So now let us talk about EOG\u2019s goals for 2015. First, our overarching goal this year is to prepare for oil price recovery. It is clear that current prices are too low to meet the world\u2019s supply needs and the market will rebalance. We would be ready to respond swiftly when oil prices improve and resume our leadership and high return oil growth.","Second, we do not believe that growing oil in what could turn out to be a short cycle low price environment is the right thing to do. And let me repeat, we do not believe that growing oil in what could turn out to be a short cycle low price environment is the right thing to do. We remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet at today\u2019s scrip prices. 2015 cash flows should fund our CapEx budget of approximately $5 billion.","Third, returns are what matter. Therefore we will focus capital on the Eagle Ford, Bakken and Delaware Basin plays. At $55 oil, these premier assets deliver a direct after-tax rate of return greater than 35% without factoring in the potential for additional service cost reductions.","I will now explain in further detail how we plan to prepare for the oil price recovery. First, we will reduce average rigs 50% down to 27% for 2015 and intentionally delay any of our completions, building a significant inventory of approximately 350 uncompleted wells. This allows EOG to use rigs under existing commitments and when prices improve we will be poised to ramp up completions.","Oil price improvement of even a few dollars generates incremental MPV. So delaying completions and wait for improved prices as evidenced by the forward curve will add significant value. Please see Slide 8 of our investor presentation for a play specific example.","Second, we remain focused on driving down finding costs and improving per well production rates. This is our best hedge against low oil prices. For example, as a result of cost and oil productivity improvements in the Eagle Ford Western acreage, we can now generate better returns with $65 oil than we did with $95 oil just two or three years ago. We illustrate this on Slide 11 of the investor presentation.","Due to low oil prices we have already seen service cost reductions in many areas and see the potential for 10% to 30% vendor savings during this downturn. Additionally, every one of our plays has room to reduce cost further through ongoing efficiency gains. We believe our integrated approach to completion technology is industry leading. Quarter after quarter we make improvements to well productivity and that will continue to be a high priority this year for EOG.","Third, low oil prices mean unique opportunities to add low-cost, high-quality acreage. We will continue to grow our acreage portfolio through leasehold, farm-in or tactical acquisitions. We view our strong balance sheet and excess liquidity as a strategic asset for opportunities in times like these. We are already benefiting from the oil down cycle, adding new leases at lower cost than last year and we are optimistic that additional opportunities will become available.","Finally in my 36 years with the company I have seen many downturns, and each time EOG stays disciplined, performs well and emerges on the other side in better shape than we entered it. in 2015, EOG plans to build a stronger position and be ready to resume long-term, high return production growth when prices improve.","I will now address the Eagle Ford. David Trice will discuss the Permian Basin and Billy Helms will provide an update on the Bakken and Rockies plays along with a review of our year-end reserves. 2014 was another remarkable year in Eagle Ford. Oil production from the play increased 45% and EOG achieved several key milestones. Number one, down spacing and improved completion techniques enabled us to increase our total potential reserve estimate in 2014 by 1 billion barrels of oil equivalent to 3.2 billion barrels equivalent net to EOG. We continue to advance our technical expertise as evidenced by ongoing improvements in productivity across the field.","Slide 17 in our updated investor presentation shows an 8% increase in productivity for wells completed in 2014 versus 2013. We continue our progress with high density completions across the entire play. A high density completion is simply various techniques used to maximize the amount of rock connected to the well bore. Due to geologies those techniques will change from one county to the next and we are making progress determining how to tweak those techniques across our acreage.","Number four, after five years in the Eagle Ford we are still making drilling time and cost improvements. Please see Slide 18 in the investor presentation. And number five, at the end of 2014 our acreage in the Eagle Ford was over 80% held by production. We had a number of lease retention commitments in our Western acreage that we successfully fulfilled in 2014, bringing up drilling flexibility going forward.","Eagle Ford activity in 2015 will continue to be balanced between the West and East sides of the field. As I mentioned we are intentionally delaying completions while we wait for improved [oil prices]. Thus our inventory of uncompleted well is expected to increase. This strategy allows us to maximize the value of our existing contractual commitments while waiting on improved pricing before we bring on newly completed wells with high oil production rates.","Delaying completions will also provide an opportunity to take advantage of lower service costs that will likely materialize in the coming months. The Eagle Ford remains EOG\u2019s premier play. We have about 5500 net oils to drill on our acreage, and over 10 years of inventory. The Eagle Ford represents a huge call option on oil that EOG can exercise at any time to take advantage of a favorable oil price environment.","We often refer to the Eagle Ford as our technology laboratory. Our understanding of this field and how to increase its recovery rate has led to improvements in plays across the entire company. The first to benefit from this technology transfer was the Bakken beginning in late 2012, and now the Permian Basin is experiencing the latest step change in our application of technology.","I will now turn it over to David Trice to discuss activities in the Permian.","David Trice","Thanks, Bill. In 2015 EOG\u2019s capital budget in the Permian will expand to take advantage of new Delaware Basin targets, advancements in well performance and cost reductions achieved in 2014. If you will recall, last year we shifted capital from the Midland Basin to the Delaware Basin, which allowed us to advance our technical understanding of the Delaware. In 2015, we will have fewer drilling commitments to hold acreage in the Midland Basin, which frees up capital and provides more flexibility. ","Let us quickly review the 2014 achievements that set this play up to be major contributor to EOG\u2019s returns and long-term growth. First we made significant advancements in our most mature oil play in the Delaware Basin, the Leonard Shale, by increasing oil productivity 17%. In 2015 we will continue to push wells closer together, developing and further testing down to 300 feet. We are encouraged with the initial results and expect to see further advancements throughout the year.","Second, in our Delaware Basin Wolfcamp play we made great progress in 2014 as the play moved into development mode. We greatly increased well productivity as evidenced by the three wells we highlight in our press release. At $7 million completed well cost, the Wolfcamp play delivers very strong returns. Also in the Wolfcamp during 2014 we identified and delineated 90,000 new acres in the oil window.","Third, we tested and improved the second Bone Spring Sand to be another high return oil direct in our Delaware Basin acreage. Initial results were promising, and we did extensive G&G work to delineate this play. The second Bone Spring Sand produced 70% oil in our Red Hills acreage in Mexico, and promises returns on par with our premier oil plays. We will move the second Bone Spring Sand into development mode this year and it will receive the largest relative increase in capital.","In summary, the Leonard Shale is in full development mode and continues to deliver impressive results. The Delaware Basin Wolfcamp finished its first year of development drilling, the wells are outstanding and the costs are dropping and we are excited to have the second Bone Spring Sand to the drilling program and bring it forward into full development mode. We are confident that we will see the same progress in the second Bone Spring Sand that we have seen from the Leonard Shale over the last two years.","While the Delaware Basin is still in the early innings of its exploration and development, the returns we are already generating from multiple targets to make it very competitive with Eagle Ford and the Bakken. ","Billy Helms will now discuss the Bakken, the Rockies and year-end reserves.","Billy Helms","Thanks David. 2014 was a successful year for the Bakken program. We began down spacing, testing various spacing patterns and continued experimenting with completion techniques to improve the performance of the field. ","Here are some of the highlights for 2014 activity. First we made significant advancements in improving drilling times and reducing well cost. A typical 10,000 foot lateral is now drilled in just over 10 days with a completed well cost of $9.3 million. This represents a cost reduction of 11% from 2013, and we expect more efficiency gains and service cost reductions in the current environment.","Second, we now have production data from each of the various spacing patterns and began to determine the optimal development plan. We have tested wells at 1300 foot, 700 foot and 500 foot spacing patterns and have just started producing oils in the 300 foot spacing pattern. Similar to the Eagle Ford, we expect that the spacing will vary depending on the specific rock characteristics in each area of the field.","One of our latest test is a 6 well pattern with wells spaced 700 feet apart in the Bakken core. The initial production rates of these wells range from 1000 barrels of oil per day to 1900 barrels of oil per day and represent a customized completion design tailored for the rock properties in this particular area of the field. ","Third, we are confident that there is a significant amount of remaining potential in the Bakken, and that down spacing will be highly economic. As I mentioned earlier, evaluating the production from each spacing pattern will lead us to the appropriate spacing and the ultimate reserve potential. While the Bakken will receive less capital in 2015 it remains a core, high return asset in our drilling program. A typical 10,000 foot lateral in the Bakken core generates greater than 35% after tax rate of return with a $55 flat oil price.","In addition, maintaining activity allows us to retain momentum on operational efficiencies. For example, we recently drilled an 18,600 foot well to total depth in just over seven days. We continue to believe that EOG has the premier acreage position in the play with many years of development drilling remaining and the potential for long-term production growth. In the DJ Basin EOG made significant progress in both the Codell and Niobrara. We\u2019ve been experimenting with web or targeting inter well spacing and modifications to the completion design for both intervals. For the Codell, we\u2019ve identified a specific statrographic interval within the pay section that when targeted rightly enhances the performances of the well.","The improved completion techniques we used are even more effective when we focus o this target. Please see our press release for notable well results. Back to Codell we\u2019ve tested several targets within the Niobrara. With this additional testing we\u2019ve determined a correlation between the amount of lateral focused within a specific target interval and the protection performance of the well.","In 2014, we made progress in several areas that contributed to reaching our well and operating cost wells in the DJ Basin. These include drilling and completion efficiencies and oil and gas gathering system and water gathering and distribution system and the infrastructure needed to obtain EOG self-source sand.","Our activity in the 2015 in the DJ Basin will be limited, drilling wells needed to maintain leasehold and finishing completion operations on a few remaining wells drilled last year. The Powder River Basin is stack pay system we\u2019ve drilled primarily in apartment and tunnel oil reservoirs similar to other areas within EOG\u2019s portfolio. In 2014, we focused on well targeting and completion designs and inter well spacing to determine the optimal development plan.","We made significant improvements in all aspects during 2014. Please see our press release for some excellent fourth quarter well results in both department and internal place. We plan to have limited activity in the Powder River Basin in 2015 while we wait for commodity prices to improve.","I\u2019ll now address reserve replacements and planning cost. Excluding revisions due to commodity price changes, we replaced 249% of our 2014 production at a low planning cost of $13.25 per Boe. Proved reserves increased 18% and more than half of our reserve growth was driven by proved. In addition net proved developed reserves increased 20%.","For the 27 consecutive year, the DeGolyer and MacNaughton did an independent engineering analysis of our reserves. And their estimate was within 5% of our internal estimate. Their analysis covered about 76% of our proved reserves this year. Please see the schedules accompanying the earnings press release for the calculation of reserve replacements and finding cost.","I\u2019ll now turn it over to Tim Driggers to discuss financials and capital structure.","Tim Driggers","Thanks Billy. Let me start by addressing an unusual item affecting the fourth quarter. In early December we announced the sale of most of our producing assets in Canada, the proceeds of approximately of $400 million. As a result volumes were lower than our previous guidance for the fourth quarter by approximately 2,300 barrels of oil per day and 15 million cubic feet per day of natural gas. Also G&A for the quarter was higher due to $21.5 million of exit costs related to the sale.","Now, I\u2019d like to make a few comments about our capital spending last year and in the fourth quarter. Capitalized interest for the quarter was $14.5 million, for the fourth quarter 2014, total expirations and development expenditures were $1.8 billion excluding acquisitions and asset retirement obligations.","In addition, expenditures for gathering systems, processing plans and other property plant and equipment were $140 million. There were $66 million of acquisitions during the quarter. For the full year 2014, capitalized interest was $57.2 million. Total expiration and development expenditures were $7.6 billion excluding acquisitions and asset retirement obligations. In addition expenditures for gathering systems, processing plans and other property plant and equipment were $727 million. For the full year capital expenditures excluding acquisitions and asset retirement obligations were $8.3 billion.","Total cash flow from operations was $8.6 billion exceeding total cash expenditures. In addition proceeds from asset sales were $569 million. Total acquisitions for the year were $139 million. At year-end total debt outstanding was $5.9 million for debt to total capitalization ratio of 25%. Taking into $2.1 billion of cash on hand at year-end, net debt to total cap was 18%, down from 23% at year end 2013.","In the fourth quarter of 2014, total impairments were $536 million, $445 million of these impairments were the result of significant declines in commodity prices during the fourth quarter. For the full year 2014, total impairments were $744 million, $501 million of these impairments result the declines in commodity prices and negotiated sales prices of property sales. The remaining impairments for both the fourth quarter and full year 2014 were ongoing lease and producing property impairments.","The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 61% and the deferred tax ratio was 104%. Yesterday we included a guidance table with our earnings press release for the first quarter and full year 2015. Our 2015 CapEx estimate is $4.9 billion to $5.1 billion excluding acquisitions. The expiration and development portion excluding facilities will account for approximately 80% of the total CapEx budget.","2015 CapEx represents a 40% decrease from 2014. As Bill mentioned earlier, we\u2019re not interested in growing oil production in a low price environment. The budget for expiration and development facilities accounts for approximately 12% of the total CapEx budget for 2015 and midstream accounts for 8%, we plan to concentrate our spending on infrastructure in the Eagle Ford and Delaware Basin to support our drilling programs in those areas and enhance operating efficiencies.","In terms of hedges, for February 1 thru June 30, 2015 we\u2019ve 47,000 barrels of oil per day hedged at $91.22 per barrel. For the second half of 2015, we\u2019ve 10,000 barrels of oil per day hedged at $89.98 per barrel. This represents a small portion of our estimated oil production in 2015 and we\u2019ll look to hedge further volumes opportunistically throughout the year. We\u2019ve contracts outstanding for 37,000 barrels of oil per day that could be put to us at various terms. Please see the press release for further details.","For natural gas, we\u2019ve 182,000 MMBtu per day hedged at $4.51 per MMBtu for March 1 thru December 31, 2015. We also have a number of contracts on natural gas that could be put to us at various terms. The counter parties exercised also its options, the notion of volume of EOG\u2019s existing natural gas derivative contracts were increased by 175,000 MMBtu per day at an average price of $4.51 per MMBtu for each month during the period March 1 thru December 31, 2015.","Now, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Bill.","Bill Thomas","Thanks Tim. Now, I\u2019ll talk about the macro view. We\u2019re encouraged that Congress is taking a look at lifting a ban on crude oil exports. Doing so will bring a lot of range of economic geopolitical benefits including strengthening the U.S. energy sector, growing the U.S. economy, creating jobs, dramatically improving the U.S. trade deficit, providing our European allies with more secure supplies and lowering gasoline process to U.S. consumers. As I mentioned earlier EOG will be very focused this year on preparing for the recovery in oil process. The current supply demand imbalance is not very large and current process are far short of what is necessary to sustain the supply need to meet world demand growth. When process recover, EOG will be prepared to resume strong double-digit oil growth. For now, EOG is intentionally choosing returns over growth. In fact that's the way it\u2019s always been here at EOG.","In summary, I want to leave you with some important summary points. Year in, year out, EOG consistently approaches capital planning by focusing on returns. 2015 is no different. Second, we\u2019ve halted production growth deliberately while EOG is one of the few companies that can earn a healthy return at today's oil prices we are not interested in growing oil into our low price environment. As we compare today\u2019s oil prices to our expectations for a more balanced market, it makes economic sense to slow production until an industry wide supply response is realized and prices respond accordingly. This strategy maximizes the value of our assets and it\u2019s the right strategy to create long term shareholder value.","Third, our balance sheet places EOG in a strong position. We intend to use our financial flexibility to take advantage of opportunities to grow our inventory by acquiring low cost, high quality acreage. And fourth, with the substantial inventory up high volume levels to complete, we will be ready to return to double-digit oil growth as oil prices improve.","And finally, we fully expect to merge the commodity price down cycle and the stronger position that we entered in. In 2015, we have more opportunity than ever to lower finding costs and development costs and improve returns in 2016 and beyond.","Thanks for listening and now we will go to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Doug Leggate from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Sir, your line is open please check your mute function. And we will take our next question from Paul Sankey from Wolfe Research.","Paul Sankey","Hi, good morning everybody. Can you hear me okay?","Bill Thomas","Yes Paul go ahead.","Paul Sankey","Good morning. You have clearly stated guys that you are now targeting flat year-over-year crude production in 2015 and that you also stated clearly that you\u2019re not interested in growing oil production in a low oil price environment. I wanted to confirm that the overarching decision that you have made here is to get CapEx in line with expected cash flows and secondly by increasing efficiency allowing for lowest service cost that even if oil prices remain low for another year you would be able to deliver growth in 2016 while keeping CapEx within cash flows or if oil prices remain low which you reduce the CapEx and leave volumes flat again next year? Thanks.","Bill Thomas","Yes Paul that \u2013 the first statement is generally correct. Number one, we do not think it\u2019s wise or prudent to accelerate oil when oil prices are low especially if the rebound and price could come certainly in the next \u2013 this year, the end of this year or maybe even next year. So, there is no use in trying to accelerate. It makes much more prudent business decision to wait and that will give us a much more capital returns if we do that and we are very committed to maintain the very strong balance sheet, so we don't want to out-spend trying to grow oil in a low price environment.","And we want to keep our balance sheet clean and low and we want to keep our patter drop so that we will be able to take some advantage of what could be some unique opportunities in this downturn. 2016, yes if we \u2013 if things go as we think they might could and we would have say a $65 oil environment in 2016 and we believe that we could return to our very strong double-digit oil growth that we have been marching towards a last few years and that we will be able to generate very high rates of return on our capital and we would be able to stay free cash flow neutral.","Paul Sankey","And I guess, the specific part of that was that if you \u2013 another year $5 billion CapEx next year you would be able to re-accelerate growth because of the increased efficiencies and lower service cost that you will be seeing throughout this year?","Bill Thomas","Certainly, we do think costs will come down this year due to services and again efficiency gains, we\u2019re making really good progress in that and as we look forward to 2016 we haven't set a capital goal on that yet and we will look at that when we get there.","Paul Sankey","Okay. That's great. Thanks and then can I just confirm you are building effectively an inventory of stuff that you can do if you want to, would that mean you are less likely to add into M&A or would you not follow that statement through?","Bill Thomas","Well, the kind of opportunities that we are looking for is take advantage of is number one, this low cost environment. It helps us to pick up acreage that we are working on in our certainly our core areas. We are able to pickup 11,000 acres last year in the Eagle Ford and we are targeting to pick up more there just on leasehold so that goes more easily this year. The second is we have historically and we do think that we will have opportunities to earn acreage through farmings or drill to earn top things commitments and we will look for partners that we can join in with that will be a win-win situation and earn acreage in our core areas and maybe some emerging areas. And then, we look for topical acquisitions that won\u2019t be the large, large acquisitions that they will be certainly bolt on acreage and they will be opportunities that we see primarily in our top tier place.","Paul Sankey","Okay. Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Phillip Jungwirth with BMO.","Phillip Jungwirth","Yes, good morning. EOG has been the cutting edge of completion technology and proven to be a premiere operator, but is there any way to quantify the operational synergy you think can be achieved during acquisition strategy in terms of MPB or how big you think it\u2019s best to think about it and can this technology advantage be maintained in a way that's accretive through acquisitions?","Bill Thomas","Yes Phillip, thank you for the question. I think certainly when we look at potential acquisitions, the thing we let help guide that is our expiration expertise and our understanding of the locks and so we really are only focused on that kind of opportunities where we see very sweet spot top acreage and use existing core areas or in emerging place. And then, we certainly have a lot of expertise and we\u2019ve been in the shale business I think longer than most people and we developed a very strong efficiencies and technology improvements and we think that we would certainly bring that to bear. And we apply that and the upside that we see on that that we could bring the table on any kind of acquisition that we might pursue.","Also we\u2019ve certainly our built-in cost of reductions, mechanisms like our self-sourced sand and other materials that we use in our fracs, so that gives an advantage from an economic standpoint to be competitive on acquisitions.","Phillip Jungwirth","Thank you. And how much of the 2015 capital being spent isn\u2019t additive to production this year just solely due to the decision to defer completion during the year just so we can get a sense of what a clean number on a capital efficiency basis would be?","Tim Driggers","Okay. As for as the number of wells that we\u2019re deferring really the number is we had 200 wells at the start of 2015 and we\u2019re going to end the year with about 285 wells waiting on completion. So they have additional 85 wells and were we complete that that cost would be somewhere $250 million to $500 million. But, as far as the wells that we\u2019re drilling and not to be completed that\u2019s a couple of 100 million additional costs that we\u2019re spending this year, 2015.","Phillip Jungwirth","Great, thanks a lot.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Charles Meade with Johnson Rice.","Charles Meade","Yes, good morning to everyone there. Bill, if I can get you to go back to some of the macro comments that you closed at your prepared comments with. My recollection is that some of your comments back in December, some of your public comments, you had the opinion that we were looking at a more of a V shaped recovery in oil prices and maybe activities well, but I wanted to, can you talk about how your view of the macro landscape has changed over the last couple of months and what you think, I know you just referenced $65 oil in a year, is that a reasonable point to anchor on as far as your expectations for \u201916?","Bill Thomas","Charles, I don\u2019t think that I\u2019ve talked about our shape of the recovery. But, our view now is that we really believe with the consensus opinion that as we go forward due to the response of the industry that we could have flat to maybe even negative U.S. production growth on a month-over-month basis by the end of this year, and that certainly going to slowdown U.S. production growth this year.","So, as that slows down there should be a price response and I\u2019m not going to predict whether it\u2019s going to be V or U or W o really what the price is, certainly the forward curve is very indicative that prices will increase in the future and we\u2019re just going to wait and see how that goes and we\u2019ll respond accordingly.","Charles Meade","Got it. And that\u2019s actually good segway to the next question I would like to ask, it really gets to this inventory and what are the set of, what set of conditions would lead you to start really wanting to work that down, I mean, current forward curve as I said I think January crude read around $60 bucks, January \u201916 crude would that be, would $60 crude would be sufficient for you to start, want you to work that down or perhaps that in combination with some other factors on completion costs or sort that of thing. Can you just elaborate a bit on how you\u2019re thinking about it?","Bill Thomas","Yes certainly, we\u2019re deferring these completions because we do believe that prices will be better in the future and even at $10 increase in oil price gives us a significant additional return on our investment and NPV upside. So, really our rate of return focus and our capital return focus is really what\u2019s driving the deferral. And let me kind of walk you through, there is two parts of this deferral, one is as Gary said we\u2019re starting out 2015 with about 200 uncompleted wells in our inventory and that uncompleted well inventory will grow throughout 2015. And if oil prices improve and they look something like the forward curve in the $60 range then we would begin completing many of those wells starting in the third quarter of 2015 and that would reflect additional growth in the fourth quarter heading into 2016. So, we want to head in the 2016 on an uptick in production growth. So our curve in 2015 would be U-shaped. It will be the lowest production, will be in the second quarter and then in the third quarter and then production will begin to increase in the fourth quarter as we head into 2016. Then at the end of the year, we will have about 285 wells and inventory to start to 2016 process and that will give us a bit of an advantage as we go into 2016 and we will be able to grow oil at very strong double-digit rates and be able to stay free cash flow neutral in our $65 oil price environment. So hopefully that gives you a bit of more understanding of what we are thinking.","Charles Meade","Bill that's great insight into your thinking, exactly what I was looking for, thank you.","Operator","And we will go now to Leo Mariani with RBC Capital Markets.","Leo Mariani","Yes guys. I was just hoping you can speak a bit into sort of how quickly once the price response is in place where you can start working down the backlog of completions, is that just the matter of a month or two and then additionally just following up on what you have just mentioned there in terms of if we have got to $60 oil say by midsummer where you might start completing more wells in 3Q is that contemplated in the production guidance in 2015 for EOG?","Tim Driggers","What we have contemplated is just as Bill was saying is we will ramp-up in the fourth quarter and you are right, it would take us about one month since we have wells drilled wait down completion to go ahead and see the impact of that production. So yes, we would start somewhere like September and start the ramp-up if we have been encouraged with oil prices improvement.","Bill Thomas","And yes that is included in our guidance. Production guidance for 2015.","Leo Mariani","Okay. That's helpful. And I guess I notice that you guys did have a relatively healthy increase here in the dividend this quarter. Can you talk a little bit about how you balance kind of returning cash to shareholders through the dividend with drilling wells obviously the returns on the wells are still quite strong here at $55 oil so how do you think about the increase in dividend just given where oil is right now?","Bill Thomas","Yes, now we didn't increase the rate of dividend in this quarter. So, we did increase it twice last year, but too healthy now, so that's just the give back to the shareholders share within the success of the company as we end this lower price environment, the opportunity to further increase the rate is a bit more limited. And so, we will really just have to see how oil prices respond in the future and to consider additional increases in the dividend. The company is very committed to that part of the business and to the shareholders in that way. So it\u2019s a very top priority for us, but we need a bit better business environment to work on that.","Leo Mariani","Alright, thanks.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Pearce Hammond from Simmons & Company. ","Pearce Hammond","Thank you for taking my questions. My first question is what percent of total well cost is completion and where do you expect that to go with service cost decreases?","Bill Thomas","Well our drilling cost is roughly 25% to 30% of the cost of the well. So that gives you the completion, of course, I guess we could put facilities in there so the facilities would be somewhere around 10%. So, the balance being completion and the other part of the question is what Pearce?","Pearce Hammond","How you see those service costs decreasing, those completion costs decreasing over the course of this year?","Billy Helms","Yes. When we put our budget together we were seeing 5% to 10% cost reduction. Now, we are seeing 10% to 30% cost reduction that of course depends on the sector. But just to kind of illustrate that not just mentioned in the Eagle Ford you noticed in our exhibit 18, we are showing our well cost to 6.1%, we are expecting, we are setting our target, we hope to see somewhere around 5.5% or about a 10% reduction. In the Bakken we have got 9.3%, our target would be to further lower that growth of 9.3% in \u201914 we have got 8.2% is our planned number, but we have got a target that\u2019s slightly less than that maybe 19%. So overall, we are expecting our cost to come down somewhere around to 10% to 20% from 2014.","Pearce Hammond","Thank you Billy and then what is the base decline for the company?","Billy Helms","Yes Pearce, we haven't given that number out. The decline rate in the region we have decline rate is slowing overtime. So there is three reasons for that. One is every year that goes by, our well by its gets more matured then we have got older wells bigger percentage of older wells all the time. So that's slowing the process. Number two, our completion technology is really beginning to starting to flatten out our decline rates on a per well basis specifically the high density fracs that we talked about in the last quarter that we are applying the Eagle Ford are not only increasing the initial rates, but they are also decreasing the decline rates so we are very encouraged about that. And then number three, as we go forward, we are targeting place that have better rocks with better probability and better ability to flow oil and those rocks such as the Sandstone place in the Delaware Basin and in Wyoming have lower decline rates also. So the mix of our decline rate in the company is slowing overtime due to a number of different reasons.","Pearce Hammond","Thank you very much.","Operator","We will now go to Joe Allman from J.P. Morgan.","Joe Allman","Thank you operator. Hi everybody.","Bill Thomas","Good morning Joe.","Joe Allman","Just first question is on production. So, I heard what you said about the U-shape production for 2015, I just want to get a better understanding so the first part of the question is why is the first quarter 2015 production below fourth quarter especially in the oil side, I know you sold Canada and some factor in that end and could you just give us a better understanding of the trajectory so it sounds that you are going to be down in the first quarter, down in second,, down in third and then up in fourth and like will the fourth quarter oil be flat with fourth quarter 2014 oil especially in the U.S. and I understand what\u2019s going on in the East \u2013 on that field in the third quarter?","Bill Thomas","Yes Joe, the reason the first quarter volumes are down is because we began ramping down our completion spread really quickly in the year. So we wanted to and so oil continued to drop, we wanted to drop CapEx quickly and not focus on growing oil when we have the lowest prices in the first part of the year and then again as I described, the second and third quarters should be the lowest production and then the fourth quarter we will ramp back up. We don't have a number to give you on guidance on that number, but it will ramp back up significantly heading into 2016.","Joe Allman","Okay. That's helpful Bill. And then, on the cash from operations, so to get the cash from operations to cover the CapEx what benchmark prices do you assume and in that are you assuming the midpoint of your production guidance?","Bill Thomas","Yes, we go CapEx to discretionary cash flow should be balanced at about $58 average price this year and the second part of your question was?","Joe Allman","Just are you assuming, to generate the cash flow, first I would love to get WTI assumption, brand assumption and then natural gas assumption too and then are you assuming the midpoint of your guidance when you say you are going to cover the CapEx of cash from operation so for example, if you hit the low end of your guidance you maybe sort of you would be spending somewhat?","Bill Thomas","It's an average midpoint of our production for 2015, yes Joe.","Joe Allman","And how about natural gas assumptions and brand oil if you get there?","Bill Thomas","Yes, on the gas we issue a five year strip, and yes we issue the five year strip on that and then on the NGL, the NGL is basically a percent of oil price in our assumptions and then gas again it\u2019s a five year strip.","Joe Allman","Okay. Very good, thank you.","Operator","And we will go now to Bob Brackett from Bernstein Research.","Bob Brackett","Some clarifications on some of the other questions. One, I am trying to do the math on you start the year with 200 uncompleted, you drill about 465 wells and then you end the year with 285 or 350 uncompleted?","Bill Thomas","Yes Bob, that's a good question. That 350 was an incorrect number, so correct that back to 285, we end the year with 285. So here is the number just to be completely clear, we start with 200, we drill 550 and we complete 465 during the year and we exit the year at about 285 wells uncompleted.","Bob Brackett","Great. That's helpful. Quick follow-up on acquisitions you \u2013 two definitional terms, you contrasted bolt on versus large, large acquisitions is there a monetary value associated with those two numbers or those two additives?","Bill Thomas","No that is not a monetary number, we just want to distinguish that we are open certainly to any kind of acquisitions that would be very highly beneficial to the company. But most likely the type of acquisitions we do are not in the very large I\u2019m talking multi-billion dollar kind of acquisition. They are really more directed towards the tactical acquisitions and they are really at very specific acreage pieces that we think are very highly productive according to our geology.","Bob Brackett","And you said core areas, so that's Bakken, Eagle Ford and Permian?","Bill Thomas","Well certainly, those would be the first choices but obviously those are the most competitive, but we do from time to time consider those type of things and so many emerging place. But again, we are very discriminatory there and that we are only looking for acreage that will be additive to our inventory and that means it has to be equal to or better than Eagle Ford, Bakken and Permian place.","Bob Brackett","Great, thank you.","Bill Thomas","Thank you.","Operator","And we will go now to Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer","Thank you. Good morning.","Bill Thomas","Good morning Brian.","Brian Singer","You talked the potential for 10% to 30% vendor cost savings and I wondered as a company more vertically integrated than others can you talk more specifically where you see this potential beyond the more normal course efficiency gains you highlighted in your presentation and your comments and whether do you think the 10% to 30% is merely cyclical or secular?","Bill Thomas","Let me let, Brian, let me let Gary Thomas answer this question.","Gary Thomas","The good thing is as the vendors are working so well with the EOG and we are seeing that 10% to 30% across drilling, completion, production all areas. And I guess the thing that be a little unique for EOG is we believe that we are going to be seeing maybe in the 10% to 15% reduction in some of our self-sourced areas because that EOG has 3 sand plants. We also have at least a half of dozen other vendors. So there is combination of cost of sand and distance from oil site. So, we will be able to use some of the lower cost sand with us having half the number of frac fleets running in 2015.","So that will be in the fit as well. As far as more granular yes, in the tubing and casing area it may be lower in 5% to 7% range. But, we are seeing stock tanks those discounts coming down as much as 25%.","Brian Singer","And to follow-up, do you think that's cyclical or secular, it sounds like from your comment on just the cost of split the distance that's more high grading, but is there a secular element you see as well?","Gary Thomas","No. not appreciably. I think the secular part Brian would be in the efficiency gain particularly in the technology side of it those will stay with us for years and they keep improving. The service cost comes and goes obviously with activity and so we will be a bit more short term. But, we build in long term I think cost savings in the company that will continue to stay with us. As an example, we gave this earlier we now see better returns in our Eagle Ford with $65 oil than we had with $95 oil two or three years ago. And that is mainly due to the efficiency gains we have been able to accomplish with our completion technology and the efficiency and the cost reduction on the wells.","Brian Singer","That's helpful. Along those lines you talked about the acquisition strategy, but let\u2019s say oil prices do quickly recover, the acquisition opportunities are not accretive as you are hoping for. What potential do you see from your higher rate of return legacy areas to further extend your inventory beyond the 15 plus years you are at now, where are we in that ball parking?","Bill Thomas","Brian, we see upside in really all of them just to start with the Eagle Ford again we still believe we are in the sixth inning there in the Eagle Ford. So, we are still testing new zones like the upper Eagle Ford and we working on down spacing and again we have added acreage there in the last year about 11,000 acres that is very high quality acreage. So, we think there is additional room there, in the Bakken we have not upgraded our Bakken well count our reserve potential after we have started this down spacing process. So, we see upside there and then in the Permian, we are diligently working on spacing and targeting and specifically in the second bond spring sand we are working on bringing the spacing patterns closer together and identifying maybe even two targets in that particular zone in the [indiscernible] we working on spacing there and we haven't upgraded that well count in the long time and then in the Wolf Camp we have multiple play zone spacing that we are working on there. We haven't upgraded that in a while. So really each one of our core areas, we believe we will continue to provide additional high quality inventory as we go forward.","Brian Singer","Thank you.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen this does conclude today's question-and-answer session. Mr. Bill Thomas at this time I would like to turn the conference back over to you for additional or closing remarks.","Bill Thomas","Thank you. I would just like to leave you with this last one thought, EOG is very long term focused. We could have taken a short term approach this year and just picked up the very best wells in the company to drill and focus on those and cut our capital back to really own a short term focus. But, we do not believe that's the right way to grow the company and to manage the company. We are focused on long term shareholder value and that's our focus. So, as we said, we are going to not grow oil while oil prices are low, we are going to wait for the recovery and that will be able to give us much higher returns and it\u2019s the right business decision as we go forward. So we appreciate everybody. Great questions and thank everybody for their support.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen this does conclude today's conference and we do thank you for your participation."],"8353":["EOG Resources, Inc.

As a reminder, this call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of EOG Resources, Mr. Mark Papa. Please go ahead, sir.","Mark Papa","Good morning, and thanks for taking the time to join us. I hope that everyone has seen the press release announcing fourth quarter and full year 2012 earnings and operational results. This conference call includes forward-looking statements. The risks associated with forward-looking statements have been outlined in the earnings release and the EOG's SEC filings and we incorporate those by reference for this call.","This conference call also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation schedules for these non-GAAP measures to comparable measures can be found on our website at www.eogresources.com. The SEC permits oil and gas companies in their filings with the SEC to disclose not only proved reserves but also probable reserves as well as possible reserves. Some of the reserve estimates on this conference call and webcast, including those for the Eagle Ford, Wolfcamp and Leonard may include potential reserves or other estimated reserves not necessarily calculated in accordance with or contemplated by the SEC's reserve reporting guidelines. We incorporate by reference the cautionary note to investors that appears at the bottom of our press release and Investor Relations page of our website.","With me this morning are Bill Thomas, President, Gary Thomas, COO, Llyod Helms, EVP, Operations, Tim Driggers, Vice President and CFO, Maire Baldwin, VP of IR and Jill Miller, Manager of Engineering and Acquisitions","An updated IR Presentation was posted to our website last night and we included first quarter and full-year 2013 guidance in yesterday's press release.","This morning, we'll discuss topics in the following order. I'll first review our 2012 fourth quarter and full-year net income and discretionary cash flow. Then Bill Thomas and I will provide operational results followed by reserve replacement, our macro view and hedge position, and our 2013 business plan. Tim Driggers will then discuss financials and capital structure, and I'll finish with concluding remarks.","As outlined in our press release, for the full year 2012, EOG reported net income $570.3 million, or $2.11 per share and a net loss of $505 million, or dollar $1.88 per share for the fourth quarter.","For investors who focus on non-GAAP net income to eliminate mark-to-market impacts and certain non-recurring items as outlined in the press release, EOG's full-year adjusted net income was $1.54 billion, or $5.67 per share and $437 million or $1.61 per share for the fourth quarter 2012.","For investors who follow the practice of industry analysts who focus on non-GAAP discretionary cash flow, EOG's 2012 Bcf was $5.7 billion for the full year and $1.4 billion for the fourth quarter.","I will now address our operational results in key plays. We had a good fourth quarter providing a capstone to a very strong full year 2012. Our fourth quarter oil volumes essentially hit the mid-point of our guidance. Our unit costs significantly weak guidance and partially due to our crude by rail system, our domestic crude netback was at a significant premium over WTI.","For the full year, our crude and condensate volumes were up 39% year-over-year, NGL volumes were up 32% and total liquids increased 37%. North American natural gas volumes were down 9% year-over-year in line with expectations. In Trinidad volumes increased 6%. Overall total company production grew 10% in 2012 versus 2011. Over the past three years, our organic crude and condensate growth rates have been 35%, 52% and 39%, respectively.","More importantly, EOG's full-year non-GAAP EPS adjusted EBITDAX and discretionary cash flow grew 50%, 26% and 26%, respectively, above 2011. We believe, we have the highest two-year growth rate in the three important financial parameters of all large cap E&Ps. We expect further growth in each of these three metrics in 2013, as well as improvements in our ROE and ROCE.","I'll note that in the fourth quarter, we incurred a significant financial and natural gas reserve write-down, which is very unusual for EOG. Approximately 98% of the total financial write-down occurred in Canada as a result of low gas prices. We have written off the remaining book value of our entire Horn River acreage along with all PDP and PUD reserves, because they are on economic at current gas prices. However, the drilling we have done today holds our remaining 127,000 net acres in the Horn River with an estimated seven Tcf reserve potential until 2020, providing optionality for us.","The other major main issue of the component involved our Canadian shallow gas assets. Even with these write-downs affecting our capital account, we accomplished our goal of keeping our net debt to total cap below 30%.","I will now discuss our key oil plays, starting with Eagle Ford. The Eagle Ford continues to be our flagship oil assets and we have several important points to share with you today regarding this asset. First, as predicted on our previous call, our fourth quarter Eagle Ford production declined relative to the third quarter since we slowed down our capital spend rate to stay within budget targets of previously used the analogy of a coin-operated machine and we simply didn't insert as many coins in the fourth quarter. The good news is, we are ramping up in the first quarter and in January we completed our highest IP well in Eagle Ford to-date. 100% working interest Burrow Unit #2H tested at 6,330 barrels of oil per day with 5.7 million cubic feet a day of rich natural gas. The Eagle Ford will be the biggest driver of EOG's targeted 28% 2013 oil growth.","Second, we expect the aggregate industry wide Eagle Ford oil production to surpass the Bakken within the next two years. Remember that EOG's 569,000 net oil acres constitute the largest and highest quality oil position in the entire play.","Third, through year-end 2012, we drilled and completed 630 net wells and conducted multiple spacing studies, and reservoir computer simulations. Simply put, we understand the reservoir much better than we did a year ago and we reached several important conclusions. The bottom line answer is that we are increasing our net potential recoverable reserve estimate by 600 million Boe and the development economics are still excellent. However, since some of the data supporting this conclusion may be counterintuitive to street expectations, I will provide some backup details without dragging you through the (inaudible) here.","Conclusion one is that downspacing across all of our acreage has been successful and the optimum spacing is 40 acres in the Eastern half of our acreage and 65 acres in the West. Previously our spacing was 65 to 90 acres.","Conclusion two is that with the new spacing, we have a total of 5,500 net drilling locations on our acreage. Since we have completed 630 net wells to-date, there are approximately 4,900 wells yet to drill or a 12 year inventory based on our 2013 program of 400 net wells.","Conclusion three, is that per well reserves will average 400 MBoe net after royalty. This is lower than the 450 MBoe which previously provided because there is an inner well drainage component associated with this closer spacing. A minimal amount of drainage is optimal in developing a resource play and maximizing present value. Multiplying 5,500 net wells times 400 MBoe net after royalty equals 2.2 billion Boe net to EOG which is our new potential reserve estimate. This translates to an approximate 8% recovery factor of the estimated 26.4 net billion Boe in place under our acreage.","Conclusion four, is that we plan to drill longer laterals than previously assumed. 5,500 feet versus 4,000 feet previously. So the average well cost is now $6 million. Adjusted for lateral length this is equivalent to the $5.5 million cost target we previously reported.","The final conclusion is that using the new well cost and reserves and current oil and NGL prices the direct unlevered after-tax reinvestment rate of return per well is 100%. The bottom line is that we had an estimated 600 million Boe net potential recoverable reserves with a direct ATROR is 100% and the incremental infrastructure cost is rather low.","I will now turn it over to Bill Thomas to discuss other domestic oil plays.","William Thomas","Thanks, Mark. Our Bakken\/Three Forks drilling results during the fourth quarter were outstanding and our 2013 program should be one of our strongest in many years. While most of industry Bakken\/Three Forks results are trending downward, EOG results are moving in the opposite direction. In other words, our wells are getting better. There two reasons our well performance is trending higher and why we expect our 2013 results to be strong.","First new frac technology is improving our wells in every area of the Bakken\/Three Forks. In some cases the new frac technology using our 320 acre downspacing wells in the Parshall Core has resulted in a 30% to 70% improvement in cumulative production over the original offset wells are per foot of treated lateral basis. For example, the Wayzetta 156-3329, a 320-acre down spaced well completed in 2012 has a cumulative production of 330 Mboe in the first 340 days in is still producing at a rate of over 800 barrels of oil per day. Please see our updated IR slides for an illustrative chart.","The second reason to expect strong results in 2013 is our drilling program is directed to the Parshall Core and Antelope Extension areas, which are some of the best acreage blocks in the play. Two Antelope Extension wells recently completed at our Hawkeye 01-2501H Three Forks well following 2,945 barrels of oil per day and the Hawkeye 01-2501H, a Bakken well following 2,444 barrels of oil per day. EOG has 75% working interest in these wells.","In addition to improving well results, we have completed our first two wells on 160 acre downspacing in the Parshall field. The Wayzetta 022-1509H and the Wayzetta 149-1509H tested at maximum rates of 1,185 and 1,265 barrels of oil per day, respectively. EOG has 68% working interest in these wells.","In 2012, we completed 28 net wells in the Parshall field and Antelope area with a successful 320 acre downspacing program.","In 2013, we plan to complete 46 net wells in these same two areas. Our focus this year will be to further downspace to 160 acres in both, the Bakken and Three Forks play intervals continue to improve frac efficiency and to optimize the recovery factor of each play.","If 160-acre down spacing proves successful, this will allow us to accelerate our development program in 2014 and beyond. The takeaway from our Bakken\/Three Forks asset is that wells were getting better with continued success in down spacing. The number of potential locations is growing and this provides us many years of high ROR investment opportunity in the play.","In the Delaware Basin, we have completed our first two horizontal Wolfcamp wells, in Reeves County, Texas, and we have significant results to announce. The Harrison Ranch #56-1002H tested in the upper Wolfcamp at 635 barrels of oil per day with 480 barrels of NGL per day and 3.1 million cubic feet of gas per day","In the Harrison Ranch #56-1002H was completed in the middle Wolfcamp at 377 barrels of oil per day with 602 barrels of NGL per day and 3.9 million cubic feet of gas per day. With estimated gross reserves of 900 MMBoe per well and a target completed well cost of $6.5 million. These results yield a strong 60% direct a-tax rate of return. Our Reeves County acreage has as much has 2,000 feet of gross Wolfcamp thickness in some places and approximately 300 million barrels equivalent per section of resource potential.","We have 220 subsurface faults total cost on our 114,000 net acres and we estimate the reserve potential to be 800 million barrels of oil equivalent, net to EOG. This is another substantial addition to our growing opportunities of higher rate of return drilling inventory. As a cautionary note, because we have such a large inventory of opportunities across the company, significant production growth on the Delaware Basin Wolfcamp should not be expected until the 2015 timeframe. As noticed in previous earnings calls, the results from our Leonard Shale play also in the Delaware Basin keep improving. With improved frac technique, the wells are getting better and showing a higher percentage of oil production than previously reported.","Successful downspacing and the identification of multiple play targets have substantially increased the number of potential drilling locations. Recent wells include the Vaca 14 Fed #6H with an initial production rate of 1,290 barrels of oil per day with 255 barrels of NGL per day and 1.4 million cubic feet of gas per day, and the Diamond 8 FC #5H with initial production rate of 1,162 barrels of oil per day and 183 barrels of NGL per day and one million cubic feet of gas per day. As a result, we are increasing our gross reserves from 430 in MBoe per well two 500 MBoe per well and increasing the percentage of estimated oil from 41% to 50% of total well reserves. In addition, we are increasing EOG's estimated Leonard pipe potential reserves from 65 million barrels of oil equivalent to 550 million barrels of oil equivalent net to EOG. Our direct a-tax rate of return for the 2012 Leonard total was 55% and we see this improving in 2013.","In summary, our 114,000 net acres in the Delaware basin has multiple pay zones targets in the Leonard and Wolfcamp shale plays with a combined estimated reserve potential of approximately 1.35 billion barrels of oil equivalent net to EOG. Additionally, our results from the Midland Basin Wolfcamp program continues to be on track. The Barnett combo will make a solid with our 30% direct a-tax rate of return drilling program. Cost efficiencies have reduced completed well cost of 3.1 million and new techniques are helping to improve oil recovery. In 2013, we plan to drill 130 wells versus 190 in 2012.","Because we have an EOG owned processing plant, methane extraction is still economic and supports our drilling program in spite of soft NGL prices. Recent wells include the Evans Unit #1H, #2H, B Unit #1H with initial production rates of 573, 677 and 685 barrels of oil per day respectively and recall A Unit #1H and #2H with initial production rates of 371 and 447 barrels of oil per day respectively. EOG has 100% working interest in all of these wells. Remaining drilling potential continues to grow for EOG in the play.","In addition to these plays we have a smaller levels of horizontal oil activity in the midcontinent, Powder River basin and Southern Manitoba. Also we continue to test new Greenfield horizontal oil ideas in North America.","Now I will turn it back to Mark.","Mark Papa","Thanks, Bill. As you can see with our Eagle Ford reserve estimate upgrade and our success in the Delaware basin, we are very long on domestic oil and combo reinvestment opportunities for many years and this affects our decision to exit the Kitimat LNG project. We believe Kitimat is good project and with Chevron involved the project will likely get built. However the projected Kitimat ROR did not compare favorably with returns from our domestic shale oil projects, especially in light of our Eagle Ford reserve upgrade. We weren\u2019t desperate to monetize our Kitimat position. We simply believe that the substantial go forward capital required by Kitimat will be best reinvested in U.S. oil shale plays. We hope this explains to shareholders our logic regarding the exit of this project.","In Trinidad, our fourth quarter gas sales were lower than previous quarters due to downtime from planned maintenance and construction work on our offshore facilities. We are currently in the middle of a drilling program which includes four wells off of our Osprey platform. These wells are expected to be completed in the first half of 2013. In Trinidad, we expect natural gas production to decrease by 4% this year. This is a function of the timing of first production from our current drilling program.","In the East Irish sea, we expect our Conwy oil project to start production early in the fourth quarter.","I will now address two other EOG differentiators, frac sand and oil margins. Frac sand is easy to explain. Our sand plants ran at essentially 100% during the fourth quarter and met our completion needs. In the fourth quarter our U.S. crude oil price realization was $10.52 over WTI, up from $5.45 in the third quarter. During the fourth quarter and currently our Eagle Ford crude is priced off an LLS index and essentially all of our Bakken and part of our Wolfcamp crude is being railed to our St. James terminal. To a large degree, our domestic crude price is linked more closely to LLS than WTI. We expect that the recent Seaway Pipeline delays will continue to provide us with marketing prices advantage.","I will now address 2012 reserve replacement and finding costs. Because of the extraordinarily low 2012 gas prices and current SEC rules, all companies with gas reserves will likely incur reserve write-downs and EOG is no exception. This will make it very hard for analysts to compare overall 2012 reserve metrics with past years. Because of low natural gas prices, EOG has written off essentially all of our dry gas PUDs in the Horn River, Marcellus, Haynesville and Barnett.","Additionally, our existing gas PDPs have been significantly reduced because of shale gas reductions. The total write-off related to price you 3.2 Tcfe. However, excluding these price-related reasons, our reserve replacement and finding cost metrics are excellent. We replaced 268% of production at $12.60 Boe total finding cost. This compares to last year's number of $18.74 per Boe. Our ratio of liquids in our total reserves, increased from 28% in 2010 to 36% in 2011 to 256% at year-end 2012.","Our domestic crude oil replacement rates from drilling was 442%. Overall, I believe EOG had an outstanding highly economic reserve replacement year, and I think the removal of gas reserves from our books properly reflects the new low gas price reality. Our reserve books are now more reflective of an oil company.","For the 25th consecutive year, DeGolyer and MacNaughton has done their own independent engineering analysis with the high reserves and that overall number was within 5% of our internal estimate. Their analysis covered 87% of our proved reserves this year. Please see the schedules accompanying the earnings release for the calculation of reserve replacement and finding costs.","Now I will provide our views regarding macro, hedging and crude by rail. Regarding oil, we think the NYMEX correctly reflects slightly 2013 WTI prices, which we expect to be in the mid-90s. We think the dangers of a global recession are slowly abating, so we continue to be cautiously optimistic regarding oil.","For 2013, as a percent of total company oil production, we are approximately 49% hedged at an average price of $98.85. Now, also note that we have some options that could be exercised further increasing our hedge position. Please see the table that was included in our earnings press release for the details of our hedging contracts.","As you know, our crude-by-rail system has been a profitable venture for us and is one reason why our average domestic oil price was $10.52 over WTI during the fourth quarter, likely the highest in the industry for any company with similarly situated crude. Although currently the price differentials at St. James in Houston continues to be very advantageous as compared to Cushing, it's possible that the spread between Houston and WTI may narrow late this year as additional pipeline from Cushing in the Permian come online.","We are already working on plans to use our rail system to maximize crude margins in 2014 and 2015 possibly by delivering to different destinations. Regarding North American natural gas, we continue to have a negative outlook and our drilling plans reflect this bias. We believe that those that are counting on the low gas directed rig count to balance the market will be disappointed because of the large associated gas volumes with drilling in combo-type plays. We have 150 million cubic feet per day hedged at $4.79 per MMBtu this year.","We are also bearish regarding 2013 ethane prices. We think it's unlikely that ethane will rebound much this year. It's likely that most producers including EOG will be on the cusp of ethane rejection throughout the year. For example, in January and February, EOG for the first time chose to keep out of Eagle Ford ethane in the gas stream reducing our NGL production by 4,000 barrels per day and we are projecting the Eagle Ford ethane rejection throughout the year. We have taken this into account in our lower NGL production growth estimates for the year.","Now I'll address our 2013 business plan, which is congruent with what we reported in our November call. We expect our 2013 CapEx to be between $7.0 billion to $7.2 billion, a reduction of approximately $400 million from 2012. Approximately $1.2 billion of this will be devoted to facilities, gathering systems and other infrastructure. We expect to spend very little, approximately $25 million, on North American dry gas drilling to hold acreage. We have already invested the drilling capital in previous years to hold the remainder of our dry gas acreage that we want to retain. Because of low NGL pricing, we shift some funds away from the Barnett combo to the Eagle Ford and Bakken. We are targeting 28% oil growth which on and absolute the OPD basis is the same as last year. A tall order for a company our size.","I will note that only a very small portion of this is condensate. Essentially all of our oil production is exactly that, crude oil. We are not particularly interested in growing the ethane portion of NGLs and expect 10% NGL growth, primarily because we are assuming full year Eagle Ford ethane rejection. It will be purely an economic decision as the year progresses. We are not driven by NGL production growth.","Since North American gas continues to be a money loser, we have zero interest in growing gas volumes and expect decreasing production for the fifth consecutive year regarding gas. We forecast EOG natural gas production to decline 14% in the U.S. due the past property sales and lack of gas drilling, but this also could be affected by ethane rejection.","In Canada, we also expect natural gas production to decrease by 24%. In Trinidad, we expect natural gas production to decrease by 4%. This is more a function of our well downtime due to our planned regional program. Overall, we expect total company production growth of plus 4%.","However the only metrics that drive financial performance is our crude oil growth. Additionally, we plan to sell approximately $550 million worth of assets of which 85% has already closed this year so far. The biggest component of this is our already closed Kitimat sale. We still plan to maintain a strong balance sheet keeping the net debt to total cap ratio below 30%.","Based on the current NYMEX strip we expect this plan to generate a reduction in the net debt ratio and year-over-year growth in DCF, GAAP and non-GAAP EPS and adjusted EBITDAX per share as well as healthy year-over-year improvement in ROE and ROCE. Given that we are bearish regarding pricing for two out of three of our hydrocarbon products, we think that is quite an impressive outcome.","Now I will turn it over to Tim Driggers to discuss financials and capital structure.","Timothy Driggers","Thanks, Mark. Capitalized interest for the quarter was $13 million and $49.7 million for the full year. For the fourth quarter 2012, total cash exploration and development expenditures were $1.5 billion, excluding asset retirement obligations. In addition, cash expenditures for gathering systems, processing plants and other property, plant and equipment were $143 million. For the full year 2012, total cash exploration and development expenditures were $6.9 billion, excluding asset retirement obligations. Cash expenditures for gathering systems, processing plants and other property, plant and equipment were $620 million.","Acquisitions for the year was $700,000. For the year, proceeds from asset sales were $1.3 billion. It December 31, 2012, total debt outstanding was $6.3 billion and the debt to total capitalization ratio was 32%. At December 31, we had $0.9 billion of cash on hand, giving us non-GAAP net debt of $5.4 billion or net debt to total cap ratio of 29%.","On a GAAP basis, the effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was negative 13% caused principally by impairments reported in Canada. The deferred tax ratio was negative 157%. The current tax provision for the fourth quarter was $152 million. EOG's board increased the dividend on EOG's common stock for the 14th time in 14 years by 10% to an indicated annual rate of $0.75 per share.","Yesterday, we included a guidance table with earnings press release for the first quarter and full year 2013. For the first quarter and full year, the effective tax rate is estimated to be 35% to 45%. We have also provided an estimated range of the dollar amount of current taxes that we expect to record during the first quarter and for the full year.","Now I'll turn it back to Mark.","Mark Papa","Now, let me summarize. In my opinion, there are five important points to take away from this call. First, our Eagle Ford potential reserve increase gives EOG a domestic shale oil inventory unsurpassed in the industry. As I stated earlier in the call, we expect industry-wide Eagle Ford oil production to surpass the Bakken over the next two years and EOG indisputably has a premier Eagle Ford oil position in addition to our strong Bakken position.","Our 2.2 billion Boe net Eagle Ford position is not theoretical. The production results are visible on both, in EOG and industry scale. When add in our Permian and Barnett Combo assets, we have an unsurpassed inventory of proven reinvestment opportunities. Second, we have added a new Greenfield project to our portfolio with the Permian Basin and Delaware Wolfcamp, plus a significant Leonard Shale upgrade. Additionally, we are excited about additional future Greenfield shale projects. Third, as predicted, this is the year when we expect to reduce our net debt ratio based on current future prices. Fourth, our 10% dividend increase is a tangible signal of our growing confidence and cash flow stream. Finally, and most importantly, we expect our key financial metrics such as EPS, adjusted EBITDAX, DCF, ROE and ROCE to show positive year-over-year improvement in 2013.","Thanks for listening, and now we will go to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions). We will take our first question from Doug Leggate of Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Good morning, everybody, and thanks for all the color, Mark, on the down spacing. You talked in the past about continued adverse supply and increase your recovery rates there obviously you've done a good job on that.","Would you now say that 8% is that pretty much target achieved or do you think there is still more running room there and just curious as to what else you might do in terms of trying to look at your recovery rates and I have a follow-up please.","Mark Papa","Yes, Doug. There is, no, we can't say that the 8% is the final, final, final answer at all. In terms of what we are still looking at doing on there, there is the continued work on non-potential additional spacing seeing improvements from frac enhancement and then the one that I think is the big hitter potential hitter out there is secondary recovery.","In the case of the Eagle Ford, it would be through the gas injection and we have commenced our pilot gas injection project down there in the Eagle Ford, and the reason I mentioned it on the script is that it may be as long as two years before we really have a read on the outcome of a pilot project. I just only want to give a timeline on it, but its worse our investors knowing that the pilot project is underway but it's not anything that we are going to be able to provide quarter-by-quarter feedback as to how is the pilot coming or anything like that. But it is fair to say that we are cautiously optimistic that we will come up with a method of significantly enhancing the recovery above the 8% number.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. Thank you for the answer. my follow-up is really, you have been very disciplined in the focus of your balance sheet and so on but when you take a right turn, obviously you are inflating your net debt to cap. It makes me wonder, given you have got so much resource opportunity, particularly the upgrade in the Leonard, is that still the right metric, the 30% net debt to cap? Is that still the label in terms of pacing your development and if you could maybe share any updated thoughts on how might try to monetize or bring forward some of those non-core assets, not much non-core, as that Eagle Ford and Bakken, through a joint venture or something? So I will now leave it there, Mark. Thank you.","Mark Papa","The write-down cost, I think I might have said, about 2% net debt penalty, if you will. We ended the year at 29% in asset to write down. We thought we would have ended the year about a 27% number on there. So you can say we have a little tighter boundary if we stick with the 30%. I think what we wanted to indicate, if you look at the bigger picture and we have the chart in our IR slide that we released this morning, that showed years of our inventory, if we assume that we turf up zero additional Greenfield plays and we have already advised you we are working on additional Greenfield plays, that two things show up.","One is the locus of future investments is likely to shift to the Permian basin more heavily than you would have expected before this earnings call just due to what we are seeing in the Leonard and the Delaware basin Wolfcamp.","The second thing is that as we develop into a potential free cash flow situation starting in 2014, in other words there were questions as to what we are going to do with the free cash flow. I think that the picture is becoming clearer that where that free cash flow is likely to go is into reinvestments into both Eagle Ford and into the Permian basin area likely, which will generate additional production growth, high rates of production growth in the out years than we would have expected otherwise.","So we are still at the camp and I know that disagrees with your thinking. We are still not leaning towards JVs in any of the plays that the our key plays, however. Hopefully that gives you an answer.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes, it does. Thanks very much, Mark.","Operator","We will go next to Leo Mariani with RBC Capital.","Leo Mariani - RBC Capital","Hey, guys, just a quick follow-up on the Eagle Ford. Obviously you guys increased your potential tremendously here. I just kind of look at some of the numbers, do some quick math, 569,000 net acres, 5,500 locations you have identified. That equates to about 103 acre spacing. You guys are talking more about 50 acres spacing. So it is fair to say that you guys have really high graded that 569,000 acres and are excluding maybe some of the untested areas in that number. So potentially if those were to work, it will drive the number higher?","Mark Papa","No, it's not so much high graded. All the acreage is good but by the time you eliminate all the subsurface areas such as faults and everything, and then by the time you honor the lease line that are in there, such as you can't drill wells across the lease lines, then you stay certain boundaries away from lease lines. The amount of effective acreage you can drill on is considerably less than that 569,000. So, that's really the difference between the 100 acres if that's what you were quoting there and effectively the, roughly 50 acres. It's really how much of that acreage can you really access, it's not in a geologic fault or. That's just due to lease line issues Railroad Commission limitation issues you can really access.","Leo Mariani - RBC Capital","All right. That's helpful. I guess, just switching gears over to the Permian, you are obviously taking your Leonard Shale estimate up tremendously 65 million Boe to 500 is a pretty big job, and you are kind of doing something similar in the Delaware with 800 million Boe. Those are pretty big numbers. It seems like the results reported, you got not a tremendous number of wells. I mean, what gives you confidence in sort of putting those pretty large numbers out there?","Mark Papa","Yes. Now, that's a good question, Leo. Both of those shales are extremely rich, the Leonard is in most places up to 200 million barrels of oil equivalent per section. And then in the Wolfcamp Shale, is even richer and thicker in some places just up to 300 million barrels of oil equivalent, so they have a lot of resource in place and a lot to work with and each play also has multiple targets and we are working with at least two targets in the Leonard on all of our acreage and in some places we have three or four targets in the Leonard.","In the Wolfcamp, we are looking at lease three targets and in some parts of our acreage also, so there is a lot of potential plays zone. When we complete the wells, we're able to isolate the each individual target and we've also had really good success in the Leonard at continuing to down space. We've tested pattern from 80 acre spacing per target and we've not seen a lot of between the wells and so that's very positive also.","Of the other things going on in all of our plays are frac technology is really increasing. With each wells, the wells are getting better because of that and we have a pretty strong history. We have 47 wells we've completed before the Leonard, so we have a lot of history on the actual production.","Then in the Wolfcamp in Delaware Basin, as you know, there is a lot of deep penetrations by vertical wells for different plays and deeper targets of years, and so on our acreage, we have over 200 well penetrations that we have gotten valves on and subsurface control for both, the Leonard and Wolfcamp, so we have a lot of confidence that the reserve potential is there and then we've been able to continue to reduce our cost on our drilling program, so we've got a lot of confidence that these plays are really very significant plays and we are excited about. They are able to generate very high rates of return on the drilling that we've done so far right now.","Leo Mariani - RBC Capital","That's really helpful. Thanks.","Operator","Operator","We'll go next to Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley","Good morning, guys. Pretty helpful update. Just follow-up on the downspacing comment one more time on Eagle Ford, I know you different lease line issues or other issues that imply 45% of your operated [resource]. On that tighter spacing, but I also presume there's some risking element on the spacing, so any comments maybe on how aggressive or conservative assumption might be currently or how the risking might progress and when you might have more data to adjustments on that potential location increases, which is effectively.","William Thomas","Yes. If you are kind of saying can you expect on the earnings call next quarter that we are going to again raise reserve in Eagle Ford for the subsequent quarter, I would say for the year 2013, you should not have any expectations that we are going to be given another number in Sand with a number locations is going up again in the Eagle Ford, so now it's going to take some time to digest.","So, there is certainly a possibility down the road, but for the next 12 months. I think the number that we have given you, the $2.2 billion is probably where we are going to sit at.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Maybe a commodity question. Thanks for sharing your view on the commodity but any views on condensate pricing? I know we are beginning to see some price degradation as likely those imports are backed out of the Gulf region. Do you expect any price degradation of this higher API hydrocarbon stream? Thanks.","Mark Papa","Yes, I will give you a comment regarding condensate vis-\u00e0-vis the Eagle Ford. We have a chart in the IR slide we rolled out this morning specifically relating to the Eagle Ford. A point that we will make is that all of our Eagle Ford production is indeed crude oil and the chart that we have shows the major producers there and relative gravity of the oil or condensate production that the producers have as compiled by IETF. What you will see from that chart is that EOG is clearly the largest producer, that EOG's production is well within the oil column, in terms of gravity but many be of the rest of the producers there are actually producing condensate as opposed to oil.","But I will say is there is definitely a difficulty in marketing the condensate in the Eagle Ford area. You just have to talk to the other producers to see what kind of prices they are actually receiving for that condensate.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley","Very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","We will go next to Bob Brackett with Bernstein Research.","Bob Brackett - Bernstein Research","Hi, good morning. I hate to harp on the Eagle Ford downspacing but I can't resist. If I think about 40 acre spacing, you are basically picking 16 one mile laterals into a square-mile. In the past, you kind of targeted a key zone in the Eagle Ford. Is the go forward plan more of a staggered development with one offsetting in the upper and one in the lower?","Mark Papa","The answer to that is directionally no, Bob. Its wells that are spaced the quite closely together, generally in the same stratigraphic interval in the Eagle Ford as opposed to one in, say the upper Eagle Ford and one in lower Eagle Ford. That\u2019s where you get the issue of a question that logically it would come up, wait a minute, you were quoting 450 MBoe per well and now you are quoting 400 MBoe per well. There is some inner well drainage. Bill, you may add something to that here?","William Thomas","Yes, one of the things, Bob, that we have been able to accomplish is, on our frac geometry, we have been able to increase the complexity of the surplus area that were connecting with each well and we have also been able to contain the geometry on that complexity closer to the well. So we are not fracing really long wing link kind of frac. We are really keeping that frac really close to the well and just increasing the amount of surface close to the well. That really is the big driver in harvesting more and more reserves. If you can do that, keep it close to the well and then you can drill more wells without significant interference.","Bob Brackett - Bernstein Research","And what do you think about the vertical height of these fractures? Are we looking at things that are kind of tall but skinny?","William Thomas","Well, we have them more aggressive with our fracs. More sand and more frac rates and one of the advantages that the Eagle Ford has over many of the shale plays, it has a very good upper and lower fracs barriers. So, yes, you are right. I mean the fracs are more contained close to the well but they are fully contacting the play, the 200 or 300 feet of that play in the Eagle Ford and it is creating a lot of complexity. So the increased frac rate does help that. You could connect all the play.","Bob Brackett - Bernstein Research","Thanks, and then a follow-up. In the past, really only two world-class shale oil plays and\/or plays in North America, the Bakken in the Eagle Ford. As you spend more time in the Permian, is that emerging as a credible number three or is it part of a long tail of number three?","William Thomas","Yes. I think it's still certainly number three, and it's still a bit different number three. Part of that is, many of the Permian plays are still a bit comb. They are not as rich in oil. Although we are making headway on that part of it too, but just the quality of the rock the kind of metrics contribution you can get them, the Eagle Ford and the Bakken is exceptional compared to the kind of metrics contribution you can get from the Permian plays. The Permian plays are very good plays, and don't get us wrong. We are not certainly down on those, but they are still I think a bit distant PUD.","Operator","We'll go next to Charles Meade with Johnson Rice.","Charles Meade - Johnson Rice","Good morning, everyone. I want to go back to the Bakken on the question. I think Bill Thomas said in his prepared remarks was Hawkeye wells were Three Forks wells and I am curious of two things. One are those the best Three Forks wells you've seen yet and where in that Three Forks section are the place and do you see possibility for more than one bench in Three Forks?","William Thomas","Yes. Those Three Forks wells are in our Antelope area. And in the Antelope area, we do have a significant column hydrocarbon column in the Three Forks, and we have all four benches that have oil in them. That's just the well believe was drilled in the upper bench and it's certainly a good well. I wouldn't say it's any more outstanding than some of the other wells we have completed and we are working on that three forks development and we'll be testing 160-acre spacing and we will be testing multiple benches over the next over year or so, so the Three Forks, particularly in Antelope, where it has a lot of upside for us.","Charles Meade - Johnson Rice","Got it. Thank you. And also going back to, I think point maybe you glanced on a few times here. crude-by-rail marketing. I think, Mark you've kind of made illusion in your comments that you might be looking at taking crude from the Bakken to the East Coast by rail, and maybe you guys are not ready to talk about that, but if you were to start that now, when should we expect that crude might be delivered to the East Coast?","William Thomas","Well, actually we made a few spot deliveries in the last couple months to the East Coast just kind of, (Inaudible) and where we are right now is we are really just kind of doing some strategic work as to the with a plateau of new pipelines that will be the installed during late 2013, specifically to the Gulf Coast. What does that really mean life in crude differentials and then where would we want place or Bakken and our Eagle Ford crude in 2014 and 2015, and then what would we need to do to get in place change our destination, so we are really not ready to talk about that specifically other than to provide our investors that the system we have in place and the locations, where we are selling our crude today are not necessarily where we will be selling our crude in 2014 and 2015.","Operator","We'll go next to Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs","Thanks. Good morning. Just following up on prior question with regards to transporting crude to different destination, what if any capital commitment would be required to shift the focus of your crude going from where you have it largely going now to the Gulf Coast, and is it baked into your 2013 guidance or to the degree that you feel that there is the need to get more crude elsewhere, would you need to raise your capital budget for that?","William Thomas","I mean, the one thing about the crude-by-rail is, it's pretty flexible. We don't think there is any capital requirement over and above what's already included in our guidance guidance. We have already got the tanker cars which is a key thing in the track access with railroads. The offloading terminal would be the issues at a different destinations. We are working on some deals there that would probably end up being joint ventures with other people. So at this stage, we don\u2019t think that there will be huge capital commitments either in 2013 or 2014 for the offloading terminals.","So the main thing is just trying to figure out what is likely to happen with these differentials. You know, Goldman has their ideas, everybody has got their ideas, but we are proceeding on the concept that at any point in time that we will be somewhere in the U.S. where there is an advantageous differentials relative to other locations in the U.S. and our job is to see if we can make sure we can get our crude to that advantageously priced location.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs","That\u2019s helpful. Then as a follow-up, going back to the Delaware basin. In the Southern Delaware basin where you reported the recent well, is that production mix that you expect going forward consistent with the production mix from that well? I think Bill until mentioned just in a couple questions ago that you are making headway on production mix and I was wondering if you could add some color to what you can do to improve the oil production mix in the Delaware and the Permian?","William Thomas","No, I think it is. I think those two wells are representative of what we will see in that particular acreage based going forward. The Wolfcamp does get more oily as you move to the north in the New Mexico in some places. We have not drilled a Wolfcamp well up there yet but hopefully that will be a bit more oily. The main thing on increasing the oil out of these combo plays is certainly the narrow rocking connected to the well's surface area is a big deal.","We also have some production techniques we are working on. I think we are not really ready to talk about those right now but we are making some headway on helping to increase the recovery of oil there but we feel really good. I think these whole combo plays are certainly more challenging as these NGL prices have weakened but going forward I believe that we will be able to technically improve those and make those plays better in the future.","Mark Papa","Yes, just to add a little bit color to that, Brian. For example, in the in the Leonard play out there, where we previously had shown that the mix was about 41%, although now we are saying the mix is about 50% oil, a lot of it is in the design of the fracs. We typically keep trying to close mouth about most of this stuff because we don\u2019t want share our secrets but the concept of designing the fracs to not have fracs that are necessarily long fracs but have fracs that really increase the surface area near the wellbore more efficiently as opposed to just having long fracs that increases surface area far from the wellbore.","What that does is it really likely improves the ability for oil to flow in a radius around the wellbore and that is probably what we think is causing the increased oil yield. So there is things you can do on frac designs that can modify things and help in these combo plays to get more oil out of them. So I am particularly impressed with this Leonard play.","A couple reasons why they are upgraded reserves. Number one, that 55 million Boe, that\u2019s probably have a two to three year-old reserve estimate. So it\u2019s a very stale reserve estimate. Number two, all that acreage has been held by production. So we haven\u2019t had any urgent lease expirations. So we haven\u2019t been drilling frantically on it to hold leases. That\u2019s one where even though we take our time, do our science, we purposely kept quiet, as EOG does on some of these plays until we get our Ps and Qs right, but when you take 550 million Boe at 50% oil, we have got something pretty good there and that's going to turn into a pretty significant oil play for us. And that's obviously moved up considerably on our priority list for the particularly 2014-2015 kind of timeframe for capital.","Operator","This does conclude today's question-and-answer session. Mr. Papa, at this time, I will turn the conference back to you for additional or closing remarks.","Mark Papa","I have no additional remarks. Thank you for listening.","Operator","This does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation."],"8896":["EOG Resources, Inc.

As a reminder, this call is being recorded.","At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to the Chief Financial Officer of EOG Resources, Mr. Tim Driggers. Please go ahead, sir.","Tim Driggers","Thank you, and good morning. Thanks for joining us. We hope everyone has seen the press release announcing fourth quarter and full-year 2018 earnings and operational results.","This conference call includes forward-looking statements. The risks associated with forward-looking statements have been outlined in the earnings release and EOG\u2019s SEC filings, and we incorporate those by reference for this call.","This conference call also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Definitions as well as reconciliation schedules for these non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures can be found on our website at www.eogresources.com.","Some of the reserve estimates on this conference call may include estimated potential reserves and estimated resource potential, not necessarily calculated in accordance with the SEC\u2019s reserve reporting guidelines. We incorporate by reference the cautionary note to U.S. investors that appears at the bottom of our earnings release issued yesterday.","Participating on the call this morning are Bill Thomas, Chairman and CEO; Billy Helms, Chief Operating Officer; Ken Boedeker, EVP, Exploration and Production; Ezra Yacob, EVP Exploration and Production; and David Streit, VP, Investor and Public Relations.","Here\u2019s Bill Thomas.","Bill Thomas","Thanks, Tim, and good morning everyone. Our long-term game plan is simple, be one of the best performing companies across all sectors in the S&P 500. Our goal is to deliver double-digit returns and double-digit growth throughout commodity price cycles.","In addition to high returns and disciplined organic growth, our goal is to generate free cash flow that supports a growing dividend and impeccable balance sheet and allows the company to take advantage of other opportunities, such as bolt-on property additions that meet our strict premium reinvestment standard or potential opportunities to repurchase shares when value accretive.","In 2018, EOG accomplished our goal by delivering 15% return on capital employed, organically growing oil production 19% and generating $1.7 billion in free cash flow. Our 2018 performance places EOG among the very best, in line with top performers in any sector of the market.","Last year, we earned a company record adjusted net income of $3.2 billion. Our 2018 15% return on capital employed at $65 oil surpassed our 2014 return on capital employed when oil prices averaged significantly higher at $95. It\u2019s clear, our permanent shift to premium strategy three years ago has had a dramatic effect on the profitability of the company.","EOG\u2019s premium standard requires investments to earn at least 30% direct after-tax rate of return at $40 oil and $2.50 natural gas. Consistently applying this standard to our capital allocation decisions has reset the company to be successful throughout commodity price cycles.","In addition to double-digit returns and growth in 2018, we also generated a company record of $1.7 billion in free cash flow, increased the dividend rate 31% and reduced our net debt to capitalization ratio from 25% to 19%, delivering high-return organic growth producing free cash flow, returning cash to shareholders by increasing the dividend and reducing our debt is a significant achievement. This combination is rare, not only in our industry, but in the broader market.","Our ambition is to make this level of performance to norm for EOG Resources. Consistent with our long-term game plan, our 2019 $6.3 billion capital program is forecasted to deliver 12% to 16% U.S. oil production growth. We\u2019re excited about 2019, because we\u2019re building on our cost reduction momentum from last year. Per barrel cost \u2013 per barrel cash operating cost are expected to go down again this year.","We continue to both improve well productivity and lower well costs and estimate that the average 2019 well will generate $6 million net present value at $55 oil. These improvements are expected to increase our capital efficiency by more than 10%. As a result, the price of oil needed to fund our 2019 capital and the dividend with discretionary cash flow is less than $50. With oil at $55, we expect to generate significant free cash flow.","Our 2019 disciplined growth and capital program will allow the company to increase returns by discovering and applying new technological breakthroughs, improving operating efficiencies and continuously reducing cost in every area of our business. Accordingly, we are spending a bit less this year on growing oil and a bit more on opportunistic proprietary new horizontal potential.","Applying our proprietary knowledge, we believe the new prospects have the potential to meaningfully improve the quality of our drilling inventory and improve our future returns. Today, it takes oil prices in the mid-50s for EOG to generate double-digit return on capital employed, and in the foreseeable future, we see that price dropping into the 40s. It would be incorrect to assume that EOG is permanently shifting into a lower-growth mode.","Our goal is to continue to lower our break-even costs, improve margins and reset the company to sustainably deliver double-digit returns and double-digit growth throughout commodity price cycles.","EOG continues to be the peer leader in return on capital employed and disciplined growth. We are rapidly becoming one of the low-cost producers in the global energy market and we embrace a strong commitment to sustainability.","Our goal of double-digit returns, double-digit growth and free cash flow puts EOG in line with the best companies across all sectors in the market. We are truly excited about 2019, and our ability to continue to improve and to deliver significant long-term shareholder value.","Next up is Billy to review our operational performance in 2018 and provide details on our 2019 plan.","Billy Helms","Thanks, Bill. Our high-return production growth in 2018 is a result of investing in our diverse inventory of premium drilling across 11 plays in six different basins. EOG\u2019s 2018 performance illustrates the perseverance of our operating teams to continually get better by improving both well productivity and reducing cost, the two key components that drive sustainable improvements in capital efficiency.","In the fourth quarter of 2018, we made the decision to maintain activity and retain top-performing service providers in order to accomplish these two specific goals. As a result, and in the face of increasing oil prices and service cost inflation throughout most of 2018, EOG achieved a 3% reduction in the average well cost by the fourth quarter.","To be clear, the cost improvements are not from decreases in service cost, instead the lower cost are due to more efficient operations from faster drilling speeds, increased completion stages per day, reduced sand cost, water recycling and infrastructure projects. In addition, you can see the improvements in well productivity across our plays, with the fourth quarter well results provided in the presentation slides.","Our 2019 program is built upon these already proven results of the existing domestic program. Furthermore, our operating teams continue to deliver results consistent with the well cost and productivity achieved last year. As a result, the momentum carried from 2018 gives us confidence that we can achieve the 2019 plan objectives.","In addition, by retaining these services, we have secured about 65% of our anticipated services and materials requirements for 2019. We negotiated terms at both lock in services cost and maintain flexibility to adjust our activity level depending on market conditions.","However, it is important to note that we will not increase capital should oil prices increase. We forecast our 2019 $6.3 billion capital program will deliver 12% to 16% U.S. oil production growth. Every one of our major plays is expected to contribute to that growth. The plan is designed to generate significant free cash flow and is balanced below $50, meaning, we can cover our capital and dividend with discretionary cash flow.","The 2019 plan includes slightly more capital for gathering and processing and other facilities, which largely consist of additional water and oil gathering infrastructure in our major plays. In Trinidad, we allocated a small increase as well for its drilling program in 2019.","Our domestic development program spend will be slightly lower, but much more capital-efficient due to advances made last year. In addition, we continue to make progress in advancing new completion technology that we believe will further improve well productivity and reduce completion cost. Early results indicate measurable increases in production performance.","In addition to what is assumed in our 2019 plan, we have set further ambitious goals, including reducing total well cost another 5%, lowering all-in finding cost 10%, improving well productivity through the application of new technology, 90% of wells drilled meeting the premium definition and adding new premium inventory at a pace faster than we are drilling it.","Finally, our 2019 plan includes more capital for exploration of new drilling potential.","Here\u2019s Ezra to update you on those efforts.","Ezra Yacob","Thanks, Billy. Our decentralized structure allows our asset teams to identify high-quality unconventional reservoirs and capture acreage as the first mover with low-entry costs. Our ability to capture the sweet spots of these plays is the most significant reason we consistently drill top tier performing wells.","Currently, we are leveraging proprietary knowledge from numerous plays across our portfolio and have identified multiple opportunities. We\u2019re focused on applying our technical knowledge of horizontal drilling and completions to higher-quality unconventional reservoirs, and we\u2019ll be leasing acreage and drilling our initial test wells in 2019.","Our goal is to increase the quality of our inventory with new plays that can deliver higher production at lower costs, providing a vehicle for continued improvement of our finding costs, DD&A rate and ultimately ROCE. By focusing more resources to these new innovative play concepts, we\u2019re taking advantage of market conditions to opportunistically add low-cost, high-return inventory to our portfolio.","I\u2019ll now discuss our Delaware Basin results, where we produced more than 220,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2018, making it our fastest growing asset for the third year in a row. Oil production grew nearly 50%, averaging 127,000 barrels of oil per day, with more than 260 net wells going to sales.","In addition, we more than replaced those wells, identifying 375 net new premium locations last year. We also made significant progress blocking up our acreage through trade adding 600,000 feet of premium treated lateral, which is the equivalent of about 85 well locations.","Last year, we focused our attention on developing larger packages, drilling longer laterals and increasing our operational efficiency across our 400,000-plus net acre position in the Delaware Basin. The results of this effort includes a 31% increase in completed lateral feet per day, a 9% decrease in completions cost and an 18% reduction in drilling days per well.","We also continued strategic expansion of our oil, gas and water infrastructure. In 2018, we put into service an oil gathering system and terminal across the core of our acreage position. This system and terminal will ultimately have up to five connections to downstream markets, where we secured firm capacity to Cushing and Corpus Christi.","In 2018, we flowed about half of our oil production through this system, resulting in over $22 million in transportation savings. We will realize increased savings in 2019 as additional wells are connected to this oil system. Our current target is to have 85% of our oil production on pipe by year-end.","The first-half of 2018 was also marked by extensive learnings from spacing tests, both horizontally within one target and staggered vertically across multiple targets. From our test, we gathered a tremendous amount of drilling completions and production data and have applied those learnings to our development program. Optimizing our target spacing and completions designs based on local geology resulted in an increased well performance during the second-half of 2018.","Our Delaware Basin program last year highlights our ability to quickly transform data collection and analytics into better well productivity and lower well cost in order to optimize the returns and NPV of this world-class asset. Using what we learned in 2018 to refine our spacing and staggered development patterns, combined with new completion technology, we expect to continue to improve well productivity throughout 2019.","Next up is Ken to review highlights on our Eagle Ford and Woodford Oil Window plays.","Kenneth Boedeker","Thanks, Ezra. 2019 marks our 10th-year developing the Eagle Ford. This workhorse asset remains EOG\u2019s premier oil play, delivering a consistent performance year-after-year. The Eagle Ford grew oil production by 9% last year to 171,000 barrels of oil per day, representing 43% of EOG\u2019s total crude oil production. Even after 10 years, we continue to learn and improve well productivity, find efficiencies and lower costs.","We extended laterals another 7% from 2017, primarily on our western acreage, where there is less faulting. In fact, we drilled a record 65 wells, with laterals over 10,000 feet in 2018. We continue to push the limits of lateral length, setting a record with our Slytherin C#3H at 13,500 feet of treated lateral length. Wells in our western acreage produce lower IPs, but have slightly lower decline rates and are more cost-efficient.","In 2018, we updated our premium inventory for the Eagle Ford, adding 145 net locations through infills, acreage bolt-ons and longer laterals. We\u2019re confident we can continue to drive sustainable cost efficiencies in our effort to convert the remaining inventory of our total 7,200 net locations to premium status.","In 2018, we also continue to see very positive results in our secondary recovery efforts in the Eagle Ford. Results to date are in line with our early expectations for this enhanced oil recovery process and we have approximately 150 wells in various stages of injection and production. We\u2019re continuing to refine our technique and expect this project to grow in the future.","We have found that this process works best, when infill development has been completed throughout the area. So we\u2019re focusing our efforts in 2019 towards finishing primary development of nearby units before expanding our secondary recovery footprint.","In 2019, we plan to complete 300 net wells in the Eagle Ford due to capital efficiency gains, we expect to spend almost 10% less capital for a similar number of wells as 2018. In the Anadarko Basin Woodford Oil Window, we\u2019re building operational momentum. We introduced this play at the end of 2017, ramped up our development in 2018 and more than doubled production.","The Woodford Oil Play is a concentrated sweet spot of moderately over-pressured high-quality permeable rock located primarily in McClain County, Oklahoma. These wells are low decline, low GOR and produce an average of 42 degree API oil. We made significant improvements in well cost last year by improving our operational efficiency and we expect to carry those improvements forward into 2019, with a new target well cost of $7.6 million.","Highlight from activity during the fourth quarter of 2018 was our GALAXY 2536 well. This well\u2019s estimated ultimate recovery is 1.5 million barrels of oil equivalent. In its first 30 days, it averaged 1,400 barrels of oil per day and 1,950 barrels of oil equivalent per day.","Based on spacing and targeting test last year, we believe the right distance between wells is less than 660 feet. In 2019, we\u2019ll conduct additional targeting tests and continue to use new completion technology that we expect will allow for closer well spacing. Our initial resource estimate of more than 200 million barrels of oil equivalent was based on 660-foot spacing. So there is additional upside in this play. We\u2019re very optimistic we can expand our current inventory of 260 net premium locations.","In 2019, we plan to slightly increase Woodford Oil Window completions to roughly 13 net wells and expect will more than double production again.","Now here\u2019s Billy to review our Bakken and Rockies plays.","Billy Helms","Thanks, Ken. The Bakken remains an important asset in EOG\u2019s diverse portfolio of plays, providing flexibility for reinvestment at our premium return hurdle rate. Over the last several years, we\u2019ve made significant progress in the Williston Basin on precision targeting, the drilling and completion efficiencies. Between better well production and tremendous cost improvements, our Bakken program delivered over 70% direct well level returns.","In 2019, we\u2019ll continue to focus our 20 net well plan in the Bakken core and expand our development of the Antelope Extension. The Antelope Extension is part of our Williston Basin core acreage and the area now benefits from additional midstream infrastructure and takeaway capacity, driving better economics through reduced transportation cost and LOE. We are also testing new completion technology and are optimistic that it will improve productivity and lower cost.","2018 was an incredible year for operational improvements in our Rockies plays in the Powder River and DJ Basins. We increased our completions efficiency dramatically, achieving a 38% improvement in feet of treated lateral per day. Our cost to drill averaged just $100 per foot and drilling days declined 20%.","Rockies-wide, we either met or beat all of our cost targets for the year by the end of the first quarter of 2018. In the Powder River Basin, our core acreage doubled to more than 400,000 net acres following the 2016 Yates merger.","In 2018, we added more than 1,500 premium net drilling locations and nearly 2 billion barrels of oil equivalent of net resource potential through the addition of Mowry and Niobrara shale plays and new locations identified in the Turner sand. Furthermore, as we continue to block up our acreage position, we see significant upside to add to our premium inventory over time.","During the fourth quarter, two Powder River Basin Mowry wells came online, delivering an average 30-day initial production of more than 2,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. In the Powder River Basin Turner, we completed four wells that averaged 1,400 barrels of oil equivalent per day for the first 30 days.","Last year, we moved the DJ Basin into full development and produced record volumes of nearly 30,000 barrels of oil per day. But the bigger story in the DJ was drilling performance. Average drilling days were already an impressive 4.4 days and we reduced another 7% to 4.1 days. Due to lower pressure, the IP rates aren\u2019t as flashy as some other plays, but these are some of the lowest-cost wells in the company and they consistently deliver premium level returns.","The sustainable improvements we have made to the cost structure of the Powder River Basin and the DJ Basin over the last year, combined with moderate decline wells, drove record low finding cost and record high returns in 2018. Performance from our Rockies plays are highly competitive with our largest premium assets.","Here\u2019s Ken to review our year-end reserve replacement and finding cost.","Kenneth Boedeker","Thanks, Billy. We had a great year for reserve replacement, more than doubling what we produced during the year. Our proved reserves increased over 400 million barrels of oil equivalent, or 16% year-over-year to $2.9 billion barrels of oil equivalent. We replaced 238% of our 2018 production at a low finding cost of $9.33 per Boe, which excludes positive revisions due to commodity price improvements.","Since the start of the downturn in 2014, we have reduced finding cost 30%. Our ability to consistently add reserves at low-cost demonstrates the tremendous capital efficiency gains we made through the downturn from our permanent shift to premium drilling and laser-focus on cost reductions.","Every year, EOG engages DeGolyer and MacNaughton to perform an independently engineered analysis of our reserves. This year, they evaluated nearly 80% of EOG\u2019s proved reserves. And for the 31st consecutive year, they were within 5% of our internal estimates.","I\u2019ll now turn it over to Tim Driggers to discuss our financials and capital structure.","Tim Driggers","Thanks, Ken. EOG further strengthened its financial position in the fourth quarter. The company generated discretionary cash flow of $2.1 billion, invested $1.3 billion in exploration and development expenditures and paid $127 million in dividends.","Free cash flow was $637 million in the fourth quarter and totaled almost $1.7 billion for the full-year 2018. Proceeds from asset sales for 2018 totaled $227 million, which was predominantly the UK sale, including the Conway Field.","Cash on the balance sheet at December 31 was $1.6 billion and total debt was $6.1 billion, for a net debt-to-total capitalization ratio of 19%, down from 25% at the end of 2017.","Our goal is to repay $3 billion of debt from 2018 through 2021. We took a step in this direction by repaying a $350 million bond that came to maturity on October 1. In 2019, we have a $900 million bond scheduled to mature on June 1. We will determine the funding for this bond replacement closer to the date of maturity, whether from cash on hand or other sources based on the company\u2019s financial condition at that time.","EOG is currently unhedged for the price of oil or gas for 2019, with the exception of some contracts protecting the price differential between certain sales points. Historically, EOG has hedged up to 50% of our expected production. While our best hedge position is being a low-cost producer, we will continue to evaluate hedging opportunities with the objective of prudently managing our business and providing our shareholders upside to commodity prices.","I\u2019ll turn it back over to Bill for closing remarks.","Bill Thomas","Thanks, Tim. In conclusion, our goal is simple, to be one of the best performing companies in the S&P 500. Our business model of high return organic growth is driven by our culture of return focused decision-making, low-cost operations, innovation, technology and a first mover advantage.","We have a pleased, but not satisfied mindset that motivates every fiber of our company to continuously improve. EOG\u2019s core business acumen, organic exploration, low-cost operations, advanced information technology and sustainability powered by our never satisfied innovative culture means, EOG has not remotely peaked.","We are excited about our future and our ability to achieve our goal of delivering double-digit returns, double-digit growth and free cash flow throughout commodity price cycles. EOG\u2019s premium combination is rare in the energy sector and places EOG in line with the top performers in any sector of the market. It is a unique and compelling combination we expect to demonstrate again this year and over the long-term to create significant value for our shareholders.","Thanks for listening. And now, we\u2019ll go to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. The question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. [Operator Instructions] And the first question will be from Neal Dingmann of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please go ahead.","Neal Dingmann","Good morning, guys. Great details. My question is just you guys have done a great job continuing to bring out another of these distinct premium plays. Just as you continue to look at some of your exploration opportunities, your thoughts about the potential for \u2013 potentially another one of these rolling out this year or next?","Ezra Yacob","Yes, Neal, this is Ezra Yacob. As we discussed in the opening remarks, and I think it\u2019s \u2013 you can see a good illustration on Slide 11 on the presentation. We\u2019re really focused on adding higher-quality plays to the inventory as we\u2019ve done over the past couple of years as opposed to just increasing the quantity.","We\u2019ve \u2013 we\u2019re utilizing a lot of data captured over the last few years in the Permian and the Powder and the Woodford to develop some new horizontal play concepts. And we\u2019re really focused on applying our horizontal drilling and completions techniques to a higher-quality unconventional reservoir some that we\u2019ve identified. And as we said, we\u2019ll be leasing and drilling some test wells in those \u2013 in 2019.","And so the important thing, the way to think about it really is, since we\u2019re just kind of leasing and testing those this year, we probably won\u2019t have a potential exploration announcement. But we\u2019ll be able to update you as we gather more data on these.","Neal Dingmann","Okay. And then just sticking with that for my follow-up just on that Slide 11 with total locations, how do you all think there has been some diversion out there? Some folks are thinking about more of an ROR focused, up-spacing versus others thinking they\u2019re still maximizing units by downspacing to get more locations. So again, I\u2019m just wondering sort of your philosophy these days and how that might impact total locations?","Ezra Yacob","Yes, Neal, this is Ezra again. I think, it\u2019s a combination, not really up-spacing. What we try to do as far as converting existing non-premium wells into the premium status is really through two different mechanisms.","The first is lowering well costs and dominantly doing that through sustainable kind of operational efficiency gains. But then also making strides on both the high grading of our targets and especially in 2018 advancing our completions technology, where we can actually improve the well productivity. And so, again, it\u2019s a combination of increasing well productivity and lowering cost to get those across our premium threshold.","Neal Dingmann","Great. Thanks, Ezra for the great details.","Operator","The next question will be from Arun Jayaram of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Arun Jayaram","Yes, good morning. My first question relates to Delaware Basin. One of the SMID operators yesterday commented how children well recoveries were lagging parent wells by 15% to 20%, which is a delta relative to the Street. Bill, I was wondering if you could comment on EOG\u2019s published type curves, as well as Billy\u2019s commentary on some of the new advances in completion that you\u2019ve announced, as well as the improvement in Delaware Basin well productivity in the second-half of the year?","Bill Thomas","Yes, Arun, thank you for the question. If you see the data we\u2019ve released, our well productivity is beginning to improve significantly in most of the plays in the Delaware. And we have been tackling and addressing the parent-child relationship for a number of years and we\u2019re \u2013 we have made significant improvements. I think the company\u2019s ability to absorb data real-time and to make changes very quickly in our drilling programs in our well patterns has really paid off.","So the new completion \u2013 ours that we\u2019re using connects more rock. It also reduces the offset depletion effects and we also improved our targeting and our spacing. And to go back what Ezra talked about just recently, we\u2019ve been able to do this and not really reduce. We\u2019ve actually increased the recovery and we\u2019ve increased the NPV and we\u2019ve increased the rate of return all at the same time. So we made tremendous progress on solving the parent-child relationship.","Arun Jayaram","Great. Just \u2013 and my follow-up, Bill, could you maybe discuss the tradeoff before \u2013 between investing in premium locations today versus new plays? It seems to us that you\u2019re investing early to prevent an inventory situation down the road. So \u2013 and also so you wouldn\u2019t have to make expensive M&A in order to preserve your trends, but I would love to hear your thoughts on that?","Bill Thomas","Sure, Arun. Yes, the total focus on the new plays is to add better inventory. We have 9,500 premium locations right now. So we really don\u2019t need more, we just need better. And so we\u2019re \u2013 as Ezra talked about, we are targeting rocks that have better ability to produce oil and be able to respond to these new completion techniques that we\u2019re coming up with, and to reduce our costs, increase our returns and make the company better in the future.","So our total focus on all that is to add a lot better inventory than we have right now. And we are being able to add \u2013 or able to add at very, very low costs. So we\u2019re actively leasing in plays like $500, certainly, less than a $1,000 an acre. And that certainly much, much better than trying to compete in these hot areas through M&A.","Arun Jayaram","Great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","The next question will be from Paul Grigel of Macquarie. Please go ahead.","Paul Grigel","Hi, good morning. Referencing the Slide 13, could you please provide color on the methodology on how the corporate decline rate was derived? And adding in additional color for any variations by major basin? And how does this on the corporate decline rate and the capital efficiencies compare historically prior to 2018?","Billy Helms","Yes, Paul, this is Billy Helms. Thanks for asking about Slide 13. It\u2019s a new slide that we put into illustrate the confidence we have in improving our capital efficiency year-over-year. We\u2019ve made tremendous strides on both lowering our well cost and improving the productivity of the wells and is starting to dramatically show up. And this slide is based on not forecasting additional cost reductions, but based on our results we\u2019re seeing today in the wells we\u2019re completing here at year-end.","So we\u2019re very confident. And basically, the way you calculate the decline from that, if you go back and look at the production year-over-year, you can see the production in 2017 to 2018 and the capital number there $5.9 billion divided into those differences will give you the \u2013 and the capital efficiency number will give you the decline rate in 2018. And you do the same mechanism for 2019 using the midpoint of our guidance, compared to the 2018 production volumes with that capital efficiency number you can back into the decline rate of 31%, as it illustrates here on the slide.","Year-over-year, our capital efficiency is improving. But as we grow volumes, those first year volumes, of course, are \u2013 have a steeper decline in the base production. So year-over-year, the base decline did increase from 2018 to 2019. And that\u2019s just simply, because the volumes are getting much bigger. So that tells you that we\u2019re adding \u2013 for the same amount of dollars, we\u2019re adding a lot more new oil at our capital efficiency rate that we have today. So that\u2019s the implication.","Paul Grigel","Great. I appreciate the color there. And then could you also provide your latest thoughts on the Austin Chalk, and if that falls within the premium category or in the exploration spend? And what\u2019s the driver of moving to 15 completions in 2019 and the Austin Chalk down from 27 in 2018?","Ezra Yacob","Yes, Paul, this is Ezra again. So the Austin Chalk there in South Texas that we\u2019ve talked about is considered part of our premium plays there, where it overlies with our Eagle Ford development program.","As far as \u2013 it\u2019s been documented out there that we\u2019ve got some other exploration opportunities there in the Austin Chalk. And that part of it would be considered in the exploration spend.","As far as the well counts there in Austin Chalk and the Eagle Ford area, that\u2019s just going to \u2013 simply the wells that we have put to \u2013 the wells that we\u2019re forecasting and put to sale this year are with respect to where we\u2019re at in our development program there. As you know, geologically, as we\u2019ve talked about, it\u2019s a bit of a complicated \u2013 a little more complex than the Eagle Ford down in South Texas. And so we\u2019re really moving a little bit slower on that and making sure that the premium wells that we\u2019re drilling on there are the quality that will be additive to our program.","Paul Grigel","Thanks, Ezra.","Operator","The next question will be from Leo Mariani of KeyBanc. Please go ahead.","Leo Mariani","Hey, guys, just wanted to follow-up on a couple of your prepared comments here on the call. I guess, you guys previously had kind of talked about in the last year sort of 15% to 25% oil growth at $50 to $60. Bill, I think, you said in your prepared comments that you\u2019re not really moving away from that over the next couple of years. But growth a little bit lower this year at sort of 12% to 16%. Can you provide a little bit more sort of color as this maybe just a little bit lower year due to more uncertainty around oil prices? Kind of what\u2019s driving you to move towards the lower-end of that range in 2019 here?","Bill Thomas","Yes. Leo, this is Bill. We\u2019re not shifting into a low double-digit growth mode that needs to be really clear. We\u2019re not really shifting down into a lower mode and maybe we \u2013 people might think. Specifically, this year, we\u2019re allocating a bit less capital to drilling oil and a bit more capital to drilling for new potential. So that affects this year\u2019s rate a little bit.","But certainly, as we\u2019ve demonstrated in the past, we have tremendous ability to grow. It\u2019s really easy for EOG to grow with our capital efficiency so high and such a huge deep high-quality inventory. But we said governors with our disciplined growth strategy, investment governors. And so the first one is, we want to generate free cash flow every year; and the second one is, we want to grow at a pace, where we can take advantage of the learning curve and continue to increase our returns and capital efficiency.","So as we continue to get better and increase efficiency and add new higher \u2013 even higher quality inventory than we have right now, it will become easier for us to grow and to sustain and deliver strong high return growth. So don\u2019t count us shifting into a lower mode.","Leo Mariani","Okay, that\u2019s great color. And I guess, I just wanted to also follow-up on a comment that you guys made. You certainly are focused on continuing to improve ROCE at EOG, kind of clearly want to lower that over time, because I know you\u2019re spending more money on kind of some newer domestic plays this year. And as I kind of think about that, I guess, I would, maybe assume that maybe the newer plays would initially have a lower ROCE, but might sort of payoff in the longer-term here.","So just trying to get a sense of how you square that up with having a really long inventory already. Clearly, you guys have said, you\u2019ve got well north of 10 years of premium oil drilling, even at an accelerated pace over time. So I guess, can you provide a little bit more color on sort of the need to kind of target some more annuity plays with more new exploration dollars here in the short-term?","Bill Thomas","Yes. Leo, this is Bill again. That\u2019s certainly what we\u2019re focused on with our exploration effort is to improve our ability to deliver return on capital employed. And because we\u2019re able to acquire this \u2013 these positions at very, very low-cost, $500, $1,000 an acre. And they\u2019re in areas where there infrastructure. We\u2019re not in remote areas that \u2013 they\u2019re not going to be difficult to connect really good markets. They\u2019re in areas where we have very capable operating efficiencies with our seven domestic divisions in the company. And so we can move on them and we can test them very quickly and evaluate them. And then pretty quickly within a year or so, we could put them in a pretty strong development mode.","And so we \u2013 we\u2019re taking our advantage of being first movers in these plays and getting there before other people may not \u2013 may realize the potential of them. And we\u2019re focused on better rock than we have right now. And those \u2013 that combination of low-cost and better productivity, we believe could meaningfully improve the returns of the company and down the road will improve our ability to deliver oil at even lower prices and generate return on capital employed at even lower prices.","Leo Mariani","Okay, thanks. Great color.","Operator","The next question will be from Charles Meade of Johnson Rice. Please go ahead.","Charles Meade","Good morning, Bill to you and your whole team there. I\u2019d like to start with a kind of a big picture question, and this may go over some old territory for you guys. But looking at Slide 14, it looks like the way you guys built your capital program as you decided, you picked an oil price and said, okay, we want to able to fund our dividend. And so our CapEx has to be something less than our cash flow minus our dividend there.","And I get the picture that free cash flow will just \u2013 will accrue as oil prices perhaps role in higher than that. But can you offer, I guess, a color on whether that is the way that you built your capital program? And if that is the right meat on it, could you give some insights into the process of how you pick that $50 oil or whatever that planning price would seems to be the kind of the organizing data point at the time of holding?","Bill Thomas","Yes, Charles, this is Bill. Yes, we use multiple parameters to set our program every year. But certainly, one of the first ones is, we want to build a program based on our view of the macro certainly, what oil prices might be and put us in a position to generate free cash flow every year. So that\u2019s the first one.","And so, over the last several years, $50 has been a good rule of thumb for that and it\u2019s worked really well for us. And then our goal is to set the capital allocation at a rate that will continue to improve our returns. So that we can take advantage of the learning curve and continue to get better every year and continue to improve our capital efficiency.","So with that in mind, we set the program to give us a good chance to generate significant free cash flow to do the things that we\u2019ve talked about reducing our debt and certainly, being able to have the ability to work on the dividend on a much stronger rate than we have in the past years and to get better at the same time.","Charles Meade","That\u2019s helpful, Bill. I think I\u2019m picking up what you guys are putting out there on \u2013 in that respect. And then, I mean, going back to some of the prepared comments, I believe, by Ezra about the improvements in the Delaware Basin oil productivity. And I know you guys have talked on this a little bit, but you\u2019ve talked about optimizing the spacing and staggering. Can you give us a bit more detail as \u2013 does that mean that you guys have gotten closer or rather wider on your Delaware Basin well patterns?","Ezra Yacob","Yes, Charles, this is Ezra. Really, when you look at it over the bulk of the year between 2017 and 2018, I think, on average, our spacing was pretty consistent. As we\u2019ve talked about in the past, it really is going to change across that base and depending on how many of our specific targets that we\u2019re aiming for in developing and co-developing. And we aim to target as we\u2019ve talked about before, any targets that are kind of within maybe a couple of hundred feet of each other.","And so as we talk about the improvements and optimization of spacing vertically and horizontally, it\u2019s if you think about it in a stacked and staggered manner. And so we\u2019ve definitely tested as we highlighted on one of the earlier calls last year as tight as a 400 \u2013 approximately 400-foot staggered spacing pattern. And obviously, we\u2019ve targeted much wider than that.","I think at the end of the day what we\u2019re seeing is, there\u2019s a lot of potential upside there to our announced resource potential. As you recall, our type curve in the Wolfcamp Oil Window is based on a 660-foot spacing in just one Wolfcamp target across the whole of our Wolfcamp oil acreage.","Charles Meade","Okay. Thank you for that color, Ezra.","Operator","The next question will be from Michael Scialla of Stifel. Please go ahead.","Michael Scialla","Good morning, everybody. Based on your comments that the exploration ideas are really targeting better quality rock, is it fair to say that you\u2019re really not looking at kind of the massive traditional shale plays like the Eagle Ford or the Bakken, I\u2019m thinking maybe more along the lines of tight sand or carbonate resource plays, I mean, you admitted, I guess, the Chalk over in Louisiana is one of them. But is that more the type of play that you\u2019re looking at with the exploration ideas?","Ezra Yacob","Yes, Michael, this is Ezra again. That\u2019s a great question. Without giving too much away, what I would say is, just reiterate again what we talked about, and I think you\u2019re on the right track with it is we are targeting \u2013 we\u2019re looking to apply our horizontal drilling and completions technology to in general just better rock quality in these unconventional reservoirs. It\u2019s a variety of different things that we\u2019re looking at. And really, it comes from combining datasets, as I said, that we\u2019ve collected over the last few years in development in the Permian and the Powder and including the Woodford also.","And so the way to think about it really is that, the actual rock quality is going to be better than what we\u2019ve traditionally targeted horizontally. And I think that\u2019s what really we want to \u2013 is going to help us increase the quality of our inventory. And it should hopefully shallow the decline that these unconventional plays are kind of known for. And really that should help reduce our finding cost, lower our DD&A and play into helping us achieve our long-term goals of double-digit growth and double-digit returns.","Michael Scialla","Okay, thanks. And Bill you said in your opening remarks that you would be willing to buyback shares when accretive of just wondering what metrics you\u2019re going to be looking at there and decide if that\u2019s an accretive opportunity or not? Is it simply NAV or something else?","Bill Thomas","Michael, as we stated on free cash flow, our priorities are to target \u2013 to be able to be in a position to target a stronger dividend increase. And we\u2019ve been doing it in historical past, which has been 19%. And then we certainly have outlined a very strong debt reduction, as Tim talked about earlier, and we\u2019ve got about $2.65 billion in the next three years to \u2013 we want to reduce that.","And so our priority to maintain a strong balance sheet is \u2013 has put us in a position, where we have the flexibility to take advantage of opportunities down the road in the future, such as high-return, low-cost property additions, particularly things that could go in conjunction with these new plays that we\u2019re talking about. And it puts us in a position to consider potential share buyback.","So share buybacks could be an option, when our senior management and our Board indentify a value-accretive opportunity in the future. So we continuously consider all the options what is in the best interest of the shareholder. And our primary focus is on creating the most value for shareholders in the future. So we\u2019ll continually consider on a quarterly basis free cash flow availability and what is the best allocation of capital to create the most value.","Michael Scialla","Thank you.","Operator","The next question will be from Doug Leggate of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Douglas Leggate","Yes. Thank you, and good afternoon, everybody, or good morning, I should say. I\u2019m actually in Europe right now, so sorry about that, Bill. Bill, a bit of a philosophical question, if I may, and it really relates to your comments about being one of the best companies to compete with the S&P. No question, you guys have knocked it out of the park against the E&P sector. But the big difference between the focus on returns and competitive drills is that, the S&P obviously has been dramatically better than the E&P sector over the period that you focus on premium locations. The big difference being that they payout a lot more of their cash flow for those competitive growth companies, think biotech, think technology.","So if you\u2019re really talking about \u2013 what do you feel \u2013 what do you think about that your relative performance to the S&P obviously isn\u2019t delivering that with the current strategy? What makes you think you will do so in the future?","Bill Thomas","Yes, Doug. Certainly, you\u2019ve identified two of the key things is a return on capital employed. We think we can be competitive even through the commodity cycles with double-digit and we believe on growth that we can be competitive with any sector through the commodity cycle. And as we work on lowering the cost basis of the company and our capital efficiency, we will target free cash flow. And as we continue to generate free cash flow and get better at doing that, that allows us to return more cash to the shareholders.","Certainly, first, we picked through dividend. We\u2019ve already outlined our debt reduction. And then down the road, it comes to where we have situations where we can have accretive value through share purchases, we\u2019ll consider that too. So we\u2019re committed to making the company better in every means. And we certainly believe that our culture and our business model has the ability to compete with any company in any business.","Douglas Leggate","No, I understand the philosophy. I\u2019m just trying to understand what \u2013 how it changes as it relates to the comment about the relative performance story within the broader market when your cash distributions are so much lower. I guess, that\u2019s what I was getting at. But my follow-up really, if I may, is also kind of a high-level question and it really is related to the same thing, because we\u2019re all wrestling with this.","Let\u2019s be honest now for the stock price performance over last several years, and it really is the issue of that. The one thing that\u2019s different obviously with oil and gas is, you\u2019re dealing with a commodity and the volatility of that commodity. You guys are a very large company. On the high-end of your prior target range, 25% at $60 oil, your growth in oil is 10% of global demand growth. And we know the growth isn\u2019t rare, but growth with cash returns is.","So I\u2019m just, again, trying to reconcile why not grow at a slower rate and step up the cash distribution? Because you can\u2019t control the oil price. And if you can grow at that rate and the rest of the industry following six, obviously we\u2019ve got a problem with the commodity. So I\u2019m just wondering how you address that circular volatility, and I\u2019ll leave it there. Thanks.","Bill Thomas","Well, Doug, as \u2013 if you consider the metrics that and the value that we\u2019re creating by drilling possibly 700 wells this year. As I stated in the opening call, the net present value \u2013 discounted net present value is about $6 million per well.","So our drilling program this year is creating more than $4 billion of value, that\u2019s a significant thing. And so you can obviously \u2013 when you\u2019re reinvesting its super high rates of return and creating that much value per well, that is an exceptionally good. There\u2019s not many businesses and in any business that can create that kind of value.","And then second of all, we truly believe that we can be among the low-cost producers in the energy market. So that gives us a competitive advantage. We have a lead we believe versus our competitors in cost and being the low-cost producer and we also have the culture to get better faster than most of our competitors.","So we have a long-term sustainable business model. And our goal is to create tremendous value and be able to \u2013 through growth and returns and be able to do that sustainably for a long period of time.","Douglas Leggate","I agree with that. I'm going to close that there, Bill. But just with \u2013 if there's any sort of comment, though, that has been your strategy for four years. And if you really believe that much value is being dislocated from your share price, which is flat, why not go ahead and buy back your stock? And that\u2019s really all I\u2019m saying is that, the value creation isn\u2019t being recognized at the market, then that means something has to change? Thanks so much.","Bill Thomas","Thank you. Again, we\u2019ll continue to evaluate what\u2019s best for the shareholders on a quarterly basis and make the appropriate decisions going forward.","Operator","The next question will be from Paul Sankey of Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead.","Paul Sankey","Good morning, everyone. I mean in the uncomfortable position of supporting the previous couple of questions. They were actually very much in line with what I was going to ask about, particularly the accretion definition, which I know is always difficult. But also the balance between growth and returns relative to the stock price performance.","One further one I would just add is, do you have a comment on motion for your premium inventory life, which seems to be steadily rising? I wondered if there was a point at which there was no need to raise it anymore now than you\u2019re getting deal for 13 years? Thanks.","Bill Thomas","Paul, this is Bill again. We \u2013 we\u2019re not focused on this the size of it. We\u2019re really focused on the quality of it. And that\u2019s why, of course, we\u2019re \u2013 as we talked about, that\u2019s not we\u2019re working on new these new play concepts. And so we believe that our inventory, even the lower tier part of our inventory is probably comparable, maybe even better than much of the inventory that\u2019s been drilled by the U.S. And that has a lot of value in the future.","So we\u2019ll continue to work on getting value for that. We\u2019ve sold quite a bit of property over the last few years, I think, over $6 billion over the last five years or so. So we\u2019ll continue working on tearing off the lower-quality and adding on to the higher-quality and improving the overall metrics of our inventory.","Paul Sankey","Yes. Again, it\u2019s \u2013 further to that firstly, if there is a potential to increase your definition of premium inventory and so accrete returns through higher hurdle rate, even I accept that your hurdle rate is impressive. But as you\u2019re constantly growing, potentially, you could skew towards more returns of a growth through that?","And secondly, I completely hear what you\u2019re saying about disposals, but you do seem to becoming more and more spread in more and more areas, potentially the \u2013 potential for increased disposals, I guess, would be an additional logical continuation of that strategy? Thanks.","Bill Thomas","Yes That\u2019s correct, Paul. I think we\u2019re a bit more decentralized than most other companies. And that decentralized structure is a huge advantage in the company, because we can execute on each one of these plays with a very dedicated, strong group of people that can learn quickly and apply the technologies and the learnings that we\u2019re getting across the company and we share those.","And so we can, with our scale, with our ability to share data and learnings, we can execute each one of those plays at a very efficient manner. And when you have multiple plays, you can take each play slower. So that you can take advantage of the money, because you don\u2019t have to go so fast on any of them and it makes all your plays better. So \u2013 and it give you a very stable high-return and high-growth portfolio to continue to build the company on.","Paul Sankey","Sure. Okay, thanks. I mean, the problem does remain that the stock is not competing with the S&P in the way that you wanted to, I think, that\u2019s what we\u2019re driving at? Thank you.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Thomas for his closing remarks.","Bill Thomas","In closing, EOG\u2019s results in 2018 were the best in company history due to the excellent work by everyone in EOG. We\u2019re headed into 2019 with tremendous momentum, so we\u2019re very excited about the year. EOG has never been in better shape. We are pleased, but not satisfied, so we fully expect to continue to get better.","Our goal is to be one of the top performers in the S&P 500 with double-digit returns and double-digit growth through commodity cycles and deliver significant long-term shareholder value.

This morning Bill Thomas will start with a few opening remarks, followed by Billy Helms and David Trice to review operational results. I will then discuss EOG\u2019s financials, capital structure and hedge position and Bill will provide concluding remarks. Here is Bill Thomas.","Bill Thomas","Thanks, Tim and good morning everyone. Our goal this year has been to transition the company to be successful in a low commodity price environment. To achieve this goal, our 2015 game plan is focused on the following objectives; one, maximize return on capital invested; two, improve well performance through technology and innovation; three, achieve significant cost reductions through sustainable efficiency gains; four, take advantage of opportunities to add drilling inventory; and five, maintain a strong balance sheet.","As the year draws to a close, I am pleased to report we\u2019re right on track with our plan, we have maximized return on capital invested by directing capital to our best plays, the Eagle Ford, Bakken and Delaware Basin. We are having a record year of well productivity improvements and cost reductions. Ongoing completions and the new work we are doing on targeting mean EOG continues to drill the strongest horizontal wells in the industry. As a result of these efforts, our largest and best assets now generate over 40% direct after tax rate of return with $50 oil. Making a solid return in horizontal oil at $50 is an excellent achievement.","On the cost side, we\u2019re making substantial improvements. Year-over-year third quarter per unit lease operating expense was down 17%, per unit transportation was down 11% and total G&A was down 6%. In recent years we\u2019ve grown inventory at twice the rate of drilling, 2015 is no exception. This is a record year for adding high quality drilling potential. Last quarter, we increased our Bakken and Three Forks\u2019 net potential reserves by 600 million barrels of oil equivalent. This quarter we increased our Delaware Basin net potential reserves by 1 billion barrels of oil equivalent. As you read in our press release we made three tactical acquisitions in the Delaware Basin adding significant high quality drilling potential. In total, we added over 1.6 billion barrels of net reserve potential and over 3,000 net locations this year and we\u2019ve achieved this incredible growth through our reserve and drilling potential, while maintaining one of the strongest balance sheets in the industry.","To summarize our progress report; in 2015, we maximized return on capital invested, added significant future growth potential and maintained a strong balance sheet. All year long our focus has been on the improving fundamentals and building future potential instead of chasing short-term volume growth. We believe this demonstrates that EOG\u2019s priorities are squarely focused on returns and creating long-term shareholder value. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Billy Helms to discuss the big news this quarter our resource upgrade to the Delaware Basin.","Billy Helms","Thanks Bill. Last night we announced a significant upgrade to our Delaware Basin assets. We increased the estimated net resource potential to 2.35 billion barrels of oil equivalent that is a 74% increase from our resource estimate just two years go. The expanded resource provides 2,200 additional net locations adding to what was already decades of drilling inventory. The primary driver of this upgrade is our constant focus on improving well results through the application of technology and targeting. We've a proven track record of increasing in a play\u2019s potential and this quarter our success is evident in the Wolfcamp and Second Bone Spring Sand plays.","In the Wolfcamp we\u2019re adding net potential reserves of 500 million barrels of oil equivalent and almost 1,000 net wells. We now estimate the Wolfcamp's total net potential reserves to be 1.3 million barrels of oil equivalent from 2,050 net drilling locations. This estimate is based on a highly detailed evaluation of multiple distinct intervals within a geologically complex basin like other plays we've found that by first identifying and then targeting discrete intervals we can dramatically improve the performance of the wells and ultimately the recovery from the reservoir. There are several potential targets within the Wolfcamp and we had successful tests in at least three. This resource estimate includes wells plays and these tested intervals across all of our acreage with well spacing that varies from 660 feet to 1,320 feet between wells in the same zone. ","To summarize it more simply this resource estimate assumes at least one productive interval across all of our acreage with wells spaced about 700 feet apart. Similar to other resource plays we\u2019re testing powder spacing with encouraging results. Last quarter we drilled a two well pattern on 880 foot spacing Dragon 36 State 701H and 702H. These wells are at these rates averaged over 2,300 barrels of oil per day. This quarter we drilled a two well pattern in the same area on closer spacing at 500 feet apart the Brown Bear 36 State 702H and 703H. Their initial production averaged over 3,000 barrels of oil per day per well. We\u2019re drilling wells closer while maintaining or improving their EURs.","Another highlight in the third quarter was the Thor 21 702H. This is an industry record horizontal Wolfcamp well with a 30 day IP of 30,490 barrels of oil equivalent per day. All these Wolfcamp wells are in the oil window which we identified late last year, wells in this window produce at least 50% oil versus 31% in the combo play with this resource update we initiated a separate Wolfcamp oil window gross EUR of 750 MBoe per well. Wells completed in the Combo area maintained their previously estimated gross EUR of 900 MBoe per well. We\u2019re encouraged by these results and continue to test and evaluate tighter well spacing patterns along with multiple targets. With approximately two-thirds of our acreage in the oil window this play will generate very competitive returns during this period of low commodity prices.","In the Second Bone Springs Sand, we initiated our net resource potential estimate to 500 million barrels of oil equivalent and 1,250 net well locations. Like the Wolfcamp this estimate is a result of a detailed evaluation of recent completions in multiple targets that presumes at least one productive target across all of our acreage. The well count constitutes actual sticks on map locations and while well spacing varies across the play by area and target in general it averages about 850 feet. We first discussed this oil target last year and are very encouraged with initial well results. The Second Bone Springs Sand provides an attractive third leg to our Delaware Basin activity.","The Leonard is the most material of our Delaware Basin plays and we continue to make progress improving results. A recent four well package mentioned in the press release the Hawk 35 Fed 7 through 10H was completed on 500 foot spacing with an average IP of 1,615 barrels of oil per day these wells are producing on par with net wells drilled on water spacing last year. Again this is the testament to the progress we've made on completion technology in the Delaware Basin. Moving forward we expect to develop this resource using 300 to 500 foot spacing.","We had one other significant success in the Delaware Basin last quarter. Last night we announced that through three transactions we added 26,000 net acres in Loving County, Texas, and Lea County New Mexico. Since the start of the year we've mentioned our heightened interest in acquisition opportunities driven by the oil price down cycle, while we didn't initially rule out corporate M&A we quickly focused our efforts on targeting smaller more tactical acquisitions. These types of opportunities are more likely to compete with our existing high quality inventory because the acreage is mostly undeveloped and is concentrated in the core of these plays. We are already drilling this highly prospective acreage and the potential reserve estimates from these acquisitions are included in our updated Delaware Basin numbers. EOG\u2019s Delaware Basin potential is rapidly increasing and we expect this asset to be a significant top-tier contributor to the future growth of the company.","In the Eagle Ford after five years and three resource upgrades to this world class play, we are still excited about the learning and the technical progress we make every quarter. We continue to test and evaluate the Lower Eagle Ford W pattern mentioned in last quarter\u2019s call. While the W pattern is not new to the industry, there is one significant difference to the spacing test, the vertical spacing between target intervals is not necessarily an arbitrary distance, but rather is determined by certain characteristics of the rock. Our W pattern test is specifically designed to take advantage of technical findings from the work we are doing around targeting. We started this targeting work by analyzing 60 unique well characteristics from hundreds of recently drilled Eagle Ford wells. From these 60, we identified 12 characteristics that are present in our best wells by incorporating this data into our 3D seismic and petrophysical data we determined that the Lower Eagle Ford may have two sweet spot intervals. Please be sure to look for the slide in our IR deck that graphically demonstrates this finding. The laterals in our W pattern test are geo-steered to very specific areas that meet specific criteria. These targets can be as narrow as 20 feet. Initial results from these tests are promising as we gather more data, conduct more tests and evaluate the results, we will bring you updates.","I\u2019ll turn it over to David Trice to discuss the Bakken and the Rockies.","David Trice","Thanks Billy. In the Rockies we continue to maximize the value of our acreage position by using enhanced completion techniques and lowering capital and operating expenses dramatically. As you may recall last quarter,we announced that we areimplementing high density completions in some Rockies\u2019 wells that are similar to the completions currently used in the Eagle Ford, while the geology varies from play-to-play and even within the same play we see the upside in our ability to increase value through high density and integrated completion techniques.","In the Bakken we are focused on completing infill wells in our core area using our latest completion technology. Even though these infill wells are among oil producing wells our integrated completion approach ensures that we effectively stimulate the reservoir and deliver high rate of return and maximum value. An example of infill wells in our core acreage is a three well pad on the Parshall 3029 unit. This pad came online with an average initial rate of over 1,800 barrels of oil per day and 1 million cubic feet per day of rich natural gas per well. These wells are spaced just 500 feet apart and use shorter laterals that average less than 6,000 feet. Our latest Bakken wells are averaging just 7.6 days spud-to-TD for an 8,400 foot lateral and cost $7 million. This is a reduction of 20% from 2014. In addition, we have lowered LOE in the Bakken core area up to $5 a barrel through infrastructure investment such as water gathering systems. All of these improvements will allow us to maximize the value of this 1 billion barrel equivalent asset and deliver solid returns even in a low oil price environment.","In the DJ Basin, we continue to refine our drilling techniques and implement high density completions. Long-term data is needed to fully evaluate the results however initial data indicates improved performance. In the third quarter, we brought online a four wall pad that targeted the Codell Sandstone. These wells are located in the windy 1705 and 1720 units and produced an average initial rate in excess of 1,100 barrels of oil per day with 600 Mcf per day of rich natural gas per well using an average lateral length of 8,700 feet. Recent well cost in the Codell are averaging just $7 million for a 9,400 foot lateral with the latest well performance in lower well cost the Codell is delivering a direct A tax rate of return approaching 30%. As greater efficiency continues to drive down cost, we believe we can achieve a target well cost of $6.1 million. These successes in the Codell are another example of how we are transitioning EOG to be successful in a low commodity price environment.","The Powder River Basin remains a core position for EOG, although capital spending is lower this year, we continue to work the technical details, block up acreage and to secure regulatory permits. All of this will set up the Powder River Basin as a future growth engine for EOG.","I\u2019ll now turn it over to Tim Driggers to discuss financials and capital structure.","Tim Driggers","Thanks David. For the third quarter capitalized interest was $9.8 million. Total cash, exploration and development expenditures were $970 million excluding acquisitions and asset retirement obligations. In addition expenditures for gathering systems, processing plants and other property plant and equipment were $51 million. There were $368 million of property acquisitions during the quarter. Year-to-date total cash exploration and development expenditures were $3.7 billion excluding acquisitions and asset retirement obligations expenditures for gathering systems, processing plants and other property plant and equipment were $253 million.","During the third quarter EOG incurred $4.1 billion in non-cash property impairment charges net of tax. The impairments were due to declines in the forward commodity prices and were related to some of our legacy natural gas and marginal liquid assets. At the end of September total debt outstanding was $6.4 billion for debt-to-capitalization ratio of 33%. We had $743 million of cash on hand giving us a non-GAAP net debt of $5.7 billion and a net debt to total cap ratio of 30%. Approximately 5% of the 8% increase from the end of June was due to the non-cash impairment recognized this quarter. The effective tax rate for the third quarter was 35% and the deferred tax ratio was 101%.","In terms of our hedge positions for the period November 1 through December 31, 2015 EOG has crude oil financial price swap contracts in place for 10,000 barrels of oil per day at a weighted average price of $89.98 per barrel. In addition for November 2015 EOG has put options in place which established a core price of $45 per barrel or 82,500 barrels of oil per day. For the month of December 2015 EOG has natural gas financial price swap contracts in place for 175 MMBtu per day at a weighted average price of $4.51 per MMBtu.","Now turn I\u2019ll turn it back to Bill.","Billy Helms","Thanks, Tim. Now a quick word on the macro. Our view has not changed the industry is becoming more disciplined. The U.S. is on an oil production decline based on the EIE data and could exit the year 500,000 to 600,000 barrels of oil per day lower than peak production recorded in April. Worldwide longer-term projects are being cut, but we agree with the consensus view that $40 to $50 oil is not sustainable and supply demand is in the process of slowly rebalancing.","Regarding 2016 although our planning process won't be complete until the beginning of the year when we have a better view of oil prices, I'll share a little color on our situation. EOG is uniquely positioned for strong performance next year. We\u2019ll enter 2016 with a large high quality inventory of drilled but uncompleted wells and we've few capital commitments, therefore we have flexibility with respect to our CapEx program. The highest return use of our capital next year will be to complete many of our DUCs in the first half of the year. This will allow us to have a strong start to 2016. As always we've no interest in outspending and expect to balance CapEx and discretionary cash flow. Our focus will be on increasing capital returns, increasing the quality of our inventory and reducing operating cost.","2015 is rapidly coming to a close and I could not be prouder of how the EOG team has been executing on our plan. As I have said at the start of the year I've seen many downturns in my 36 years with the company, each time EOG emerges on the other side in better shape, this is exactly how 2015 is playing out. But there is one primary take away from the call today. EOG is quickly adapting to be successful in a low oil price environment. We\u2019re not depending on a rebound to high oil prices instead we\u2019re making the most of the current price environment by focusing on improving fundamentals and building future potential. In fact 2015 has been EOG's best year in terms of the magnitude of improvements in the Company. Regardless of where we\u2019re in the commodity cycle EOG is committed to return focused capital discipline year-after-year. The Company remains focused on creating long-term shareholder value.","Thanks for listening. And now we\u2019ll go to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. The question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. [Operator Instructions] Questions are limited to one question and one follow-up question. We will take as many questions as time permits. [Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll take our first question from Leo Mariani with RBC.","Leo Mariani","Wanted to touch base on the enhanced completions, it sounds like you're starting to use these in the Delaware Basin, here. Obviously you've had a lot of success in other plays, any reason to think that these won't give you a nice improvement in economics here?","Bill Thomas","Leo we\u2019ll ask Billy Helms to comment on that.","Billy Helms","Yes Leo, this is Billy Helms. As you mentioned we view these enhanced completions or these high density completions in other plays largely starting in the Eagle Ford where we have certainly demonstrated the uplift associated with executing these high density completions. We are transferring this technology to other plays including the Delaware Basin and I think the results are very encouraging with what we are seeing there and we are incorporating our high density completions along with are focused on targeting. And the targeting I think is going to also make a huge difference in the performance of the wells. I\u2019d say in the Delaware Basin is still early on and we\u2019re evaluating both those two new approaches as well as spacing test in each one of our target intervals and we hope to be able to give you some very positive news in the future on the performance of those efforts.","Leo Mariani","I guess just turning to the Eagle Ford here, just trying to get a sense of where you are at in the process of testing the W patterns, and the stagger stacks here? And are you able to kind of see any results at this point, and when do you think we'll have a better update on that?","Billy Helms","Yes Leo this is Billy Helms again, on the Eagle Ford we\u2019ve actually got several tests underway using this W pattern test and the W pattern just to make sure we are certain about the explanation that is largely and it is only in the lower Eagle Ford that we are doing the W pattern. So we\u2019re not -- we\u2019re just focused solely on the W pattern in the Lower Eagle Ford and that\u2019s largely been the focus as a result of our targeting efforts as I started in the Lower Eagle Ford, we identified through our analysis of all the core data and the petrophysical data that we have that there are two sweet spot intervals that we wanted to target. It's still early on, we\u2019ve just started testing those and we\u2019re testing those in several areas across the field but we are encouraged with their early results. The early results look to indicate that these two areas, these two sweet spot intervals aren\u2019t interfering with each other during the production phase. So that gives us a lot of encouragement for additional resource that we\u2019ll be able to capture in the future it is still early yet to really quantify the results from that test, but I\u2019d say we\u2019re optimistic about the results.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley.","Evan Calio","Bill, let me start off on a macro strategy question. You are one of the best, if not the best on conventional operator, deep well inventory, and a relatively bullish outlook on the commodity. Philosophically, what does your reacceleration look like? Will you be pacing activity within cash flow neutrality on a few quarter lag, and, given the efficiencies that have accelerated, does it change your view on a peak rig count being significantly lower than prior rig count in a recovery scenario?","Bill Thomas","Yes I think the key for us going in next year the advantage we have that we didn\u2019t have in the early part of 2015 is we have an incredible amount of flexibility with our capital. It's really, we just don\u2019t have commitments to international, we don\u2019t have lease retention, we don\u2019t have as much heavy infrastructure especially first part of the year and we don\u2019t have a lot of service contracts in place. So we\u2019re free to really put our money on the best rate of return projects, or wells and the Company and we\u2019re also free to vary that capital spend rate based on the commodity price and we can react very quickly. So as we said we\u2019re not going to -- we won\u2019t give specific growth numbers, or production numbers, or CapEx numbers until February because we\u2019re very committed to staying within cash flow. So that will really determine our view of -- basically we will use the strip process plus form factor that we have on the macro to kind of determine our CapEx for the year. And then we will vary that according to the commodity prices as the year goes through. So it will be a very flexible year and -- but our focus will be of course on increasing returns, increasing the quality of our inventory and continuing to prove up new things.","Evan Calio","And it sounds like DUCs will be your first lever there. Let me ask my second or follow-up question on the Delaware. You're making significant progress. How long do you think it takes to get to the same level of technological maturity that you have in the Eagle Ford, where you're satisfied in your ability to drill within zone, optimize completion design? Yes. I'll leave it there. Thanks.","Billy Helms","Okay yes Evan this is Billy Helms. Yes for the Delaware Basin as you mentioned there we\u2019re earlier in the ability to really get into a good development program there. I think the key thing you have to realize about the Delaware Basin as opposed to the Eagle Ford is the Delaware Basin is a highly complex basin the geology changes quite a bit across the basin. There are multiple targets, multiple formations and we've done a -- our team out there has done a great job of really delineating their understanding of the play with the data that we have and we\u2019re always collecting more and more data as we develop the program. So I would say just to bullet down to maybe base ball terms we\u2019re probably maybe a third inning on the Delaware Basin as opposed to sixth or seventh inning maybe on the Eagle Ford for instance.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Charles Meade with Johnson Rice.","Charles Meade","I'd like to dig in a bit on the -- on the advanced completions and the well productivity that you cited as one of the reasons for your oil volumes coming in over guidance, I know that the most prominent thing we see is these great IP rates that you have turned in, but the other thing that I believe you've mentioned and we certainly see with the results on these Thor wells that, particularly for those Thor wells, the 30-day rate is at least as remarkable as the IP rate. And I'm curious when you look at the effect that these advanced completions are having on your production profile, should we be thinking about the beat in 3Q being a function of wells that were completed in 3Q, or is it more a function of the wells that were completed in the first half of the year that are holding up better with lower decline, that really are leading to beats like this?","Billy Helms","Yes Charles this is Billy Helms. Ys I think that\u2019s a good question, I think it\u2019s maybe a factor of both certainly the targeting and the high density completions are making a huge difference as evidenced in as what you just mentioned in the Thor well and the other Wolfcamp wells we completed in the last quarter, and certainly those are new wells and we\u2019re seeing vast improvements in the productivity of the wells, and they are sustaining themselves as evidenced by the 30 day average that you mentioned on the Thor well. And we've been doing this for a while longer in some of the other plays mainly the Eagle Ford and yes we\u2019re seeing the decline as not as steep on those wells, so it has an overall flattening effect on our decline rates on all these programs so we\u2019re seeing the benefit in those two areas.","Charles Meade","So it's both. And then, if I could ask a question about the Delaware Basin acquisitions, I know that this is a little bit of a change in MO from you, who you have historically have been focused really on organic leasing. Should we be thinking about these acquisitions or further acquisitions like this as the closest you can get to organic leasing in the Delaware Basin, given the legacy of vertical production out there? And I suppose as a follow-on to that should we be expecting more similarly sized deals from you guys going forward?","Bill Thomas","Charles this is Bill. I think I'll ask Billy to comment a bit on that. But I think it will be a combination, we\u2019re doing a lot of little deals along with the bigger deals, and so block enough acreage sharing acreage with other operators and slopping it out and some drilled aren\u2019t deals and then we\u2019re also buying some small fracs from different operators. So it will be a combination of multiple things. As Billy said we pretty much ruled out any of the bigger M&A possibilities and mainly we ruled that out on asset quality, it didn't come in comparable to what we already have. So we don't really expect to be pursuing anything like that, Billy you want to add anything?","Billy Helms","Yes the only thing I would add Charles to that as I think it, -- the acquisitions we've done are largely staying within our focus of growing organically. The difference would be that the organic growth in new plays we\u2019re still able to go out and get ahead of the competition and acquire positions in new plays fairly cheaply. In the Delaware Basin it's a very mature basin, it is a lot of ownership, legacy ownership has been out there for years and years as everybody knows. So one way to gain entry into acreage that we see quite a bit of upside is through these tactical acquisitions and I would add to Bill's comment we\u2019re being highly selective in what we acquire. And so we passed up several opportunities that have been transacted that we just passed on and we did focus on these three tactical acquisitions that we are very encouraged with and as a matter of fact we already have drilling operations going on, on the acreage that we acquired. So we\u2019re going to stay selective and continue to grow each of one of these plays in whatever manner we feel like we can.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Bob Brackett with Bernstein Research.","Bob Brackett","Yes a question on the acquisitions, who were the counter parties, were they privates or publics or landowners?","Bill Thomas","They were selective companies and we\u2019re not going to get into details about the deals we have done and certainly not again into the details about the things we\u2019ve looked at, it's just something we don\u2019t really comment on. But I\u2019d say they are all existing companies, strong companies that we\u2019ve done business with in the past and hope to continue to do business with in the future and we\u2019ll look at all of the opportunities whether it is small private companies or larger public companies for opportunities to add to our positions.","Bob Brackett","And then a follow-up on next year, how do you think about debt to cap, and is it a level that you're happy with or is some of next year's cash flow going to debt reduction?","Bill Thomas","Well yes Bob, we\u2019re very committed to keeping a very strong balance sheet. So we\u2019ll not stretch it much further than then it really is. Although I will say this, we will continue to look for acquisitions and not likely to find a big one, but if we find things that are attractive to us we will use -- evaluate all the options that we have to acquire that. And so the Company is in fantastic shape to do that. Of course the goal for us has always been to generate free cash flow, to continue working on the dividend down the road too we needed a little bit better commodity price, than we have right now to accomplish that, but that will be a goal for us going forward. We also continue to market non-core properties that has been an ongoing process for the Company for years. So we\u2019re in the process of doing that again this year too. So we\u2019ve got multiple ways to continue to keep the net debt of the Company low and to really preserve our balance sheet.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Doug Leggate with Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch.","Doug Leggate","Bill, within the scheme of living within cash flow, obviously you've had a fairly large international project pretty much close to conclusion now, a lot of exploration spending and a fair amount of midstream spending. Just in the grand scheme of things, within the different buckets can you generalize whether you will see an incremental swing back towards completions within the context of living within cash flow, in terms of your capital spending?","Bill Thomas","Yes, Doug specifically, yes for 2016 with the very large uncompleted well inventory certainly the focus of the CapEx and that will be the highest return thing we can invest in next year, we will be on completing that inventory and lower that inventory down. So it gives us a lot of flexibility because we just don\u2019t have always all these other big commitments and that will certainly give us I think stronger capital efficiency, a very-very high return on our capital next year.","Doug Leggate","I guess not to push the point, Bill, but I guess I was kind of hoping you might quantify order of magnitude. Exploration, IOC, midstream I'm guessing it's close to 20%-25% of this year's budget. I mean could it be that big of a swing in terms of incremental completion capital?","Bill Thomas","No, I think the -- we call that kind of the indirect that will be roughly about the same percentage that it has been in the past. Maybe not quite as much in the first part of the year but certainly we\u2019ve got things that we need to do in those areas. As far as international projects, we don\u2019t have many significant commitments next year on international it's actually less I think than historically. Let me ask Gary Thomas to comment and chime here and give a little bit more color on that.","Gary Thomas","One thing on the indirects and you talked about the midstream it will be benefitted next year with us having these doubts because they are in areas where we have quite a lot of operations currently, so we will have less infrastructure requirements just to hook those wells up. So it would be a little less than what we have experienced 2014-2015.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from David Tameron with Wells Fargo.","David Tameron","Let me run with that same theme. If I think about maintenance CapEx, I think you have thrown out a number before, $4.8 billion. One, is that the right number? And two, obviously that number goes lower. Can you give us any framework around that?","Bill Thomas","That\u2019s when you look at what we are spending now and that came up and we\u2019re looking at spending $1 billion this quarter and probably somewhere around maybe 900 million for next quarter, this fourth quarter. So it could be talked out there has been maintenance capital but yes when we go into \u201916 we\u2019ll not have to be spending money associated with locations with the drilling with quite a lot associated with these stuffs. So that will probably reduce per well about 30% but the 4.8 is -- our maintenance capital was quite a bit less than that.","David Tameron","Yes, yes I think that was a prior number, okay that's helpful. And if I think about the DUC -- the pace of the DUC drawdown, I think before we talked about mid-year, are you just going to take them down -- should we think about it systematically, taking down 200 over the first six months of the year, or how should we -- can you give us any framework around just the pace or the timing of that?","Billy Helms","Yes David let me answer that one. We've a lot of flexibility, so really the pace of our spending and the pace of our activity will be very much guided by the commodity price and the resulting cash flow. So that\u2019s the reason we\u2019re not giving any really details because we want to work our plan more every time we work our plan it gets a little better so we\u2019re very encouraged about that, and then we certainly need to have a lot better insight on what the cash flow and commodity price would be. So it will be regulated by really the oil price.","Operator","For our next question we\u2019ll go to Kevin Smith with Raymond James.","Kevin Smith","It seems the industry playbook is fairly standard with drilling longer laterals and pumping more sand in your completions, but you were able to deliver record-breaking well results in the Wolfcamp with a lateral less than 5,000 feet, is it fair to say then that EOG believes completion and maybe zone landing are more incrementally economic than just drilling longer laterals?","Billy Helms","Yes Kevin this is Billy Helms. That\u2019s exactly what we would say is that the completion and targeting are making a huge difference regardless of lateral length and we\u2019re not focused on drilling necessarily longer laterals to make better wells we\u2019re focused on increasing our rate of return, driving rate of return through the innovation and application of technology which includes how we analyze and figure out where the place to lateral in each of these pay objectives that\u2019s a big part of why the productivity on these wells is increasing every quarter is that continual focus on those two things, the technology around completions and also the landing spot that we\u2019re working on with our geological effort.","Kevin Smith","And then lastly, thank you for that, but given the Wolfcamp drilling results, does the Delaware Basin start competing with capital versus the Bakken or other plays?","Billy Helms","Yes Kevin this is Billy Helms again. Yes I think while it's still early to think about what that\u2019s going to mean for next year's capital allocation. I think if you look back to this year, this year the Delaware Basin was the only area that saw an increase in capital from 2014. And we\u2019ll certainly assess the way that looks. I would say we\u2019re very encouraged with the productivity gains we've made and the progress we\u2019re seeing on that play to be able to generate growth for the Company, and we\u2019ll evaluate our options on how we allocate capital as we get closer to the year-end.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Pearce Hammond with Simmons & Company.","Pearce Hammond","Bill thanks for your comments on 2016. My first question is if you match CapEx and cash flow, do you expect to deliver oil production growth in 2016?","Bill Thomas","Yes Pearce again that\u2019s a good question, because we don't know what that cash flow and CapEx will be yet because we will set that based on the oil price and that\u2019s what we\u2019re -- wanted to get a little bit better deal on down the road. We certainly are in a position next year to have a very strong performance. And if we have the support from the oil price the Company is in great shape. So but we\u2019ll just have to wait to give any specific numbers until February.","Pearce Hammond","And then my follow-up is, when it's time to ramp production for EOG and the rest of the industry, are you concerned about the deliverability of the service industry, given the sizable headcount reductions across the states and maybe some degradation on some of the pieces of equipment?","Gary Thomas","Pearce this is Gary Thomas. And yes there is some concern with that and we've talked quite a lot about that and maintaining the activity level that we have maintained and what we've planned to do in 2016 we\u2019re focused on those companies that are really quality companies and have been tremendous partners to EOG and we\u2019re spreading that word trying to keep them in good shape. So it's going to be hard on the industry. I believe you're correct there, but I think we\u2019re positioned so that we\u2019ll be able to get the top services and hopefully we have got a lot of self sourcing going on with EOG anyway. So I think we can really ramp-up readily when we see commodity prices improve.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Ryan Todd with Deutsche Bank.","Ryan Todd","If I could maybe follow up with a couple questions on the Delaware Basin. I appreciate your earlier comments about uncertainties in terms of relative capital allocation across the portfolio next year. Maybe, as you think about relative capital allocation within the Delaware Basin, I mean, is there a pecking order in terms of which of the three plays have the best rates of return at this point, and how much does infrastructure at this point dictate relative activity between Leonard versus Bone Spring, versus Wolfcamp?","Billy Helms","Yes Ryan this is Billy Helms. So yes, we\u2019ve got three really good plays out there, the Leonard, the Bone Springs and the Wolf Camp. And what we\u2019re doing right now is we\u2019re focusing most of our activity on the lower most of those zones to Wolf Camp for a couple of reasons; one, the Wolf Camp is generating really high rate of returns that are competitive with pretty much every play in the Company. And then two, it really gives us by drilling the deeper objective it gives us a chance to evaluate the shallower objectives as we drill through them. So we can gather log data and other data that we need to really help delineate the shallower plays and that will help us improve our returns on those plays and make them even stronger when we start our development in those plays. On infrastructure, we\u2019re focusing most of our activity in areas where we already have existing infrastructure. As we step out and test some of the new areas, we\u2019re certainly going to have to build out an infrastructure in those areas. But right now most of our activity is in areas where have infrastructure available to us.","Ryan Todd","And do you have sufficient infrastructure to allocate materially more capital going forward, or is this still a waiting game, I guess?","Lance Terveen","Ryan, this is Lance. When we look at their takeaway capacity it's been very encouraging. I mean the midstream operators are really fall through with investment and we\u2019re going to be connected to all that near-term capacity, so, and just to follow-up what Billy said, we\u2019re in great shape as we\u2019re sitting today.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Irene Haas from Wunderlich.","Irene Haas","My question has to do with your targeting effort. I wish there's a fancy schmancy name for it, but it's really intriguing. So on slide 9, you show that there's 12 parameters that you have identified. You sum it together, and that kind of gives you the targeted zone. And my question for you is, some those parameters, can you share a little bit like, are they porosity, permeability as such, and is it hard to replicate? My question really stems from you said in Eagle Ford, you're in the sixth inning, so in terms of just data density you have a whole lot to work on. Would it be a harder exercise to pull off in Delaware Basin? And are there anybody else trying to do this? Is this expensive, or is it data intensive, or simply they need brain cells? And lastly, who does the number crunching for you? Do you actually do this analysis in house, or do you farm it out to a third-party?","David Trice","Yes Irene, this is David Trice. A lot of this that we\u2019re presenting there is proprietary data. So we will just give you an example and this is -- a lot of this is built up, we\u2019ve been pursuing these resource plays for over a decade and so a lot of this is just it means that we\u2019ve learned over the years and we have some of the very best people in the industry. And so we\u2019ve been able to put this together through this integrated approach between our G&G guys, our petrophysicists and the engineers. And this is just kind of a core competency of EOG how we approach things. And so really we can\u2019t really give a lot more detail than that, but it is part of our culture.","Irene Haas","So what you're saying is it's kind of hard to replicate for a multitude of reasons, and is it easier to do it on Eagle versus Delaware, because of data density, or are you able to forecast because you've got such a great global database on every single shale?","David Trice","Yes, I mean if you think about it, we\u2019re in really the three major plays so we have a lot of good data throughout all those plays and we\u2019ve got a lot of good rock data, petrophysical data and everything. And so we have -- we\u2019re testing so many different targets and we just have a lot of information and we are able to apply it from play-to-play. And so I do think as you look towards a play like the Delaware Basin we\u2019re -- you do have multiple targets, a lot of that information is going to be even more critical there. So we do think it is something that is very-very difficult to replicate.","Operator","We\u2019ll go now to Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer","I wanted to just follow up on the questions with regards to 2016 and growth. Just looking at the third quarter here of 2015, where you spent about $1 billion ex the acreage acquisition, you grew your oil volumes, and what I think you're highlighting here is you're going to be more flexible because of the DUC inventory, because you have some of those contracts rolling off. What are the impediments to showing perhaps not just the growth that we saw in US oil volumes in Q3, but even greater growth next year, assuming we're in a $40 to $50 environment? It seems that rate of return is not a question, unless you think it is. What are the impediments to showing -- to showing growth, since we just saw it here in the third quarter?","Gary Thomas","Brian this is Gary Thomas. And it really just goes back to the cash flow and that\u2019s what we\u2019re working so to balance and we\u2019re still working through that and yes the wells we've drilled and completed that will be being official to us but then just as data we were just mentioning we have these new plays and we\u2019re in the experimental phase as well and we've to gather data and have to run quite a number of logs and also there is just a whole combination of things. So we\u2019re still factoring all those in to see what kind of volume growth we could have with particular oil prices in 2016, but cash flow driven.","Brian Singer","And then with regards to the technological improvement here, and the higher density completions in particular which do cost some amount more capital, can you talk about what you would expect to see in terms of incremental EURs in places like the Delaware, the Eagle Ford, and the Bakken? And whether, that is all upside from here and represents an increase in recovery rate?","Billy Helms","Yes Brian this is Billy Helms. I would say that we haven't really quantified in most of plays yet just the magnitude of the improvement we\u2019ll hope to see in EURs from testing the new high density completions as well as the targeting efforts. The numbers we've given you to-date are based on the results we have and have data on but as we continue to make improvements in both targeting and the high density completions we\u2019re very encouraged with the early results and as we get more data we\u2019ll certainly update its impact on the resource assessments. So we just need some production time to evaluate that data as well as the different spacing tests that we\u2019re conducting throughout the Company. And we\u2019ll give you more color on that as we get data.","Operator","We\u2019ll go now to Subash Chandra with Guggenheim.","Subash Chandra","Yes, my first question is how do you think about your base decline rate starting in \u201916 versus \u201915?","Bill Thomas","Yes Subash this is Bill Thomas. The decline rate in the Company is lowering every year because of we get more old wells versus new wells so the production base gets more mature that\u2019s the major driver. And then the completion technology is a very significant driver and the quality of the rock that you drill the lateral in as that improves the decline rate lower. So we've got multiple things going on, as far as 2016 versus \u201915 it will be lower and particularly when you slow growth down say versus 2014 we grew at 31% well in 2015 our decline rate was higher because then it would be in 2016 because of we grew production and added a lot more new wells in 2014. So as the activity, number of wells as you complete each year as that is lower and then we\u2019ll be coming off a flat growth year in 2015, so it will be significantly lower than what it was in 2014. ","Subash Chandra","And my follow-up is, in the Permian plays, between the three that you've mentioned, how do we think about the water oil ratios, either in absolute terms or relative to one other? And that's formation water?","Billy Helms","Yes Subash this is Billy Helms. Certainly that\u2019s something we look at on each one of these plays and I would say it varies by target interval but it also varies by where you are in the basin. So all of these plays have some element of formation water and so it's really important that you understand due to the detailed geological work that we had done to really delineate what we think are the sweet spots and that\u2019s where our efforts are focused on picking up acreage in what we do considering the sweet spots, we\u2019re being there very selective about where we drill and where we increased our position in those areas. And I would say the Leonard play probably has a little bit higher water cut than the Wolfcamp in general, but every play has some element of water production. So you need to have infrastructure to go along with that to make sure that your cost over the life of the play are measurable and competitive with other plays that we have in the Company.","Operator","That concludes today\u2019s question-and-answer session. At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the conference back to Mr. Thomas for any concluding remarks.","Bill Thomas","Thank you for your questions and again I want to really thank the EOG employees\u2019 who have done a fantastic job this year in giving the Company reset to be very successful on the low commodity prices. So the combination of the best in class assets, technology, low cost, and organic exploration and all this is driven by EOG\u2019s organization and culture are we believe very sustainable competitive advantages as we go forward. And this powerful combination will allow EOG to be one of the highest return producers and more importantly we believe we\u2019re going to be more than competitive going forward in the world oil market. So we want to thank everybody for listening and especially thank you for your support.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s conference.

Bill Thomas will review our shift to premium drilling and the long-term growth outlook we introduced in yesterday's press release. Billy Helms and David Trice will review notable achievements in select plays. I will then discuss EOG's financials and capital structure, and Bill will provide concluding remarks.","Here's Bill Thomas.","William R. Thomas - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Tim. Good morning, everyone.","EOG's goal during this downturn has been squarely focused on resetting the company to be successful in a low commodity price environment. We are focused on lowering operational costs and achieving a strong return on capital invested in a $40 oil environment. Our goal is to continue to be the U.S. leader in investment returns and be competitive with the lowest cost producers in the global oil market. On this call this morning we have important updates that highlight significant progress towards reaching our goals.","First, per unit lease operating costs decreased by 27% in the first half of 2016 versus 2015, and per unit cash operating costs in the first half are down 15% compared to full-year 2015 and 30% below 2014 levels. Second, with outstanding capital efficiency gains, we exceeded the high end of our second quarter U.S. oil production target, and we are increasing our full-year U.S. oil forecast by 2% without increasing CapEx guidance. Third, we have increased our premium inventory by 34% and increased our premium reserve potential by a whopping 75%. And fourth, we closed on $425 million of non-core property sales this year. Along with maintaining our strong balance sheet, we are updating our portfolio by investing in high-return premium assets.","As a reminder, a premium well is defined by an after-tax direct rate of return of at least 40% at $40 oil. We believe this metric makes EOG unique in the U.S. when it comes to quality of inventory and investment returns.","There are a few additional points regarding this definition of premium that I want to be sure are very clear. Number one, 30% is a minimum return. This means the average return for our premium drilling inventory is clearly higher. Number two, 30% was selected as a minimum so that the fully-loaded investment, including all indirect costs, generates a healthy all-in corporate rate of return. Number three, 30% at $40 oil is the premium benchmark regardless of what the prevailing market price for oil is, meaning if oil goes to $50 or $60, the returns quickly move into the triple-digit range. Finally, premium inventory is a return-based metric. It can be achieved by cost reductions or productivity increases or a combination of both. Because our technical and efficiency gains are sustainable, we are confident that a large majority of our remaining inventory will be converted to premium over time.","EOG's shift to premium is a new chapter for the company. Premium drilling establishes a higher permanent standard for capital allocation, and therefore will significantly increase capital productivity over time. This shift enables EOG to deliver high-return robust growth using far less capital at a far lower oil price.","Which leads me to another highlight from yesterday's press release, the 2020 growth outlook we provided. Due to the sustainable gains in well productivity and cost, we can grow oil production at a 10% compound annual growth rate at $50 oil. At $60 oil, our compound annual growth rate jumps to 20%. And most importantly, we can deliver that oil production growth while covering our capital expenditures and our dividend with cash flow, enabling us to meet our goal of maintaining a strong balance sheet.","As prices improve, we expect to incrementally reduce the net debt-to-capital ratio to our historical norm of 30% or less by generating free cash flow and, to a lesser extent, through non-core property sales. While the shift to premium drilling has tremendous impact on EOG's returns, growth, and capital productivity, the question remains. Is this shift really permanent? In other words, can EOG continue to replace its premium inventory? And the answer is yes.","The three ways we add premium inventory are conversion, exploration, and acquisition. The first and most immediate way is through conversion. Converting well locations that were on the edge of the 30% hurdle rate is a source of the 1,100 new premium locations we announced yesterday. Furthermore, we have much more inventory on the verge of conversion. By improving well productivity or lowering cost, in most cases both, we expect much of our current non-premium inventory in the top basins to be converted to premium over time. Improvements to well productivity and cost savings are ongoing and never ending. In a moment, Billy Helms and David Trice will talk more about how productivity improvements, cost reductions, and longer laterals will add to premium inventory.","The second way we add premium inventory is through exploration. EOG is a leader in organic exploration growth because at our core we are an exploration-driven company. In this lower commodity price environment, we have not stopped looking. With EOG's decentralized structure, we have six experienced exploration teams in the U.S. generating new ideas, acquiring leases, and developing new plays. EOG is a prospect generating machine, and our shift to premium has not slowed that effort down. In fact, it has enhanced the return hurdle by which new plays are evaluated.","The third way we expect to add premium inventory is through targeted bolt-on acquisitions. Due to the current low commodity cost environment, we are actively pursuing opportunities to capture top-tier acreage. We were successful on four such transactions in the Delaware Basin last year, and are optimistic we can execute on more through this down cycle. I am confident that we can replace premium-level drilling every year through conversions, exploration, and acquisitions. And as I said last quarter, this shift to premium drilling is permanent and it's a game-changing event for EOG.","Now I'll turn it over to Billy Helms to discuss the Eagle Ford.","Lloyd W. Helms, Jr. - Executive Vice President, Exploration & Production","Thanks, Bill.","As highlighted in the press release yesterday, we added 390 net locations to our Eagle Ford premium inventory. That's a 25% increase to our original estimate six months ago, and takes the total premium well count in the Eagle Ford to almost 2,000 locations. Two thousand locations represents 10 years of premium high-return drilling. What's more, there are at least 2,000 more Eagle Ford locations that are on the verge of premium designation. To convert these locations, we will need to reduce current well cost by 10% or improve EURs by 10%. Slide 11 of our investor presentation illustrates this. By making small, very attainable improvements, we can add another 10 years of premium high-return Eagle Ford inventory from our existing acreage. I am confident we will make this conversion over time.","One of the ways we convert locations to premium is by drilling longer laterals. Our success in the western Eagle Ford, as illustrated on slide nine, is a good example. The trick with longer laterals is to maintain, or preferably enhance, productivity per foot of lateral. Due to engineering breakthroughs in EOG's completion design, we have gone out as far as two miles with no degradation in productivity per foot.","While longer laterals will be one source of future premium inventory, two more significant sources will be EOG's focus on performance improvement through advancing our technical understanding and lowering cost. On the technical side, geological and geophysical advancements enable us to refine our precision targeting efforts. For example, we are determining where there may be multiple lower Eagle Ford targets to support drilling a W pattern. We are also working to understand where the upper Eagle Ford is prospective. While the prospective area for the upper Eagle Ford is geographically limited, there are some sweet spots that may contribute premium well locations.","Finally, as we discussed last quarter, we will be completing seven additional Austin Chalk wells and continue to delineate the play and understand its full potential.","On the cost side, we are finding creative ways to drive costs down further. We are drilling more wells per pad with more efficient rigs designed for pad drilling. The rig design allows for simultaneous operations such as conducting drilling and cementing operations on multiple wells at the same time, reducing both time and cost.","On the completion side, we continue to optimize proppant schedules and stage lengths, reduce cost for items like sand and chemicals, while maintaining the EOG high-density completion process. Our continuing focus on every facet of our operations has allowed us to drop Eagle Ford total well cost another 11% year to date to $5.1 million.","Also, we continue to be encouraged with our enhanced oil recovery or EOR projects. As a reminder, the process is highly economic and provides another way to create premium inventory. It not only increases the recovery, but also provides a means to flatten the field production decline.","Finally, I'll draw your attention to slide 23. We added another line to the chart representing 2016 year-to-date cumulative production. Year after year, we improve our well productivity in the Eagle Ford. Much of this year's increase can be attributed to our shift to premium drilling. However, as slide five illustrates, just 60% of our 2016 drilling program is premium, so we expect to see this chart show improvement for many years to come.","Now here's David Trice.","David W. Trice - Executive Vice President-Exploration & Production","Thanks, Billy.","Like the Eagle Ford, the Delaware Basin also added to its premium drilling inventory. Five hundred twenty net locations were added across all three plays, the Wolfcamp, Second Bone Spring, and Leonard. The new premium total now stands at more than 1,700 locations. That's almost 20 years of premium high-return drilling.","In the Delaware Basin, the main driver of premium additions was improvement in well productivity through better targeting and completions. For example, slide seven of the investor presentation shows EOG's 2016 Wolfcamp oil wells produced more than 200,000 barrels equivalent on average in the first 180 days. That's a 17% increase in the 180-day cumulative oil production over wells in our 2015 program. More importantly, it shows a 45% uplift over a typical 750 MBOE well, which is the gross per well EUR given in our last Wolfcamp update.","Finally, it's worth noting that the data in this chart is normalized to 4,500-foot laterals, meaning EOG's 4,500-foot laterals in the Delaware Basin are as good or better than the 10,000-foot laterals in the Midland Basin. In addition to productivity gains, longer laterals in the Delaware Basin are another way we've added premium locations to the Wolfcamp as well as the other two plays. Innovations made to wellbore design in the last six months allow us to drill longer while still applying high-density completions so that we do not sacrifice long-term reserves. The new design will allow us to maintain high recovery rates on the longer laterals while lowering costs and increasing returns.","Sixteen gross Wolfcamp oil and combo wells were brought online in the second quarter, with an average 30-day rate of more than 2,400 barrels of oil equivalent per day and an average lateral length of 6,500 feet. These are industry-leading Wolfcamp results regardless of operator or basin, as shown on slide eight of our investor presentation. EOG expects to complete 70 Wolfcamp wells in 2016.","While the effort in the last couple years has clearly been focused on the Wolfcamp, we have been able to collect a tremendous amount of data on all of the shallower targets such as the Second Bone Spring and the Leonard Shale. Despite limited drilling this year, results in the Second Bone Spring have also been impressive. Ninety-day cumulative production has increased 27% over 2015 wells and 60% better than a typical 500 MBOE well. The Second Bone Spring tends to be more stratigraphically complex, so additional data we collect from drilling Wolfcamp wells has aided in much better targeting, longer laterals, and more premium wells. We expect similar or better uplifts to our Leonard Shale results on a go-forward basis.","In the Rockies, we've had great success in the Powder River Basin and Wyoming DJ Basin. As announced in our press release yesterday, we drilled three Turner wells last quarter that averaged almost 2,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Completed well costs, which include drilling, completion, and on-lease facilities averaged $5.4 million for a 6,500-foot lateral, down from $6.5 million in 2015. These Turner wells are incredibly economic at $40 oil. We plan to drill a total of 20 net wells in the Turner this year.","When we conducted our first count of premium inventory in December of last year, the DJ Basin Codell in Wyoming was slightly below the premium threshold. Due to sustainable cost reductions and better targeting, we added 200 premium locations in this play. Currently, Codell wells cost $5.9 million for a 9,400-foot lateral. As noted in press release yesterday, our latest Codell well produced approximately 1,400 barrels of oil equivalent in the first 30 days. We expect costs and well improvements to continue and are working to expand gas takeaway options in Wyoming. The DJ Basin Codell will become a larger part of our premium drilling program in the near future.","In the East Irish Sea, I'm happy to report that Conwy is currently producing approximately 10,000 barrels of oil per day. During the second quarter, Conwy was down due to issues on the Douglas production platform. While Conwy wells were initially tested at a daily rate over more than 20,000 barrels of oil, results from recent production testing indicate that the optimal level of production is 10,000 barrels of oil per day. For the remainder of the year, we expect to average about 4,000 to 8,000 barrels of oil per day to accommodate further tests and potential downtime.","Here's Tim Driggers.","Timothy K. Driggers - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Thanks, David.","Capitalized interest for the second quarter of 2016 was $9 million. Exploration and development expenditures were $624 million excluding property acquisitions, which is 49% less as compared to second quarter 2015, while our total production volumes decreased by just 2%. In addition, expenditures for gathering systems, processing plants, and other property, plant, and equipment were $20 million. We have maintained our full-year capital expenditure guidance of $2.4 billion to $2.6 billion.","At the end of June 2016, total debt outstanding was $7 billion and the debt-to-total capitalization ratio was 37%. At June 30, we had $780 million of cash on hand, giving us non-GAAP net debt of $6.2 billion, for a net debt-to-total cap ratio of 34%.","Year to date, we have sold $425 million of assets with associated production of 45 million cubic feet per day of natural gas, 3,300 barrels of oil per day, and 3,700 barrels per day of NGLs. Assets sold include Midland Basin and Colorado DJ Basin properties.","The effective tax rate for the second quarter was 23%, and the deferred tax ratio was 214%.","Now I'll turn it back over to Bill.","William R. Thomas - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Tim; now a brief word on our macro view and how it relates to our 2016 plans.","Even though oil prices have been volatile, our view of supply\/demand fundamentals has not changed. We believe $40 oil will not provide enough cash flow or investment return to overcome the combined effect of production decline and demand growth worldwide. While EOG can deliver healthy growth in cash flow at $50 oil, we continue to believe the U.S. horizontal oil industry as a whole needs a sustained $60 oil price and extended lead time to deliver a moderate level of growth.","As we discussed last quarter, the substantial reduction in capital investments by the industry since 2014 is causing oil supply to decline in many producing regions worldwide. As production continues to decline, the inventory overhang will slowly work off. The consensus view is the market will balance during 2017.","For 2016, given the uncertainty of the current commodity environment, we are maintaining our CapEx guidance at $2.4 billion to $2.6 billion. However, as a result of cost savings, we are increasing our well count to 250 drilled wells and 350 completed wells. This is an additional 50 wells drilled and 80 completions above our original plan for the same CapEx.","In summary, I would like to leave you with the following important takeaways from this call. Number one, we continue to reduce operating costs. We believe these reductions are sustainable, and we have additional efforts underway to reduce future operational costs.","Number two, our shift to premium is achieving what we believe are the strongest investment returns at $40 oil in the U.S.","Number three, our shift to premium is permanent. We are confident we can grow premium quality inventory much faster than we drill it.","Number four, we continue to exceed our U.S. production targets by increasing capital efficiency. We believe these efficiency gains are sustainable and give EOG a significant advantage as we enter the next recovery.","And number five, we are maintaining our strong balance sheet through disciplined spending.","I'll close this call with our view of EOG's future through 2020. There are four goals we plan to achieve. The first goal is to be the U.S. leader in rate of return on capital investments. The second goal is to be the low-cost U.S. producer and therefore competitive in the global oil market. Our third goal is to be the leader in Lower 48 absolute oil growth through 2020. And our fourth goal is to maintain a strong balance sheet through disciplined spending. By achieving these four goals, we will accomplish our ultimate goal of creating long-term shareholder value.","Producing growth by consistently outspending and drilling uneconomic wells is not in EOG's vocabulary. We firmly believe that growth should be the result of strong returns and disciplined spending. EOG's unwavering commitment to our long-term shareholders is to focus on returns first. The company is uniquely positioned to produce strong returns and resume high-return growth as commodity prices improve.","Thanks for listening, and now we'll go to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And we will take our first question today from Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey, guys. Good morning, everybody, and good results to close out earnings here.","William R. Thomas - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Evan.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","My first question, Bill, is how quickly can you get into the 10% annual growth rate, the bottom of your new growth at $50? It looks a little bit back-end loaded on slide 14. And I guess my question is, do DUCs allow for fast return? And what signals do you need to add rigs to move towards these targets?","William R. Thomas - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, of course, Evan. The driver is oil price. And as oil prices improve above the $50 level, the more capital we'll add and the faster we'll ramp up our activity. We're not limited on beginning out very significantly. We have ongoing operations and enough rigs and equipment going now, and the DUCs really help us get off to a good start. But it is, as you can tell from the chart on slide 14, it's not 10% every year. So 2017 will start off incrementally at a lower rate, and then we'll build from there as we go forward. And of course, as volumes grow, cash flow grows too, so the process multiplies itself as we go forward.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","What drives the higher growth in the back end of the decade? Does that reflect the EUR base decline management, or is that all an effect from premium locations?","William R. Thomas - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","The whole driver for us being able to grow at these kinds of rates at these low oil prices is really the switch to premium and the lowering of the well cost at the same time. The productivity of the wells is just a tremendous uptick from where we were in 2014, and so the capital efficiency I believe has more than doubled since that time. We did not put in the outlook, we did not put any EOR investments in there or production response, so that's really not a part of the outlook that we did. Of course, the EOR has great capital efficiency. It's just as good as premium, and we're working it in over time as is appropriate.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great, I'll leave there for somebody else. Thanks.","Operator","And we'll go to Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Doug Leggate - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Thanks, good morning, everybody. Bill, this is pretty exciting. Obviously, we see this as the formal change I guess. I guess the question I have is you could pretty much, assuming you're right on the macro, you could pretty much assume to grow at whatever pace you want as it relates to inventory. I'm guessing a 10% hurdle is not, for your track record, that difficult to achieve. So what are the constraints that you see to EOG's growth aspirations as relates to people, infrastructure, and maybe even a switch in capital towards EOR or back to shareholders?","William R. Thomas - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Doug, the constraints would be \u2013 I think the biggest one would be we don't want to lose the capital efficiency gains that we have built in right now, and so we don't want to go so fast that we're bringing in equipment and people and spending money and drilling wells and really lose these efficiency gains that we've got right now. So if oil, say, went to $70 or $60 or $70 really quick, we could ramp up appropriately, but we wouldn't do it overnight. We couldn't do it overnight. We would have to build up the service quality, and we would certainly want to maintain our efficiencies that we've already built in. That's the one thing we don't want to do.","Of course, we want to focus on our balance sheet and to get that net debt-to-cap back down to below 30% also. So I believe I'll let Gary Thomas chime in on that. He can give some color on that.","Gary L. Thomas - Chief Operating Officer","Yes, Doug. As Bill was saying, the premium drilling is what helps us with the growth forward because it just requires fewer wells, and we'll not be having to ramp up to the number of rigs that we had, for instance, in 2014. And another reason is because of the productivity by rig. If you could, look at Exhibit 20 showing that. But we've got a plan in place to be able to ramp up to maintain our efficiencies and more than likely continue to reduce our costs.","Doug Leggate - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","I appreciate the answer. Go on...","William R. Thomas - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","To answer your question on would we buy back shares, that's really not in our plans at this time. We're not opportunity limited. That's an important part of the process. And so geologically, we don't have an opportunity limit there. So we would ramp up appropriately to maintain the discipline and to reduce the debt at the same time.","Doug Leggate - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Bill, I appreciate the detailed answer. Hopefully my quick follow-up is just on the balance sheet. Clearly, there are going be some assets that maybe don't make it into the premium inventory. So as you've now made this permanent shift, rather than get specific, could you quantify for us? What impact on your base production do you think disposals could ultimately represent? Because obviously that would amplify the implied growth rate going forward. And I'll leave it there, thanks.","William R. Thomas - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Doug, on the oil growth rate, I don't believe it's going impact it significantly at all. The things that we've targeted this year are mostly gassy properties to sell. And as we go forward, they would either be kind of combo-ish or gas properties going forward. So on the oil growth, property sales shouldn't be a factor much at all.","Doug Leggate - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","I appreciate that. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Next is Pearce Hammond with Simmons.","Pearce Hammond - Simmons Piper Jaffray","Good morning and thanks for the helpful long-term plan. My first question is given the rise in completion activity, do you believe you have enough access to enough Texas-based finer sands, or will you need to use more of the white sands, potentially requiring you to reactivate your Wisconsin mines?","Lloyd W. Helms, Jr. - Executive Vice President, Exploration & Production","Pearce, we have both available to us. We've been working on our own Texas mines and plant and expanding there as far as our capability, as well as working on our Wisconsin plant, being able to reduce costs and put in place improved transportation. So we believe that we have adequate sand, and we believe we've been able to lower our sand cost as well, and we're seeing that helping our cost here in 2016. So we've got plenty of sand available. We feel like we've got most all of our resources available to us as well.","The thing that's really helped us during this downturn is we've been able to just continue increasing our efficiencies. And before, I probably mentioned that we thought that as far as our cost reductions, maybe two-thirds were sustainable. With what we've seen here from 2015 going to 2016, we've lowered our well cost in all of our areas somewhere 11% to 13%, and that's just through increased efficiencies. So those will go forward with us.","Pearce Hammond - Simmons Piper Jaffray","Thank you, Billy, very helpful. And then my follow-up. Bill, as you look at the non-premium inventory, big picture thought, does it make sense to divest more of it, or do you need to hold on to some of it and let technology catch up to that so you can move the acreage into the premium category? So I just want to get your big picture thoughts on how you view that non-premium inventory.","William R. Thomas - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, Pearce, I'll let Billy address that, Billy Helms.","Lloyd W. Helms, Jr. - Executive Vice President, Exploration & Production","Yes, Pearce. So in our inventory, as we continue to demonstrate, we can add more and more to our premium inventory. There's some of the inventory that may never make it to that. So we're looking at what options are best to bring that value forward, whether it's monetize that property or produce it out for a period of time or whatever the optionality is. We have a tremendous amount of flexibility. We haven't designated certain properties yet to be put on the market, but we'll just be opportunistic in that approach and evaluate each one independently. We haven't really considered any of those volumes, as Bill said, in our four-year or five-year plan. And so as he mentioned, they'll be mostly gas or gas combo-type plays, so that really won't affect oil production guidance any.","Pearce Hammond - Simmons Piper Jaffray","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll now go to Subash Chandra with Guggenheim.","Subash Chandra - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Good morning. So the question was, in creating these premium locations, do you find the best rock gets better, or are you equally successful in converting Tier 1\/Tier 2 rock to premium?","Lloyd W. Helms, Jr. - Executive Vice President, Exploration & Production","I think the rock quality is a very big driver on the premium, and the higher the quality of the rock, the better it responds to the technical advances we make in the completions. There's no question about that. So I think one of the things that's not clearly understood in the horizontal shale industry is that these sweet spots in these plays, especially in the oil plays, are not very large. So capturing the very highest quality rock is extremely important and certainly something that EOG has excelled in and focused on over the years, and it really is the biggest driver of productivity.","Subash Chandra - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Okay. My follow-up is, how many completion crews do you have active in your basins, and is there a rig count-to-completion crew ratio that we should think about?","Gary L. Thomas - Chief Operating Officer","This is Gary Thomas. We have now eight completion units running and we've got anywhere from 11 to 12 rigs, and that's a pretty good ratio as far as an average.","Subash Chandra - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Could you scale up the rig count without adding completion units materially?","Gary L. Thomas - Chief Operating Officer","We could, yes. It depends on where you add the rigs. If we added in the Eagle Ford, we would have to add fewer completion units, for instance, there. They're just so efficient after having operated there for the last seven or eight years.","Subash Chandra - Guggenheim Securities LLC","All right, thank you. Great quarter, thanks.","Operator","Ryan Todd with Deutsche Bank is next.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning, guys, maybe a couple points of clarity. Can you talk about \u2013 the incremental 50 wells drilled in 2016 and the 80 completions, does that involve any rig additions, or are you completing that with the existing rigs and crews that you have on hand?","Gary L. Thomas - Chief Operating Officer","This is Gary Thomas. What we've been able to do is just the tremendous efficiency improvements have allowed us to go ahead and do this with the same number of drilling rigs. We will be adding one or two completion units here through the second half to go ahead and take care of the 350 completions in this round. It's all being done within existing capital, planned capital.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","That's great, thanks. And then maybe as we look out over the next couple years, can you talk about the allocation of capital between the Eagle Ford and the Permian? As you look into 2017 and 2018, what's the expected split between capital going to each basin, and how will that change as you look forward over the next two or three years? And is that reflective of the relative rates of return between the two assets?","William R. Thomas - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","As we look into 2017 and forward, the capital will be \u2013 about 45% will be in the Eagle Ford, about 45% in the Delaware, and then about 10% in the Rockies. That's a rough balance between each one of those areas. Of course, the one we've increased capital most this year is in the Delaware Basin, and that will be increased again going forward. The rates of return that we're getting in the Delaware are just outstanding as the well results we've talked about today.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","So is it purely a rate of return driven exercise? The Delaware wells, have they risen to the top, or is it also a reflection of depth of inventory, infrastructure, things like that? Or is it just returns driven?","William R. Thomas - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","It's certainly returns driven, but I would say of those three areas, if we look at our current scorecard, the returns on all three of those areas are about equal. So it has to do with inventory and returns and of course, operational efficiency.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, thank you very much.","Operator","We'll go to Charles Meade with Johnson Rice.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Good morning, Bill, and to the rest of your team there.","William R. Thomas - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","I'd like to pick up on the theme that you mentioned a couple times in your remarks about improved capital efficiency. And certainly we're seeing that in spades today with you increasing your completed well count \u2013 or your completions by 30% and your wells drilled by 25% with the same CapEx. But I think I get the theme that this is really driven by your shift to premium drilling, and I'm looking at that left half of the slide five you have where you lay out your plans for the next few years. Is that ongoing shift to premium a fair weather vane to look at for how capital efficiency will continue to improve in 2017 and 2018, or is it the kind of thing that you think you've seen the beginnings and we shouldn't expect a whole lot more from this point forward?","William R. Thomas - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, that chart is very indicative of the way that capital efficiency goes. So I believe this year it's about 60% premium. Next year it's 81% premium. And then I think from 2018 forward it's 98%. So as we complete more premium wells each year, the capital efficiency will increase.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Got it, that's helpful. Thank you. And then if I could pick up on one of the big themes from last quarter, your Austin Chalk activity, I think I heard you mention that you're still excited about that play. Can you give us a sense? Are any of those locations in your premium count right now, perhaps under the overall Eagle Ford heading, or is this still in the exploration bucket waiting to be promoted somewhere down the road?","David W. Trice - Executive Vice President-Exploration & Production","Charles, this is David. As far as the Austin Chalk goes, like we mentioned last quarter, we're still delineating that play. So we're still intending to drill nine wells throughout our whole acreage position there. And currently, we don't have any Austin Chalk within our premium count, but that's clearly a potential for some upside there. Just like Bill had mentioned, one of the ways that we're going to add premium in the future is through exploration. So the wells that we've brought on, as we talked about last quarter, are clearly premium. So we're still excited about that play, but we need a little bit more data on it.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","That's helpful insight, thank you.","Operator","We'll go to Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you, good morning.","William R. Thomas - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Brian.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Bill, you've recently spoken a bit less on the topic of recovery rate. But given that you are increasing your premium inventory in part because of productivity gains and longer laterals, I wonder if you could provide an update on where you see recovery rates, particularly in the Delaware and Eagle Ford, and then the opportunity from here for further technology and productivity gains to increase resource in premium inventory and overall recoveries.","Lloyd W. Helms, Jr. - Executive Vice President, Exploration & Production","Brian, this is Billy Helms. On the recovery rates, we've gotten away from quoting what we think the overall recovery rate is by zone. But needless to say, it's improving. I think a large part of that, a very significant part of that is what Bill talked about earlier. It's understanding the rock, our shift to better define what targeting is, and then deploying our high-density completion process. It's really made a huge difference on the recovery rates. We really don't focus on what that recovery rate percentage is. It really doesn't help us understand our go-forward models on how these wells will perform. So it really hasn't been a focus for us, but that's the color I would give to you is that they're definitely improving with time.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks. Maybe I'll ask it in a slightly different way then, since you talked about the targeting and the enhanced completions specifically. What inning do you think we're in, in terms of the impact that those technological improvements are having on your productivity? Is there still a big gap? Even if you're not specific on the recovery rates, is there still a big gap where there's the opportunity for further use of these technologies to increase recovery? And are the benefits from targeting and enhanced completions fully baked into your premium resource and premium locations?","William R. Thomas - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Brian, this is Bill. The targeting, we started that I believe in the latter part of 2014, and it's really in different stages and different basins. In the Eagle Ford, it's more mature there. We're probably still in the sixth inning. I've been saying this for years, but we're probably still in the sixth inning there of understanding what is the best target and working it into our W patterns and our spacing patterns. So as we get more data, even in a very mature area like the Eagle Ford, we get more data. We continue to find out more about the rock and the section, and we're able to discriminate and pick better rock all the time. So it's an ongoing process even there.","In the Delaware Basin, we're probably in the second or third inning there. There's so much potential pay there, and we're still learning and we've got a lot of data to gather. As we drill the Delaware wells, we're focused on the Wolfcamp, particularly using those fantastic wells. But number two, you get to see all the Bone Spring sands and all the pays above you. And so you're gathering data as you drill these wells, and that helps with delineating targets and working the stratigraphy out in mapping. So each one of the plays is at a different position on improvements, but we think there's really a long way to go. We're not anywhere close to the end of being able to make additional improvements on that side of the business or on the cost side too. So it's an ongoing process and it's a very sustainable process.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great, thank you.","Operator","We'll go to Irene Haas with Wunderlich. Please go ahead.","Irene Oiyin Haas - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.","Following up on the Delaware Basin, your inventory count of about 2,130 wells, I'm curious as to \u2013 for the Wolfcamp. I think mostly in Wolfcamp A, and you're doing work on the deeper horizons. Are there more headroom to add locations without really adding more acreage?","David W. Trice - Executive Vice President-Exploration & Production","Irene, this is David. In the Wolfcamp, really what we've targeted mostly there, we've got several targets in the upper Wolfcamp, so there are quite a few premium targets. Like Bill mentioned earlier, we're still early in the Wolfcamp, so we still see quite a bit of upside there. But clearly from the data that we show, like on the chart seven in our investor book, we've made some big progress there. These are clearly premium wells. As we go forward, we're going to have the ability to drill more and more of them with longer laterals.","Irene Oiyin Haas - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.","A follow-up question, I was wondering. How far are you along with your database, how many wells you have inputted in your position targeting model? Do you use existing vertical wells, horizontal wells, and core samples? I'm just trying to get a feeling as to how much more data you might need to really nail it perfectly.","David W. Trice - Executive Vice President-Exploration & Production","There's a lot of industry data out there, legacy log data and everything that's helped us with that. But really what's going to drive it more than anything is, as we drill the wells and complete them and gather the data over time, you'll continue to see some improvement there. Just like you've seen, we never stop learning. We've continued to test the limits, and so I still think there's plenty of upside on the Wolfcamp.","Irene Oiyin Haas - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.","Great, thank you.","Operator","We'll now go to Bob Brackett with Bernstein Research.","Bob Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","I had a high-level question and then a follow-up. The high-level question is, it looks like you've added, say, 34% to your net locations, to premium, but the average EUR went up 75%. What's driving that?","William R. Thomas - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Really, Bob, it's just the combination of better rock and better completions, and now we're going to add longer laterals to that too. So the well results, the productivity of the well increase is just very, very large and incredible. I think once there's enough of this data out in the big databases where people can analyze it and compare EOG wells versus the industry or really any other operator drilling horizontal oil wells now, they're going be very, very surprised and very, very impressed.","We do have one chart in the slide deck that compares our Wolfcamp results to other operators. I believe it's slide number eight. So you might want to look at that, but the wells are just fantastic wells.","Bob Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. The follow-up is, could you talk a little about the process by which a location moves or gets blessed as premium? Is that done by the asset? Is it blessed by headquarters? Is it statistical, or is it sticks on a map?","William R. Thomas - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","It's a process that really is done in our division offices. So our decentralized culture that's focused on the details right there, they're evaluating the rock, driving the costs down at the same time, and executing on the wells. They know their properties the best, and they are constantly working. And they are so focused on improving returns and improving productivity and driving down cost. So they're really driving this whole thing, and it is an amazing performance that's going on.","Bob Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","And there's sticks on a map there. Those locations are known lat\/longs [latitude\/longitude]?","William R. Thomas - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Absolutely, yes. The well count are absolute sticks on a map. They all have a well name.","Bob Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Yes.","William R. Thomas - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So they're not like a spreadsheet.","Bob Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Great, thank you.","Operator","We'll go to Mike Scialla with Stifel.","Michael Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi, good morning. Bill, you said in your prepared remarks that the minimum 30% IRR for premium wells translates to a healthy corporate rate of return. Is there a minimum ROE you can equate that to, or does that necessarily translate to positive earnings?","William R. Thomas - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We picked the 30% because when you pull in our full-cost of capital, which would be infrastructure, land, G&G (53:22) and things like that, it usually draws the return down to maybe 15%. So we would like to have a minimum full-cost all-in call it capital cost rate of return of about 15%.","Michael Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay, thanks. And then, Billy, you mentioned in your prepared remarks you're seeing no degradation in productivity per foot with these longer lateral lengths. I guess is there anything specific there without giving away the trade secrets that you can talk about, maybe bigger casing size or something like that that's preventing that degradation in recoveries per foot with the long laterals? And I was wondering too, you mentioned the Eagle Ford and the Delaware, where you're going with the longer laterals. On the Eagle Ford side, is that really confined to the western portion of the play, or does it have any application in the east as well?","Lloyd W. Helms, Jr. - Executive Vice President, Exploration & Production","Mike, this is Billy Helms. So on the Eagle Ford, first of all, for both the Eagle Ford and the Delaware Basin, when we drill a longer lateral, we definitely want to make sure that we are maximizing the recovery. We're not losing efficiencies as we just drill longer laterals. So we've spent a lot of time \u2013 our operational groups have spent a tremendous amount of time trying to understand how to accomplish that. And the results we've seen so far have shown they've been very successful at maintaining that productivity per foot, especially when it results in \u2013 we're talking about EUR per foot mainly. Certainly, the initial production can somewhat be diluted a little bit just due to the longer laterals and flowing larger volumes up, restrictions on chokes and surface things, surface facilities. But the EUR per foot has been maintaining a pretty steady pace. So that's really encouraging.","Now, I won't get into exactly how we're doing that. We do feel like that that is an advancement we've made internally, and we want to keep that a little bit proprietary at this time. But on the Eagle Ford and the Delaware Basin, both of those are benefiting from that and will continue to benefit from that.","Michael Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","And in the Eagle Ford, is it really on the western side of the play, or does the east have any application?","Lloyd W. Helms, Jr. - Executive Vice President, Exploration & Production","Yes, probably more so on the western, but certainly the east side also has opportunities for that. But the east side also has a little bit more geological complexity that hampers that a little bit. But certainly, there are opportunities, and we'll find that where we can.","Michael Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great, thank you.","William R. Thomas - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I think we've got time for one more question.","Operator","Okay. Our final question today will come from Paul Sankey with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Hello, guys. Sorry, guys, just a quick one I'll add after all you said. I was asked this morning what would happen at $40 flat to all your assumptions? Thanks.","William R. Thomas - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Paul, at $40, we would adjust our capital appropriately, and we would be able to generate what we believe would be the best rates of return in the industry. That's certainly a big separator for EOG. But we would adjust our spending to cash flow and stay balanced and stay disciplined and hunker down and continue to improve. We are optimistic and we have hope, and we're not there yet, but at one day, we would be able to get our capital efficiency to a point where we could actually grow oil at $40, and we're working towards that goal. We're not there quite at the moment, but we're going to continue to focus on that. But our focus, of course, first, has always been on returns and capital discipline and keeping the company healthy in that regard.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","I've got the feeling it's just a couple of minutes and it's a long question, but could I just follow up? Could you walk us through the progression from the field level returns that you talked about after tax to the corporate level returns? I don't think anyone has asked that one, which is always a conundrum as it regards to U.S. E&P.","William R. Thomas - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, I did talk about that a little bit earlier. But we did put the benchmark of 30% rate of return on the direct side, which is the well cost only. We set that at that mark so that we would have room that when we put in full cost, that would be land and seismic and infrastructure, our capital rate of return, not ROCE or ROE, but our capital investment rates of return would be about 15%. Now that walks down \u2013 it's a long process, but that walks down to ROE and ROCE. But the ROE and ROCE are trailing metrics. And it takes years to get your base production to the point where it reflects the returns that you're currently drilling. So it's a long process; it takes several years to get there.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","It's the top of the hour, I'll leave it there. Thank you.","Operator","And at this time, I'd like to turn the conference back to Mr. Bill Thomas for any additional or closing remarks.","William R. Thomas - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, I'm going to ask Gary Thomas to add some remarks on our progress on cost reduction and where we see that headed.","Gary L. Thomas - Chief Operating Officer","It goes along with the last question there, and also, yes, us being competitive on the world market as it requires that we really be disciplined in spending and that we just continue to work our costs down. And that is, yes, through just all the primary efficiencies we've mentioned earlier with us having the top rigs. And you'll note too that we had quite a number of our rigs in 2016 under contracts placed a couple years ago, higher rates, $26,000 and $27,000 a rig. Now those are rolling off, and we're going to be able to replace those, about half those rigs with rates that are in the $13,000 to $15,000 per day rate. So that allows drilling costs to be down about 20% \u2013 25%.","Our tubulars, we depleted their inventory here early 2017. And with the arrangements we have in place, that will allow those costs to go down in the 20% to 25%. With our sand, as I mentioned earlier, we've reduced our production costs, optimized the transportation, just all of those sorts of things that allow us to reduce sand cost by about 15%.","Same with rigs, we had many of our frac fleets under long-term contract. Half those are going away, which will allow us then to bring in the lower frac rates. We've continued to improve completion efficiency with faster completions, wireline run times, just our stage arrangements. The water infrastructure has continued to be enhanced, and it allows us to reduce our water costs. Our wellhead inventory, it's somewhat depleted, and that will allow us to reduce those costs in the 25% range. So all of this, and that probably accounts to 50% to 60% of our well cost, allows us to further reduce well cost here going into 2017.","Yes, we are s pleased with the vendor help, service providers. We've got the top rigs, the top frac equipment. It's a fast-changing technology, so we're glad not to have ownership but just to work and partner with these service providers to have outstanding service at competitive prices. They're not always the same providers, but they're the best and the most cost effective in our arena.","And the other thing is that our rig efficiency has improved such that, yes, we will not have to have the number of rigs we had back in 2013 and 2015. As a matter of fact, when we look at our 10% growth and our 20% growth, we think we'll be able to provide this sort of growth running somewhere between 25 rigs to 35 rigs. The number of frac plates we'll then require with the efficiency we're seeing are going to be in the 15 to 20 frac plates running for us, and that's on a compound average growth or increased rates. By the time we get to 2020, we're talking, yes, that's the 35 rigs on the 20% growth.","So yes, the downturn has allowed EOG just to enhance our overall operations. Our divisions are performing especially well, continuing to lower our costs. And during the ramp up we would expect the same because if we look back and see what has been done by EOG in the period that we were growing volumes, the 30% to 40%, we will continue lowering our well cost, improving our efficiencies. And we expect our divisions to continue to do the same, especially with all the ideas we have now for further reduction. Thank you, Bill.","William R. Thomas - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I'd like to end this conference by saying thank you to all of the EOG team. The EOG employees are focused on returns and they're performing at an extremely high level, and we could not be more proud of each one of them. So we look forward to the days ahead. So thank you for listening and thank you for your support.","Operator","Thank you very much. That does conclude our conference for today. I'd like to thank everyone for your participation."],"8355":["EOG Resources, Inc. (NYSE:EOG) Q2 2013 Earnings Conference Call August  7, 2013  9:00 AM ET","Executives","Mark G.

As a reminder, this call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to the Executive Chairman of the Board, Mr. Mark Papa. Please go ahead, sir.","Mark G. Papa","Good morning and thanks for joining us. We hope everyone has seen the press release announcing second quarter 2013 earnings and operational results. This conference call includes forward-looking statements. The risks associated with forward-looking statements have been outlined in the earnings release and EOG\u2019s SEC filings, and we incorporate those by reference for this call.","This conference call also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation schedules for these non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures can be found on our website at www.eogresources.com.","The SEC permits oil and gas companies in their filings with the SEC to disclose not only proved reserves, but also probable reserves as well as possible reserves. Some of the reserve estimates on this conference call and webcast may include potential reserves or other estimated reserves not necessarily calculated in accordance with or contemplated by the SEC's latest reserve reporting guidelines. We incorporate by reference the cautionary note to U.S. investors that appears at the bottom of our press release and Investor Relations page of our website.","With me this morning are Bill Thomas, President and CEO; Gary Thomas, COO; W. Helms, Executive VP, Exploration and Production; Tim Driggers, Vice President and CFO; and Maire Baldwin, Vice President, Investor Relations. An updated IR presentation was posted to our website yesterday evening, and we included third quarter and full-year guidance in yesterday\u2019s press release.","This morning we\u2019ll discuss topics in the following order. I\u2019ll first discuss second quarter net income and discretionary cash flow, then Bill Thomas will review operational results. Tim Driggers will then discuss financials and capital structure. Finally, I\u2019ll cover our macro view, hedge position, and concluding remarks.","As outlined in our press release, for the second quarter 2013, EOG reported net income of $659.7 million, or $2.42 per share. For investors who focus on non-GAAP net income, to eliminate mark-to-market impacts and certain non-recurring items as outlined in the press release, EOG\u2019s second quarter 2013 adjusted net income was $573.8 million, or $2.10 per share. For investors who follow the practice of industry analysts who focus on non-GAAP discretionary cash flow, EOG\u2019s DCF for the second quarter was $1.9 billion.","Similar to the first quarter, EOG continue to hit on all cylinders in the second quarter. Our oil volumes considerably exceeded guidance, our unit cost beat guidance and EOG\u2019s realized domestic oil prices were at a significant premium to WTI. As a result of our exceptional performance in the first half of the year, we\u2019ve raised our full-year oil growth estimate from 28% to 35%, reflecting total organic growth of 55,000 barrels of oil per-day year-over-year.","We\u2019ve increased our NGL growth estimate from 10% to 14% and we\u2019ve increased our total company overall growth target from 4% to 7.5%. The oil growth target increase is emanating primarily from the Eagle Ford, with contributions from the Bakken and Delaware Basin. The impact of our domestic onshore oil portfolio in the high rate of return Eagle Ford, Bakken and Leonard is showing up in the bottom line as demonstrated by our first and second quarter EPS results, which will show up as a stronger full-year ROEs and ROCs.","On the previous earnings call, we outlined our five-year plan where we expect to continue to achieve the highest and most profitable oil growth rate of any large cap independent, through 2017 and this quarter\u2019s results or another building block in that plan.","I\u2019ll now turn it over to Bill Thomas to discuss specific operational results. Before I do, I want to congratulate Bill on this new role as CEO. He has been with the Company for over 34 years and knows the assets inside and out. This makes him well qualified to deliver on a five-year plan and guide the Company for many years beyond that.","William R. Thomas","Thanks, Mark. I will start with our second quarter 2013 Eagle Ford results. EOG\u2019s Eagle Ford acreage continues to prove that it\u2019s the premier horizontal oil position in North America. During the second quarter, we consistently completed strong growth in both the Eastern and Western portions of our acreage that drove our record production results.","In addition, drilling and completion improvements continue to drive down oil costs. As a result, we\u2019ve the lower, the average completed well costs in the Eagle Ford from 6 million to 5.5 million and increased the number of wells we plan to drill this year from 425 to 440. Fine tuning this engine with continuous cost reduction and improved well productivity makes EOG\u2019s Eagle Ford acreage the strongest oil growth and capital return machine in North America. And the best part is we have a 12-year drilling inventory on this play that will provide many years of oil growth and superior capital returns.","In our Western acreage, we\u2019ve drilled a large number of wells allowing us to fine tune our completion technology. We are now making oils with rate of return that are approaching wells drilled in the Eastern part of our acreage. In La Salle County, The Keller number 1H and 2H had initial daily production rates of 1,855 barrels of oil and 2,050 barrels of oil with 590 and 400 Mcf per day of rich gas respectively.","The Smart number 1H and 2H began production at 1,495 and 2,030 barrels of oil per day with 480 and 610 Mcf per day of rich gas respectively. In McMullen County, the Naylor Jones B number 1H started production with 1,830 barrels of oil per day and 1,920 Mcf per day of rich gas. EOG has 100% working interest in each of these wells.","To show how wells have improved on our Western acreage, the updated IR presentation includes slides that show well IPs marching upward as a result of better frac techniques and longer laterals. As an example, slide number 21 shows that the Keller and Smart Unit wells drilled in 2013 are 30% better than offset wells drilled in 2012. In addition to making better wells we are driving down well cost through efficiencies.","Slide number 22 shows spud to TD drilling days continued to drop with wells in 2013 down to less than 10 days. As a result, our 2013 well cost has decreased by $1 million per well in certain areas from 2012 levels. With the combination of improved well productivity and cost reduction, our Western drilling activity now has an average direct a-tax rate of return in the 100% range, on par with many of the wells in the East.","In the East, we again set a new record with the completion of the Burrow Unit number 5H which had an initial production rate of 7,515 barrels of oil per day and 6,880 Mcf per day of rich gas. Consistently the number one driver for better wells in all areas is improved by techniques and that's the case for the Burrow 5H.","Also in the East, we completed the Wilde Trust number 1H, number 2H and number 3H wells with initial rates of 5,475, 6,520 and 5,525 barrels of oil per day with 7,040, 5,690 and 6,200 Mcf per day of rich gas, respectively. We have 100% working interest in each of these wells.","The takeaways from our second quarter Eagle Ford results are; number one, EOG continues to make significant improvements in well productivity and cost reductions in both the Eastern and Western portions of our acreage. Number two, EOG's drilling results from a large number of wells in our Western acreage confirms that the Western part of the play can deliver high direct capital rates of return and strong production growth.","Number three, our large number of high quality drilling locations in the Eagle Ford gives EOG the platform to have superior oil growth for many years to come. In the Bakken Core, our 160-acre or four wells per unit down spacing program in the Parshall field and Mountrail County, North Dakota is yielding impressive results. Recent completions include the Parshall 22-3032H and 25-3032H with initial production rates at 2,120 and 2,685 barrels of oil per day with 505 and 945 Mcf of gas per day, respectively.","We also completed the Van Hook 29-1113H and 30-1113H producing 2,390 and 2,295 barrels of oil per day with 2.0 and 1.1 million cubic feet of gas per day, respectively. EOG has a 62% working interest in the Parshall wells and a 78% working interest in the Van Hook wells. We are very pleased with year-to-date down spacing results that show excellent progress in both well productivity and cost reduction.","We've added some new slides in our IR presentation showing these operational improvements. There is a slide showing EOG's improved well productivity in the Core and Antelope areas over time. This improvement is a result of drilling longer laterals and using better frac techniques. The average EUR from our 2013 program is 940 mboe per well growth, more than a 180% improvement over wells we were drilling only two years ago.","To control costs at lateral length's increase, we've been able to reduce 2013 drilling plans on an average 10,000 foot lateral to 16.9 days, which is a 30% decrease compared to 2012 levels. As a result of better wells with lower costs, our year-to-date 2013 Bakken program is generating direct a-tax rates of returns of 100%.","As we have said previously, the majority of the 53 net wells drilled this year will be down spaced with the goal of maximizing the net present value of this large EOG asset. Based on further evaluation of Three Forks potential on our acreage and the success of our Bakken down spacing program, we have increased our total Bakken\/Three Forks drilling inventory from 7 to 12 years. The takeaway is our Bakken\/Three Forks asset is another segment of EOG's crude oil inventory that will provide high margin production growth for many years to come.","In the Delaware Basin, we continued to see improved results from both our Leonard and Wolfcamp plays. During the second quarter we completed three outstanding wells in the Leonard. And Lea County, New Mexico, the Diamond 31 Fed Com number 2H, number 3H and number 4H began producing at 1,780, 1,905 and 1,530 barrels of oil per day plus 215, 165 and 150 barrels of NGL per day and 1,200, 910 and 835 Mcf of gas per day, respectively. EOG has a 91% working interest in each of these wells.","We've continued to make strong improvements in both well productivity and cost reduction and our year-to-date drilling results have a direct a-tax rate of return in excess of 100%. This makes the Leonard one of EOG's top return plays. The returns are competitive with those of Eagle Ford and the Bakken. As a reminder, we have approximately 1,600 Leonard well locations in our current drilling inventory. With these excellent returns we plan to shift more capital to this play in the future.","In the Delaware Wolfcamp, we completed our fourth well in the second quarter, drilled in the Wolfcamp's sweet spot of Reeves County, Texas, the Phillips State 56 301H was completed in the upper Wolfcamp interval, blowing 870 barrels of oil per day with 570 barrels of NGL per day and 3.7 million cubic feet of gas per day. We have 100% working interest in this well. The Phillips State is our best well to-date in this play and it builds on our confidence that the Delaware Basin Wolfcamp is a high quality shale play.","We now have a combined data base of 200 subsurface wells in our acreage along with access to full core rock data, micro-seismic frac data, 3-D seismic data and four recently completed horizontal wells that confirm the strength of the play with a direct a-tax rate of return of 60% and over 1,100 drilling locations in our current inventory, the Delaware Wolfcamp is another strong asset in EOG's portfolio. Since this is a newer play with infrastructure constraints and newer leases, our development activity will be slower relative to the Leonard.","In summary, EOG's Delaware Basin, Leonard and Wolfcamp positions are located in the sweet spot of two very strong horizontal shale plays. Using that conservative recovery factor, we have roughly 2,700 drilling locations with 1.3 billion barrels equivalent of net reserve potential that we can develop at very high capital investment returns. The Delaware Basin plays are another reason that EOG will continue to have significant production growth for many years in the future.","During the second quarter, we continue to test multiple play intervals and spacing patterns in the Midland Basin Wolfcamp. In Crockett County, the University 40-C #1705H, #1706H and the #1707H were completed in the middle zone with initial rates of 1130, 725 and 1070 barrels of oil per day plus 1010, 98, and 75 barrels of NGL per day and 800, 636 and 545 Mcf of gas per day respectively. EOG has a 90% working interest in each of these wells. We also completed another excellent well in Irion County in the lower pay with the University 40, #1002H which had an initial rate of 1110 barrels of oil per day plus 155 barrels of NGL per day and 115 Mcf of gas per day. The Company has a 75% working interest in this well.","As we had discussed previously, the Midland Basin Wolfcamp play is more technically and economically challenging than the Delaware play. We\u2019re using extensive micro seismic and 3D seismic tools to improve the completion effectiveness and reduce the well spacing in order to improve the recovery factor. We are making steady progress. In the Barnett Combo after more than 10 years in this area we still continue to drive down drilling days and average well cost, and improve well productivity. Recent wells include the 100% working interest Madison A unit #1H and 2H and Madison B unit # 1H with initial production rates were 430, 435 and 335 barrels of oil per day. With 340, 330 and 240 Mcf of rich gas per day respectively.","We drilled the Madison wells, from the spud to TD in an average of four days with a total completed cost of only $2.4 million per well. Low cost along with consistently good wells continues to give EOG solid 30% to 40% direct a-tax rate of returns on this program. In Trinidad, we brought the Osprey OA-4 well online last month at 30 million cubic feet of gas per day rate. We\u2019re in the process of completing an additional four wells to increase our overall deliverability. In the East Irish sea the start up of our Conwy oil project is now estimated for mid 2014.","I\u2019ll now turn it over to Tim Driggers to discuss financials and capital structure.","Timothy K. Driggers","Thanks Will. Capitalized interest for the quarter was $11.8 million. For the second quarter 2013, total cash exploration and development expenditures were $1.7 billion, excluding asset retirement obligations. In addition, expenditures for gathering systems, processing plants, and other property plant and equipment were $91.3 million.","As compared to second quarter 2012, total cash expenditures decreased by $278 million. There were $2.6 million of acquisitions during the quarter. During the second quarter net cash provided by operating activities exceeded financing and investing cash outflows in fact we were cash flow positive during the quarter excluding any pro savings from asset sales.","Through August 1, we closed on asset sales of approximately $580 million. At the end of June 2013, total debt outstanding was $6.3 billion, and the debt to total capitalization ratio was 31%. At June 30, we had $1.2 billion of cash on hand, giving us non-GAAP net debt of $5.1 billion or net debt to total cap ratio of 26%. The reductions in the year end 2012 ratio of 29%. The effective tax rate for the second quarter was 36%, and the deferred tax ratio was 77%.","Yesterday, we included a guidance table with the earnings press release for the third quarter and full-year 2013. Our original CapEx estimate of $7.0 billion to $7.2 billion excluding acquisitions remains unchanged. For the third quarter, the effective tax rate is estimated to be 30% to 40%. For the full-year, the effective tax rate is estimated to be 35% to 45%. We\u2019ve also provided an estimated range of the dollar amounts of current taxes that we expect to record during the third quarter and for the full-year.","Now I\u2019ll turn it over to Mark.","Mark G. Papa","Thanks Tim. Now I\u2019ll provide some views regarding the macro environment, hedging, crude by rail and the concluding remarks. Regarding oil, we\u2019re hesitant to provide any short range WTI price predictions considering the volatility we\u2019ve seen over the past months. We note that recent monthly EIA data is consistent with our expectation that 2013 year-over-year domestic oil growth will be less than 2012. We expect EOG\u2019s oil growth performance will be atypical of the industry as other companies with poor quality acreage or plays struggle to grow at rates similar to EOG. We believe the U.S. oil production will continue to grow in future years but at slower rates than 2012 and this is bullish that the global supply and demand picture. Additionally we\u2019re not sanguine regarding any large international shale oil plays affecting global supply within at least the next several years. Overall we continue to be bullish regarding oil fundamentals and prices.","For the remainder of 2013 we\u2019re approximately 53% hedged at $98.82 and we have approximately 98,000 barrels per day hedged for the first half of 2014 at $96.48. Because the NYMEX is severely backward dated we currently have only a very small hedge for the second half of 2014. These numbers exclude options that are exercisable by our counterparties. Regarding North American gas prices we consider 2013 to be another and long string of disciplinary years and we expect gas supply to continue to trump demand causing continued weakness over the next several years. Our gas hedge position is unchanged from last quarter. We also expect NGL prices especially ethane to remain weak throughout 2014. Our crude by rail again was a very profitable piece of business for us in the second quarter and our average U.S. well head price was $9.50 over WTI.","We expect the premium over the index to decrease in the second half of the year due to the number of new pipelines to the Gulf Coast Louisiana markets but we see sustained high oil prices. Our third quarter projected average U.S. oil price is $2.75 above WTI. The offset is WTI prices have increased over the course of the year particularly in recent weeks. The net effect is EOG is still receiving a premium to hire overall U.S. oil prices. To provide some understanding of our oil net backs I\u2019ll briefly describe our current crude marketing in our three major areas. In the Eagle Ford majority of the oil is piped to Houston where it currently receives LOS index prices. In the Bakken essentially all of our oil is being railed to St. James, Louisiana and in the Permian part of our oil is being railed to St. James and partly sold locally. We have the flexibility to sell any of our rail volumes at Cushing instead of St. James if differentials dictate that is more profitable.","I\u2019ll now briefly address our 2013 business plan which is consistent with what we outlined on the February and May calls except for the 2013 volume growth increases. As Tim mentioned, we still expect CapEx excluding acquisitions to be between $7.0 billion and $7.2 billion and proceeds from dispositions to date are $580 million. Effective this quarter on a unit cost basis we reduced our full-year LOE and DD&A estimates. We still don\u2019t plan to drill any dry gas wells this year and we continued to have zero interest in growing gas volumes in a current price environment.","Now let me conclude, there are three important takeaways from this call. First, EOG\u2019s first and second quarter results are the result of having the best acreage in the premier, domestic shale oil plays and the best in-house completion technology. Simply put our average 2013 Eagle Ford, Bakken and Leonard well is performing better than predicted. This is particularly true of our Western Eagle Ford wells. Our current acreage will position us as an industry oil growth leader for many years to come.","Second, the vast majority of our CapEx this year is going into three plays currently yielding greater than 100% direct after-tax reinvestment rate of return; the Eagle Ford, Bakken and Leonard. Each of these has 10 plus years of additional drilling inventory. EOG has a track record of execution. Our seven-year compound annual oil growth rate is 38%. ","This high return domestic onshore oil growth we're achieving isn't just for growth sake. What's significant is that EOG's production growth is showing up in the bottom line with first half non-GAAP net income up 69% year-over-year driving increasing ROEs and ROCEs. Finally, as is evident by our results, EOG is firing on all cylinders; volumes, unit cost, price realizations, returns and net debt reduction.","Thanks for listening. Now we'll go to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. The question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. (Operator Instructions). We'll take our first question from Leo Mariani with RBC.","Leo Mariani - RBC Capital","Hi, guys.","Mark G. Papa","Hi, Leo. How are you?","Leo Mariani - RBC Capital","Great. Great results here. Just a question on the Western Eagle Ford. Obviously as you guys have moved West, it just seems like the results have certainly surpassed your expectations. I think you guys last update on sort of the Eagle Ford average EURs and it was 450,000 boe. Do you guys think that that has got some upward bias here given the strength as you've moved out of your core area?","Mark G. Papa","Yeah, Leo, I'll let Bill answer that but I think the number is 400 boe is the last update we've given on that, so that's the number that we're sticking with at this point. But let me have Bill address that.","William R. Thomas","No, you're right. I mean that's what we have talked about extensively here is that our Western Eagle Ford results are just like in all of our plays. I mean they are coming up really, really nicely. The main driver for that of course is the completion technology and the cost reduction too goes along with that, but the most important factor in improving the wells is the use of EOG sand. That has been a major factor in improving our wells. And so it also helps us to drive down the well cost and we're certainly watching the per well EURs and the Eagle Ford as we go along here. The thing that we're not going to do is we're not going to rush to change the EURs on a per well basis really until we complete the down spacing program in the Eagle Ford. And we're still actively down spacing both in the East and the West side of the Eagle Ford. And so while we continue to push wells closer together, we want to be careful about that per well EUR and we want to make sure we have enough time to evaluate the long-term effects of the wells on those tight spacing patterns. So, we're going to hold firm with that 400 in boe per well for now.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Pearce Hammond with Simmons & Co.","Pearce Hammond - Simmons & Company","Good morning and congratulations on another exceptional quarter. Our EOG's EUR improvements in the Bakken is highlighted on slide 26 in your presentation. Is that applicable to your Bakken light acreage as well?","William R. Thomas","Yes, Pearce, that is. That's a common thing that we completed a few wells in other areas in the Core and Antelope and we've seen excellent results from the new completion techniques in all of our areas. So it would apply across the board. Of course, everybody realizes our Core acreage and our Antelope acreage is the high quality acreage, so the EURs and the other areas might not be as good but certainly the completion techniques are very effective in all of the Bakken.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs","Thank you. Good morning.","Mark G. Papa","Hi, Brian.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs","Wanted to just follow-up on the Eagle Ford here and wanted to see if you could characterize the remaining locations that you have to drill in the Eagle Ford and the quality of those locations, whether it's meaningfully different from those that have been drilling in the last year? And whether you're seeing decline rates that are in line that are worst that your type curve? And I guess there were issues along with whether sand supply and sand supply cost will continue to kind of be available to support the remaining inventory I would think or would all those be key towards your ability to someday raise that EUR?","Mark G. Papa","No, I'd say that our remaining inventory in the Eagle Ford is pretty analogous to what we've drilled so far this year. As far as the sand supply issue, that's definitely not a problem. We have our in-house sand mine, so the sand supply issue is really off the table. There's not a question at all there. I know there have been some questions about our theory that some people have had about us is as we moved West in the Eagle Ford, the quality of our inventory was alleged to deteriorate but I think the one thing that results of this earnings call should dispel is the fact that our inventory in the West is pretty darn strong and we've always had a mix of East to West. We've never preferentially drilled in one area per se. So I think the concern people should have as we drill in later years in Eagle Ford that the rate of change in the Eagle Ford is going to somehow decline, that's just not true and that's why we've been talking so much about this five-year plan of why we are so confident that our oil growth during that period is going to be superior to all other large cap E&Ps because we have the engines of growth with Eagle Ford, the Bakken and the stuff we had in the Permian. And when you think about it, we've got a seven-year run with 38% compound annual oil growth which I'm pretty sure is much stronger than any other company certainly in our peer group and we're telling you the next five years is going to be much stronger than the peer group. And certainly if you look at our first and second quarter results, that's just certainly underpinning that confidence. So we feel very, very good by this and the second quarter data should dispel any notions anyone should have about the range of change in the Eagle Ford being a concern.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Good morning, Mark, and good morning everybody. Mark, first of all, congratulations in your transition. It seems that the quarter hasn't really suffered for it, but if I may ask a question about down spacing in the Eagle Ford. You've talked about 40 in the East and 60 in the West, but it seems from these well results in the West that at least you should be asking the question about how you see the inventory and the down spacing results going forward. Can you speak to whether or not you're continuing to test tighter spacing and what your latest thinking is there? And then I've got a follow-up please.","Mark G. Papa","Yeah, Doug. Yeah, we are continuing to test down spacing in both the Eastern portions of our Eagle Ford acreage and the Western portions of that. And we're going to continue to push that, but we\u2019ve always had is to maximize the net present value of the asset and we really approach that from on a per acre basis. So, as we drive the oil cost down and we push the wells closer together on a spacing pattern, the goal is to maximize the net present value there. And we\u2019re not sure if we reach those limits or not. We\u2019ve been able to improve the net present value over time considerably with both cost reduction and well improvements and certainly that corresponds into additional reserve recovery which we increased several times. So, the process continues in all areas. The completion technology continues to advance and we\u2019re not letting up on that and the cost reductions continues to advance, the increase in the recovery factor that continues to advance and all of that is focused on the net present value of the asset. So everything is moving ahead.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Matt Portillo with Tudor Pickering & Holt.","Matthew Portillo - Tudor Pickering & Holt","Good morning, guys. Just one quick question for me, you mentioned rail marketing and the relative net backs of LLS versus Cushing pricing on pipe and I was just curious if you could provide a little bit more color given the current spread dynamics of how you guys are thinking about railing versus piping crude out of the Bakken and how those economics may change over time? Thank you.","Mark G. Papa","Yeah, what we can say is that because relating to our crude there really isn\u2019t a pipeline option. I mean, the only pipeline is up there is the Enbridge pipeline and we\u2019ve very limited access to the Enbridge pipeline, and so our pragmatic options up there would be trucking the crude versus railing the crude and it\u2019s a slam-dunk there. So for us, railing the crude is the only way to go, so then it just boils down to the \u2013 do you bring the crude to Cushing or do you bring it to St. James and so far for us with a differentials were they sit today, its still preferential for us to take at the St. James versus Cushing and \u2013 but we have that option if and when the advantage would flip the other way to take it the Cushing or one of the few companies who do \u2013 would have a rail option of either place if and when that became advantageous. Next question.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Irene Haas with Wunderlich Securities.","Irene Haas - Wunderlich Securities","Hi. Again congratulations on just doing such a great science and turning out really new place year after year and my question is to do Reeves County and the four wells that you\u2019ve drilled thus far, I can see sort of the percentage of oil actually marching out with your newer wells, so it was looking like sort of 40% oil. Can you shed a little light on when all is said and done, sort of what is your EUR composed of in terms of percent, oil, natural gas, liquid and gas?","William R. Thomas","Yes, Irene, we\u2019ve a slide on that with a pie chart. I believe that is slide 31. And our latest estimate here is that on the typical Wolfcamp well its 34% oil, 34% gas and 33% NGL and we found that the percent oil is a little variable depending on what zone you\u2019re drilling in the Wolfcamp, and so we\u2019re testing multiple zones there. Of course, there is an enormous amount of resource in place there, our Reeves County we\u2019ve been fortunate to be able to lease-up a very strong sweep spot in the Delaware Basin with Wolfcamp where the shale thickness is very thick and also the quality of the shale is very hot. So, we\u2019ll get a better handle I think, we\u2019re going to drill 10 wells this year approximately and we\u2019ll be trying multiple zones there and I think that some time later in the year, I mean by next year we\u2019ll have a little bit better idea kind of what the balance will be on the content of everything. But right now we feel like this 34% oil is probably going to be pretty close to what its going to be.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Amir Arif with Stifel.","Amir Arif - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning, guys. Congratulations on a great quarter. The question really is about your positive free cash flow position that you\u2019re going to start hitting in \u201914. I know you lay out through different priorities, but could you just give us some more color in terms of how you\u2019re thinking how useful that excess free cash flow in terms of excess above of steady dividend growth? How much would go to incremental capital spending and the follow-up would be on the incremental capital that you would allocate? How would you think about splitting that between your three core areas of Eagle Ford, Bakken and Permian? Thanks.","William R. Thomas","Yeah Amir, that\u2019s a good question. We are going to have a lot of cash and certainly the priority is we set out and we\u2019ve given these guidelines as we continue to work on the dividend. We\u2019ve had a nice 14 year increases in dividends and so we want to continue that and reward the shareholders in that way. We also want to focus some of the money, the second priority would be to continuing to reduce the debt of the Company, not to the extremely low levels, but a bit lower than where we\u2019re right now. And then number three, we\u2019ll have additional cash each year to invest in our best place. And certainly the highest rate of return plays will be the priority there and the places where we can invest to grow oil prices \u2013 oil production most aggressively and those will not be much different than they\u2019re this year. That will be certainly the focus number one will be the Eagle Ford and the Bakken and as we \u2013 as over time, we\u2019ll be focusing more capital into the Leonard. It\u2019s turning into the very high rate of return play for us and very oily also. So, each of those plays have more 10 years of inventory in their extremely high quality plays and that\u2019s what gives us the confidence that we can continue to be the peer leader in oil growth through 2017 and beyond.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Arun Jayaram from Credit Suisse.","Arun Jayaram - Credit Suisse","Good morning gentlemen. I just wanted to ask you a couple of quick questions. One Bill, I was just wanted to see if you\u2019ve done any analysis on maybe stratifying the wells drilled on Eagle Ford looking at some of the monster wells versus perhaps some more typical well and any general comments on decline rates you\u2019re seeing over the first year what not relative to both of those?","William R. Thomas","Yeah, Arun. The stratigraphy of the Eagle Ford is pretty consistent from east to west. There\u2019s not a lot of individual zones developing and coming and going as you kind of go across the play. Some of the changes are I think in the eastern part of the acreage, there\u2019s more faulting and so there is more open fracture systems available and that\u2019s why you see sometimes you see very high IPs from the wells in the east. On the west side there is less faulting, and less open fracture systems and so it takes a little bit of a different completion technique which we obviously \u2013 we\u2019re making very good progress with that and maybe the IPs may not ever approach the wells on the east but certainly the results in the west are very, very good. We have been able to develop techniques to increase the amount of rock that reconnect to the wells. One of it is, we drilled longer laterals in the west and we used a different kind of completion style and all that\u2019s designed to connect up to the more of the matrix of the rock and so we\u2019re certainly getting really good results in both areas and both areas as Mark has said we have an enormous amount of locations in both sides and so the quality of our program is certainly not going to deteriorate over time. It's very, very, very strong.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Marshall Carver with Heikkinen Energy Advisors.","Marshall Carver - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","Yes, good morning. A question on the Bakken. You have 90,000 acres in the Bakken Core. How many acres do you have in the Antelope Extension, State Line and Elm Coulee areas?","William R. Thomas","Again, Marshall, it's a question \u2013 we've not updated our acreage position in Antelope or the Core but you're right, we have 90,000 acres in the Core and this is an estimation that I think is approximately about 20,000 acres in the Antelope area.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Barry Haimes with Sage Asset Management.","Barry Haimes - Sage Asset Management","Hi. Thanks for getting my question in. I had a question in the Bakken. I understand and you alluded to longer lateral lengths and changing completion techniques a couple of times in the call. And I guess in the Bakken you've drilled a few wells with maybe 15,000 foot laterals and maybe four or five times the amount of (indiscernible). I wonder when you're talking about the different completion techniques, is that what you were alluding to? Number one. And then number two, how applicable is that across the Bakken and then maybe also in the Eagle Ford? Thanks very much.","Mark G. Papa","Yeah, in the Bakken we feel we have a completion advantage there and we're happy to disclose that we're using more pounds of (indiscernible) than we have in the past and that we are drilling longer laterals. But as far as giving any more specifics other than that, we feel we'd be giving away some proprietary secrets and so I'm afraid, Barry, we're just going to have to leave it at that. And the same for the Eagle Ford; we have gone to some bigger fracs in the Eagle Ford than we have in the past but again, we feel we clearly have a proprietary advantage in our frac technology in the Eagle Ford also and we just assume to keep it proprietary. Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Ray Deacon with Brean Capital.","Raymond Deacon - Brean Capital","Hi. Good morning. I was wondering if you could give a little bit more detail on the Wolfcamp, how many of each zone do you think you will have tested this year.","William R. Thomas","Yeah, Ray, in the Delaware \u2013 are you talking about the Delaware Wolfcamp? I guess so. Yeah, in the Delaware Wolfcamp, Ray, we've tested three zones this year, call them the upper, middle and lower zone there and we've had really good results in each one of them. As I said before there's a little bit of different mix in each zone, on the product mix whether it's oil or gas but the rock quality and the response of the wells on each one of those have been very, very, very strong. So, we feel that we've been very fortunate to lease up a really nice large position of the sweet spot there.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Charles Meade with Johnson Rice.","Charles Meade - Johnson Rice","Good morning and thank you for taking my question. I wanted to get a little more detail on the Burrow Unit and particularly I believe it was the 5H or perhaps it was the 4H that had that really fabulous IP. But the one thing that I noticed was a little different that you guys offered the 30-day average and you get to a 30-day cumulative of I think 128,000 barrels which is really impressive. And would I be wrong to read into that that the reason that you guys choose to include that 30-day rate is that it's better than other wells in the past? And that if that's correct to read into it, is that a function of your improved fracture line?","William R. Thomas","The Burrows did have a longer lateral. It's about 7,500 foot lateral. The other two are quite a bit shorter. But as far as us reporting cumulative, it's relative to other wells. It's not proportionally any larger at all, performing about the same, just longer lateral.","Operator","At this time, I'd like to turn it back to our speakers for any closing or additional remarks.","Mark G. Papa","Yeah, I'd just close with two remarks, just again to summarize I think two points you want to take away from the call. First point is, again the Western Eagle Ford is an area that we're particularly proud of with the results. And the second point is for the first time we can highlight three key oil plays on a direct after-tax rate of return basis. In each of these plays, we're achieving 100% or greater rate of return; Eagle Ford, Bakken and Leonard. So thanks for listening and we'll talk again in three months from now.","Operator","This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation."]}}
