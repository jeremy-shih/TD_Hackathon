Your lines have been placed on listen-only until the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Today's call is being recorded and will be archived at www.pepsico.com.","It is now my pleasure to introduce Mr. Jamie Caulfield, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Caulfield, you may begin.","Jamie Caulfield","Thank you and good morning. Joining me on the call today are Indra Nooyi, PepsiCo's Chairman and CEO; and Hugh Johnston, PepsiCo's CFO. We'll lead off the call this morning with prepared remarks, and then turn to Q&A. ","As we begin the call, it's important to note the following. We will make forward-looking statements on this call. Any forward-looking statement inherently involves risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from current predictions and expectations. Information on such risks can be found in today's earnings release and our most recent Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings. In addition, we will discuss results using non-GAAP measures and you can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations on our web site under the Investors section in the Events and Presentations tab.","Beginning with the third quarter of 2015, PepsiCo will realign certain of its reportable segments as you saw in this morning's press release. And within the next 30 days, PepsiCo expects to provide reclassified summary segment reporting for 2013 and 2014 and the first two quarters of 2015 to reflect the company's new structure.","And now it's my pleasure to introduce Indra Nooyi.","Indra Nooyi","Thank you, Jamie, and good morning everyone. We are very pleased with our performance in the quarter. Organic revenue grew 5.1%, with Global Snacks up 8% and Global Beverages up 2%. Core gross margin improved 115 basis points. Core constant currency operating profit grew 8% and core constant currency EPS grew 11%.","Based on the strength of the quarter, our overall first half results and our outlook for the remainder of the year, we are increasing our full year of core constant currency 2015 EPS growth outlook to 8%.","Our businesses are performing well, both in the top line and bottom line. PepsiCo America's beverages had an outstanding quarter. 3% organic revenue growth translated to 10% core currency operating profit growth.","Frito-Lay North America delivered another quarter of very strong results, with organic revenue up 3% and core constant currency operating profit up 7%. And our developing and emerging markets delivered 11% organic growth in the quarter, revenue growth, despite the ongoing volatility in many regions of the world.","Looking across some of our key D&E markets, our businesses continue to prove resilient. Turkey and Saudi Arabia achieved double digit organic revenue growth. China, Egypt and the Philippines achieved high single digit organic revenue growth and Mexico achieved mid-single digit organic revenue growth.","Now I assume you have had a chance to read the release this morning. So rather than go through the numbers in detail by segment or country, what we will do in this call and going forward is to give you an update and provide a bit more detail on each of our big initiatives to drive performance, namely innovation supported by sensible brand management, flawless execution, self-sustaining productivity, prudent capital allocation, and talent renewal in management. But today we will focus primarily on innovation and touch briefly on the others. And on future calls, we will highlight one of each of the other initiatives.","So let me begin with innovation. Our innovation success today is the result of significant investments in and changes to our innovation research and development capabilities and processes that began about eight years ago. At that time, we were in an extremely decentralized organization, operating as a loose confederation of geographic business units, with each largely driving its own development agenda and establishing their own processes. Development is focused largely on product line extension, and that structure, while effective in its time, led to less efficient use of resources with redundant projects often being undertaken in different parts of the world and suboptimal resource allocation to the most promising ideas.","As a result, much of our innovation lacked staying power. In part, this had to do with the quality of our innovation, but it also had to do with our inability to appropriately incubate innovation in the marketplace. And to address these opportunities, we undertook a major transformation to improve our R&D function and innovation capabilities. Specifically, we established global category groups charged with coordinating global innovation. This resulted in a more focused innovation agenda, a greater emphasis on development platforms, rather than product line extensions only, and more efficient allocation of development resources, as we have significantly reduced redundant efforts through better coordination.","Two, we globally adopted the proprietary Demand Moments framework, originally developed at Frito-Lay North America. The framework focuses on the triggers of consumption by examining consumer needs based on the context of the occasion. This created much stronger linkage between consumer and shopper insights in the R&D functions, and has led to our innovation being more incremental to top line growth. ","Three, we implemented a common discipline-staged gear process to gain better visibility into multiyear pipeline of R&D projects, to allocate resources to the most promising ideas and new platforms, and to ensure a better balance of refresh, reframe and breakthrough innovation.","Four, to facilitate more rapid lift and shift of our more successful innovation launches from one market to another. We provided our businesses with better visibility into new products and their performance around the globe.","Five, we increased our investment in R&D starting in 2008. In fact, from 2011 to 2014 alone, our investment in R&D has increased almost 40%.","Next, more recently, we established a design capability, capped at world class design talent. Increasingly, they are involving design in the early stages of innovation, taking into account the entire purchase to consumption cycle, to create truly memorable experiences for our consumers.","And lastly, we are using reverse engineering, leveraging our learnings and developing in emerging markets, to yield the benefits of thinking more holistically about low cost design of new products, packaging and equipment, without sacrificing quality.","We are pleased with the progress we have made across all these fronts and the tangible results we see. Innovation as a percentage of total revenue reached 9% in 2014, an improvement of over 150 basis points compared to two years ago.","Three, PepsiCo products received the 2015 Nielsen Breakthrough Innovation Awards. This award recognizes the most successful and enduring new CPG products launched in the U.S. in 2013. PepsiCo was the only company to receive multiple awards this year. And over the past three years, we have introduced a number of new products that have achieved or are on pace to achieve more than $100 million each in annual retail sales, including Tostitos Cantina, Mountain Dew Kickstart, Doritos-Cheetos fun multipack mix, and Gatorade Fierce Blue Cherry and Frost Glacier Cherry.","More recently, we are successfully using premium innovation within key categories to capture more price realization, to relaunch Caleb's Kola and launched DEWshine, a craft premium soda inspired by Mountain Dew's brand roots in the backwoods of Tennessee.","We are also innovating in packaging, capitalizing on the success of our consumer engaging, Lay's Do Us A Flavor campaign. We launched Lay's Summer Days campaign, encouraging fans to create custom digital packs of Lay's potato chips, featuring photos of your favorite summer moments to share with friends and family on social media.","Adding excitement to this experience, 10,000 lucky fans will receive a real life customized bag of Lay's Classic Potato Chips, featuring the photo they digitally submitted, offering consumers personalized packaging for the first time in the brand's history.","We are also capitalizing on consumer health and wellness demand. As consumers are embracing almond milk and other plant-based proteins as an alternative to traditional dairy milk, Naked Juice has launched two new nut milks, Berry Almond Nut Milk and Peachy Almond Nut Milk. And in Quaker Foods North America, our new Quick Cook Steel Cut innovation has propelled us to the number one market position in the on-trend and growing Steel Cut Oatmeal segment by making preparation much more convenient.","Channel focus innovation is advancing our food service business. We are launching a new line of craft soft drinks called Stubborn Soda in fountain this summer. The Stubborn lineup includes unique and contemporary takes on traditional craft flavors. Flavors include Black Cherry Tarragon, Lemon Berry Acai, Agave Vanilla Cream, and Pineapple Cream. They contain no high fructose corn syrup and are made with fair trade certified cane sugar and natural flavors. And of course we have continued to refresh and reframe our key brands to maintain a high level of consumer engagement and excitement.","Now innovation has also contributed to good market share performance in the second quarter in the United States, and I believe our results are impressive. We held LRB value share, while delivering strong net price realizations. We gained value share across important subcategories, including sports drinks and ready-to-drink tea. Gatorade share of sports drinks surpassed 80%. Mountain Dew gained 40 basis points of value share within the CSD category in Q2. in fact, if you add Kickstart, DEWshine and Baja and Sangrita Blast together, it represents more than two points of CSD value share in the most recent four week period, placing our recent Mountain Dew innovation by itself as a fourth largest flavored CSD behind base Mountain Dew, Dr. Pepper and Sprite.","In Q2, we grew retail sales in measured channels in the U.S. For regular colas and Mountain Dew within CSD, for Gatorade, Lipton Tea and Naked Juice within our non-carb portfolio. And at Frito-Lay we have a value share in savory snacks, and in Quaker Foods, we gained value share in key categories, hot and ready-to-eat cereals, while expanding gross margin and stepping up advertising and marketing at the same time.","And our innovation is driving growth for our retail partners as well. In the second quarter, PepsiCo was once again the largest contributor to U.S. retail sales growth among all food and beverage manufacturers, with over $400 million of retail sales growth in all major channels. This was more than two times the next largest contributor to growth, and represented more growth than the next 14 largest manufacturers combined. Notably, North American beverages was a key driver of U.S. retail sales growth within PepsiCo, and the largest contributor to U.S. retail sales growth on a standalone basis.","Our intention is to continue to invest in innovation, build upon our already strong capability base and further sharpen our holistic innovation process to drive greater growth for our customers, create compelling products for our consumers and ultimately, increase the contribution of new products to our total revenue. So that's the story on innovation.","Turning now to execution; we have ramped up our execution focus across the value chain from seed to shelf. We have established clear consistent performance metrics to track and benchmark the effectiveness and efficiency of every one of our core value driving activities, from safety to manufacturing utilization to transport efficiency to promotional display execution.","You know, execution is a never ending journey, as there will always be an opportunity to raise the game of the below average performance, be it at manufacturing lines [ph] or DSD routes. But we are seeing solid execution and steady improvement across the enterprise, and this is translating to good market based performance and financial results.","Turning now to productivity and disciplined capital allocation. As you know, we have a goal of delivering $5 billion in productivity savings over five years from 2015 to 2019, which is approximately $1 billion per year. Our current program follows a similarly aggressive three-year $3 billion program that we successfully concluded in 2014, and overall our productivity initiatives are driving meaningful results.","Over the three years ending in 2014, despite adverse ForEx, we've realized a $1 billion of annual productivity savings, net revenue per employee is up 10% and EBIT per employee is up 9%. And since 2012, gross margins have consistently expanded. Similarly, our capital allocation discipline is yielding meaningful results. From year end 2011 to the second quarter of 2015, net CapEx as a percentage of net revenue has improved from 4.9% to 4.1% on a rolling four quarter basis, and this 80 basis point reduction equates to approximately $500 million in incremental annual free cash flow. And since 2012, through the second quarter of 2015, core net ROIC has improved by 310 basis points to 18.4% on a rolling four quarter basis.","And finally, people renewal and development; this is an area that I and the board spend a lot of time on. Our focus is twofold here; making sure we have the right leaders in place today, and that we are developing the next two generations of leadership for the company. And as all of you know, good talent management does not happen in short burst. It requires taking a long term view and very detailed analytical planning.","As a core of our people renewal and management plan, we have to focus on the 200 critical leadership roles in our company. These are the roles that are most important to our success, and that provides the greatest experiential development for our executives. For each of these roles, we have developed a pipeline that ensures that we have at least one immediate successive candidate; two people in a one to three year timeframe; and then another three people ready, four to six years out.","As a result of this process, we are deliberately developing top talent, by giving them multiple category, geography and job experiences and ensuring we have well developed succession plan.","The other priority we have is ensuring that we have the right balance of home grown talent, that we augment our talent pool from time to time, with exceptional executives that we recruit from outside the company, and I believe our plans are working. When we have had executive transitions, both planned and unplanned, they have been smooth and well coordinated. And as we look at our current leadership, you will find that executive have had very broad critical experiences within PepsiCo over many years across functions geographies and categories, people like Tom Greco, Al Carey, Sanjeev Chadha, Ramon Laguarta and Hugh Johnston. And folks that we brought into PepsiCo later in their careers to augment our skill base and stretch our thinking. People like Mehmood Khan, Laxman Narsimhan, and Tony West.","And we are grooming our next generation of leadership, by giving them critical experiences. People like Mike Spano, who runs our China operations; or Eugene Willemsen and Brian Newman, whose promotions we announced last night.","So to conclude, we are pleased with our financial performance for the first half of 2015, and with the progress we have made across our valued driving initiatives. Clearly, there are a number of macro challenges around the world, but we believe we have the right strategies and programs in place, to enable us to continue to navigate successfully through the current environment. The construction of our product and geographic portfolios enable us to continue to deliver strong results. In part, because our balanced portfolio creates a natural hedge against the global macro and political volatility that has become the new normal. And all of this bolsters our confidence in our ability to continue to achieve our financial target.","So with that, let me turn the call over to Hugh.","Hugh Johnston","Great, thank you, Indra and good morning everyone. Turning directly to guidance; as Indra mentioned, based on the strength of our first half results and our outlook for the remainder of the year, we have increased our full year core constant currency EPS growth target to 8% from 7% previously. Our other targets remain unchanged.","For the full year 2015, we continue to expect mid-single digit organic revenue growth, core operating margin expansion as organic top line growth, and productivity, should offset negative geographic mix and commodity inflation, which incorporates the impact of transaction related foreign exchange headwinds, and approximately $1 billion of productivity settings.","Below the division operating line, we continue to expect corporate costs to be lower, a core tax rate of approximately 25%, and a reduced share count. We expect foreign exchange translation to negatively impact net revenue and core earnings per share growth by approximately nine and 11 percentage points respectively, based on current market consensus rates. Our outlook for the year assumes translation of our VIM [ph] as well the results, at the SICAD rate of 12.8 bolivars per U.S. dollar. Should circumstances dictate use of a higher rate, this would also negatively impact our U.S. dollar results. Taking our 2014 core EPS of $4.63 and applying our guidance in current market consensus of foreign exchange impact, implies 2015 core EPS of approximately $4.49. ","As you model up the third quarter, I'd ask you to consider the following; foreign exchange translation should have an approximate 11 point unfavorable impact on the third quarter net revenue growth and approximately 12 point unfavorable impact on third quarter core EPS growth, based on current market consensus rates. And we expect the profit decline in QFNA, as we left last year's gain on the sale of the cereal business.","Below the division Operating Profit line, net interest expense is expected to continue to increase in the third quarter versus last year, driven by higher interest rates and net debt balances, and our tax rate in the third quarter is expected to be higher than the third quarter of 2014.","From a cash flow perspective, we continue to expect full year free cash flow of more than $7 billion. We expect our capital allocation discipline to continue to drive core ROIC improvement. This is building on the steady progress we have made in ROIC, with core net ROIC up 310 basis points from 2012 to 18.4% through the second quarter of 2015 on a rolling four quarter basis. And consistent with prior outlook, we expect to return between approximately $8.5 billion and $9 billion to shareholders in 2015, through both dividends and share repurchases.","As a reminder, our previously announced 7% dividend per share increase, commenced with the June payment. Our annualized dividend is now $2.81, an approximate 60% payout ratio based on 2014 core EPS. This represents the 43rd consecutive year of annual dividend increases and our annualized dividends per share have grown at 10% compound annual rate over the past 10 years.","So to summarize; our core constant currency earnings per share outlook for 2015 has improved from our last call, and free cash flow, disciplined capital allocation and returning cash to our shareholders remain top priorities for the company.","With that operator, we will take the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of John Faucher of JP Morgan.","John Faucher","Thanks. Good morning.","Indra Nooyi","Good morning John.","John Faucher","Good morning Indra. Two quick questions here; one, can you just give us a little bit of the rationale in terms of the merger at the Latin American Food and Beverage businesses? I just sort of -- the regions -- need to manage the regions? And then secondly, can you talk a little bit about the Frito volume, which was a little bit light relative to trends? Anything in particular going on there? Thanks.","Indra Nooyi","Let me talk a bit about the Latin American merger. We have seen success in Europe and AMEA with all of the power of one management of those regions. We are able to get more productivity takeout costs, and especially with volatile economies, we have to get more and more agile and more creative about how to take out costs. And its not just costs within our system, John; I think even with our bottling partners, there is an opportunity to cooperate and figure out how not to duplicate efforts between the two companies. And we are seeing those initiatives pay off in AMEA and Europe, and we decided now is the time to do it in Latin America.","We are in the middle of a major productivity program in Latin American Foods, and integrating Latin American beverages with foods, gives us that much more of a cost base to work with.","Lastly, given the volatility of those economies there, I think it's very important to really become a lean mean machine there, in order to take the sales and reinvest it to grow the top line. So that's Latin America.","Second is on the Frito volume. Again, we watched the Frito performance very carefully as does Tom Greco and the Frito team. In our potato chip business, we were going through a revenue management program, and that revenue management program is actually yielding good revenue growth, and improving topline growth and profitability for our retailers. And one of the results of the revenue management program is that, it is going to impact volume, because the price-backed [ph] architecture shifts some of the volume to certain bag sizes, which impacts volume in the short term. But over the long term, it\u2019s the right thing for the business. So I'd let it play out through the balance of the year, then look at our results in 2016.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane of Bank of America.","Bryan Spillane","Hi, good morning everyone.","Indra Nooyi","Good morning Bryan.","Bryan Spillane","Just two quick ones; first, in terms of exchange rate, Hugh, you mentioned Venezuela; and if you were to move to the SIMADI rate, what would the impact for that be on the year, and how will that affect the guidance that you have given for currencies?","Indra Nooyi","I mean, Hugh is going to take that.","Hugh Johnston","Yeah. Happy to do that, Bryan. As you all know, we have provided pretty extensive disclosures in our 10-Qs and 10-K on the question. In the Q that we intend to file after today's market close and consistent with past Qs, you will see that Venezuela represents approximately 2% of our revenue and operating profit. We also have net monetary assets of approximately $335 million, and non-monetary assets of approximately $725 million.","Now, if we were to take all of that and go to SIMADI, Venezuela would then represent 0% or very slightly above 0% of our revenue and operating profits. So it's roughly a 2% hit on both revenue and operating profit. We have a charge of approximately $325 million related to the net monetary assets. It will also likely lead to an impairment of our non-monetary assets.","Now the one thing for investors to consider on this is, from an economic standpoint, this really would not represent a big impact on PepsiCo, given that Venezuela is largely a self-sufficient, self-funding operation. We are not putting any capital to speak of in the country, and we have not been able to redeploy any of our Venezuela cash outside of Venezuela. So from the perspective of cash flow and cash management, it would not have a meaningful impact on cash returns.","Bryan Spillane","So that 2% effect on operating income though would be above and beyond the guidance that you have given this morning, in terms of the 11% currency hit to EPS for the year, is that right?","Hugh Johnston","That's correct. Right now, what we are assuming for the balance of year on Venezuela is 12.8, because that was the recent SICAD option, which was a pretty robust option. But if we did make the move to SIMADI, the impact would be that much more significant.","Bryan Spillane","Okay. And then just one other question I guess, thinking about the back half of the year. Just seems like, the first half has come in better than expected, and with organic sales at mid-single digits, it seems like there has just been a better operating leverage here, or again, the currency neutral operating profit has been better. So in the second half, why -- just some higher level thoughts in terms of why that doesn't continue in the second half? Is there something you are seeing on the commodity cost front? Is the flow of productivity savings? Just something that sort of raises that flag for the back half of the year, that you won't continue to kind of see the current growth? Thank you.","Hugh Johnston","I think there is three things I'd remind you of in that regard, Bryan. Number one, the back half lapse, particularly Q4 -- both Q3 and Q4 are more challenging than the first half overlap. So we are certainly facing more of an uphill for growth in the back half of the growth. Number two, you are correct, commodities are more of a headwind in the back half of the year than they were in the first half of the year. And number three, again recall, certainly based on what we are seeing in the news these days, the world remains a very volatile place. We have big businesses in the Middle East; we have big businesses in Russia. And as we model things out, we obviously try to ensure that we give investors appropriate guidance, at least incorporating some of that volatility. So we are not assuming the perfect sunny day going forward as well.","So that's what goes into our thinking, as you look at the so-called squeeze chart between the first half and the second half of the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Schmitz of Deutsche Bank.","Bill Schmitz","Hi, good morning.","Indra Nooyi","Good morning.","Bill Schmitz","Couple of questions. The first one is, is there a price war going on in snacks, especially in the U.K.? because I look at some of the market share trends, it seems like the categories are in a lot of pressure, and Pringles and Kelloggs are getting pretty aggressive. I know it's not a huge business, but I just wonder, how far that travels across Europe, and what the competitive response has been? And I have a follow-up.","Indra Nooyi","I wouldn't call it a price war. I just think that the retail environment in the U.K. remains interesting. There is -- the high street retailers are going through their own set of challenges. You have got the entry of the discounters. All of that is closing. The entire competitive situation in the U.K. to be reset. And being one of the major food and beverage companies in the U.K. and the largest salty snack company in the U.K., I think we have to be careful how we make our transition with the high street retailers and the discounters.","And so in the short term, we did lose some share. But we have plans in place to recover that share and somehow navigate through these retail environment changes. Again Bill, I tell you, around the world, as we see major changes in the retail environment, always in the short term, there will be some dislocation, because we have to make changes in the business model very-very carefully.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Marshall of Barclays.","Bill Marshall","Hey, good morning.","Indra Nooyi","Good morning.","Bill Marshall","I am just curious. So the syndicated data in June across a lot of categories looked a little tough. I think most have come to the conclusion that may be that was a little bit weather related. I am curious, if you could update us on what you are seeing in the market, and then specifically if you had any comments, kind of into the July 4th Holiday, how both of your beverage and snacks portfolio as we are doing on a volume and price perspective?","Indra Nooyi","I think from our perspective, our numbers look fine. I mean, we have got good price utilization. There were some weather related issues in some parts of the country. But I think overall, we are feeling pretty good about our results.","Hugh Johnston","Absolutely Bill. To some degree, I think there is some bifurcation between what's happening in the center of the store, and what's happening on the perimeter. But from the perspective of the categories we participate in, with the exception of center of the store, where we saw Quaker category slow down a little bit; most of our categories are robust and saw pretty good growth across the quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Grundy of Jefferies.","Kevin Grundy","Hey, good morning.","Indra Nooyi","Good morning Kevin.","Kevin Grundy","So two quick ones for you. First with respect to North American carbonated soft drinks and broadly in the industry. And given the recent pricing discipline which has taken hold, my question is, given this dynamic, how materially does this change your view, with respect to North American carbonated soft drink profit pool, and do you see mid-single digit growth now, as sort of more sustainable here looking out, not just this year, but longer term? And then as sort of a follow-up speaking with North American beverages, can you give us an update Indra, on Diet Pepsi and the change to the formulation there your competitors are not following? And how you're thinking about that, how you're defining success there with that product? Thank you.","Indra Nooyi","In terms of the North American CSD pricing -- look, we have been talking about disciplined pricing for a long time; I'd say couple of years. I am glad that there is disciplined pricing in the marketplace right now. And there is lot more innovations in the market basically from our end. And look, we are going to keep playing our game; we are going to focus on disciplined pricing, good revenue management, put CSD innovation out in the marketplace. And ultimately, it depends on the competitive situation, what the profit pool is in this whole CSD business, or the North American beverage business in totality. But we believe this is the right way to participate and play in this very-very important and large segment.","In terms of Diet Pepsi; big business. And I think for some reason which we cannot really explain, as with the Enchilada [ph] flavor with some consumers. And from our perspective, we just want to make sure we have an offering for all of the consumers who want to switch out of aspartame. And we have formulated a very-very good product, which is aspartame free, and will be available in the market starting in late August. So for all of those consumers who are looking for an alternative, to an aspartame sweetened diet product, we will have a product. And for those consumers, who still love Diet Pepsi with aspartame, we will figure out how to make it available online. So I think, this is a consumer driven strategy to offer all of the Diet lovers, a diet cola that's aspartame free.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rob Ottenstein of Evercore.","Rob Ottenstein","Great. Thank you very much.","Indra Nooyi","Good morning.","Rob Ottenstein","Very impressive introductions on the innovation front and progress there. So wondering if you could give us a little bit more granularity on the impact to the topline, both in terms of volume and price mix that you're getting from innovation?","Indra Nooyi","I'd say that, innovation has allowed us to get lot more price mix -- pricing realization in particular. Something that's very-very important in today's environment. And its -- product packaging process innovation, but we are also spending a lot of time on revenue management. I mean, really thinking through portion sizes, pack sizes, and I think this combination of interesting products coming to the marketplace and interesting packages in interesting combinations of packages, it's what's resulting in incrementality on the revenue side and actually resulting in higher profit flowthrough. And we are seeing it across carbonated soft drinks, I mean, whether its DEWshine or Baja Blast or any of those products, and we are seeing it even in Europe and Russia and Latin America and AMEA, where I'd say, creative revenue management tactics, coupled with innovation that cuts through the clutter is resulting in flow-through to the bottom line.","Again, I think in these environments, the focus should be on revenue and profit, not necessarily on volume growth. We focus more on unit growth, revenue and profit in these environments, because a change for volume, results in the whole business hurting. So I think the revenue management unit growth, value growth, and profit is what we focus on, and that's what our innovation efforts are yielding today, the almost 10%, I think the high 9s are innovation performances. Something that is a significant step-up, and we keep watching that metric very-very carefully.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Caroline Levy of CLSA.","Caroline Levy","Good morning. Thank you.","Indra Nooyi","Good morning Caroline.","Caroline Levy","Good morning Indra. Question on the -- it is actually talk of Russia putting an advertising ban I guess on sugar drinks and fatty foods and things like that. And in the context of that, I am just wondering, if you see increased regulatory risk to your food or beverage business around the globe, and what you think the impact might be, for example, in Russia, and how you would handle that?","Indra Nooyi","Caroline, we were among the first people to recognize this risk, and we have been retooling our portfolio, to make sure that, first of all we have a diverse portfolio that can weather any sort of action on any part of our portfolio. But we are also in constructive conversations with governments, to make sure there aren't any discriminatory taxes or discriminatory action on any of our categories.","Having said that, on Russia in particular, it is perhaps the most diverse portfolio of any part of our company between berry and juices and ranks ranging from fun-for-you to good-for-you, and beverages. This is actually a small portion of our business in Russia. And so if you want to use an example of the most diverse portfolio of doing fun-for-you, better-for-you and good-for-you is skewing towards good-for-you, I think it's our Russia portfolio.","So we feel good about Russia so far, and we all wish there weren't any geopolitical issues to deal with from a Russian perspective, but our business is doing well, and the economy has been good to us, and the Russian business environment has been good for us. So we like it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Swartzberg of Stifel.","Mark Swartzberg","Morning Indra, Morning Hugh. I was wondering if we could talk a little bit more about procurement specifically in that larger $5 billion productivity aim. Can you give us a bit of an update on -- to what extent that number is included in the $5 billion and how you're leveraging your global scale. And whether if at all, these changes in the reporting structure, particularly Latin America, have any influence on how you go after procurement savings of the global entity?","Indra Nooyi","Hugh, go ahead.","Hugh Johnston","Yeah, I am happy to take that one Mark. The entity question is actually quite straightforward. We don't include procurement savings as a part of productivity. Productivity is focused on the operating cost structure, not on the commodity and procurement cost structure. The way we report procurement savings is, we share with you all a net commodity inflation number, so that includes gross commodity inflation, less whatever we can do in terms of managing, what we call value engineering, so managing our commodities to a lower cost through more efficient packaging, trading different types of juices, and things like that. So the $5 billion number does not include any savings from procurement at all. That's all captured in net commodity inflation.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Powers of UBS.","Steve Powers","Yes hi, good morning. I was actually hoping you could just talk us through personnel and segmentation decisions that you announced alongside today's results. Obviously, congrats to you Hugh, but could you maybe also provide a little more color on the other people movements that were highlighted, and then also a bit broader window into your thinking on the resegmentation? I think it makes sense to bring Latin America in line with Europe and Asia, as you have mentioned, an increased visibility into North American beverages is welcome, at least from my perspective. But I love your broader perspective on it as well. Thanks.","Indra Nooyi","Steve, I will tell you, one of the things we did some time ago, is really sit back from the world and say, how should we think about groups of countries and clusters of operations that make sense? And based on all the work we did, basically the world broke out into eight clusters\\; North America is cluster one, Western Europe is the next developed market with cluster two; three was Latin America; four was Russia and East Europe; five is Middle East and North Africa; cluster six was the Indian subcontinent; seven was China and the whole Pacific Rim; and cluster 8 was Sub-Sahara Africa. So those were the eight clusters.","And North America is so big, that grouping it together and not providing visibility into the pieces didn't make sense. So we have kept North America separate in terms of North American beverages and Frito-Lay and Quaker being so different. But all other clusters, we just cleaned it up. Cluster three is Latin America, we put it together, and Sub-Sahara Africa, we had the snacks business of South Africa and Simba reporting into Europe, and beverages reporting to our Asia and Middle East sector, we just cleaned it up.","So the segment changes that we reported, were a clean-up of these clusters, so that we can think of cluster strategies. So that's the first one, and more and more strategic thinking and designs of the future are based on how do we establish and grow our positions in each of these clusters. And more importantly, how do we get more productive working across our partners within each of the clusters. That's what we have been focused on. So the last two got cleaned up.","In terms of personnel changes, as I talked to you earlier in my strips, talent management is something that the board and I are focused on a lot. I mean, our phenomenal board, spends a lot of time thinking through succession for the top couple of hundred jobs. And one of the things we always looked at is, where is that bright talent across the company that should be lifted up, so that they can be part of a succession process in the company. And every time we get an opportunity, we figure out ways to lift them up, in order to stretch people, in order to really build exciting talent for the future, and that's what the most recent changes enabled us to do.","And just to give you an idea, let me start with Brian Newman, and I have worked with Brian now for 20 years, off and on. Brian started in corporate strategy, but then went to China, he went to Russia, he went to Spain, worked in European headquarters. Went to Canada, was the Treasurer of the Pepsi Bottling Group, and both Hugh and I have been mentoring him now for 20 years, Hugh? And now giving him this job with operations coupled with corporate strategy, allows him to get a whole perspective of the company across snacks and beverages, even though he has worked in it for a while. And here is a person that speaks Mandarin Chinese, speaks multiple other languages, and just a very great executive to lift up. And we are looking for opportunities to do that, and with the departure of Anderson, gave us that opportunity.","And Eugene likewise, he has been running the key partnership, but again a Dutch national who has worked in multiple countries, and truly global executive. Travels, 60%, 70% of his time in every part of the world. I remember, when he was running Turkey, he started to learn Turkish. Everywhere he goes, he becomes a national. And again a very exciting executive; and you will all get a chance to see these people in action, as we move along. And all of the people we are elevating, whether it's Laxman who is now going to be running Latin America. Ramon has got additional responsibilities in Europe. Sanjeev was running a gigantic geography. You will see all of them over the next few quarters. And of course you all know Al Carey and Tom Greco and Hugh very-very well.","So I think that you will find that, what PepsiCo is doing is, just reinforcing the fact that they are a talent academy. And any company that's looking for talent always relates PepsiCo. So we have to constantly make sure that our best and brightest move up, and we keep them engaged and excited about the company. And that's my job, and the job of the board, and that's what we are doing.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.","Judy Hong","Thank you. Good morning.","Indra Nooyi","Good morning Judy.","Judy Hong","So I had two questions. One, Indra, its just really more of a longer term kind of strategy questions as you think about your global snack business. You obviously have a very good business there, but in a world where skill is becoming increasingly important and you have got other macro-snacking categories that perhaps you may not be participating as actively, how do you think about accelerating really top line, as well as the profit growth, as you think about the global snack platform? It's really looking at integrated beverage and snack nationally is the answer, or can you really do something more with the platform?","And then second question is, just really talking about your global e-commerce effort. It's not an easy opportunity for CPG companies, so can you just give us some perspectives on what efforts you have made already, and what are some of the opportunities as you think about over the next few years?","Indra Nooyi","Sure Judy. Interesting question, because I think in global snacks, we are in an interesting position; because our base is savory snacks, and we are a very-very strong player in savory snacks.","First of all globally, we still have a lot of growth within savory snacks. We came from a salty crisp snack background, and we are expanding more and more into other savory snacks, be it crackers, be it nuts and seeds, we are expanding into those areas, there is lot of opportunity there. I see growth in global snacks along two dimensions. Dimension one is, a compliment to our snack, and that's what made us go into dips, because many of our snacks are consumed by themselves. Other times, your snacks serve as sort of a substrate upon which you can put on meal like products like our Sabra hummus or our Tostitos dips. So that's one vector to grow, and we still haven't scratched the surface, and we have got lots of growth.","The other area is taking away eating occasions from other macro-snacks category. Its interesting, unlike beverages, in the case of snacks, we can go off and take eating occasions from other macro-snacks, be it cookies, or confectionery or chocolate. And our goal is to focus on what we are doing, but looking at our signs of demand spaces, which I talked about briefly, look at each eating occasion by cohort group, and figure out, how we can leverage our salty snack platform, to go after other macro snacks, be it -- replace it with a salty occasion, or do some sort of a salty-sweet combination, for example Stacy's with cinnamon sugar. It's based on a pita chip, but it's certainly sweet when you taste it, and has a much better mouth feel and experience, than if you eat something totally sweet by itself. At least, that's my perspective.","So I think that, our growth is all about growing the core and then leveraging all of the other eating occasions, taking share away from other macro snacks, and other savory snacks.","In addition, I think it's leveraging the beverage occasion to really figure out how to go into all retail outlets that beverages are in already; because beverages retail outlet, our penetration is much higher than snacks. And so if you leverage that retail base, it gives you lot more opportunities for growth.","And internationally, we are leveraging in-store promotional displays a lot more. I mean, I was in the Middle East a few months ago, and I was just amazed to see the in-store display of Lay's and Pepsi; and again, with the shares of Pepsi that we have there, it is really a powerful in-store promotion that results in tremendous lifts. So the opportunities for growth, by itself and in combination with beverages, are pretty significant.","So with that, let me turn to Hugh to talk about global e-commerce, because he is the leader of the global e-commerce activity. Hugh?","Hugh Johnston","Okay. Thank you, Indra. I mean, global e-commerce to talk about in two minutes, is a bit of a challenge to say the least. I guess, I'd make just a couple of quick comments to start the dialog on that.","Number one, global e-commerce can mean so many things, anywhere from just changing the way the product is ordered and picked, the so-called click-and-collect model, where people order online and then go pick up products at their local retail outlet, all the way through to in China, where the product is delivered significantly to door and in more and more proportions of the overall spend. Clearly, one of the leading areas, to the U.K., where you see retailers also doing a lot more delivery to the store, all the way through to new emerging players like the Blue Aprons of the world, who are actually sort of designing meal solutions, in effect filling demand moments for consumers by giving them an entire pre-packaged meal, which you see in some urban markets in the U.S. and starting to expand outside the U.S. as well.","From the perspective of PepsiCo, we are looking at it two ways. Number one is, the existing products going through the existing channels, either current retailers or the traditional online retailers. And then second really, looking hard at demand moments and designing products that fit the e-commerce types of distribution channels and e-commerce types of consumers in a more tailored way. So that's sort of a very brief view towards what's happening in the e-commerce world. The biggest opportunity obviously is to be able to have more of a one-on-one relationship with those consumers than we have ever had in the past, through traditional linear TV advertising.","I expect you will see a lot more from us in this regard, but that's probably the best two minutes that I can give in terms of what it is that we are doing right now.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ali Dibadj of Bernstein.","Ali Dibadj","Hey guys.","Indra Nooyi","Hey Ali.","Ali Dibadj","Hi. Wanted a thought on volume versus price question that we heard about FLNA about, but wanted to hear more about Europe, and what really was driving that and if we are seeing any end in sight in terms of slower volumes there is the first question, in Europe specifically? And then the second one is, if you could help us, I guess, give some quantification for the buckets where the remaining cost cutting will be coming from? What the buckets are, how much? And if we were to talk to your employees at this point, would we hear any concerns that you are cutting too deeply into the organization from a cost perspective?","Indra Nooyi","Let me take the first one Ali. The thing I'd tell you is, Europe is a difficult economy, between east and the west, there is some sort of volatility there all the time. I think today, year-to-date, we are the best performing European CPG company, based on all the numbers we have looked at. If you combine east and west, or whether you look at them individually, both on the top line and the profit performance, we are performing the best.","The challenge in Europe is, especially with Russia there, the high street battle in U.K. going on, I think it's very important, we play a very judicious game between revenue and profits. And we have been playing that game very-very carefully, and if you look at our year-to-date numbers, I won't look at it on a quarterly basis, I'd look at it on a year-to-date basis. I think on a year-to-date basis, we are performing at or above our expectations in Europe, and we feel comfortable with what the team is doing, and that's what we intend to keep doing for the balance of the year.","And in terms of cost cutting opportunity, Hugh well you can talk about what other opportunities exist, but in terms of employees, look nobody likes cost cutting, everybody likes growth. I think we are one of those companies that are doing a wonderful balance of growing the top line and delivering productivity, and that's what we want to focus on. Swinging the pendulum too much to cost cutting, I don't think is a good idea at all, because it just jeopardizes the future of the company. So we look at opportunities to shrink the cost base and get more lean and mean, but without sacrificing our ability to innovate and grow; and that's really all I have to [indiscernible]. Do you want to add anything Hugh?","Hugh Johnston","No. I think you captured it well. The areas for cost cutting I think remain inside the manufacturing facilities, we are using automation where it makes more sense. Inside of the selling system, we are using technology to make our [indiscernible] system more productive, and inside of the G&A buckets, we are doing more combinations of shared services to create more efficiency in the way we delivered shared services to the organization. And Indra, to reiterate what you said, which is finding the right balance of driving productivity, reinvesting some in growth, and delivering some to the bottom line, is yielding results at brand building and innovation and taking some of that growth. Investing it back and driving more productivity and delivering some of that to the bottom line, is working well. I think we are in the sweet spot right now in terms of being able to deliver performance and it is a careful balance to manage.","Operator","We have time for one more question. Your final question comes from the line of Nik Modi of RBC Capital Markets.","Nik Modi","Yes, good morning everyone and congrats Hugh. I guess the question is on cost savings, so clearly you have this $1 billion three year program over the next few years. But every meeting I go in with an investor or an industry conference, the word zero based budgeting comes up or the terms of a zero-based budgeting comes up. So I just wanted to get your perspective on that particular cost saving initiatives and if you're thinking about zero base budgeting at all within the business, in addition to the $1 billion program?","Indra Nooyi","We look at every opportunity to tighten our belts and become more efficient. As I said earlier, and as Hugh reiterated Nick, we are balancing top line and bottom line growth very-very judiciously. When you embark on a zero base budgeting program that costs to the bone, and jeopardizes your ability to grow the top line. I think that's a formula for disaster.","We believe into the smart spending initiatives where we look across all of our cost structure, and see where we can selectively reduce costs, intelligently, not for the short term, but find a way to make sure it does not affect top line growth initiatives. So rest assured, that we look at every possible way to make our company more efficient, and I think we are -- as Hugh said, in the sweet spot of balancing investments against top line growth, and figuring out ways through automation, shared services, taking out work that's not needed, simplifying our processes, coordinating across the company, reducing our cost. And that's what we are focused on.","And with that, let me reiterate that we are pleased with our results for the first half. We are confident that our plans are working and believe we are on the track to deliver our financial targets for 2015. I want to thank you all for your time and questions this morning, and more importantly for the confidence you have placed in us.

Your lines have been placed on listen-only until question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Today\u2019s call is being recorded and will be archived at www.pepsico.com.","It is now my pleasure to introduce Mr. Jamie Caulfield, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Caulfield, you may begin.","","Jamie Caulfield","Thank you, operator. With me today are Indra Nooyi, PepsiCo\u2019s Chairman and CEO; and Hugh Johnston, PepsiCo\u2019s CFO. We\u2019ll lead off today\u2019s call with a review of our first quarter performance and 2013 outlook, and then we\u2019ll move on to Q&A. In an effort to get to as many analysts\u2019 questions as possible within the hour, we have kept our prepared remarks relatively short this morning, and we are going to have a one question limit, so we should be able to get through the full queue of analysts when we get to Q&A.","Before we begin, please take note of our cautionary statement. This conference call includes forward-looking statements, including statements regarding 2013 guidance based on currently available information. Forward-looking statements inherently involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those predicted in such forward-looking statements. Statements made on this conference call should be considered together with the cautionary statements and other information contained in today\u2019s earnings release and in our most recent periodic reports filed with the SEC.","Unless otherwise indicated, all references to EPS and total operating profit growth are on a core basis.

As we discuss our results today, please keep in mind that our Q1 reporting period is the 12 weeks ended March 23 for North America businesses and is the months of January and February for the vast majority of our businesses outside North America.","And now, it\u2019s my pleasure to introduce Indra Nooyi.","","Indra Nooyi","Thanks Jamie, and good morning everyone. Last February, we announced and then executed a number of important actions to strengthen and ensure the long-term success of our business. Since then, we have driven greater productivity, significantly increased our advertising and marketing investments, and upped our execution in the market. Today, I am very pleased to report strong first quarter results. We had mid single-digit organic revenue growth, double-digit core EPS growth, and a significant improvement in cash flow. We feel good about these results in what has been, and continues to be a competitive landscape and a volatile macro environment.","The first quarter has us confident that we are on track to meet our 2013 financial guidance. Our organic revenue growth was 4.4% right in line with our mid single-digit long-term target, with particularly strong growth at Frito-Lay North America, Latin American snacks, international beverages, and snacks and beverages throughout Asia, Middle East, and Africa.","Organic revenue growth reflected a good balance of volume and net pricing. Our overall servings increased 3%, with snacks volume growth of 4% and beverage volume growth of 1% in an organic basis, but our international beverage volume growth was very strong, up 9% on a reported basis and 6% on an organic basis. More specifically, developing and emerging markets volume was particularly impressive with snacks volume growth of 5.5% and beverage volume growth of 7% of an organic basis. North American beverages volume was negative driven by specific decisions we made to take pricing and sustain it during the quarter. ","We had good profit flow through with core gross margins improving almost 130 basis points in the quarter, core constant currency operating profit up 9% and our core operating margin up more than 80 basis points. Each of our four business units grew core gross margins, expanded our health core operating margins and grew operating profit, and we remain focused on cash flow and cash returns. Management operating cash flow excluding certain items was more than $460 million a significant increase over Q1, 2012. In addition we returned over 1.4 billion to shareholders in the quarter in the form of dividends and share repurchases up more than 50% year-over-year. We\u2019re encouraged by the continued strength in the top-line.","Innovation was a strong contributor to our overall organic sales growth and we continue to see positive signs in terms of both improving brand equity scores of our global brands and market share results. And our productivity program is squarely on track. We have targeted $900 million in savings this year which is a second year of our three year $3 billion productivity program. We\u2019re leveraging best in class supply chain activities from around the world. We\u2019re increasing automation across the value chain from raw materials handling through to the route truck and we\u2019re implementing new processing technologies that enable us to both increase asset utilization and reduce input cost. We are well on our way to achieving our current productivity goal of $3 billion and we have our team now focused on identifying and planning the next generation of projects that would extend our productivity savings well beyond the current program.","With the productivity we\u2019re unlocking we\u2019re able to invest in growth drivers like advertising and new product launches and to simultaneously drive margin improvement. This was evident in the first quarter where A&M expense increased by 50 basis points while delivering an 80 basis point improvement in core operating margins.","Turning now to our businesses, let me comment briefly on them in four buckets, Frito-Lay in North America, North American beverages, all other developed markets businesses and then developing and emerging markets. Let me begin with Frito-Lay North America. Frito had a good first quarter, we generated mid-single digit volume and revenue growth and going forward we expect modest pricing to create a bit more of a spread between volume and revenue than you saw in the first quarter. We expanded core operating margins by 40 basis points even as we increased advertising and marketing expense. More importantly in Q1, Frito-Lay gained volume, unit and value share across major channels in the United States. We feel good about Frito-Lay\u2019s growth model because our business is largely focused on salty snacks and we\u2019re able to grow by taking occasions from another macro snacks like cookies, crackers, nuts and seeds. For example our Tostitos Cantina is sourcing cracker occasions while Doritos Jacked is sourcing occasion from microwavable snacks.","Additionally with our focus on the growing premium snacking occasion we\u2019re realizing additional growth and profitability. For example in Q1, Sabra dips grew volumes 16% and Stacy\u2019s grew revenue 21% and both these are premium offerings which give us additional space in the produce and deli sections of the grocery stores. So as we look at Frito we believe it's in good shape. ","Let me turn now to North American beverages. Our goal in North American Beverages is to judicially balance share and profitability. Now this is very important because we compete in every sub-category of the LRB segment and any growth we achieve in one business comes largely at the expense of another sub-category where we also compete.","So we have to be very careful to compete in this large and profitable LRB business in a responsible way focused more on innovation marketing, balancing share and profit. It's our experience that short term volume driving activities merely rent share and is not a value creating strategy.","Now, let me talk about the category itself and our performance in it. As you all know, about [65%] [ph] of category is non-carbonated beverages, and this segment continues to show growth potential. In the first quarter, we had good performance in teas and chilled juices, ready-to-drink coffee and sports drinks, all supported by successful innovation. Our Pure Leaf product under the Lipton trademark, Tropicana Farmstand, Naked, our super-premium chilled juice, Starbucks\u2019 Iced Coffee, Starbucks\u2019 Refreshers, Gatorade\u2019s Chews and Shakes, each performed well in the first quarter despite less than favorable weather in many parts of the country.","In the other, 35% of the LRB category that\u2019s CSDs, about 17 points are made up of colas and about 18 points are made up of flavored CSDs. Within flavored CSDs, Mountain Dew continues to perform well significantly outperforming the overall CSD category and gaining four-tenths of a share point in the quarter bolstered by the launch of Kickstart, and the momentum of Kickstart continued into April. However, the cola category continues to be a challenge. We took pricing in this declining category and continued to invest in R&D to break some of the compromises that caused consumers to leave the cola category. While this work progresses, we are managing the business responsibly and profitably. We are supporting Pepsi with package and product innovation to drive price realization and investing appropriately in A&M.","And this is what you see reflected in our first quarter PAB performance. We had good disciplined net price realization. Our revenue performance was generally in line with the category. A&M expense increased by 30 basis points versus Q1 of 2012. We expanded core operating margins by 50 basis points, and we grew core constant currency operating profit 4% in the quarter. So, as we go forward expect us to continue to play a responsible game in North American beverages to be competitive of course, but to also enhance our financial performance. And across the beverage business, we are taking out costs to drive margin and improve returns under our current structure, while we continue our work to explore sensible opportunities to unlock incremental value through meaningful structural alternatives. And as we told you in the last earnings call, we do not intend to talk about this until early next year.","Let me now turn to our other developed markets outside the United States. We saw good performance in some of our larger markets. The UK had 5% organic revenue growth, Germany was up 8%, France grew 10%, but Western European macros overall continued to be challenging, and we expect it will continue to put pressure on consumer spending going forward.","Emerging and developing markets, we saw very good growth in these markets in Q1 with organic revenue growth of 12%, made up of 14% in snacks and 9% in beverages driven by execution of our strategy to increase household penetration and frequency of consumption. We had terrific growth across each of our major developing markets with organic revenue growth of 6% in Mexico, 8% in Turkey, and 12% in Brazil. And our emerging markets performance drove the continued great results in our EMEA sector, where organic volume grew double-digits in each of snacks and beverages, and organic revenue grew 15%. Within our emerging markets, organic revenue was especially strong in Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Vietnam, and the Philippines with each growing in excess of 20%. And organic revenue grew 19% in Jordan and 18% in Egypt. And China performed especially well with organic volume growth of 17% in beverages and 47% in snacks. Importantly, we also saw nice improvement in core operating margins in EMEA with a 450 basis point increase even as we continued to invest in brand building and capacity to drive future growth.","So, overall, we feel good about the state of the business and our first quarter performance. Top line was strong. We continued to invest in our brands to fuel growth. Productivity is on track. And we saw solid core operating margin improvement and core operating profit growth. With the strength of the first quarter\u2019s performance we have an even greater degree of confidence in delivering our 2013 financial guidance in a global micro-economic environment that continues to be volatile. To summarize, PepsiCo is performing well. We\u2019re growing the top and bottom line and driving margins and cash returns. We\u2019re being disciplined and responsible across the board in balancing value share and profitability and the overall portfolio is working in terms of scale, geographic reach and product diversity covering snacks and beverages and different day parts, need states and cohorts. So with that let me turn the call over to Hugh.","","Hugh Johnston","Thanks Indra and good morning everyone. I will spend just a minute covering the financial results and guidance in a little more detail and then we will open the lines to your questions. For Q1 organic volume grew 4% in snacks and 1% in beverages with international organic volumes up 6% in beverages and 5% in snacks. Organic revenue grew 4.4%, our core gross margins improved by about 130 basis points and we reinvested almost 50 basis points in A&M. core operating margin improved by 80 basis points and core constant currency operating profit grew 9%. Net interest expense increased by $12 million reflecting higher debt balances, our core effective tax rate was 24.5% approximately 220 basis points below Q1, 2012 and core constant currency EPS grew 13%.","So between core constant currency division operating profit growth of 7% and core constant currency EPS growth of 13% we got about six points of leverage, one point from corporate unallocated some of which is timing related. Slight leverage from net interest expense, three points from tax rate which will reverse as we\u2019re forecasting the full year rate to come in at approximately 27% and one point from weighted average share count which was down 1% year-on-year. Overall the quarter came in as expected with pricing actions, commodity inflation and productivity all in-line with our expectations. On a reported basis net revenue was up 1%, and that was driven by a 0.5 point drag from 4x and at 3 point negative impact from structural change reflecting the China we\u2019re franchising. And reported operating profit and EPS included to be $111 million net monetary asset write down in Venezuela that we talked about on the Q4 call. We generated over $700 million in cash flow from operations in the quarter, a $1.4 billion positive swing versus last year. This was driven by lower pension contributions, stronger working capital improvements and a reduction in net capital spending.","Management operating cash flow excluding certain items was $464 million an increase of $385 million over Q1 of last year and we returned over $1.4 billion to shareholders this quarter in the form of dividends and share repurchases of 52% increase year-over-year. Now turning to guidance, for 2013 we expect core constant currency EPS growth of 7% of a core 2012 base of $4.10. More specifically we expect organic revenue growth of mid-single digits, core constant currency operating profit growth of approximately 6% and approximately 1 point of leverage below the operating profit line driven by share repurchases offset somewhat by higher net interest expense of approximately $90 million from higher debt balances. And we expect our core effective tax rate to be approximately 27% for the full year.","Within these expectations we assume positive price mix, low single digit commodity inflation, productivity of $900 million and A&M growing at least in-line with our net revenue growth. Our productivity assumption is completely in-line with the three year $3 billion program that we launched last year and the savings will be used to help offset inflation as well as to provide funding for investment back into the business. One of our key investment areas is supporting our brands with advertising and marketing, where we will grow A&M investment at least in line with net sales meaning you should expect A&M spending of at least 5.7% of sales, which was our 2012 baseline investment.","In addition, we are also accelerating our investment in R&D and innovation. Based on current market consensus, we anticipate foreign exchange translation to have approximately a 1 point negative impact on our net revenue, operating profit, and EPS for the full year, including the impact of the Venezuela devaluation. Our ForEx outlook is marginally more negative than what we shared with you on the Q4 call, but still rounding to 1% at this point. And we anticipate structural changes will have a negative impact on our full year net revenue growth of approximately 1 point driven by China and Vietnam.","Overall, we are pleased with how the first quarter came in and that increases our confidence in delivering our full year guidance. I would encourage you not to increase your estimates however. The world remains a volatile place, and we may also choose to incrementally invest in the long-term value building initiatives, such as advertising, innovation, and in emerging markets growth capacity.","As you model out the second quarter, we expect foreign exchange translation to have up to a negative 2 point impact on second quarter revenue and EPS based on current market consensus rates. We expect revenue in the second quarter will have an estimated 1 point negative impact from structural changes due to the beverage refranchising\u2019s, both China and our recently announced refranchising of Vietnam. We will also have a gain on the Vietnam transaction, which we intend to reinvest in the business, so we don\u2019t expect it to have any impact on our full year earnings guidance. Commodity inflation will ramp up sequentially from the first quarter, but our full year outlook remains unchanged from our original guidance of low single-digits.","In Europe, given the timing of expenses and continued challenges in Western Europe, Europe sector\u2019s operating profit performance may moderate from the Q1 performance, and we expect higher A&M expense will negatively impact margins around \u2013 across the business. From a cash flow perspective, we expect full year core management operating cash flow, excluding certain items of more than $7 billion. We will continue to drive cash flow through even more efficient working capital management and continued tight controls over capital spending. And for 2013, we expect to see continued improvement in our key working capital metrics and to manage net capital spending to approximately $3 billion, which is well within our long-term target of less than or equal to 5% of net revenue. As a result, we will continue to return strong cash flow through our shareholders. In total, we expect to return approximately $6.4 billion to shareholders in 2013, $3.4 billion in dividends, and $3 billion in share repurchases.","Net, our outlook for 2013 is consistent with our long-term targets for net revenue, operating profit, and core constant currency EPS. We expect to drive improved margins and net ROIC and generating and returning cash flow to our shareholders remains a top priority for the company. So, with that, operator, we will take the first question.","","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question is coming from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America.","","Bryan Spillane - Bank of America","Hi, good morning.","","Indra Nooyi","Good morning Bryan.","","Bryan Spillane - Bank of America","Just a question on the operating leverage in the quarter, and I don\u2019t know how difficult that it\u2019s going to be to try to parse this out, but just try to get a sense for how much of it was driven just simply by commodity disinflation, how much of it is driven by the pricing \u2013 pricing actions, I guess, in Latin America foods and in America\u2019s beverages","And then how much of it is you\u2019re actually beginning to see more of the productivity kind of drop to the bottom-line. So I\u2019m just trying to get a sense for when we look at the margin expansion in the quarter and try to look at it going forward just the weightings in terms of what those items contributed to the margin expansion.","","Hugh Johnston","Obviously we\u2019re getting into a fair amount of detail and in a global P&L it's a little bit difficult to parse all of that. No doubt they were all contributing factors, we clearly did have some pricing in excess of inflation for the quarter but we also got more than our share of the $900 million of productivity in the quarter and that was flowing through as well. Instead of breaking the specific pieces down what we really try to do is just give you guidance on what we expect the outputs to be and at least give you a sense for the difference between what\u2019s happening in gross margin and what\u2019s happening in operating margin. What I would just say is at both price in excess of commodity as well as productivity, we\u2019re significant contributors to that margin expansion.","","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Faucher with JPMorgan Chase.","","John Faucher - JPMorgan","Just want to follow-up a little bit Indra on your comments on North America, if we look at the scanner data pricing which is really what we have to work with, your pricing in CSDs accelerated a little bit through the quarter and on a two year basis you\u2019re ahead of both of your largest competitors in terms of pricing in CSDs and I guess the big concern given the weak volume number is profits without a balanced algorithm really are not sustainable and people would argue that\u2019s one of the things that got you in the hole that you\u2019re in heading into 2012. So how do we think about that balance going forward because to Bryan\u2019s point the leverage looks good but the view point is going to be that it's not sustainable and you\u2019re going to have to drive some of that back in order to get the volume moving? So any sort of follow-up there?","","Indra Nooyi ","In the last call I think we talked about Q1 always being sort of a funny quarter because all the weather related impacts hit us on Q1. So it's very hard to read the year from Q1 alone but having said that let me tell you that we look very carefully at this trade-off between volume, pricing and profit, we look at it constantly and we began the year saying we\u2019ve got to take pricing and we\u2019ve got to stick with it because this is a category where you got to behave in a very responsible and a consistent way so that you don\u2019t destroy value in a business that requires reinvention that\u2019s way we approached it. We saw some interesting pricing activity in the first five or six weeks of the quarter and at the second half of the quarter we started to put in the right actions on pricing, very granular, very targeted still with an eye towards profitability to make sure that we balance volume, revenue and profitability very carefully and if we look at the last six weeks or the last nine weeks the performance is very different. So believe me John, your point is exceedingly well taken, we\u2019re threading this thing very, very carefully but at the end of the day I think this industry requires responsible behavior and we\u2019re going to try to make sure that we play this carbs, non-carbs portfolio very carefully while getting ready for this reinvention of carbonated soft drinks. So we will continue to play this game where we don\u2019t allow volume declines for the balance of the year to be at the magnitude of the first quarter.","","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs.","","Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs","On some of your emerging market or developing market, performance I guess it's been now a few quarters where your profitability is starting to really ramp up. So can you just give us some perspective on the sustainability of that kind of profit improvement, your level of investment that\u2019s going into those markets and the potential for continued I guess profitability, improvement how much of that is going to really drive your overall profit growth performance.","","Indra Nooyi ","Judy, emerging and developing market have been growing robustly from a GDP perspective and the differential between developed markets and emerging and developing markets tend to be about between three and six points in terms of GDP growth. So if you look across the world, emerging, developing markets have robust growth. That\u2019s the macroeconomic factor. Over the past five or six years, as you well know we have been investing to shift our portfolio to be more balanced between emerging and developing markets and developed markets because prior to 2006 we tended to be more of a developed market predominantly U.S based company. So the last six years we have been working very hard to diversify the portfolio. So what you\u2019re beginning to see right now is a result of all those investments beginning to pay off bit by bit. When you first make the investments it is dilutive to profitability but you have to make those investments between M&A and organic investments we had to do it. Now, bit by bit, as developed markets don\u2019t grow as robustly as it did pre-2005, and as the developing and emerging market investments start to payoff, the combination is beginning to yield results. Now, if you are asking for projection, I mean, that\u2019s very hard to give you a projection, all that I tell you is the overall PepsiCo algorithm works, because we have this nice mix of developed and developing and emerging markets, and as margin improves in those markets and developed markets also continued to grow the overall portfolio works, the overall financial profile works.","","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ali Dibadj with Sanford Bernstein.","","Ali Dibadj - Sanford Bernstein","Hey, guys. Thanks.","","Indra Nooyi","Good morning, Ali.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford Bernstein","Hi, how are you?","","Indra Nooyi","Very good. Thank you.","","Ali Dibadj - Sanford Bernstein","Good. Want to ask a little bit about this balancing act that is certainly going on in North America, it sounds like successfully, particularly on North America CSDs, where you are seeing volume as what volume is, we are going to try to do better, but it is what it is, and we are going to try to drive profitability to try to\u2026.","","Indra Nooyi","And so the question being Ali?","","Hugh Johnston","I think he is asking the balancing act between profit and market share.","","Indra Nooyi","Yeah, good ahead.","","Hugh Johnston","Yeah. So, Ali, I guess, what I would say is this, as Indra mentioned in her opening remarks, we are basically trying to do two things. Number one, we want to make sure that we ensure our competitiveness, and that\u2019s something that we think is important for the long-term of the business. At the same time, we do think that this is a \u2013 it\u2019s a good business, it\u2019s a business that generates a lot of cash flow, and obviously, we are looking for it to generate profit growth as it did in Q1 with PAB delivering 4% profit growth, which is certainly a positive, I think in the industry. The balancing act that we are ultimately going to manage to is ensuring that within the categories we are being smart about how we manage each of the categories, where we choose to gain share, where we choose to hold share.","The second thing that we are going to be doing is we will be playing a price package game to ensure that we do look to across the package portfolio to get price realization, where we can, and in that vein one of the things that you know we are doing this year is what we have called our hybrid EDD, which is to try to balance out holiday and non-holiday pricing to try to send the message to consumers that not to buy only when the product is deeply discounted. And then obviously the last decision that we have made is a decision to invest in research and development to address some of the core dissatisfiers with some of the products with the belief that innovation is the way really to create sustainable value in the category. And I think that\u2019s what we are looking to do in the North American beverage space, and we think it\u2019s a successful strategy.","","Indra Nooyi","And Ali, the other thing as we talked in our earnings call, it\u2019s interesting because the North American beverages we participate in every sub-segment of the North American beverage business. So, we have to be careful that we don\u2019t take too much \u2013 take pricing down too much in one category and source from a more profitable part of the other sub-category. So, we have to make sure we play this overall category game very, very carefully. And because we have owned the operating businesses around the world in snacks, we are very, very cognizant of how you play the game in a big operating business. It\u2019s very different from playing the game in a franchise business, and we have volumes of learning\u2019s from around the world from our various operating businesses. And I think we are borrowing a page from that playbook to participate in this NAB, in the North American Beverage business.","","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.","","Dara Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley","Good morning.","","Indra Nooyi","Good morning, Dara.","","Dara Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley","So, Hugh, given that the 9% core profit growth in Q1 despite the 11% ad increase, your full year guidance implies a few hundred basis point slowdown at least in the balance of the year on core profit growth, and I know you mentioned commodities get worse, but I was hoping for a bit more detail on why you would expect that level of deceleration. And also can you quantify what you are expecting on commodities in the balance of the year relative to Q1?","","Hugh Johnston","Yeah. So, I think a couple of things to keep in mind on that, Dara. The first and probably the biggest factor is the world\u2019s certainly a volatile place. And as we look forward into the balance of the year, we are certainly thinking about our guidance in the context of the world being a volatile place and at the same time ensuring that we deliver our guidance through thick and think in terms of the challenges that we might face. ","The second piece to consider is given that we have seen some success in terms of moving the top-line with investments that we have made in the business we\u2019re only going to do things that we view as creating sustainable shareholder value but to the degree that there are opportunities to invest in the business to create sustainable shareholder value. We\u2019re obviously going to be looking towards doing that as well. And then the last piece I talked about core division operating profit growth of 7% for the quarter and core division operating profit growth of 6% for the year. So that\u2019s about a one point gap and frankly with the timing of the A&M expenses, with the timing of commodities that gap isn't so large that just sort of the general quarterly movements in those expenses would move the number from a 7 through a 6 in a relatively undisruptive way. So that\u2019s basically how we get there and hopefully that gives you a little bit of a sense of the context as to how we are thinking about it as well.","","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank.","","Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank","Can you just give us some color on the organic growth rate and some of the bigger country? So Russia, China, exiting the partnership, Brazil and Mexico and maybe Gatorade on the organic side too and then the second part of the question is maybe how March is looking at some of the international markets because I know (inaudible) in February so maybe some update on what is going to happen in March and what\u2019s your view is going forward?","","Indra Nooyi","So organic growth pretty much in every one of those markets was strong and we talked about it in our earnings. China, volume grew organic revenue grew, if you look at the UK, you look at Russia; you look at every country pretty much across the board we had organic revenue growth whether it was developed or developing. I don\u2019t think there was any country around the world they will wear. We did not have some organic growth. So we feel good about the growth rates even though many of these international markets were just two months. India grew 9%, Egypt grew 20%, Saudi grew 21%, Pakistan grew 37%. I could go on and on but every one of these grew mid-single digits or even in the 20s or 30s. So good revenue performance across the board. The first quarter is a two months quarter, it's a lowest, it's the smallest quarter in the year and so the cost and the profits are not fully balanced. So what I would say to you is that we had very good growth margins in EMEA for example we had 438 gross margin basis point improvement in gross margins but it's a small quarter, so let\u2019s wait and see how that evolves through the year but all that I tell you is that Latin America, EMEA doing well margins expanding profit going well, Russia doing well.","Western Europe, we\u2019re going to watch and wait and see what happens to the macroeconomic environment and North America we have talked enough about it. So overall I would say it's a good outlook for our developing and emerging markets.","","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Caroline Levy with CLSA.","","Caroline Levy \u2013 CLSA","I wonder if you could actually just the last part of the last question was around Gatorade and Trop and talk about the strategy for this year and longer term the repositioning that happened at Gatorade and what the volume was like this quarter.","","Indra Nooyi","Actually Gatorade and Tropicana had very good quarters and sequentially the performance is sustaining itself. Again as you well know and Gatorade we\u2019re playing sports nutrition game between Gatorade Juice, Gatorade Hydration and Gatorade Recover and as a system that business is doing well. We are staying very true to our premium sports nutrition positioning and we continue to play the games that way. We\u2019re beginning to gain share and sports nutrition even though we had low priced competition come in with really aggressive pricing. We held our ground and we\u2019re beginning to gain shares. So we feel very good about our sports nutrition strategy. In the case of Tropicana between Tropicana Trop 50, name of the Tropicana franchise also includes Naked, but let me just speak to Tropicana. Again, coming out of the first part of Q1, going to the second part, and now going into Q2, we are beginning to gain share in the chilled juice category, just a lot of great advertising, incredible execution focus in all of our traditional strongholds. And we are seeing impressive performance gains in Tropicana. And just look for us to grow the Naked franchise, it\u2019s continued to bring innovation into the Tropicana franchise and the launch of Tropicana Farmstand, which is our fruit and vegetable product is also doing very, very well. So, continued to look for innovation from Tropicana, we feel good about tailwinds of those categories, because they are more in the nutrition space coupled with the fact that our brands are very strong.","","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Swartzberg with Stifel Nicolaus.","","Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus","Yeah, good morning.","","Indra Nooyi","Good morning Mark. How are you?","","Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus","Good morning Indra. I am good. Thank you. Two-part question, it looks like in C stores, there is an increasing divergence between what you are seeing on the snacks side of your business and the beverage component of your business and how do you say, we have only got two months here. So, perhaps on the beverage side, we should not make too much of that. Can you speak to how accurate that assessment is and kind of what kind of promise these tie-ins with AB and the promotions you have kind of incrementally from a (indiscernible) perspective, how you feel they might address that issue? And then kind of related to that, but could we speak a little bit more about how this large format effort on the promotional side, changing the promotional calendars is actually going, it sounds like the aim is good and you have had some success to an extent, but perhaps the pace of success in terms of getting a better promotional environment is a little slower than you would have thought about a year ago?","","Indra Nooyi","Convenience stores in the first quarter, especially the first part of the first quarter perhaps not a very good performing channel. I wouldn\u2019t say, we are talking about our business, as a channel, convenience stores did not perform very well, because weather impacted convenience stores significantly, and you can\u2019t do anything about Mother Nature. So, convenience stores didn\u2019t perform well, but now as the weather is improving across the country little bit slower than we would like, because snow in the West in April doesn\u2019t feel that good. But we are seeing trends improving convenience stores, and we are very strong in convenience stores both in beverages and snacks. And we are beginning to see sequential improvement. And because of the underperformance in the first part of Q1 of the channel itself and now that we are seeing sequential improvement, we think the year for C stores would still end up with sort of 3.5%, 4% growth in the channel. And if the channel grows at that rate, you should expect to see good performance from PepsiCo in that channel. I would be honest with you the divergence between snacks and beverages, is not that much both our businesses are doing fairly well in the convenience stores. And I think that as the year goes on, you start to see better performance in the convenience store channel. And in terms of \u2013 you wanted to add something Hugh?","","Hugh Johnston","Yeah, if I can add just particularly to the convenience store please as well. I mean, as Indra mentioned, that the weather lapped in convenience is particularly challenging for beverages. I mean, we had a particularly warm winter last year lapping that now with a really long extended winter. That\u2019s just going to have a more natural effect on beverages than it will on the snacks business. And I think the divergence that you are referring to can be more attributed to that than it can be to anything else. It\u2019s also indicated in the overall performance of the convenience channel, which was down obviously in the first quarter. And as Indra mentioned, we expect the full year that channel to be up 3.5%, 4%. So, we don\u2019t normally like to use weather as much of a conversation piece, but I think in this case, because it\u2019s just so historic and it does have such a significant impact on that channel in that particular set of businesses, it is a relevant factor.","","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo.","","Bonnie Herzog - Wells Fargo","Thank you. Good morning.","","Indra Nooyi","Good morning, Bonnie.","","Bonnie Herzog - Wells Fargo","Hi. I just had a follow-up on the C store channel and then Frito-Lay. I was actually hoping you could give us a little more color in some of the new initiatives in this channel such as your individual store plan events that you started to implement, curiously how broad-based this initiative will be, and then maybe could you talk about any other changes you have been making in the important channel?","","Indra Nooyi","Well, Frito-Lay has always had the convenience store as a very, very strong go to market outlet and continues to be that way. Frito had terrific performance in Q1 and to get to that level of detail on how individual store planograms are working on. My suggestion is that at some point if you want to visit Frito-Lay and get a better sense of what they are doing in these stores we invite you to do that.","","Bonnie Herzog - Wells Fargo","In addition to that I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going as its planograms oriented. We obviously have made the move with certain packages in terms of moving into a larger volume on size and in addition to that we got some terrific innovation out in convenient stores right now and that innovation obviously really does help Frito-Lay, it is so sensitive to flavor innovation and convenience is where you tend to get a lot of trial on that stuff early on. Frankly if that works really well and we feel very, very good about it.","","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Damian Witkowski with Gabelli & Company.","","Damian Witkowski - Gabelli & Company","In the past you have called the U.S. pricing environment probably one of the most irrational you have seen in the industry and I\u2019m wondering if you have changed your mind about that with what happened over the last couple of years and pricing seeming to be a little bit more rational and then the second part is are we seeing any of that in the international markets especially ones that are growing and getting bigger?","","Indra Nooyi","I made that comment a couple of years ago when pricing was crazy but I would say that it's become rational. I would say in burst it becomes irrational and I think if we continue to focus just on volume and mainly on volume I\u2019m talking mostly about beverages. If we only focus on volume growth it does lead to some irrational pricing especially when quarters have to end or when people are trying to make some volume number just to report something good. I think in this LRB category in particular it's very, very important. We thread volume and value very carefully. It's a big profitable category and we run the risk of sucking the profits out if we don\u2019t play this game responsibly. So that\u2019s the tact we have chosen to take and I hope that how the industry gets played out. We see burst of responsible behavior then at times we see action that we can\u2019t even explain but I guess this is part of free markets and competition so we will keep playing this.","","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Ali Dibadj with Sanford Bernstein.","","Ali Dibadj - Sanford Bernstein","My question is a little bit broader which is really around whether we should philosophically think of the global portfolio being one of part generating cash and profit in North America beverage in particular, particularly North America CSD to then take that and invest in parts of the global business that are actually growing more robustly. So emerging markets, snack markets in particular, is that the model you guys explicitly think about and talk about internally like some other CPG companies and retail companies do or is that just more organic in the way it's been happening.","","Indra Nooyi","Actually that\u2019s a very insightful observation because I think every company needs, if you go back to road share metrics that Boston Consulting came up with I think in the 60s or 70s, you\u2019re really talking about how you have some cash cows to go off and invest in big broad stars and that\u2019s how we all have to play the portfolio because a portfolio complete comprised of growth vehicles. You can\u2019t sustain in the investment. You do need some cash cows to be able to invest in growth engines. Having said that I think that mature low growth businesses especially if they are big and have consumer appeal and also right to reinvention and I think it's very important that established players reinvent their categories as opposed to allowing others to reinvent it and push them out and there are examples, many, many examples of big companies especially companies based here in the U.S. that did not reinvent their categories. So I think we adopt today behave responsibly, generate the cash in the North American business, grow responsibly and wait for international growth but reinvent North America simultaneously, which is why we have stepped up all our R&D investments in sweeteners, flavoring agents, new processing technologies. Unfortunately, the timing is a bit off, because R&D projects don\u2019t result in major breakthroughs in the same timeframe with which you can manage responsibly. So, you got to give it little bit more time to yield results. So, you are absolutely right in saying you have got to play the overall portfolio carefully. And what I feel good about the PepsiCo portfolio, we have a very good mix of growth businesses, businesses that generate cash and good returns to keep funding this growth. And I think our portfolio is so well-balanced in terms of snacks, beverages, geographic mix, different growth rates, that we are able to manage it sensibly and deliver the kind of profits that I think this portfolio is capable of generating well into the future.","","Operator","That was our final question. I\u2019d now like to turn the floor back over to Indra for any closing comments.","","Indra Nooyi","Thank you all. In closing, I just like to say that we are pleased with the way we are navigating through an uncertain and volatile environment. We have taken all the steps necessary to strengthen and position ourselves for sustainable long-term growth. I think the first quarter of 2013 is an excellent example of how well constructed and developed portfolio coupled with disciplined execution and reinvestment can drive high-quality top and bottom line results. So, I thank you for your time and for the confidence you have placed in us with your investment. Have a great day.","","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s conference call.

This conference call includes forward-looking statements, including statements regarding 2018 guidance based on currently available information. Forward-looking statements inherently involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those predicted. Statements made on this conference call should be considered together with cautionary statements and other information contained in today's earnings release, which includes a detailed discussion of our fourth quarter and full-year 2017 reported results, and in our most recent periodic reports filed with the SEC.","When discussing our financial results on today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP measures, which exclude certain items, such as the impact of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and foreign exchange translation from our reported results. You should refer to the Glossary and other attachments to this morning's earnings release and to the Investors section of PepsiCo's website under the Events and Presentations tab to find full explanations and reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures.","And now, it's my pleasure to introduce Indra Nooyi.","Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.","Thank you, Jamie, and good morning, everyone. As you saw in this morning's release, we concluded 2017 with another quarter of strong operating performance, capping off another successful year. In the fourth quarter, overall organic revenue growth accelerated sequentially from the third quarter to 2.3%, right in line with our expectations. Core constant currency operating profit increased 6%, and core constant currency EPS increased 8%.","We had particularly strong performance in the quarter at Frito-Lay North America, with organic revenue growth of 5%, led by impressive growth in variety packs, Ruffles, Tostitos, Doritos and dips. We also gained market share, both in salty snacks and in the more broadly defined macro snacks categories. The business performed well throughout the year, with strong brand activation and innovative new products propelling the top line, and productivity programs continuing to move margins up.","Quaker Foods North America had very good performance. Hot cereals volume grew mid-single digits, and we gained share in our three key categories of hot cereals, bars and ready-to-eat cereal.","North America Beverages posted sequential improvement from the third quarter in organic revenue performance, with volume trends improving in trademarks, Pepsi, Mountain Dew, Gatorade and Lipton. More importantly, we have robust marketing in innovation lined up for 2018, including the launch of our Pepsi Generations campaign; the launch of Mountain Dew Ice, which was prominently featured with Doritos Blaze at the Super Bowl; the introduction of bubly, our new sparkling water that combines refreshing flavors with an upbeat and playful sense of humor to shake things up in the sparkling water category; and further marketing support in packaging innovation, as LIFEWTR enters its second year from launch.","To be clear, while our North American Beverages segment's top line performance did improve compared to the third quarter, overall, its performance still has tremendous room to improve, and we are taking the right steps to realize those opportunities. We remain committed to our strategy to compete on the basis of brand building, innovation and marketplace execution across our portfolio of brands as the best way to create shareholder value over the long term.","Turning to our international segments, organic revenue growth outside North America was fueled by continued strong performance in developing and emerging markets, which posted organic revenue growth of 7% as a group, led by double-digit growth in Vietnam, Turkey, Thailand, Philippines and Argentina, high-single-digit growth in Russia and China, and very solid mid-single-digit growth in Mexico and India.","For the full year, we delivered solid organic revenue growth of 2.3%. We expanded core operating margin by 45 basis points. We grew core constant currency EPS by 9%, exceeding the 8% goal we set out at the beginning of 2017. We generated free cash flow, excluding certain items, of $7.3 billion, which exceeded our goal of approximately $7 billion we set out at the beginning of 2017.","Core net ROIC expanded by 140 basis points and now stands at 22.9%. And we met our goal of returning $6.5 billion in cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. These are impressive results, particularly in light of the challenges posed by global mega trends impacting our industry, from macroeconomic and political volatility, the continued rebalancing of the economic world, to shifting consumer preferences and increasing demand for healthier products, to the disruption of retail caused by the rapid growth of e-commerce and the blurring of channel lines.","Our 2000 (sic) [2017] (06:08) results add to a long run of very strong operating performance. Over the past five years, organic revenue grew at a 4% compound rate, core operating margin expanded by 220 basis points, core constant currency EPS growth averaged 9% annually, core net ROIC expanded more than 750 basis points, our annualized dividend per share increased by 50%, and we returned $38 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases combined.","Our results for 2017 and over the longer past are a result of our steadfast commitment to manage our business responsibly and sustainably. Our portfolio of businesses has delivered consistently strong financial results year after year, while making the investments and taking the necessary actions to sustain shareholder value creation over the long term. Specifically, the expansion of our geographic reach and product portfolio has made our business more resilient. The power of our customer relationships in retail and foodservice has created advantage in the marketplace.","The strength of new capabilities in e-commerce, research and development, social and digital marketing and design has helped us connect with consumers in new ways. Our environmental footprint has continued to shrink, streamlining our operations and reducing costs. And our commitment to productivity has enabled us to sustainably reinvest in the business, positioning us to capture tomorrow's growth. In a nutshell, we have built a business that balances top line growth, productivity and reinvestment to generate strong financial results in a way that is self-reinforcing and self-sustaining.","The strength of our customer relationships in the United States was reflected in the most recent Kantar Retail PoweRanking survey, where our retail partners, once again, named us as the number one best-in-class manufacturer. And for the first time, we received the top ranking in every functional category, including clear company strategy, most important consumer brands, growth in profitability, sales force and customer teams, insights and category management, supply chain management, and use of digital platforms. Similarly, we were highly ranked in service by Advantage in many of our markets outside the United States, including key markets like China, Russia, the UK and Mexico.","Our annual productivity savings of approximately $1 billion have been driven by a relentless continuous improvement mindset focused on every aspect of our value chain and guided by our environmental sustainability agenda. We have refined our business model to reduce management layers and accelerate decision making, and have deployed leading-edge technologies to increase manufacturing throughput, reduce logistics costs, and increase go-to-market efficiency and effectiveness.","Further, our robust environmental sustainability agenda has complemented these initiatives. Its focus on reducing water and energy use and eliminating waste has both reduced cost and vastly reduced our environmental impact. For example, in 2017, we accelerated our efforts to minimize PepsiCo's environmental impact, enabling us to streamline costs and mitigate our operational impact in the communities we serve. We have teamed up with disruptive startups, leading universities, governments and innovators to develop biodegradable film resins that meet the sustainable, flexible packaging requirements of our global food and beverage business, a technology to help advance our goal of designing 100% of our packaging to be recyclable, compostable or biodegradable by 2025.","Despite the many challenges we faced over the years, from changing consumer preferences to disruption in the retail environment, to geopolitical turmoil, we have consistently and substantially reinvested savings back into the business to further build capabilities and adopt technologies that we believe will enable us to sustain our top line growth. So, for example, our investment in e-commerce across multiple channels, from e-grocery, to direct to consumer, to pure play, helped drive exceptional growth in 2017.","We are leveraging big data and predictive analytics to sharpen real-time marketing messages, dynamic merchandising and tailored offers. And we're increasingly collaborating with retail customers to make e-commerce a point of differentiation for PepsiCo. As a result, our e-commerce business is now approximately $1 billion in annualized retail sales, and we are well positioned to capitalize on what is sure to be a dynamic future in this space. In our investment in the world-class design capability enabled the successful launches of innovative new products like LIFEWTR, and injected excitement and dynamism into our presence at major global events, from the Super Bowl to the UEFA Champions League Final.","Looking to 2018, we are encouraged by a number of factors. The global economy is growing, with developed markets stable and a number of developing and emerging economies showing signs of acceleration. In most of our key markets, the picture is relatively positive, with strong employment, consumer spending, and consumer sentiment data.","And in the United States, our largest market, we expect the recently enacted tax reform to have a positive impact on many sectors and businesses and on the economy overall. However, our outlook is tempered by expectation for challenging industry conditions, including a continued dynamic retail landscape, shifting consumer preferences and behaviors, especially as it relates to the focus on health and wellness, a robust competitive environment, and rising commodity costs.","Despite these challenges, we believe we are poised to continue to perform well, precisely because we have been making the investments and taking the actions to adapt and thrive in the current dynamic environment. For 2018, we will be aided by the financial benefits provided by the recent U.S. tax reform, which will allow us to make incremental investments to further fortify our business. For example, in 2018, we will provide a bonus of up to $1,000 to full-time front-line U.S.-based associates to reward and recognize their dedication and contribution to making our business better and stronger. And we will invest in training our global associates to arm them with the skills to succeed in tomorrow's workplace.","Furthermore, as a company, we will double down on new capabilities in areas such as e-commerce, digital, and brand marketing to make us even more competitive. We're going to accelerate capital investments to add manufacturing capacity and make our operations more efficient. And we're enhancing cash returns for our shareholders, beginning with the 15% increase to our annualized dividend per share, effective with the dividend expected to be paid in June 2018.","Taken together, these actions are consistent with our philosophy of responsible sustainable management. They extend the durability of our business while strengthening cash returns to our owners, those who have entrusted their capital to us to generate secure, growing returns to provide for their retirements, their children's educations, and all the other noble financial goals they may be pursuing.","With that, let me turn it over to Hugh. Hugh?","Hugh F. Johnston - PepsiCo, Inc.","Thank you, Indra, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin with a discussion of our assessment of the impact of the recently enacted U.S. tax reform because it has implications for our 2018 financial outlook on a number of dimensions. From our perspective, it will affect five key areas.","First, beginning in 2018, it will result in a lower tax rate on our U.S. earnings. Second, it imposes a one-time mandatory tax on our international accumulated earnings that existed as of year-end 2017, regardless of whether we choose to repatriate those earnings, but at a substantially lower rate than would have previously applied to actual repatriation. So net, it provides a much more efficient framework in which to repatriate our international cash.","Third, it decreases our net deferred tax liabilities, as those tax deferred items are now expected to be taxed at a lower rate at the point they became taxable. Fourth, it will allow for much greater mobility of our international cash going forward. And fifth, it will drive higher cash-on-cash returns on U.S. capital projects, as capital spending for the next five years will be immediately deductible for tax purposes.","As a consequence, in the fourth quarter of 2017, we recorded a one-time $2.5 billion provisional net tax expense, which reflects the deemed provisional one-time repatriation tax of approximately $4 billion net of a provisional $1.5 billion benefit relating to the deferred tax remeasurement. The provisional $4 billion liability associated with the international accumulated earnings is expected to be paid out over eight years, starting in 2019.","We expect a lower overall effective tax rate for 2018. We will accelerate some capital projects into 2018, resulting in an expectation for total CapEx to be approximately $3.6 billion in 2018. And we expect to make a $1.4 billion discretionary pension contribution in the first quarter of 2018 to maximize its tax deductibility.","So turning to our guidance for 2018, we expect organic revenue growth at least in line with our 2017 growth rate, or 2.3%, as we expect to continue to benefit from successful product innovation and strong marketplace execution, but tempered by a cautious outlook as it relates to the retail environment and changing consumer behavior. As Indra mentioned, we expect to step up investment spending in front-line workforce training, digital capability, data analytics, e-commerce, and advertising and marketing.","We expect our core effective tax rate to be in the low 20s. and we expect core earnings per share of $5.70, or a 9% increase compared to 2017 core earnings per share of $5.23, with the benefit of the lower tax rate substantially offset by the incremental investments.","Turning to cash flow, we expect to continue to generate strong cash flow and to exercise discipline over capital allocation, with prudent reinvestment into the business and the majority of our free cash flow returned to shareholders. So for 2018, we expect free cash flow of approximately $6 billion, approximately $9 billion in cash flow from operations, which includes the $1.4 billion discretionary pension contribution. On this point, it is important to note the pension funding will reduce our gross debt from a rating agency perspective, and so it creates room for leverage elsewhere within our capital structure.","And we expect net capital spending of approximately $3.6 billion. As I mentioned, this is a bit above our trend over the last few years as we accelerate some projects into 2018. And we expect to return approximately $7 billion to shareholders in 2018, with cash dividends of approximately $5 billion, reflecting the 15% dividend increase Indra mentioned, and share repurchases of approximately $2 billion. Further, beyond 2018, we see the prospect for even higher cash returns as we begin to fully realize the benefits of greater global cash mobility.","Relatedly, we announced today our new three-year share repurchase program commencing July 1, 2018, providing for the repurchase of up to $15 billion of common stock.","Finally, as you update your models, I'd like to highlight the following. We expect our rate of organic revenue growth and core constant currency EPS growth to be higher in the second half than in the first half, as we will lap NAB's softer performance and natural disaster-related business disruptions in the second half. We expect variability in the timing of productivity savings, investments, and this includes the accrual of the front-line bonus, and net commodity inflation to contribute to relatively better performance in the second half. And we expect the fourth quarter to have the largest year-on-year core tax rate benefit.","With that, we're ready to take the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley.","Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.","Good morning, Dara.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey, good morning. So, NAB continued to be weak for the second straight quarter. I was hoping you could review your plans there to improve market share performance on the CSD side of the business going forward. And how big a piece lower pricing or greater promotion is within those plans?","You mentioned some tweaks post Q3 in terms of shelf space focus, et cetera, but it did look like you pulled the pricing lever more aggressively in Q4, both in the scanner data, as well as reported results despite the comments on brand building. So, I'd love some detail there. And then also, while we're on the subject, can you review the Gatorade trends in North America from a market share perspective and forward plans for that brand? Thanks.","Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.","Dara \u2013 Hugh, you want to take this?","Hugh F. Johnston - PepsiCo, Inc.","I'd be happy to take it. Thanks, Dara, for the question. A couple of comments on that. First, I want to make clear that our strategy in the beverage business remains as it's been. It's focused on brand building, it's focused on innovation, and it's focused on execution in the marketplace funded by driving incremental productivity.","Second, in terms of 2018, we have increased advertising behind the big brands, and we expect that to have a positive impact. But like most advertising campaigns, that will take several quarters to fully realize the impact. So, we expect sequential improvement in each of the quarters, starting with Q1. Just as a reminder, back on the Q3 call, we did talk about the fact that we expected sequential improvement from Q3 to Q4 and we did, in fact, see that.","Regarding pricing, we expect our pricing to be competitive in the marketplace, but pricing lower is not part of our strategy to gain market share. Price\/mix is always complicated when you read the reported results. Particularly in the first month of the year, you saw some increased promotional activity that is much more reflective of timing at a few of our bigger customers than it is of a change in strategy. So, we expect to get the types of pricing that we've gotten in recent years in the North American Beverage business.","As for Gatorade, I think you'll see a full lineup of innovation for the year, both flavor innovation and perhaps some broader things as well, which we'll be talking about as we get further into the year. So, net, it's about innovation and it's about brand building. It's not about pricing as far as our strategy is to continue to see sequential improvement in the beverage business.","Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.","And more importantly, Gatorade trends are improving, and we feel good about what we're saying the business delivering right now.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane of Bank of America.","Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.","Good morning, Bryan.","Bryan Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, good morning everyone. Just a question, I guess, related to \u2013 or a couple questions related just to cash flow as we think about this year. First, net interest expense; Hugh, if you could talk at all about just the movement in rates and how we should think about how that might \u2013 or potential movement in rates and how that might affect net interest expense?","And then, second, in terms of the CapEx coming up, I think you mentioned in the prepared remarks that some of it's going also to adding capacity. And so, I'm just curious to know, with organic sales growth sort of below the algorithm, but we're adding capacity, is it a modernization, so a need to sort of modernize some manufacturing capacity? Or are there true needs to sort of add capacity?","Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.","Go ahead.","Hugh F. Johnston - PepsiCo, Inc.","So I'm happy to take that one, Bryan. First, regarding your questions on cash flow and specifically net interest expense, we do operate with zero net floating debt, so rises in interest rates shouldn't have an immediate impact on us in terms of the debt that we carry. We obviously do have refinancing risk as we sort of turn over that debt tower each and every year. But given the cash return, we should be able to manage that successfully, so I don't expect to see significant rises in net interest expense for the year.","As to your question regarding capacity, if you look at the Frito-Lay business in particular, we will be investing in capacity there. We've seen good strong volume growth in Frito-Lay over the last several years and certain of our international markets where we've also seen good strong volume growth, we'll need to add capacity in those markets. So, this is very much capacity, reflective of growth in individual product categories around the world.","Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.","And most of the capacity increase is in snacks. And we're going to put the capital in 2018 and hopefully, from 2019 we'll start to see the results of the new capacity coming on stream.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Grundy of Jefferies.","Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.","Good morning, Kevin.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","Hi, good morning. Good morning, Indra. Indra, I was hoping you could comment on the current Dr Pepper deal. What are your initial thoughts on what you think that may mean for the competitive landscape? And then sort of looking ahead, what do you think that means with respect to the potential for further consolidation in the North American beverage industry? Thank you.","Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.","We've been reading all the reports that you guys have written to understand the real strategy behind that merger. I'm sure there's some towering strategic logic, but we are still searching for it. You see, the distribution, 80% of distribution of Dr Pepper sits between the red system and the blue system. And so, if the merger is supposed to increase access to distribution, it's between the two of us who control 80% of the distribution and manage it for Dr Pepper. So, let's wait and see over the next few weeks and months to see what kind of a strategy they articulate because it somehow eluded us the strategic logic.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Caroline Levy of Macquarie.","Caroline Levy - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Good morning. Thank you very much. I'm wondering if you could give us a little detail on your outlook for costs. We understand there's a lot of pressure on distribution, trucking, shortage of drivers, and then, of course, just raw materials. And I think you're hedged out nine months on average on your inputs. But if you could just give us an update because there was, I guess, across the board, operating cost pressure and some raw material cost pressure already in the fourth quarter. Thanks.","Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.","I'm going to let Hugh answer that. But, hello, Caroline, good morning.","Caroline Levy - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Hi. Thank you.","Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.","Go ahead, Hugh.","Hugh F. Johnston - PepsiCo, Inc.","Thanks. Thanks, Indra. Yeah, Caroline, break it up into two pieces. On the commodity side, as you correctly observe, we do have our systematic forward buying program in place, so we're generally out about nine months on all the things that we can be out on. Overall, commodity inflation will be in the low single digits as it's been in the last couple of years.","Regarding labor inflation and OpEx inflation, we've typically seen pressure there in the range of 3% to 4% globally, which is about in line with the inflation in our markets around the world. To date, we haven't seen any pressure that's so substantive that it's disruptive to the algorithm, but we certainly expect some labor inflation pressure in certain markets over time.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Ottenstein of Evercore ISI.","Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.","Good morning, Robert.","Robert Ottenstein - Evercore ISI","Great, great. Good morning. Hugh, you did touch on quite a bit some of the financial implications of tax reform. But I'm just wondering if you could step back, philosophically it sounds like you'll be able to give more money back to shareholders. You raised the share buyback authorization higher than it was in the past. And you increased the dividend at a higher rate than in the past. Can you just talk a little bit more detail about some of the increased flexibility you're going to have? Should we expect higher dividend increases than in the past? Does this change anything on the M&A front? Just a little bit more detail from a strategic perspective.","Hugh F. Johnston - PepsiCo, Inc.","Sure.","Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.","Go ahead, take the dividend question. On the M&A, I'll just tell you, Robert, we're sticking with our strategy of tuck-in M&As. And if something blindingly strategic and value creating shows up, we'll be sure to talk to you about it. But at this point, our focus is on sensible tuck-in acquisitions. But talk about the other things, Hugh.","Hugh F. Johnston - PepsiCo, Inc.","Yeah. So, Robert, on more broadly, obviously, the tax reform bill allows for a much greater flexibility in terms of the way we manage the company's resources, and, particularly, cash resources around the globe. It, obviously, lowers the cost of capital a little bit in the U.S. as well. So, generally, that's good news for investment in growth.","In terms of our projections going forward on dividend and share repurchase, with this 15% announcement, you've seen the payout ratio go up a little bit. I think that's likely where we're to maintain. This is not a signal of a longer-term increase in the payout ratio over time. So, we talk about dividends once a year, every year.","I'm not going to talk about specifically what will happen going forward. But I think what you see is just a modest uptick in the payout ratio. Beyond that, we'll see what happens as we get beyond 2018 regarding where the cash goes and what we do with it. But as Indra said, our M&A policy has been very tightly focused on tuck-in M&A, and that's where we'll stay.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Pablo Zuanic of SIG.","Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.","Good morning, Pablo.","Pablo Zuanic - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Good morning, everyone. Good morning and good morning, everyone. Look, just two questions. First, can we talk a little bit about ready-to-drink coffee and ready-to-drink tea? I know you don't fully own those \u2013 you don't own those businesses directly, but in a couple of years, both of them could be as big as your sports drinks business if my math is not wrong. Just give us some color there. Obviously, you have the Dunkin' entry with Coke into ready-to-drink coffee. On the tea side, Pure Leaf and Brisk are doing well, but Lipton is declining. Just some color there would help. And maybe a reminder in terms of how that really flows through the P&L.","And the second question, in terms of your water strategy, leaving bubly aside, obviously, Propel LIFEWTR are helping you gain share in still bottled water. But just remind us of the strategy in still water, Aquafina is still a big chunk of your business there, but how big are the other brands also?","And third and last, related to water, can you give us some color on bubly? Obviously, your main competitor there, LaCroix, does not advertise. I suppose we will see a big advertising push from bubbly with it being at Walmart. Just some color on the launch would be helpful. Thanks.","Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.","Okay, ready-to-drink coffee and ready-to-drink tea, both businesses doing very well. Ready-to-drink tea overall has grown every year in the United States and globally. Clearly, Pure Leaf grew at very attractive rates. And core Lipton fell off a little bit, but we have plans to bring growth back to Brisk, to Lipton and to Pure Leaf. So, we feel very good about the plans we have for ready-to-drink tea, which also includes the premium Tea House Collection. So, all the new flavors we are launching. And the sort of re-advertising of core Lipton, I think, is going to give the ready-to-drink tea business that we have a much needed boost.","When it comes to ready-to-drink coffee, Starbucks is still the most powerful brand in the United States and globally. And the joint venture is doing very well. When you have a competitor in the ready-to-drink coffee business going through a powerful distribution system, which is what happened with Dunkin' Donuts coffee, in the short term, you will have some share erosion. The challenge is not to behave crazily through the share disruption because, ultimately, the strength of the product determines who is going to win in the long term.","So, I think, as the year progressed, our ready-to-drink coffee business returned to growth again because the initial distribution share losses steadied. And ultimately, the business has to be won on velocity of the product, and we're doing just fine. And the innovation pipeline on ready-to-drink coffee coming out of Starbucks is very, very impressive. So, we feel good about both.","In terms of the profit impact to us, it's a joint venture, but we captured the bottling revenue. So, we capture a large portion of the revenue of both coffee and tea, although it's a joint venture with Starbucks for coffee and Unilever for tea, and they're both very successful joint ventures. I wish we had more of them.","In terms of water, clearly, it's a big market and it's growing. And as you know, beverages is a repertoire category. And water in all its forms, still, sparkling flavored; still, flavored sparkling; electrolytic waters; sports hydration, they're all growing categories. At this point, we have our presence in, I think, pretty much every category in water.","And I'll be honest with you. I think we were late to the flavored sparkling water category. I wish we had launched bubly a couple of years ago. But the fact of the matter is we have a very good distribution system. Our customer relationships are excellent, and our customers are very, very happy we're launching bubly. The product tastes fantastic, and in a lot of the testing, it is winning versus competition. So we are feeling good about bubly.","Propel has been doing very well, growing. We feel good about that. LIFEWTR, as you know, is perhaps one of the fastest-growing electrolytic waters that was launched in 2017. And our goal is to continue to support the arts and roll it out globally in 2018 and beyond. So overall, the hydration portfolio is strong. And our goal is to make sure, as a repertoire category, we offer sports drinks, we offer other hydration options, and coffee, tea, carbonated soft drinks, all of the products that the consumer wants.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer of Cowen & Company.","Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hi, good morning.","Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.","Hi, Vivien.","Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC","Indra, I was hoping that you could expand on your comment, please, around your outlook for the retail environment. I assume that was a U.S. specific comment. And if you could drill down at all into what you're seeing in c-stores, I think it will be helpful. Thank you.","Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.","Actually, the retail disruption is happening globally. It's not just a U.S. phenomenon. The success of the newly emerging retail channels is still a work in process because none of them have really established a toehold in the U.S. But between the hard discounters, e-commerce, e-commerce of every kind, the pure play, the click-and-collect, the growth of dollar stores from a few years ago, and of course, the brilliant growth of Walmart, all of this has caused the retail industry to go through a fairly significant change because we are overbuilt in grocery in the country, and all of these alternate channels are now beginning to challenge all the square footage in the marketplace. So we are watching and waiting to see whether this disruption is just a low level of disruption that happens over many years or is this going to accelerate. It's something that we're watching.","The good news is that our DSD system reaches virtually any outlet that's out there. Whether it's convenience store, foodservice, whether it's the big supermarkets or the big hypermarkets, we reach every one of them. So we are watching the traffic through these outlets. We are watching what kinds of products are being sold, what are people buying through e-commerce and what are people buying through brick-and-mortar. And more importantly, we're looking to see whether brick-and-mortar stores are really becoming the warehouse to pick for e-commerce, which breathes more life into them.","So, this is an evolving story, Vivien. And the outlook is not perfectly clear because the economics of many of these new digital channels is still being thought through. It's not perfectly clear that they're all going to make money.","Internationally, we have much the same phenomenon. China I think is the cutting edge of digital sales in the grocery channel. We are seeing Europe now grow in terms of e-commerce and the hard discounters taking a much bigger presence there. And we're seeing the same thing in Latin America. So I think China and the U.S. are cutting edge in terms of retail disruption. We're going to have to watch and see how it evolves in the other markets. And our teams are all connected globally and thinking through the best strategy for us to play in this new retail environment.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ali Dibadj of Bernstein.","Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.","Good morning, Ali.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hey, guys, so two questions on a couple things that don't make sense to me. The first one is just if we were to refocus on NAB here for a moment. And look, what looks like a change in the price rationality, at least in the data, despite certainly what you're saying. And it isn't your first quarter of seeing this, so I think it's important because your stock has been weighed down by this concern in the investment community about price rationality in North America.","And look, for years you've agreed with the idea that the price elasticity in the category suggests price rationality. But what we're seeing in the results, not just this quarter, for the past couple quarters, and then in Nielsen on NAB specifically is really suggesting that there is lower rate, there's lower mix, and certainly lower marketing spend at least in the quarter, it looks like in that in NAB. And by the way, your volumes, your shares, and most probably your sales are not really responding. Meanwhile, your competitors are taking 1.5% to 3% pricing or price\/mix systematically and pretty logically.","So I want to give this opportunity to either clarify what I'm missing because we have broken out rate and mix, to your earlier point. And look, I believe that you're not going back on what you said before about price rationality and taking prices up, but we'd really love your assurance and your clarity that we're going to see pricing up \u2013 in line with competition I think is the language you used, but in line with the competition going forward in NAB, because it's a very, very important thing obviously for your stock and for the industry. So I really want to delve into the disparity between what we're seeing in the data and what you're saying.","And the second thing, a really easy one but potentially disappointing one, is that it looks like you have $0.08 on the quarter and $0.15 on the year from Britvic and Jordan gains and other one-time things, and it looks like it's in your core. And if it is in your core number, I'd love an explanation of why one-time things like this remain in your core. And it looks like from a quarter perspective, that would suggest you're missing EPS, at least our numbers, and it suggests consensus. And your EPS growth for the year was only about 5% excluding those items. So again, there too, I would love some clarity and better understanding. Thanks.","Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.","Hugh, do you want to take the question and I'll add to whatever you have to say?","Hugh F. Johnston - PepsiCo, Inc.","Yes, happy to do that, Ali. Let me get the second one out of the way first. You're right about the gains. And where that money went was about $0.03 on the 53rd week and lapping that, about $0.03 on investment back in ESSA, and about $0.04 or $0.05 of business disruption from hurricanes and floods, all of which were one-time items, and they were all in Q4. So hopefully, that helps you tie that one out.","Regarding the question on pricing, as I mentioned earlier, our strategy has not changed. We were, I think in many ways, the author for the industry of the strategy that the basis of competition is around innovation and brand building, and that pricing is something that we would expect to take consistently every year.","One point that that's a little bit hard to comb out of the data, but it connects back to the marketing investments that we're making back behind the big brands, we are seeing promotional price points that are consistent between ourselves and our competitors and full revenue price points that are consistent between ourselves and our competitors. But our velocities on full revenue have been slower than some competitive velocities.","The reason for that, we believe, is because we do need to refocus back on A&M behind the big brands and ensuring that, as we build displays, the displays are very much reflective of those big brands as well in a substantive way, both in the shelf and out on the perimeter of the floor. We did start to do that in Q4. You'll see more of it in Q1 and even more of it in Q2. So, the strategy remains the same.","I think the full revenue velocity piece is something that probably warrants a little bit further analysis, but I think it captures some of the effect that you're seeing in the numbers. As I mentioned earlier, as you pointed January, the one other factor is, in any given four-week period, you are going to see promotion timing between competition being distortive, but the point they made earlier over the course of a couple of quarters, I think, is more driven by this whole rev promotional mix than it is by us dropping prices further.","Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.","But the thing to remember, Ali, is when you're redoing the pricing architecture on certain products, it takes two to three quarters for it to play through the system. And second is, the good news is the portfolio works. Any which way you look at it, if you look at 2015 and 2016, NAB performed very well. 2017, there was a confluence of factors that caused some issues. And 2018, we have a strong marketing program, and we're maniacally focused on the business. I just think the overall portfolio works, and that's the benefit of having international, North America, and snacks, beverages and the Quaker business. So, we are feeling good about our prospects.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman of Barclays.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great, thanks.","Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.","Good morning, Lauren.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Good morning. I was curious if you could talk a little bit more about drivers of gross margin this quarter, down pretty in a fairly healthy way. I don't think we've talked much about that. And then part and parcel with that was anything more on channel mix. Hugh, you did comment a bit on e-commerce, but just curious anything on foodservice or convenience channel trends that may or may not have been contributing to that gross margin performance. Thanks.","Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.","Go ahead.","Hugh F. Johnston - PepsiCo, Inc.","Yeah. So, happy to do so, Lauren. I think if you look at overall PepsiCo gross margins, NAB is the big driver behind that for all the reasons that we've been talking about. It's a different way to sort of look at the financial performance of NAB. But given the deleverage in the system, that's affecting gross margins, as well as operating margins, obviously.","Regarding channel mix, some of the comments that I made earlier that we were talking about regarding c-store and velocities, in particular, it does have some impact in that channel. And as a result, as we invest more behind advertising and marketing, behind the big brands of Pepsi and Gatorade and Dew, I think you'll see improved performance from us in that channel, in particular.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Laurent Grandet of Credit Suisse.","Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.","Good morning, Laurent.","Laurent Grandet - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hey, good morning, everyone. In Q4, we saw the refranchising of the Thai business be enacted with Suntory. Similarly, we saw some more products and territories being handed over to Varun, your bottler in India. So, how should we think about these going forward, the strategy to continue refranchising more aggressively internationally? And also, I mean has your position in the U.S. changed in regards to the franchise model?","Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.","Internationally, when we find a very good bottler and we believe that they can run the business better than us, we will refranchise the business, and that's what we did in Jordan, that's what we did in Thailand. And we look across our portfolio internationally to see where it makes sense. And I'd say internationally, we're pretty much refranchised in the bulk of the markets or franchised, I should say, in bulk of the markets.","North America, we look at it constantly. We look to see the benefits of doing the refranchising again versus running it ourselves, and all the friction that results when you refranchise a business. And right now, our belief is that we can run it better than going through the whole pain of refranchising and then living with all the friction. We don't believe that going back and forth from owning it, refranchising it, owning it again is a decision we can make lightly. So, at this point, we are focused on extracting the productivity, driving the top line growth and making sure innovation sticks in the marketplace.","Again, let's not forget, 2015 and 2016 were very good years for North American Beverages. 2017 was a year that we would have liked to have had better performance. And now we're going into 2018 with a strong marketing calendar. So, let's wait for the year to play out.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.","Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.","Good morning, Judy.","Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you, good morning, so a couple of questions. One is just on your organic revenue growth guidance of at least 2.3%, which is in line with 2017 growth rate. I guess it's somewhat of a disconnect from the improving macro outlook, some of the robust innovation pipeline that you've talked about. So, I'm wondering if this is really more related to the retail environment and sort of the pricing pressure that you see in these markets.","Or is there some conservatism around how the innovations are going to work out in 2018? And then a little bit of color just in terms of some of the improvement you're seeing in emerging markets, particularly around China and India, as well as what you're expecting for Latin America.","Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.","Judy, it's a tough question to answer only because, clearly, we'd like to do better on top line growth, and that's what \u2013 our innovation is geared to better performance, clearly I think the macro is improving. But for all the positives we're seeing, as I mentioned in my script, there's a whole bunch of headwinds. Retail disruption is one of them. Consumer preferences are shifting in interesting ways.","On the one hand, there's a huge push towards health and wellness. On the other hand, they want to go back to products they know the best, but they're not consuming it in the quantities that they used to consume it in the past. So, it's an interesting dichotomy there. We talk about reinvesting back in the big brands, but a lot of the growth is coming from the small brands, so we have to launch those brands, too.","So, we are just making sure that any guidance we provide to you is sensible and something that we know for sure we can deliver. And that's why organic revenue growth at least in line with 2017 is a sensible guidance. Internally, we'd like to do more, but we want to be very, very cognizant of the headwinds around us, some of which we don't even understand at times because the consumer is not consistent.","In terms of macroeconomics, we are seeing the Chinese market improve. Post the GST, we are seeing the India market coming back. And Latin America, I think in 2017 Q4 going into 2018, we are seeing most of the markets in Latin America improve, too. So, as we said earlier, we're seeing an improving global macroeconomic conditions prevailing across the world. I mean Europe is a standout example. Both East and West Europe, we're seeing really improving macros which helps the business.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira of JPMorgan.","Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.","Good morning, Andrea.","Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning. So, I wanted to go back to Indra's comment on the previous conference call about giving innovation the appropriate space, in particular in beverages. And I would layer with your comments today on the cadence of the quarters. Is it fair to assume that you're likely getting more shelves on better displays?","And Hugh mentioned also on the displays and some of the four initiatives that you had on the trade with the new launches, I read in the first quarter or, usually, I'm assuming you have some visibility because that's usually what the time that it rests in the U.S. And from a promotional standpoint, are you expecting to lift some of the promotions we saw in the fourth quarter, so we can see a better operational EBIT margin division for the balance of the year for 2018?","Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.","I'll take parts of the question and then, Hugh, you can take other parts of the question.","Hugh F. Johnston - PepsiCo, Inc.","Sure.","Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.","I think, Andrea, from our perspective, whether it's a classic Mountain Dew or a Pepsi or our core brands, through our DSD system, they go in and they have their space on the shelf. When we launched the right innovation for the marketplace, low-calorie Lemon Lemon or IZZE, they're all great tasting products and Lemon Lemon was voted the best new innovation for last year.","But when it takes space away from the core brands, the velocity is much lower, and we are trading a higher velocity product for a low velocity product. So, one of the things that we have to go back and look at is, should we incubate some of those products in the new distribution system, let them reach a certain size before you put them in the main DSD system because, clearly, they need to be incubated in a different place in the store, especially in the single-serve channels. And that's what we're working through. It's not that we are backing off the innovation. It's how we get that innovation to the market, especially if it's on \u2013 not on our big brands.","Let me turn to products like Mountain Dew Ice which we launched as part of our Super Bowl launch. Great tasting, lower-calorie Mountain Dew, tastes just like Mountain Dew, a lemon lemon Mountain Dew \u2013 or a lemon Mountain Dew, I should say. We put it through the DSD system. It's a Mountain Dew. It's doing well. But that's a big brand. It's not a Lemon Lemon, which was a new brand. So, we are trying to tweak this whole small brand innovation which will become big over time, but how do we incubate it in our distribution system and specifically where in the store should it go.","Should it go and take space from our big brands, or should it have new incremental space? The good news is our relationships with the retailers are so strong that they know that we are maniacally focused on driving growth for them. So, they like to give us the space because we handle displays and merchandising very well, and we make it easier for the retailers to do business with us.","Hugh, did you want to add anything on this?","Hugh F. Johnston - PepsiCo, Inc.","I think you covered it well. The only thing that I would add briefly is, these are not either\/or types of questions. There is a bit of a balance between the two. And as we talked about our Q3, we may have gotten our balance a little bit off. And we're course correcting that balance. So, I expect that our big brands will get plenty of presence, but that doesn't mean we're backing off on the innovations, particularly of the newer, smaller healthier brands because we know over time that those businesses are going to turn into good-sized businesses for us. They're just taking time to incubate.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Powers of Deutsche Bank.","Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.","Hi, Steve. How are you?","Steve Powers - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","I'm good. Thank you. Good morning.","Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.","Morning.","Steve Powers - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey. I just want to \u2013 I guess I want to revisit Judy's question on the top line growth guidance from a slightly different perspective. So, if we step back and look at fiscal 2017 and 2018 as a whole, just based on the results today and the outlook today, there's just obviously a significant amount of reinvestment that you've been making ahead of the implied base rate algorithm, which I know you addressed in your prepared remarks. So, a reinvestment of productivity wins, reinvestment of the extra week in 2017, effective reinvestment of one-time gains like Jordan and, obviously, tax reform.","And then despite that, as you acknowledged, we're not really seeing advantaged growth at the total company level. So I guess the question is how do you or how should we think about the ROI on all these reinvestments? Is this just symptomatic of a higher cost of growth structurally as you work through changes at the retailer and consumer level, or are there reasons beyond macro improvement to expect better results; i.e., acceleration in 2019 and beyond? Thanks.","Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.","Stephen, I think some of what you said is right because, as I said earlier, there are a whole bunch of puts and takes. There are headwinds in the marketplace. There are tailwinds. And the investments we are making, think of them in two buckets. Some of the investments we have to make because the cost of business has gone up. Example is all the investments we make in food safety because of FSMA, the investments we have to make in cyber security. You can never fully protect your system, but investments keep going up. Those are investments you make to protect the core business. And they don't result in increased top line, but they prevent major accidents from happening. That's the whole hope. We keep making those investments because that's the nature of the business.","In terms of investments in innovation, advertising to drive the top line growth, our hope is that we get even more attractive top line growth because of those investments. Sometimes there are headwinds on the categories or headwinds on our businesses that dampen the growth. As I said to you in our prepared remarks, we would like that top line growth to be higher, and that's what we are focused on. But when you have the consumer shifting to smaller brands, but doesn't stick with the smaller brands and then comes back to the big brands, our innovation starts to not yield the kinds of benefits that we're seeing.","So I think we're going through a period of incredible disruption between consumer preferences, retail channel changes. And even our 2.3% should be at the high end of top line growth in our food and beverage space. Believe me, we are focused on increasing that growth rate substantially. But at this point, given what we are seeing in the marketplace, I think it's prudent to count on that number because we're saying it's at least in line with 2017. I don't know if you want to add anything, Hugh.","Hugh F. Johnston - PepsiCo, Inc.","Indra, the only thing I would add to that, Steve, is that if you take a multiyear look at this, generally speaking, our revenue growth has been reasonably in excess of our peer group. And I think that's reflective of getting returns on a lot of the investments we've made ex the investments that Indra mentioned that we need to make for defensive purposes, going all the way back to 2012 when we put a substantial investment in the business.","If you look at where we landed in 2017, most of our businesses are performing very well and the PepsiCo portfolio is performing very well. But our biggest revenue business had a challenging year, and that was clearly a drag on the growth rate. And it's going to take a few quarters to course-correct that. I think our guidance is reflective of that. As Indra said, we view our guidance as what we're trying to hit or beat. We obviously know that investors rely on that guidance quite substantially, so we do try to make sure that we are highly confident in the guidance that we give. But we surely don't view it as a cap, and that's certainly been evident over the last five years of performance.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Swartzberg of Stifel Financial.","Mark David Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks. Good morning, Indra. Hi, Hugh, two questions. And thank you for taking the questions. Frito-Lay North America improved quite nicely in the quarter. So could you tell us a bit about why that was and how it affects your outlook there?","And then really on the other direction, so to speak, Latin America weakened in the quarter, volume weakened. To what extent is that Mexico? To what extent is that Brazil? And I apologize if I missed that in your prepared remarks.","Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.","In Frito-Lay, all the innovation is working. Distribution is excellent, merchandising is great, and it's all working. And it's a machine that has been fine-tuned over the years and it's working and all of the Power of One programs are working, too. They're doing a lot of interesting merchandising with beverages, and the whole portfolio is working. And I think that's what we expect from Frito-Lay, to deliver flawless performance. I think Q4 was extraordinary, but the hope is that Frito-Lay will continue to deliver nicely going forward. In fact, I think Global Snacks is doing well too.","Hugh F. Johnston - PepsiCo, Inc.","Yes.","Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.","Latin America, Q4 was the brunt of the extraordinary force majeure actions, earthquake to hurricanes to everything that hit that part of the world. And in spite of that, the fact that they put up those kinds of results I think is extraordinary. And clearly, markets like Brazil are coming out of economic depression. But we're seeing signs of improvement. So I look at Latin America and say, going forward, you should see improving performance. Frito-Lay, solid steady results, as we always seem to expect from Frito-Lay.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brett Cooper of Consumer Edge Research.","Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.","Good morning, Brett.","Brett Cooper - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Good morning, a couple questions. Indra, you guys talked a lot about disruption at the retail space. How much of that disruption informed your decision to hold on to the bottling businesses in the U.S.?","Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.","Control of distribution is what I would say, not necessarily holding on to bottling system because that's really distribution. I think it's important that as retailers just disrupt themselves and you're going to see big changes, our distribution systems don't cause more angst for the retailer.","I'd say when the bottling system was not part of PepsiCo, the biggest friction in the system was having to negotiate with retailers with our bottler alignment. And any of our innovation, we couldn't get it to the marketplace because the bottlers had a different agenda. Now we are largely aligned, and that's why retailers give us such high marks, because when you talk to PepsiCo, you have an aligned system on snacks and beverages that serves the retailer very well. So with retail disruption, that control of distribution system becomes even more important.","But I want to tell you something. If we believe, if we believe, and we haven't come to that conclusion at all, if we ever believe that that distribution system is better in the hands of somebody else and they can do a better job than we do, we are a team that's maniacally focused on shareholder value creation. So believe me, we will make the right decisions. But at this point, it's our belief that we can do a better job running the system. And as you see more innovation, more retail disruption, we cannot afford friction with the distribution system.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Amit Sharma of BMO Capital Markets.","Amit Sharma - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hi. Good morning, everyone, Hugh, a question for you. Gross margins were weak again in this quarter, have been weak for the last several quarters. As we look to 2018, do we still expect this trajectory to continue and operating cost savings to cover for that? And then a quick one for Indra. Last quarter, you talked about c-stores being weak. Have you seen a full recovery in that channel this quarter?","Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.","I would say, recovering trend in these channels. Remember, the first couple of weeks of the quarter, the weather was quite terrible across most of the country. And so, after the first couple of weeks, we are seeing recovering trends in the c-store channel. Hugh, you want to talk about gross margins.","Hugh F. Johnston - PepsiCo, Inc.","Regarding gross margins, I mean we don't guide on quarter-to-quarter on lines of the P&L, generally speaking. But as I mentioned earlier, NAB just has such a significant impact on our overall financials given the size of that business. As NAB's performance improves sequentially in the coming quarters, I think you'll see gross margins improve sequentially as well.","Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.","So, thank you all for your questions. So, to summarize, we are pleased with our results for 2017. We have good plans in place to continue to perform well in 2018.

Mr. Pamnani, you may begin.","Ravi Pamnani","Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. I\u2019m joined this morning by PepsiCo\u2019s Chairman and CEO, Ramon Laguarta; and PepsiCo\u2019s Vice Chairman and CFO, Hugh Johnston. We\u2019ll begin with some brief prepared comments from Ramon and Hugh, and then open up the call to your questions.","Before we begin, please take note of our cautionary statement. We will make forward-looking statements on today\u2019s call, including about our business plans and 2020 guidance. Forward-looking statements inherently involve risks and uncertainties and reflect our view as of today, and we are under no obligation to update. When discussing our results, we refer to non-GAAP measures, which exclude certain items from reported results. Please refer to today\u2019s earnings release and 10-K available on pepsico.com for definitions and reconciliations of non-GAAP measures and additional information regarding our results, including a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from forward-looking statements.","And finally, as disclosed in our earnings release this morning, we are now reporting four international divisions versus three previously. This reflects changes made to our management reporting structure. Therefore, certain international division results have been restated for the full years 2017, 2018 and 2019. Specifically, our former Europe Sub-Saharan Africa division has been reclassified as Europe and will no longer include Sub-Saharan Africa.","And our former Asia, Middle East, North Africa division has been reclassified into two divisions: Africa, Middle East, South Asia, or AMESA; and Asia Pacific, Australia, New Zealand, China, or APAC. There are no changes to the remaining divisions or our consolidated results.","And now it\u2019s my pleasure to introduce our Chairman and CEO, Ramon Laguarta.","Ramon Laguarta","Thank you, Ravi, and good morning, everybody. Approximately about a year ago, we embarked on a plan to make PepsiCo Faster, Stronger and Better. We\u2019ve made very good progress against these initiatives, and I\u2019m pleased to report that we met or exceeded each of the full year financial targets that we communicated to you about a year ago. Most notably, organic revenue growth accelerated to 4.5% in 2019, our fastest rate of growth since 2015.","Our organic revenue growth was very broad-based across all divisions, with Frito-Lay delivering its fastest rate of growth since 2013 and PBNA delivered its fastest rate of growth since 2015. Our developing and emerging markets also delivered high single-digit growth despite ongoing volatility and uncertainty in certain parts of the world. We invested in becoming Faster by increasing our global advertising and marketing spending by more than 12% for the full year, reflecting investment across snacks and beverages, and in both our large and established brands and our emerging brands; expanding our market presence by increasing route capacity, adding merchandising racks and coolers and advancing the technologies that we deploy to drive greater and more precise execution; and investing in additional manufacturing capacity to remove bottlenecks and increase growth capacity for our products.","This includes investments in new plants, new lines and added distribution infrastructure. Whilst we intend to continue to invest back into our business, we know that sustaining higher growth would require building stronger capabilities, ones which will be difficult to match by our competitors. During 2019, we enhanced our consumer and customer-facing capabilities, strengthened our organizational culture and transformed our cost management. Specifically, we invested in data analytics and other information technology to build consumer intimacy and achieve precision at scale.","By capturing and analyzing more granular consumer-level data, we can understand the consumer in a more individualized way to both customize communication and executing in every store with precisely the right products placed in the right location and at the right price. We strengthened our omnichannel capabilities, particularly in e-commerce, but our retail sales were nearly $2 billion in 2019. To meet the growing need across channels for greater customization and faster innovation, we\u2019re investing in an end-to-end agile value chain that can deliver more precision and variety to enable us to win in the marketplace.","We migrated our organizational structure closer to the market in order to improve speed, increase accountability and become more locally focused. And we evolved our way \u2013 our values and ways of working to foster a culture where employees act like owners with a greater sense of empowerment and accountability. We call this The PepsiCo Way, which includes a set of seven leadership behaviors that have been rapidly embraced by our organization. And we took a completely holistic approach to cost management, one in which we manage all costs as an investment.","In doing so, we challenged the entire cost structure to evaluate cost and benefit of our spending. In 2019, we delivered in excess of $1 billion in productivity savings and plan to deliver this amount annually through 2023. Finally, becoming Better reflects our aspiration to continually integrate purpose into our business strategy and brands as more is expected of corporations by society. We prioritized and embraced a set of focused initiatives to help build a more sustainable food system. These include advancing benefits to farmers and communities through more sustainable agriculture. We intend to achieve 100% sustainably farmer-sourced agricultural raw materials by the end of 2020, which include potatoes, whole corn, oats and oranges.","Improving water stewardship. We\u2019re striving to improve water use sufficiency and aiming to replenish 100% of the water we consume for manufacturing in high water risk areas by 2025. Circular packaging. By 2025, we intend to increase recycled content in our plastics packaging to 25% and reduce 35% of virgin plastic content across all our beverage portfolio.","Improving choices across our portfolio by reducing added sugars, sodium and saturated fats. Mitigating the impact of climate change by reducing absolute greenhouse gas emissions across PepsiCo\u2019s value chain by 20% by 2030. And finally, advancing respect for human rights, promoting a diverse and inclusive workplace and increase the earnings potential \u2013 earnings potential of women to drive economic growth and increased food security.","Our commitment to becoming Better was most notably demonstrated by appointing our first-ever Chief Sustainability Officer and by a green bond offering that generated almost $1 billion in net proceeds to advance our sustainability agenda.","To complement our Faster, Stronger and Better initiatives, we also made investments to fortify our portfolio for future growth. Specifically, we invested in our SodaStream business, which grew net revenue more than 20% last year in order to capture an incremental growth opportunity. We announced our intent to acquire BFY Brands, the makers of the fast-growing PopCorners brand, which will enhance our premium snack portfolio. We\u2019re in the process of acquiring Pioneer Foods, which will build the foundation for future growth and scale in Africa, a key emerging market where our growth opportunities remain vast.","And we acquired CytoSport, the makers of Muscle Milk, which expands our presence in sports nutrition, providing opportunities for additional growth and category expansion. As we aspire to be the global leader in convenient foods and beverages by winning with purpose, we believe these investments position us well to win in the marketplace.","Now let me discuss our operating results. As I noted earlier, our organic revenue growth accelerated to 4.5% for the full year 2019 versus 3.7% in 2018, exceeding the initial target we set a year ago. All our divisions contributed to this growth, including a 3% increase in developed markets and an 8% increase in developing and emerging markets.","Frito-Lay North America had a very strong year with a 4.5% increase in organic revenue, along with an acceleration of volume growth in the second half of the year. The business gained value share in both salty and savory snacks in 2019 and improved its customer service levels. Frito\u2019s results were driven by the investments we made in innovation, marketing and consumer insights, supply chain and manufacturing and go-to-market capacity. This included a double-digit increase in advertising and marketing spend, additional plant, warehouse and distribution center capacity, and additional routes, racks and selling resources.","Frito delivered net revenue growth in all of its large mainstream brands like Lay\u2019s, Doritos, Tostitos, Cheetos, Ruffles and Fritos and double-digit growth in emerging premium brands such as Bare and Off the Eaten Path. Our multipack offerings also delivered very good growth as we have continuously expanded the variety of brand and flavor combinations. The breadth of our growth was also evident across every key retail channel. We increased net revenue growth in grocery, mass, club, convenience, foodservice and e-commerce.","And Frito-Lay was once again the number one contributor to U.S. food and beverage retail sales growth in 2019. With respect to the fourth quarter, Frito delivered 3% organic revenue growth, driven by 2% volume growth and 1% net price realization. The deceleration in net price realization. The deceleration in net price realization was largely a function of the timing of pricing actions taken in 2018. We expect our net price realization trends to improve over the coming months and have strong innovation and merchandising plans in place for the business to deliver very good growth in 2020.","PepsiCo Beverages North America delivered 3% organic revenue growth in 2019 with a sequential acceleration in the fourth quarter, which represented its fastest rate of organic revenue growth in four years. The business benefited from improved local market focus and execution driven by our new field structure, increased go-to-market capacity, significantly stepped up advertising support, innovation and additional selling resources.","We also invested in improving our presence in the away-from-home channel by becoming the preferred beverage partner for JetBlue, Carnival Cruise Lines and Regal Cinemas for the past year. Investing in our brands has been a big focus area for PBNA\u2019s advertising and marketing spend, increasing in a double-digit range for both the fourth quarter and full year with increases in our large brands, such as Pepsi, Gatorade and Mountain Dew.","Trademark Pepsi posted its sixth consecutive quarter of net revenue growth with strong double-digit growth in our Pepsi Zero Sugar product. Gatorade accelerated as the year progressed and ended the year on a very strong note with high single-digit growth in the fourth quarter, led by Gatorade Zero, which delivered more than $600 million in measured retail sales in 2019.","Innovation played a very important role at PBNA this year with Gatorade Zero, bubly and Mountain Dew Game Fuel having cumulatively delivered more than $1 billion in measured retail sales. Other brands, including Propel and Lifewater delivered strong double-digit net revenue growth, while Pure Leaf and Starbucks delivered high single-digit growth in 2019.","Finally, we have plans in place to build on our recent innovation successes. We will invest in BOLT24, a functional beverage we launched last year that supports athletes around the clock by providing advanced, all-day hydration. We recently introduced Zero Sugar variants of Mountain Dew and Mountain Dew Game Fuel, which offer the same bold taste as the originals without the sugar. And we will roll out Pepsi Cafe, a coffee-infused cola beverage that will be available for a limited-time offering in U.S. stores as of April.","Rounding out our North America performance. Quaker Foods delivered 1% organic revenue growth for the full year, with double-digit net revenue growth in our light snacks business and Gamesa cookies and mid-single-digit growth at Aunt Jemima and Roni. I want to conclude our discussion on North America by acknowledging terrific work of our customer and supply chain teams have done.","Specifically, PepsiCo was awarded the number one ranking in the 2019 Kantar PowerRanking survey, the fourth consecutive year we\u2019ve claimed the top spot; and the top two rankings in 2019 U.S. Advantage survey core food multichannel report. These surveys reflect our customers' view of PepsiCo as a valued partner and demonstrate the benefits of investing with our customers to help drive growth.","Now moving on to international markets. Each of our international divisions delivered strong organic revenue growth in 2019. These results include some performance across our developing and emerging markets, with high single-digit organic revenue growth for both the fourth quarter and the full year. We continue to have a long runway for growth in many international markets, and our results reflect the benefits of our increased investments as we continue to leverage our global capabilities to drive higher per capital consumption and improve market share, while executing in locally relevant ways.","In Latin America, we grew organic revenue growth \u2013 we grew organic revenue 7% for the full year, with growth in both snacks and beverages despite ongoing macroeconomic volatility and political uncertainty in certain markets. Mexico, our largest market, delivered high single-digit growth for both the quarter and the full year. Our next largest market, Brazil, delivered mid-single-digit growth for the full year with an acceleration in the fourth quarter to high single-digit growth. In Europe, we grew organic revenue 5.5% for the full year, with very good growth both in snacks and beverages.","Our largest market, Russia, delivered mid-single-digit growth for the fourth quarter and the full year. The United Kingdom delivered low single-digit growth for the full year. But very encouragingly, it exited the year with mid-single-digit growth in the fourth quarter. Other highlights include double-digit growth in Turkey and high single-digit growth in Poland for the full year.","Moving to our Asia, Middle East and Africa regions. During the fourth quarter, we took the opportunity to think more strategically about this part of the world. We decided to split the organizational structure of our prior AMENA division into AMESA, which includes Africa, Middle East and Africa regions. During the fourth quarter, we took the opportunity to think more strategically about this part of the world.","We decided to split the organizational structure of our prior AMENA division into AMESA, which includes Africa, Middle East and South Asia; and APAC, which includes Asia Pacific, Australia, and New Zealand and China. By creating one operating sector centered on the Asian consumer and another centered on the Middle Eastern, South Asian and African consumer, we believe we can enhance our focus on accelerating top line growth. AMESA delivered 6% organic revenue growth for the full year.","This includes double-digit growth in Pakistan and Egypt and mid-single-digit growth in India and Saudi Arabia. APAC delivered 9% organic revenue growth for the full year, led by strong double-digit growth in China and Vietnam and high single-digit growth in Thailand and the Philippines.","To conclude, our priorities for 2020 remain consistent with our discussions today. We expect to deliver 4% organic revenue growth and 7% core constant currency earnings per share growth in 2020. And we will continue to invest back into the business to evolve our portfolio and transform our value chain; build next-generation capabilities, particularly leveraging technology to enhance our insights, speed and precision; grow our talent and simplify our organization to be more consumer and customer-centric; invest in our brands, both large and emerging; and reduce our cost structure to free up resources to fund our investments. These priorities will always be executed with an eye towards enhancing our marketplace competitiveness and delivering, of course, long-term value creation. With that, let me now turn the call over to Hugh.","Hugh Johnston","Good morning everyone. As Ramon noted, for 2020, we expect to deliver 4% organic revenue growth and 7% core constant currency earnings per share growth. We expect foreign exchange to have an approximately negative 1 percentage point impact on net revenue and core EPS growth and, therefore, expect our core U.S. dollar EPS to be $5.88 in 2020. For 2020, we also expect our core \u2013 annual core effective tax rate to be approximately 21%, free cash flow of approximately $6 billion, reflecting CapEx of approximately $5 billion. The higher rate of capital spending is associated with accelerating progress on our strategic growth priorities, as Ramon laid out earlier. We expect our capital spending to remain at or around these levels for the next few years and now expected to moderate to 5% of sales by 2023.","We expect total cash returns to shareholders of approximately $7.5 billion in 2020, comprised of dividends of $5.5 billion and share repurchases of $2 billion. The expected cash returns reflect a 7% increase in the annualized dividend per share effective \u2013 with the dividend expected to be paid in June 2020. This will represent the company\u2019s 48th consecutive annual dividend per share increase.","With respect to your models, please keep in mind the following: In the first quarter of 2020, we face a difficult comparison for both organic revenue and core constant currency operating profit growth at Frito-Lay North America and our international divisions. With that, now we\u2019ll open it up for your questions. Operator, we\u2019ll take the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane of Bank of America.","Bryan Spillane","Good morning everyone. So I guess, I just got a few questions this morning about Frito and the kind of the deceleration there this quarter, and I guess, what\u2019s implied in the first quarter commentary now. So maybe, Ramon, can you talk a little bit about the dynamics there, I guess, lapping some price increases? And then kind of what gives you confidence that, that can reaccelerate as we move through 2020?","Ramon Laguarta","Good morning Bryan. Yes, listen, we feel very good about Frito performance in 2019. So we accelerated the highest level, I think, in the last seven years, so overall, a very good year. Volume went up and volume across all our brands, the big brands and also the new brands that we\u2019re trying to build for the future. So very positive performance and also, as I said, across all channels. So very, very holistic, very good performance, I would say. The deceleration in Q4, as I said on the statement, is based on the pricing decision in 2018.","We took priced in Q4. This year, we didn\u2019t take any price in Q4. It will be more of a price decisions now in Q1, second half of the Q1. So that\u2019s the main difference. We feel good about it especially the volume acceleration. The fact that our pounds went up almost 1% this year versus last year, it\u2019s a pretty positive to us testament that our investments are working in driving per capita consumption, which at the end is the long-term driver of the business.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Powers of Deutsche Bank.","Steve Powers","A question actually on PBNA. As you think about the fourth quarter performance across that division and the acceleration you saw, I guess, which brands or businesses performed best versus your expectations in the quarter? And as you look forward to 2020, how do you think about the trajectory there, just balancing the current momentum against what will be difficult laps in Gatorade and bubly, especially there\u2019s lots of competition and the expansion on the shelf and in the cooler of an energy category in which you\u2019re still underrepresented? Thanks.","Ramon Laguarta","That\u2019s a good question. Listen, we feel \u2013 I mean, if there\u2019s any division that we feel very strong about the turnaround this year, it\u2019s PBNA, right? We feel good about the way we\u2019re exiting the market and the year and also how we\u2019ve driven that performance. So if you think about our innovation has been very, very strong across the year, and you mentioned, some of the successes. So Gatorade, clearly driving sustainable growth by innovating in a new space like Zero.","Zero has driven a lot of new consumers into the sports category, and so it\u2019s not like a summer-related growth of Gatorade. It is a, I would say, a structural, more penetration of the brand into consumers that were not consuming Gatorade. So we see that as sustainable. Actually, it accelerated during Q4. We see Pepsi, as I said, with sustainable growth. So that makes us feel good. That\u2019s also driven by new variants like Zero, smaller packages that are driving consumption.","So we see Pepsi as well driving sustainable growth. We continue to see very strong performance in our coffee business, and our partnership with Starbucks is as more robust than ever. I think the kind of innovation we\u2019re bringing to the market and how we\u2019re moving that category also into new premium spaces with innovation is very powerful. Very strong performance across the year, including Q4. The same with our tea categories. Pure Leaf continues to drive a lot of growth and develop the category. You mentioned bubly.","I think bubly is just scratching the surface as a brand. It\u2019s still very underpenetrated. It\u2019s a brand that, I think, space-wise also has a lot of opportunities. So I think a lot of people don\u2019t even know about the brand or haven\u2019t tried the brand. So I think it\u2019s already a pretty meaningful-sized brand. So we feel very strong about the way we\u2019re driving growth for PBNA. It\u2019s not short term or it\u2019s really developing the different segments of the category where we participate, expanding those categories, bringing more consumers into this space.","There\u2019s another lever, I think, of sustainable growth for PBNA, which is driven by better execution. And this better execution, obviously, comes from more focus on execution. But I think the organizational change we\u2019ve made to the business where we have decision-making closer to the consumer and to the market is making us a better execution company in PBNA. I think that is, again, it\u2019s not a 1-year event. It\u2019s a multiyear opportunity that we\u2019re going to get better with better tools and better focus. So we feel strong about where we finished. We feel strong about the drivers of that growth, not being one-off, but being very sustainable drivers of growth.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ali Dibadj of Bernstein.","Ali Dibadj","Just want to go back to FLNA for a second. I get the price increases in 2018. But even on a stacked basis, it looks like there\u2019s been some challenges. I think, as you can imagine, or you\u2019ve probably seen almost all of us have written about FLNA and concerns about it. And I get, Ramon, that you said that you\u2019re going to see some price realization improving through 2020. But I wonder with all the consumer work that you guys do, if you see anything at all that gives you pause from a structural perspective.","So are you seeing any changes driven by the consumers, in particular, on health and wellness that are accelerating? Or are you seeing anything from a competitive perspective as well? And we\u2019re all going to be at CAGNY next week, and every food company is going to say they\u2019re a snack company. And they like your margins, and they like your growth. So how does \u2013 are you seeing anything there at all? And how does that play into, if at all, what seems to be a little bit more, I guess, subdued guidance as a \u2013 of the company at the lower end of your long-term plan, especially after a heavy up year like you just had?","Ramon Laguarta","Yes. Listen, good question. And I think obviously, we\u2019re looking at long-term trends of the consumer and trying to adjust the portfolio to those trends. If you look at the way we\u2019re driving the growth in 2019 and the way we think we\u2019ll drive the growth in the next year, it\u2019s been across all brands. So we\u2019ve seen the consumer continue to go back to our classics, Lay\u2019s and Doritos and Cheetos and Tostitos. The truth is that we\u2019re trying to improve the way we market those brands in a way we are personalizing the messages, the way we\u2019re creating unique content for different types of consumers and the way we innovate against those large brands.","At the same time, our kind of more permissible portfolio, our premium portfolio, that segment of our range is growing about two times the average of the company. So if you think about Off the Eaten Path, Bare, Simply, Smartfoods, I mean, all those brands that you would say they are probably preferred by some type of consumers that prefer more permissible snacks, they are growing two times.","But the beauty of our Frito-Lay portfolio and the same would apply to our PBNA portfolio, is that we\u2019re trying to grow both our classic brands, large brands that are well established, trying to modernize them, keep them very attractive to the consumers and then innovate into future spaces where the consumer might move at a different speed in different parts of the country as they decide to change their consumer habit. So we\u2019re evolving the portfolio. Some of the acquisitions we\u2019ve made also will help us in that respect. But we\u2019re also \u2013 we\u2019re innovating in those spaces ourselves. Off the Eaten Path is a great example.","The Simply portfolio is a great example that is giving us very high penetration in those consumers that you referred to. What we\u2019re seeing \u2013 and I think we talked about it last time, is there is a trend towards smaller packages. And that might be a way the consumer is also approaching snacking categories with portion control being a key driver of the occasion. So we see small packs.","And the fact that we\u2019re moving a lot of capacity into smaller packs, I think would continue to give us good growth in that space of more permissible snacking, either by portion control by new brands and products that are preferred by those consumers. We don\u2019t see a deceleration of the category. That\u2019s why you mentioned there\u2019s a lot of new players that want to participate in this snacking trend, which I think is true and is going to be here for a long time. And that would make us feel very positive about Frito because there are a lot of tailwinds to the snacking category.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley.","Dara Mohsenian","So just following up on some of the questions. I was hoping you could review a bit your visibility around the 4% corporate organic sales growth top line target for 2020. You\u2019re obviously coming off a solid year, so we\u2019ll have a tough comparison. There\u2019s some global volatility. So just wanted to get your perspective on the level of visibility at the corporate level. And obviously, we just covered Frito-Lay North America and PBNA, but perhaps you could also review what drove the strong momentum in D&E markets in 2019 and sustainability as we look out to 2020? Thanks.","Hugh Johnston","It\u2019s Hugh. I would say we have a good level of visibility into the revenue guidance. You know historically, we\u2019ve been pretty accurate on that, and I would expect that to continue to be the case. That said, as you sort of slightly noted, the world is certainly a volatile place, lots of events going on in a lot of areas of the world even as noted a bit with some of the news this morning. That said, we take the facts that we have and we always try to plan for at least some level of volatility as a part of developing our expectations for the year. Because history tells us most years, we\u2019ll have some volatility.","So I think, generally speaking, we have good visibility. Regarding developing and emerging markets at 8%, that\u2019s really a continuation, I think, of what we\u2019ve seen over a number of years. The per capita consumption opportunities in those markets are quite large. And I think we\u2019re doing a very good job. But we\u2019re also barely scratching the surface relative to what the ultimate opportunity could be. It\u2019s one of the reasons we\u2019re investing in growth because we think by virtue of realizing those per cap opportunities and driving growth, we\u2019ll be able to sustain this algorithm for a very, very long period of time.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira of JPMorgan.","Andrea Teixeira","Hi, good morning. Thank you. So I was just hoping that if you can elaborate more on the top line guidance being, as you said before, on the low end and then embed your comment about 12% growth in investment in A&P in 2019. How \u2013 do you think you\u2019ll reach the normalized level now? And what is the growth in marketing investment that you\u2019re assuming for 2020 embedded in your guidance? And if you can kind of compare that with the $1 billion cost saves that you normally have? And if you can update us on that metric as well? Thank you.","Hugh Johnston","Yes, good morning, Andrea. In terms of the guidance, actually, the guidance that we\u2019re giving this year is exactly the same as we gave 12 months ago. So obviously, we saw a world where the investments that we were making paid off a little bit better than we expected. And as a result, we got results and growth that were higher than that. Regarding whether we\u2019ve leveled off, I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll see the same level of growth in advertising and marketing this year. It will still grow. It might even grow a little bit in excess of the rate of sales growth. To a great degree, it\u2019s going to depend on the opportunities that we see in front of us.","We\u2019ve certainly funded our advertising line well going into the year. But frankly, if we see innovation taking off or if we see an opportunity in the marketplace to accelerate investment in order to capture even more growth, we\u2019re not going to be shy about doing that. And we\u2019ve put room into the way that we guide to give us the ability to take advantage of those opportunities. As I mentioned, we think we\u2019re in great categories. And we think right now, there\u2019s lots of opportunities to grow faster. So we\u2019re going to continue to do that, and at the same time, we\u2019re going to continue to invest in the stronger capabilities that allow us to sustain performance for a longer period of time.","Ramon Laguarta","And then, if I may add. The way we\u2019re approaching in every market, the opportunity, I mean, for 2020, we have, I think, very strong plans, well funded both on customer and consumer ideas. We\u2019re investing in additional capacity across the world. So our purpose here is to gain market share in every market where we compete. We\u2019ve been doing that in the \u2013 in 2019. We\u2019ll continue to do that in 2020. The compensation in the company is very geared to top line and market share growth. So that\u2019s the way we\u2019re starting the year. Our guidance, as Hugh said, includes the possibility of events during the year that might surprise us on the negative front. But I think the guidance reflects that positive attitude towards market share and then some uncertainty room in the overall number.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman of Barclays.","Lauren Lieberman","Good morning. I wanted to get maybe a little bit of an update on progress in expanding some of your \u2013 you put some classic brands in snacking internationally. As I understand it, Ramon, one of your key priorities or areas you thought there was sort of really untapped opportunity was getting distribution of Doritos and Cheetos and these classic brands into international and emerging markets. So if you could speak directly to what\u2019s been done this year, how much that\u2019s still really more of a 2020 plan, it would be really interesting. Thanks.","Ramon Laguarta","Yes. Lauren, good morning. We have a good playbook on \u2013 especially in the snack business, on how do we develop the category and what are the levers that we need to play in every market to deliver the per cap growth that we normally deliver in the markets. And there\u2019s obviously innovation, there\u2019s brand building, there\u2019s visibility, there\u2019s value, there\u2019s many levers that we play in that playbook. So to your point on brands, brands are part of that playbook. We have Doritos, I would say, in 75% of our international markets maybe, that\u2019s the number. We have Cheetos probably in 90% of our markets.","Lay\u2019s is, obviously, the brand that we normally tend to lead than Ruffles, the potato business because that\u2019s where I think we have more differentiation possibilities with our agro programs and our flavor programs. So \u2013 but don\u2019t take it as a brand exclusive per capita development opportunity. But it\u2019s a very holistic development opportunity that includes brands, innovation, and we\u2019re getting better at lift and shift or lift and adapt, as we call it, taking successful products from one market and rolling them out globally.","But there\u2019s a lot of work in our playbook in how we develop the point-of-sale, and we become available everywhere and also how we understand consumers in their pocket money and their affordability and then how do we adopt in every market, the price levels to the pocket money of the consumer, and it\u2019s working very well. I mean, the truth is that the snacks category, it\u2019s growing consistently at a very high level internationally. And we don\u2019t see any reason why it would not do that in 2020.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Laurent Grandet of Guggenheim.","Laurent Grandet","Good morning, Ramon and good morning, Huge. And congratulate Ramon on the very strong first put you as a CEO. I\u2019d like to focus on the Lipton opportunity. I mean, two weeks ago, Unilever CEO said the company was beginning a strategic review of its tea business. As we have been saying for quite some time now, we believe the acquisition of the balance of your JV with Unilever will be a net positive for PepsiCo. It is one of the fastest-growing segment globally, one where you have a market share leadership. So the acquisition would make a strategic sense, but also a financial one because you will be capturing 100% of the profit rather than just half. So could you comment on this opportunity and the role of the tea segment for PepsiCo in general, especially as you are now facing, I mean, a renewed competition with Fuze mostly in Europe, but also in international markets. Thank you.","Hugh Johnston","Good morning, Laurent. Thanks for the question. A couple of comments on that. Number one, we launched the tea venture with Unilever a couple of decades ago, and they\u2019ve been a terrific partner over the course of the last couple of decades. We\u2019ve built a nice ready-to-drink tea business, both in the U.S. and internationally. So we certainly feel good about that. As regards the JV, we really like where we sit very much right now. We think the JV has got good balance, and I think we find the ready-to-drink aspect of tea to be attractive. So we like where we sit. Obviously, the announcement may have some ramifications for Unilever, but we think it shouldn\u2019t have substantive ramifications for us going forward.","Ramon Laguarta","Laurent, we continue to do very well in the tea business. And it\u2019s a category that we see growing internationally. It\u2019s growing very fast in developed markets and also in developing. To your point on Europe, we continue to be leaders. We keep innovating there. The Pure Leaf brand is doing very well. The Lipton brand is continuing to expand. We like this category. We like what we\u2019re seeing. As Hugh said, we\u2019ll wait for events from Unilever.","Operator","Your next question comes from Rob Ottenstein of Evercore.","Rob Ottenstein","Great. Thank you very much. You announced some interesting changes, I guess, in the way you\u2019re managing the international business to capture more of the opportunities in Asia and Africa. I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more granularity in terms of how the strategy may change. Any changes in tactics, investment that you see putting behind those changes going forward? Thank you.","Ramon Laguarta","Yes. That\u2019s good. Yes. So there were a couple of reasons why we made this change in the organization. One is to manage a huge geography like from Africa all the way to Australia from one location, as what we\u2019re doing from Dubai, was a big burden on our people and our executives. So that was not the ideal. But fundamentally, more than that, which is also important, is that there are clearly different consumption patterns, different trends, different food cultures between, I would say, the group of countries centered around China and the group of countries centered around the Middle East and Africa.","So we think that by making this change, we\u2019re going to be innovating with more local relevance. We\u2019re going to be activating our brands with more local relevance. We want to be able to have resources close to the marketplace in the critical differentiators like R&D, like sales execution that will help us to perform better in the market. One of the critical opportunities for PepsiCo is to develop the international business. And I think Asia remains by far our number one opportunity. And China, of course, is a huge market, where we have a good business. It\u2019s growing very well, as I said in my remarks. But the opportunity is much, much higher.","So that\u2019s how we\u2019re thinking about this new organization, enabling a more sustainable and focused growth in those two parts of the world. Africa is another big opportunity for us. We\u2019re \u2013 hopefully, we\u2019re almost very close to concluding the Pioneer acquisition. That will give us a lot of scale in Africa, which serves also more focus than what we had in the past. And we\u2019re also allocating additional resources to Africa, which will help us expand in that continent, which obviously has a huge opportunity for our products.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Grundy of Jefferies.","Kevin Grundy","Great, good morning everyone. Ramon, can we come back to the energy drink category and kind of get more of an update on the company\u2019s strategy? It\u2019s not an area that PepsiCo has participated in, in a meaningful way. Company\u2019s had a partnership with ROCKSTAR, which is a brand which has lost share over time. Mountain Dew Kickstart hasn\u2019t really gained any traction in the category.","And your key competitor, of course, has been more aggressive historically both with it\u2019s investment in Monster and now the extension of the Coke brands. So the question is, is this an area of emphasis for PepsiCo either organically or through M&A? Or are you reasonably fine playing on the periphery? Thanks.","Ramon Laguarta","Thank you. Good question. Listen, obviously, we \u2013 the consumers are looking for more caffeine, right? I mean, it\u2019s clear that this is an opportunity that they\u2019re looking for. As the day is becoming longer and the commuting is longer, I mean, there\u2019s a lot of tailwinds to the use of caffeine. The way we\u2019ve been approaching this opportunity is, as we said in the past, from multiple dimensions. So we\u2019re playing in energy with ROCKSTAR. It\u2019s a brand that we think we have the opportunity to \u2013 working together with the ROCKSTAR owners, to develop and to reinvest, and I think we can do a better job there. But we\u2019re also especially working in those spaces from the coffee category, and I think our partnership with Starbucks has been great.","Triple Shot Starbucks this year has been a massive innovation, and it\u2019s nothing but a very good way to consume caffeine as well. We\u2019re looking at participating in lower caffeine levels from \u2013 and we just announced some innovation in our bubly brand, some innovation in our BOLT24 brand. So we plan to participate in the caffeine space from multiple dimensions, including doing a better job with ROCKSTAR and our partnership there. Brands like Mountain Dew Kickstart and Mountain Dew Game Fuel are good innovation from our own brands into that space, a bit more focused on particular opportunities, one on the morning occasion, one on the gaming occasion. They\u2019re getting good traction for us as well. So that\u2019s the way we\u2019re thinking now of participating in what is, as you say, a large opportunity and quite profitable.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell of SunTrust.","Bill Chappell","Thanks, good morning. Just going back to Steve Powers' kind of questions on \u2013 can you quantify a little bit more what gives you confidence on, I guess, specifically, Pepsi in North America and kind of the momentum this year? Maybe what stage we are in different pack sizes or innovation on the horizon or something just that gets you \u2013 because the comps don\u2019t get any easier, and certainly, there are other products out there. I\u2019d love to hear what you\u2019re seeing or quantify what you\u2019re seeing that gets you excited.","Ramon Laguarta","Yes. I mean we\u2019re excited. We have six quarters of growth for Pepsi continuously. And we\u2019re seeing the brand equity going up as we invest more in the brand, as our advertising gets better, and we\u2019re able to talk to consumers, the different segments with different messages and that\u2019s working very well. From the product point of view, we\u2019re seeing high growth, as I said last time, in smaller packs. So that\u2019s continued to help the penetration in households that had stopped buying CSDs. Now they\u2019re going back with the smaller packs.","So that\u2019s great. Zero is a very fast-growing brand. And for us, it\u2019s a great brand internationally. We\u2019re trying to develop it faster in the U.S. You saw our focus in the Super Bowl. Our execution is quite focused on Pepsi Zero. I mean Pepsi regular is growing back again. Again, I think there is more our execution and the fact we\u2019re able to execute with more granularity and better precision that\u2019s helping the Pepsi brand, along with the brand equity development. So that\u2019s what makes us feel very strong about Pepsi continuing to grow 2020 and in the coming years. We\u2019ll keep innovating. We\u2019re innovating in Pepsi flavors. We keep innovating with Pepsi Cafe. So we will keep bringing some news to the brand to continue the consumer engagement with our brand, our products.","Yes. That\u2019s good. Okay. Thank you. I think that concludes the Q&A. Thank you for your time and your participation in this morning\u2019s call. We\u2019re very pleased with the progress we\u2019ve made to date, and we\u2019re executing well against our key priorities. We look forward to updating you again on our progress throughout the year, and we thank you very much for the confidence you\u2019ve placed with us with your investment.

Your lines have been placed on listen-only until the question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] Today's call is being recorded and will be archived at www.pepsico.com. It is now my pleasure to introduce Mr. Jamie Caulfield, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Caulfield, you may begin.","Jamie Caulfield","Thank you, operator. With me today are Indra Nooyi, PepsiCo\u2019s Chairman and CEO, and Hugh Johnston, PepsiCo\u2019s CFO. We\u2019ll lead off today's call with a review of our third quarter 2016 performance and full-year outlook and then we\u2019ll move on to Q&A. We\u2019ve kept our comments brief this morning and intend to conclude the call by 8:45.","Before we begin, please take note of our cautionary statement. This conference call includes forward-looking statements, including statements regarding 2016 guidance based on currently available information. Forward-looking statements inherently involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those predicted. Statements made on this conference call should be considered together with cautionary statements and other information contained in today's earnings release and our in most recent periodic reports filed with the SEC.","References to organic revenue results exclude the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, structural changes, foreign exchange translation and, for the full year 2016, the impact of the 53rd week. To find disclosures and reconciliations of non-GAAP measures that we use when discussing our financial results, you should refer to the glossary and other attachments to this morning's earnings release and to the Investors section of his PepsiCo\u2019s website under the Events and Presentations tab.","As we discuss today's results, please keep in mind that our third quarter comprises the 12 weeks ended September 3 for our North American operations and the three months of June through August for most of our operations outside of North America.","And now it\u2019s my pleasure to introduce Indra Nooyi.","Indra Nooyi","Thank you, Jamie. I'm pleased to report our businesses continued to perform well in the third quarter. Specifically, we had more than 3% organic volume growth in global snacks and more than 2% organic volume growth in global beverages. While foreign-exchange translation continued to pressure our reported revenue results, we delivered more than 4% organic revenue growth, which represents an acceleration from the first half.","We generated positive net price realization in total. We stepped up investment in our brands, with A&M up 65 basis points as a percentage of net revenue and made incremental marketplace investments. We expanded gross and operating margins. We grew core constant currency operating profit 2% and up 6% excluding the impact of deconsolidating Venezuela. And core constant currency EPS grew 7% and up 11% excluding the Venezuela impact.","Our performance was well balanced by market type. Our developing and emerging market businesses grew organic revenue 8% for the quarter, with double-digit organic revenue growth in a number of markets, including China, Mexico, Brazil and Egypt. And our developed markets grew organic revenue 3%, led by Frito-Lay North America and North American Beverages. ","Year-to-date, our results are equally strong. Core constant currency operating profit grew 5% and up 8% excluding the impact of deconsolidating Venezuela. And core constant currency EPS grew 7% and up 11% excluding the Venezuela impact.","On the strength of our year-to-date results and our outlook for the fourth quarter, we have increased our full-year core EPS target to $4.78 from our previous target of $4.71, driven by the expectations and factors set out in this morning\u2019s press release.","In addition to our financial results, we\u2019re also delivering on other key performance metrics. Innovation ran at approximately 9% of net revenue in the quarter. Advertising and marketing is up another 60 basis points as a percent of net revenue year-to-date. And execution metrics are improving across the board, driving growth for us and our retail partners.","For example, the third quarter in the US, which is our largest market, we were once again the largest contributor to retail food and beverage sales growth. We generated approximately 37% of all food and beverage retail sales growth, significantly higher than our food and beverage dollar share position of less than 10%. And we generated more retail sales growth than all other $5 billion class food and beverage manufacturers combined.","We\u2019re on track to deliver $1 billion in productivity savings in 2016 and we\u2019re on track to deliver $7 billion in free cash flow, excluding certain items.","Our results reflect our commitment to Performance with Purpose. PepsiCo\u2019s vision to deliver top gear financial performance over the long-term by integrating sustainability into our business strategy. When we launch Performance with Purpose in 2006, we opted not to view sustainability simply through the lens of corporate social responsibility. Instead, we charted a course rooted in the firm belief that in order to meet the changing needs of our consumers, exercise responsible stewardship for environment, and create an environment within our company where each employee feels valued and can bring their whole selves to work, we had to transform the way we do business, weaving sustainability into the way we make money.","A decade into our journey, that belief is being validated and is preparing our company forward as this quarter\u2019s financial results demonstrate.","On the purpose side of Performance with Purpose, our first commitment was human sustainability, transforming our product portfolio with a particular focus on reducing sodium, saturated fat and added sugars, while dialing up our nutrition investments. And we're pleased with the progress we\u2019ve made.","As compared to 2006, we have reduced the average sodium in our food products by 11% per serving and removed more than 2,300 metric tons of sodium from key global food brands in key countries. We have reduced the average amount of saturated fat per serving by more than 15% in key global brands in a number of our major markets, including the United States, United Kingdom, China and Turkey. And we\u2019re making strides to reduce added sugars in our beverages through reformulation.","Our transformation efforts to date have resulted in a portfolio where we derive approximately 45% of our net revenue from products that we refer to as guilt-free. Those products include diet and other beverages that are below 70 calories per 12 ounces and snacks with low levels of sodium and saturated fat. And a full 27 points of the 45 points is made up of what we refer to as everyday nutrition, which are product with positive nutrients like grains, fruits and vegetables, unsweetened tea and water.","And our innovation focus reflects our commitment to portfolio transformation. Just to give you a few examples. Recently, we launched Quaker Super Goodness porridge sachets in the UK, made with whole-grain oats, quinoa, barley and flaxseed. And introduced carrot, pineapple, mango Tropicana Farmstand in the US made with 100% fruit and vegetable juices and no added sugar.","Sabra, built on the strength of our highly popular hummus, has established a range of authentic products that include guacamole, salsa, baba ganoush and Greek yogurt dips and spreads. Sabra now generates approximately $800 million in estimated annual retail sales in the United States, well on its way to becoming $1 billion brand.","Our Naked super premium fruit and vegetable juices and coconut waters are loved by consumers for their great flavor, all-natural ingredients and no added sugars or preservatives. We have doubled Naked\u2019s net revenue over the last six years and grown estimated annual retail sales to over $1 billion. We recently extended the Naked lineup with the introduction of Naked cold-pressed juices.","Propel Water, by the makers of Gatorade, zero calorie sports hydration beverage enriched with electrolytes and minerals, is enjoying renewed success in North America with year-to-date volume up 6%.","We\u2019ve also successfully expanded what we refer to as our guilt-free product lineup. Pure Leaf Tea is an example, a premium line of ready-to-drink teas, brewed and steeped simply and authentically from leaves picked at their freshest.","Since its launch in 2012, Pure Leaf has grown to more than $650 million in estimated annual retail sales. We\u2019re now elevating Pure Leaf into a super-premium line under the Tea House collection.","Our Baked! lineup is another example of how we're transforming our portfolio. Spurred by the success of the Baked! Lay\u2019s, we have broadened our baked lineup to include Baked! Doritos, Baked! Tostitos and Baked! Cheetos and have expanded the lineup to nine international markets where there is a lot of opportunity for further growth and market expansion.","And we recently launched, STUBBORN SODA, a new generation premium crafted, sparkling beverage that is just 9,200 calories per 12 ounces and is made with Fair Trade certified cane sugar and Stevia, with no high fructose corn syrup.","So it's the breath of our evolving product portfolio and our ability to innovate against it that enables us to generate consistent organic revenue growth.","Likewise, under Performance with Purpose, our environmental sustainability agendas had positive impacts, both on our business results and, more broadly, on the planetary share. By using fewer resources, water, packaging and energy, we are simultaneously shrinking our environment footprint and reducing our operating costs. We\u2019ve improved our water stewardship by adopting new technologies and processes, which have steadily reduced use per unit of production and we\u2019ve implemented innovative watershed management in water stressed and water scarce areas.","As a result, today, we\u2019re using approximately 25% less water per unit of production than we did when we embarked on Performance with Purpose. In addition, we have supported growers in our value chain in their pursuits of better water use management. And through the PepsiCo Foundation, we have successfully partnered to provide access to safe water for more than 9 million people globally.","We\u2019re using less packaging and generating less landfill waste. We have successfully reduced packaging, weight and size and increased postconsumer recycled content in our packaging. While reducing packaging weight and size, we removed almost 100 million pounds of packaging materials from the market in 2015 alone.","We have worked to increase the recycling rates of beverage containers among consumers and we have significantly reduced the amount of solid waste generated by our operations that are sent to landfills, achieving a rate of over 90% solid waste diversion away from landfills in 2015.","And we\u2019ve reduced greenhouse gas emissions by focusing on energy use and renewable energy and by modernizing our fleet with more fuel-efficient vehicles, routing and capacity utilization. In fact, compared to 2006, we\u2019ve improved the energy efficiency of our legacy operations by 18%.","Taken together, our environmental sustainability initiatives have not only had a significant positive impact on our planet, but they\u2019ve also contributed to our productivity savings. Over the past five years, our sustainability initiatives have generated more than $600 million in savings because we\u2019re simply using fewer resources in our businesses.","Combining our environmental sustainability savings with those of our other productivity initiatives, we're generating more than $1 billion in annual productivity savings. These savings are both providing fuel for reinvestment of the business and contributing to consistent margin improvement.","And we\u2019ve continued to invest in and promote initiatives to protect and support the safety, health, professional development and human rights for our global workforce. This includes promoting women's equal advancement and fostering a diverse and engaging culture that attracts the talent base needed to grow our high performing business.","We view our sustained top-tier results as a validation of our Performance with Purpose direction where we\u2019re balancing short-term results with ensuring PepsiCo remains successful for the long-term.","In the coming weeks, we will issue our annual sustainability report where we will share with you in much more detail our progress and accomplishments under Performance with Purpose","Just as important, we will lay out our sustainability vision and goals for the coming decade and our pledge to make our products more nutritious, our food system more sustainable, and our communities more prosperous. In doing so, we will pave the way for PepsiCo\u2019s continued growth.","So with that, let me turn it over to Hugh Johnston. Hugh?","Thank you, Indra. And good morning, everyone. As Indra mentioned, we're very pleased with our year-to-date performance. We\u2019re seeing a good mix of revenue and productivity within the P&L, driving the top line and margin results mentioned earlier, and we continue to exercise strong cash flow management and capital allocation discipline.","As a result, in the third quarter, we once again shortened our cash conversion cycle; in this case, by almost 10 days compared to Q3 of 2015. And we maintained our net capital spending on a rolling four-quarter basis, well within our target of 5% of net revenue.","I'm also pleased to report that we remain on track to return approximately $7 billion to shareholders in 2016, through a combination of $3 billion in share repurchases and $4 billion of dividends. During Q3, with the June payment, we increased our annualized dividends per share by 7%, which marks our 44th consecutive annualized increase.","Looking to the balance of year, as we mentioned, we increased our full-year core EPS target to $4.78, which incorporates the following: underlying core constant currency EPS growth of 10%, excluding the impact of Venezuela; an approximate 2 percentage point negative impact from the 2015 Venezuela deconsolidation; and an approximate 3 percentage point negative impact from foreign exchange translation based on current market consensus, which is an improvement of approximately one percentage point versus our July update.","Our outlook on the other metrics we provide remain unchanged from July and are set out in this morning's release.","For the analysts on the call, as you update your Q4 models, you should consider the following factors: the inclusion of the 53rd week in this fiscal year will benefit our full-year revenue results by approximately one percentage point, but is not expected to result in any impact to our core earnings per share as we intend to reinvest the benefits back into our business; our Q4 foreign exchange outlook implies a moderation of the headwind as compared to what we have experienced year-to-date, but this assumption is obviously subject to macro and geopolitical conditions, which remain quite volatile.","Given the timing of our commodity hedges, we face a difficult year-over-year gross margin expansion comparison in Q4. While we're lapping a large increase in A&M spending as a percentage of net revenue in the fourth quarter, we expect to continue to invest in A&M. And finally, while our full-year tax rate guidance remains unchanged, we will be lapping an unusually low core effective tax rate from Q4 2015.","So to summarize, our core constant currency earnings per share outlook 2016 has improved from our last call and we continue our focus on disciplined capital allocation and cash returns to shareholders.","With that, operator, we\u2019ll take the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.","Indra Nooyi","Good morning, Dara.","Dara Mohsenian","Hey, good morning. So 10% full-year core EPS growth guidance for this year is really pretty impressive, given the type of environment we\u2019re in, and that even assumes you don\u2019t beat again in Q4 like you have been recently. It looks like much greater SG&A leverage is driving this year, in particular, when compared to the prior few year. So albeit with one quarter left to go, I guess can you talk about what's driving that greater SG&A leverage, particularly given it looks like A&M will be up again solidly this year. And I'm assuming the answer is productivity, perhaps a bit less onerous FX. But on the productivity side, is the ramp up kind of sustainable versus the past years and how should we think about it going forward?","And then, on the other hand on the gross margin side, obviously, very strong expansion in the last few years, it did slow a bit sequentially this quarter, I'm assuming with less favorable commodities. But as we look out to Q4 and 2017, perhaps you can give us some guidance around commodities and how that impacts gross margins.","Indra Nooyi","Dara, we\u2019re not going to talk about 2017 today, but let me just take a shot at the first question you asked. And then, Hugh, you might want to add whatever you want to. On the SG&A leverage, it all starts first with topline growth. The minute you get good top line growth, you get leverage on all of the other SG&A costs that we have in the P&L. And so, this quarter was a very, very good top line growth at 4.2%. That's pretty significant. And that gives us leverage to start with. Couple that with the fact that many of our productivity programs, which we put in place very deliberately \u2013 it wasn\u2019t a productivity program where we just cut the cost for the sake of cutting the costs. We actually built the underlying capabilities. So when we take out the costs, they come out for good. So putting in the ERP systems, putting the right tools to ensure visibility across the company, all of that took some money. We invested, so that we could take out the costs permanently. And slowly, step-by-step, all of these costs are coming out in a very deliberate and a disciplined way. And so, a combination of the two gives us the SG&A leverage. The key thing to remember is that over a year or two years, the overall P&L works very well. Quarter-to-quarter, you might have different aspects of the P&L delivering differently. One quarter, it might be gross margin. Another quarter, it might be SG&A leverage. But I think over a long period of time, the P&L seems to be working quite well.","Hugh, do you want to add anything to that?","Hugh Johnston","I think you covered most of it, Indra. Two small items that I would add that I think are worth mentioning. Number one, the investments we've made in technology are not just making our selling system more productive by putting not just handhelds in the hands of our route salesmen, but actually putting iPads in the hands of our district managers, enabling them to be more effective and to manage more basically with the same or less resources. And the same is true of management more broadly in the G&A bucket. By virtue of leveraging the technology advancements that are out there, we\u2019re making our management frankly more productive, and that's enabled us to do more with less.","The other item that I would point to is we implemented support spending really late last year and into this year and we are seeing the benefits of that. Whether it's across travel or consultants or facilities, we have gotten smarter with our spending. And as a result, you are seeing flow-through of that productivity into margin improvement.","Indra Nooyi","And I think the part that we all feel good about is that the Smart Spending program, the emphasis was on smart. We wanted to make sure that we never cut into topline driving initiatives. And I think we are succeeding doing that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America.","Bryan Spillane","Hey, good morning, everyone. I\u2019ve got a question, I guess, just related to \u2013 if you can talk a little bit and give us some color on how especially developing and emerging markets sort of performed in the quarter and maybe whether or not you've got \u2013 you\u2019re beginning to see maybe some recovery or some stabilization in some markets. With oil prices up in Russia, it seems like we've heard the consumer a little bit better there. And just given the 5% organic sales growth you had in Europe and Sub-Saharan Africa and AMENA and 10% in Latin America, just can you give a little bit more color in terms of some of the performance there and whether you think maybe things will maybe stabilize or begun to bottom out there would be helpful. Thank you.","Indra Nooyi","We\u2019re in a troubled global economic environment. But in spite of that, I'd say, a lot of the emerging, developing markets in Q3 showed some signs of improvement. Now, whether they last or not, we don't know. But at this point, they\u2019re looking pretty good. Russia, we did see some improvement. The Pacific Rim, good economies, all from \u2013 the entire ASEAN was, if you want to put it that way. India is looking good. Even China is looking much than it did in the early part of the year. I'm just talking overall economic, not just our business. Then if you come over to Europe, Russia, clearly, we are seeing signs of improvement. And this is even before the oil prices started to stabilize and improve. East Europe still looks all right. Western Europe is not getting worse, so that's a good sign. And when you come to Latin America, look, we have good businesses there. And there's no question, Argentina had a troubled year. Brazil is having its share of troubles. But I'd say that, overall, the economy seemed to be holding up. But, more importantly, our businesses seemed to be performing quite well because retailers turn to us to deliver more of the growth because we have high velocity categories and we take labor off the store through our DSD systems. So I think retailers are turning more and more to us to deliver a lot of the growth. Overall, I\u2019d say cautiously optimistic about emerging and developing markets.","Operator","Our next questions comes from the line of Ali Dibadj with Bernstein.","Ali Dibadj","Hey, guys. So I have a set of questions about the balance between price and mix and volume and then just a question about bottling. First, on the price mix part, would love to get your sense around North America and AMENA specifically. So NAB volumes up which is great, but assuming kind of innovation, there is a lot of premium innovation, it sounded like, and that was good, channel shift, but better weather would have suggested to me at least a little bit of a more positive price mix kind of tailwind as well. But the price mix was only up 1%. So I want to get a sense there. Negative price mix in AMENA continues, arguably getting a little bit worse given the easier compares. So just on those two, would love to get a sense of that.","And then separately on bottling \u2013 I guess it is sort of related, I guess. But on bottling, would love to get a sense of how you are thinking about the right structure from a bottling perspective, given ABI\/SAB got approved. Do you care about blue and red under one roof? Do you even mind?","And then if you go to North America specifically, have you seen any kind of competitive disruptions, positive or negative, in the Coca-Cola re-franchise move to the bottling? Sorry for a lot there, but thank you.","Indra Nooyi","I'm just going to answer this last question and toss it to Hugh to talk about price mix and volume. We\u2019re not going to comment about the ABI deal closing with SAB Miller and the consequences for overall partnership. But let me talk about the North American situation. We\u2019re playing an operating game and we\u2019re pretty successful in playing a game where we own a large portion of our bottling system, we leverage Power of One. Our retailers seem to be quite happy with the service that we\u2019re providing and we're driving a lot of growth for them because we are able to service them exceedingly well. That is our strategy and that's how we\u2019re going to continue going forward. Let me turn it to Hugh to talk about price mix and volume. Hugh?","Hugh Johnston","Yeah, happy to. Good morning, Ali. Regarding North America, price mix was one, but it was actually a strong one. I think the number was exactly 1.3. And that is, as you said, a combination of price mix. We are continuing to get good pricing in carbonated soft drinks. The couple of factors I would remind you of is we do have deflationary commodities right now. So you\u2019re seeing a little bit less of that pricing flow through into retailers as we have deflationary commodities. The other is, we do have a negative water mix going on. So on the one hand, non-carbs were quite positive. But a portion of that was water which is, obviously, from a price mix perspective, negative. So, in total, with the 1.30 of price mix that we got, along with good productivity, you saw a profit of 10% in the quarter. So we think we\u2019ve got a very healthy mix of pricing and productivity in that market right now. And frankly, we see nothing but rational pricing going on in the marketplace.","Regarding AMENA, a couple of factors there. Number one, we did see some bottlers reducing their concentrate inventories. So the volume number that you see relative to the revenue number is in part driven by the fact that volume is driven by bottle and case sales and revenue was driven by concentrate shipments. So the numbers aren't quite as negative as they look in terms of what flows through the balance of the P&L. In addition to that, the pricing was not particularly in India, both in the snacks and in the beverage businesses. And those were both factors in the numbers for the quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank.","Bill Schmitz","Hi. Good morning.","Indra Nooyi","Good morning, Bill.","Bill Schmitz","Can you just talk a little bit more about the sources and sustainability of NAB growth? You, obviously, are doing a great job with Gatorade. It looks like the whole category is lifting quite a bit. So I'm just curious how much you think that is really good marketing and good activation versus maybe some favorable weather? And then, perhaps September trend since the quarter ended so early this year?","Indra Nooyi","I think NAB has been doing a great job in terms of innovation, very sensible marketing programs and then execution has improved quarter by quarter. And so, I'm very proud of this NAB team.","Clearly, Gatorade has done very well. Marketing programs are good. Execution is very, very good. It\u2019s been a good summer. All of those together did drive the growth of all beverages and definitely Gatorade.","As far as the rest of the categories go, we\u2019re playing the long game. We want to play the total beverage portfolio because we want to make sure that we go where the consumer is going. So teas are up, coffee is doing well, hydration is doing well, products like Kickstart which are sort of soft energy products, I\u2019d say, are doing well. I think, overall, the category is doing \u2013 our business is doing quite well and we are gaining LRB share, which is really our focus.","Lastly, food service is doing well. It\u2019s an area that we underperformed in many years ago with the bottlers coming back and we\u2019ve reinvested in food service. And that's growing too.","So, overall, I\u2019d say, innovation, incredible focus on execution, followed by productivity. All three are delivering good results in NAB.","Hugh Johnston","Indra, the only thing I would add to that \u2013 and Bill you mentioned it specifically \u2013 we didn't, but I would not overrate the impact of weather in the summer. While it\u2019s undoubtedly true, it was a very hot summer, last summer was also a very hot summer. So I'm not sure it was a particularly large overlap. You didn\u2019t hear us talk about weather in Q2 when it was cool in the spring. You won\u2019t hear us talk much about weather right now. We\u2019re focused on the things we can control, as Indra mentioned in her opening.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Powers with UBS.","Stephen Powers","Great, thanks. I was hoping you could help us bridge the margins, particularly in your North American businesses, which is where we saw the particular strength. Obviously, you cited revenue management [indiscernible] benefits as key drivers overall. And I am assuming that that applies in Frito-Lay and NAB as well, offset by those A&P investments. But harkening back maybe to Dara's original question, could you size for us also the commodity tailwinds, specifically in North American segments? Obviously, overall, they were inflationary, but there they seem to have helped. I am just curious as to how much?","Hugh Johnston","Yes. Steve, good morning. This is Hugh. As we disclosed in the release this morning, North America had slightly deflationary commodities. So from that perspective, it was undoubtedly a tailwind, but not a huge tailwind. The bigger drivers were number one, pricing. As you saw and as I mentioned earlier, we have 1.3 in North America beverages; in snacks, we had about 1.5 to 2 points of pricing. And then the balance of it was really productivity, whether it was continuing to expand our automation programs, continuing to leverage technology and SG&A, continuing to leverage Smart Spending to manage our non-labor costs and operating expense down. The big drivers were just flow-through off of that productivity to deliver the positive margin result, while at the same time investing significantly more money in advertising and marketing to drive all of the product innovation that's enabling the top line. So in some, we really do have this virtuous cycle going in that\u2019s typically a sign of success in the CPG space. ","Operator","Our next question come from the line of Kevin Grundy with Jefferies.","Kevin Grundy","Good morning.","Indra Nooyi","Good morning, Kevin.","Kevin Grundy","So two unrelated questions, if I may. First, back to NAB. I was hoping you could comment on one specific aspect of the competitive environment and that is Monster's launch of Mutant, which will be targeting Mountain Dew. So to the extent you can, expectations there and any specific spending or programs you may have in place behind the Mountain Dew brand.","And then, unrelated to that, you guys spoke to productivity and you\u2019ve done a tremendous job there. So we are a couple of years into the $5 billion program that you announced. Is it still your expectation that the remaining $3 billion will be realized fairly ratably through 2019? I know that a tremendous amount of uncertainty with respect to commodities and FX, etc., but how are you thinking today with respect to the flow-through to earnings relative to advertising and marketing levels?","And then as productivity has become a bigger part of the company's culture, how are you thinking about potentially exceeding that target? Thank you. ","Indra Nooyi","Kevin, I think, first of all, we want to deliver on what we promised. So the five-year $5 billion program, that\u2019s a big productivity program. And we\u2019re singular focused on delivering that five-year $5 billion program. And we\u2019re pretty confident we will. The first two years has been good. And as is typical of us at PepsiCo, as we think about delivering the five-year $5 billion program, we\u2019re constantly looking for new ways to deliver more productivity. But at this point, it\u2019s five-year $5 billion and we\u2019re doing just fine along those lines.","In terms of Monster and Mutant, hey, there can only be one Mountain Dew. I think there\u2019s only one Mountain Dew. And we\u2019re focused on growing Mountain Dew. And if I were you, I\u2019d go buy a Mountain Dew and enjoy it.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robert Ottenstein with Evercore ISI.","Unidentified Analyst","Good morning. This is [indiscernible] for Robert. You mentioned on the release, incremental investments particularly in Quaker ESSA and AMENA. And I was hoping you could clarify or provide some color around those please. Thank you.","Hugh Johnston","Yeah. The incremental investments in those markets as well as elsewhere really fall into three categories. Number one is around advertising and marketing to support the innovation that we\u2019ve launched. Number two is research and development to enable us to accelerate our innovation into 2017 and beyond. And number three is investments that will enable us to continue to drive productivity across the P&L. So without getting into the specifics of each of those individual markets, those are the three big buckets in which we\u2019re investment.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Lohon Ronde [ph] with Credit Suisse.","Indra Nooyi","Good morning, Lohon.","Unidentified Analyst","Good morning, everyone. I do have a question regarding innovation. So you mentioned innovation representing about 9% of your net revenue. Could you give us a bit more color about the split between beverages and snacks or US versus international?","Indra Nooyi","I think it\u2019s all balanced across the board. And I\u2019d say in some of the emerging and developing markets, it runs higher than 9% because we take products developed in the developed markets and we send it there. But I\u2019d say, on balance, it\u2019s plus or minus 1% around 9% in terms of emerging, developing and developed markets and then beverages and snacks.","Indra Nooyi","So thank you all for your questions. In closing, let me just say that we are confident we have the right strategies in place and we\u2019re executing very well. We are pleased with our results for the quarter and year-to-date. We\u2019re on track to deliver our target for the year and we look forward to sharing with you our sustainability vision and goals for the coming decades in the weeks ahead. And as always, thank you for the trust you\u2019ve placed in us with your investment. We remain absolutely committed to increasing its value. Thank you."],"16865":["PepsiCo Inc.

(Operator Instructions) It is now my pleasure to introduce Mr. Jamie Caulfield, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Caulfield, you may begin.","Jamie Caulfield","Thanks, Jackie. With me today are Indra Nooyi, PepsiCo's Chairman and CEO; and Hugh Johnston, PepsiCo's CFO. We'll lead off today's call with a review of our first quarter 2014 performance and outlook, and then we'll move on to Q&A.","In an effort to get to as many analyst questions as possible within the hour, we're going to have a one-question limit, so we should be able to get through the full queue of analysts, when we get to the Q&A.","Before we begin, please take note of our cautionary statement. This conference call includes forward-looking statements, including statements regarding 2014 guidance and our long-term targets, based on currently available information. Forward-looking statements inherently involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those predicted in such forward-looking statements.","Statements made on this conference call should be considered together with cautionary statements and other information contained in today's earnings release and in our most recent periodic reports filed with the SEC.","Unless otherwise indicated all references to EPS and operating profit growth are on a core basis. In addition, references to organic revenue results in this call exclude the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, structural changes and foreign exchange translation.","To find disclosures and reconciliations of non-GAAP measures that we use when discussing PepsiCo's financial results, you should refer to the glossary and other attachments to this morning's earnings release and to the Investors section of PepsiCo's website under the Events & Presentations tab.","As we discuss today's results, please keep in mind that our first quarter comprises the 12 weeks ended March 22 for our North American operations and the months of January and February for the vast majority of our operations outside of North America.","Now, it's my pleasure to introduce Indra Nooyi.","Indra Nooyi","Thank you, Jamie, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us this morning. We are very pleased with our first quarter results. Organic revenue grew 4% overall, with global snacks up 5% and global beverages up 3%.","Core gross margins improved by 40 basis points and core operating margins improved by 50 basis points. Core constant currency operating profit grew 7% and core constant currency EPS grew 10%. We achieved our targeted productivity savings in the quarter and remain on track to achieve our full year target of $1 billion.","On a rolling four-quarter basis, our core net ROIC improved by 110 basis points and now stands at 16.5%, and we returned $2.1 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases, a 47% increase versus last year. And as we previously announced, we expect to return $8.7 billion to shareholders in 2014 in the form of dividends and share repurchases, which represents a 35% increase over our 2013 cash return to shareholders.","Now, we all know that the world continues to be a volatile and uncertain place and we certainly saw indications of this in the first quarter. The heavy lifting we've done to transform our portfolio and capability is yielding results. I believe, our results reflect the power of our portfolios of products and brands and the strength of our geographic footprint.","Additionally, the investments we made to strengthen our brand, innovate more effectively, drive better execution and operate more efficiently by leveraging our global scale and portfolio complementarity are all beginning to pay off. As a consequence, we've been consistently meeting or exceeding our financial goals, and more importantly, we have increased confidence in the future prospects for our business.","Today, we believe our business is well-positioned to deliver top-tier return in the current volatile environment, as a result of the very deliberate steps we've taken and the investments we've made over the years.","First, the balance and diversity of our product portfolio, ranging from fun-for-you to good-for-you products across snacks and beverages, gives us the ability to manage through issues in any individual business. Together, these businesses have an attractive growth rate in the mid-single digits.","Second, investments we made to enhance the equity of our $22 billion brand are all translating to success in the marketplace. These powerful brands account for more than 70% of our annual retail sales, in fact our brands hold the number one or number two position in many of our markets, and several of our brands like Mountain Dew, Doritos, Gatorade, Lays and Quaker Oats virtually define their categories.","Looking across our largest markets, we have the leading position among top brands with nine of the top 40 packaged food and beverage trademarks in the U.S., which is most of any CPG company. We have nine of the top 50 packaged food and soft drink brands in Russia, which is again most of any CPG company. We have seven of the top 50 in Mexico and six of the top 50 in the U.K., and again in both countries we are leaders.","The strength of our brands is clear in our ability to achieve consistent net price utilization. In 2013, beverages and snacks each achieved 4 points of net pricing. In the first quarter of 2014, beverages and snacks achieved 2 points and 4 points of net pricing respectively.","Third, we stepped up our focus on differentiated innovation. Our annual R&D investment is up more than 25% since 2011. We have also created unique linkages between consumer and shopper insights and product development, using the signs of our demand space as framework. As a result, 2013 was one of PepsiCo's best years ever for innovation with PepsiCo products accounting for nine of the top 15 new food and beverage introductions across all measured U.S. retail channels.","In the first quarter of 2014, products launched over the past three years made up 8% of our total net revenues. The good news is that our innovation is becoming more incremental and is contributing to positive price mix.","Fourth, the investments we made to expand our footprint in developing and emerging market are fueling our growth. As a group, D&E markets grew organic revenue 9% in the first quarter, following 10% growth for the full year in 2013.","In the first quarter, Russia and Brazil led the way with double-digit organic revenue growth, followed by India which delivered high-single digit organic revenue growth. Our broad array of food and beverage products range from value to premium-priced products and enabling us to earn sales from consumers across the economic spectrum.","Fifth, we are delivering on all our productivity targets and significantly lowering the cost base of the company. By leveraging our global scale, eliminating duplication and deploying new technologies, we are driving the highest level of productivity in our company's history.","We are on track to achieve our three-year $3 billion productivity program in 2014 and we are poised to begin executing on our next major productivity program, targeting $5 billion over five years, beginning in 2015, focused on increasing automation, deploying more shared services model, optimizing our manufacturing footprint and optimizing our go-to-market systems.","Since 2011 we've increased our core net revenue per employee by 9%, increased our core EBIT per employee by 5%, reduced net capital spending as a percentage of net revenue by 80 basis points from 4.9% for full year 2011 to 4.1% over the past four quarters, and improved our average cash conversion cycle by 33% to 24 days in 2013 from 36 days in 2011 and we continue to look in every area of our business for sensible ways to do even more.","And finally, we are executing better, faster and more efficiently within our operating segments and then further benefiting through increased coordination across our product and geographic portfolios. And let me just give you a few recent examples of our complementary portfolio and our execution capabilities at work.","Our Super Bowl execution demonstrated outstanding delivery of print, outdoor, mobile, digital and in-store programming. PepsiCo delivered a united effort to leverage our NFL partnership and drove unprecedented national and local impact with both consumers and customers.","Each business executed the property very effectively and PepsiCo's combined activation was one of our most compelling expressions of better together, with coordinated advertising, promotions and merchandizing across our snacks and beverage portfolios, which helps drive incremental sales and share gains.","Second, building on the growing consumer appetite for ridged cut chips and the strong performance of Lay's Deep Ridged chips in the U.S., U.K. and Spain in 2013, we'll offer versions of Lay's Deep Ridged potato chips in over 20 markets around the globe in 2014 with additional markets planned for 2015.","Our global execution leverage is common product specifications, branding, hedged graphics and ad copy. At the same time, we've built on our beverage partnership with Buffalo Wild Wings by introducing Ruffles Deep Ridged Classic Hot Wings flavored potato chips inspired by Buffalo Wild Wings. So what we are doing is leveraging our global category structure and getting new products to market faster across more geographies, more cost effectively and in more channels.","Third, during the quarter we kicked off the 2014 Pepsi soccer campaign, our largest global football marketing effort to date. Over 100 markets will be executing and locally adapting the campaign around the world. Our global superstar football squad brings together an unprecedented wealth of international talent that spans five continents and includes 19 of the world's greatest players, including the great Lionel Messi.","The campaign unites the worlds of football, music and art, reaching fans with distinctive packaging, point of sale, out-of-home communication and engaging content. This program drives higher consumer awareness and regard, allows us to leverage our global scale of product complementarity and gives us the flexibility for targeted local execution.","Next, our highly successful Lay's Do Us A Flavor campaign represents a great blend of global brand building elements. This campaign now expands more than 15 countries and is an excellent example of how we lived and shift best practices around the world. Breakthrough digital and mobile engagement is embedded in every single touchpoint, all the way to shelf.","This year in the U.S., we've increased consumer engagement by inviting consumer to choose both flavor and type of chip. As part of this year's contest, a judging panel will narrow down the contest submissions to four finalist flavors and then these four finalist flavors will be fully developed at Frito-Lay culinary experts and unveil this summer.","The winning flavor is determined by fan votes, will be revealed in November with a grand prize winner taking home $1 million. This program has driven high levels of consumer engagement and is an extremely efficient marketing tool because of the massive earned media benefit that begun on each of the markets where we launched it. And finally, we have accelerated productivity best practices across the organization.","For example, as our global enterprise system or GES continues to rollout across Frito-Lay North America, we are beginning to apply the same concepts and tools to our North American beverage business and in some international markets. And these initiatives will maximize asset utilization by reducing distribution centers, leveraging automation, deploying fleet and route trucks more efficiently, and reducing inventory, while improving service and product freshness.","So with all this as a backdrop, let's take a look at how the business has performed, starting with our North American businesses. Frito-Lay North America delivered another quarter of very strong results. Organic revenue grew 4% and core constant currency operating profit grew 6%. The U.S. salty snacks category continues to grow retail sales at a mid-single digit rate and Frito-Lay's delivering a good balance between volume growth and price realization.","Revenue growth in the quarter was led by good performance across our five largest brands, Lay's, Tostitos, Doritos, Cheetos and Ruffles, and each grew between low and mid-single digits. We continue to execute product and packaging innovation, targeted incremental macro snack occasions, including the launches of Rold Gold Pretzel Thins, Twistos Snack Bites, Lay's Air Pops, Lay's Kettle Cooked Lattice Cut Chips and our ready-to-go market pack that offers a broad assortment of macro snacks.","Quaker Foods North America delivered positive organic topline in the quarter and gained value share at retail in each of its core categories, hot cereals, ready-to-eat cereals and snack bars.","Turning to North American Beverages. We are really encouraged with the continued progress we are making. In the quarter, we held U.S. liquid refreshment beverage value share and achieved positive net price realization at retail, ahead of the category and our primary competitor.","Notably, PepsiCo has held or gained relative U.S. LRB value share in measured channel versus our closest competitor in each of the last four quarters. And we continue to manage the business responsibly with consistent pricing across carbonated and non-carbonated beverages.","Within the LRB category, we held or gained value share across a number of important subcategories, including CSD, sports drinks and ready-to-drink tea and coffee. And we grew retail sales in measured channels in the U.S. for regular colas and Mountain Dew, both within CSD and for Gatorade, Lipton Tea, Starbucks Coffee and Naked Juice within our non-carb portfolio.","We are investing in R&D to drive sustainable innovation and we are off to a good start, beginning with the first quarter launches of Brisk Half and Half, Gatorade Fierce Blue Cherry, and Kickstart Black Cherry and Limeade to name a few. In addition, we continue to expand our package offerings and we are seeing good success with strong double-digit growth in mini cans and we have more than doubled the sales of our 12 ounce glass bottles in Q1.","These practices enable us to realize new price-packed revenue benefits, while providing flexibility to maintain price competitiveness. So that's the North American story. Our other developed markets in Western Europe also performed well, but organic revenue for these markets are up 3.5% in the first quarter.","Let me now turn to developing and emerging markets. In Mexico, we are managing through the new taxes on certain foods and beverages that were enacted recently. We've taken pricing in snacks and our bottle has taken pricing in beverages to pass the taxes through to the consumer.","In the quarter, the elasticities and volume declines in Mexico was in line with what we expected. And we have been dealing with the situation throughout the year and expected to continue to depress consumer demands, but results so far are consistent with our planned assumptions.","In Venezuela, we are managing through high inflation, political unrest, supply chain disruptions and continued uncertainty regarding the applicable exchange rate. But given all these challenges our businesses in Venezuela performed well in the quarter with organic revenue up strong double-digits across both snacks and beverages.","Brazil delivered double-digit organic growth, revenue growth, led by organic revenue growth in snacks. In Russia, organic revenue rose double digits, and double-digit growth in snacks and high-single digit growth in beverages. And we saw strong organic growth in a number of other East European markets, including double-digit organic revenue growth in Poland, high-single digit organic revenue growth in Turkey.","Moving across to our Asia, Middle East, Africa businesses. Organic revenue growth was led by Pakistan, a strong double-digit organic revenue growth, followed by Egypt and the Philippines, which also grew double-digits and India which grew high-single digits.","China organic revenue declined low-single digits in line with our expectations. Performance was muted, given strong high-single digit comparisons from Q1 of 2013 and some business disruption related to our bottlers restructuring in Q1 of 2014 to drive increase efficiency through greater integration.","We expect the business to return to its normal trajectory as we enter Q3. We remain committed to the developing and emerging markets as they have a long runway for growth, driven by increasing demand for a convenient, on trend affordable products, supported by a rapidly growing middle-class and we are well-positioned to capitalize on these opportunities.","Let me conclude my comments by saying we are off to a good start in 2014, with the pieces of our portfolio working together to generate healthy topline and bottomline performance. Clearly, there are a number of challenges around the globe, but the shape and resilience of our portfolio combined with strong execution and aggressive productivity should enable us to navigate successfully through the current environment.","So with this, let me turn the call over to Hugh Johnston.","Hugh Johnston","Thank you, Indra, and good morning, everyone. Let me spend a few minutes discussing the quarter and our outlook for 2014, which is in line with the full year guidance issued in mid-February. Overall, the quarter came in largely as expected with pricing actions, commodity inflation and productivity, all in line with our expectations.","For Q1, organic volume grew 2% in snacks and was even versus the prior-year quarter in beverages. Organic revenue grew 4%. On a reported basis, net revenue was even versus year ago, reflecting 3 points of unfavorable foreign exchange translation and nearly 0.5 point negative impact, primarily from the franchising of our Vietnam bottling operation.","Commodity inflation was up low-single digits. Our core gross margins improved about 40 basis points and core operating margins increased 50 basis points. Core constant currency operating profit grew 7% in the quarter. Our core effective tax rate was 23.7%, approximately 80 basis points below Q1 2013.","Our fully diluted share count declined 1.5%, reflecting the benefits of our ongoing share repurchase program and core constant currency EPS grew 10%.","So between the core constant currency operating profit growth of 7% and core constant currency EPS growth of 10%, we achieved about 3 points of leverage, driven by lower interest expense or lower tax rate and share repurchases. And we returned $2.1 billion to shareholders year-to-date in the form of dividends and share repurchases during the quarter, which is 47% above year ago levels and reflective of our commitment to return cash to shareholders.","Turning to guidance. The world does remain a volatile place as evidenced in places like Mexico, Venezuela and Eastern Europe. So even with the strength that we saw in the first quarter, our full year guidance remains unchanged.","Consistent with what we said back in February, for the full year 2014 we expect mid-single digit organic revenue growth and core constant currency EPS growth of 7% and we expect low-single digit commodity inflation and productivity savings of approximately $1 billion.","Below the division operating profit line, we expect corporate cost efficiency driven by our productivity initiatives, a core tax rate of approximately 25% and a reduced share count from our share repurchase program.","Foreign exchange is expected to negatively impact net revenue and core earnings per share for the full year 2014 by approximately 3% and 4% respectively, based on current market consensus rates. Taking our 2013 core EPS of $4.37 and applying our guidance implies 2014 core EPS of approximately $4.50, consistent with our prior guidance.","As many of you know, the foreign exchange picture in Venezuela is very dynamic at the moment. Our first quarter results were translated to U.S. dollars at 6.3 bolivars to the U.S. dollar. Our current FX forecast, which is based on current market consensus rates assumes a blended rate of approximately 9 bolivars to the U.S. dollar for the balance of the year.","To help you with the FX sensitivities on Venezuela, for the full year 2013, Venezuela generated approximately 1% of our net revenues and 2% of our operating profit.","In addition, as of the end of our international Q1, which includes January and February, we have approximately $380 million of net monetary assets in Venezuela, valued at 6.3 bolivars to the U.S. dollar, which would be subject to revaluation, if there is a change in the exchange rate we use. As we did in 2013, we would expect to treat any revaluation of the net monetary assets as a non-core charge.","As you model out the second quarter, I'd ask you to consider the following. First, our EMEA division will face very difficult operating profit comparison due to the following: A, a $137 million gain recorded in Q2 2013 related to the re-franchising of the company's bottling operation in Vietnam; and B, 27% year-over-year core constant currency operating profit growth in Q2 2013, when excluding the above mentioned gain.","Second, foreign exchange translation should have an approximate 4 point unfavorable impact in the second quarter revenue and approximate 5 point unfavorable impact on second quarter EPS, based on current market consensus rates. Revenue in the second quarter will have an estimated 15 basis point of negative impact from structural changes due to the Vietnam re-franchising.","Below the net operating profit line, net interest expense is expected to increase in the second quarter versus last year, primarily reflecting higher debt balances and higher rates. And our tax rate is expected to be higher in the second quarter of 2014 versus both, the second quarter of 2013 and the first quarter of 2014.","Finally, our stepped up share repurchase activity will occur throughout the year, but is expected to have a more pronounced impact in the second half of 2014 and into 2013. From a cash flow perspective, we continue to expect full year free cash flow excluding certain items of more than $7 billion. We'll continue to drive cash flow-through efficient working capital management and continued tight controls over capital spending.","Net capital spending should approximate $3 billion, which is well within our long-term target of less than or equal to 5% of net revenue. We expect to return approximately $8.7 billion for shareholders in 2014, a 35% increase over 2013, through a combination of $3.7 billion in dividends and a $5 billion share repurchase program.","And as a reminder, our previously announced 15% dividend per share increase will commence with the June payment. This represents the 42 consecutive year of an annual dividend increase and an approximate 60% payout ratio based on 2013 core EPS. At yesterday's closing stock price, it represents a 3.1% yield and will bring our 10-year annualized dividend per share compound annual growth to 11%.","So to summarize, our 2014 outlook is unchanged from our last call. We expect to drive improved full year margins and net ROIC and discipline capital allocation and returning cash to shareholders remain top priorities for the company.","With that operator, we'll take the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our first question is coming from Bryan Spillane of Bank of America.","Bryan Spillane - Bank of America","Just wanted to talk a little bit further about Russia and maybe just the way we should think about modeling it going forward. So if you could maybe parse out for us on the double-digit growth, how much was pricing? And then maybe how the performance was snacks versus dairy? And then finally just as we're looking forward, given the exchange rate volatility, the increase in input cost there, just how we should think about modeling profitability in Russia, kind of over the next couple of quarters?","Indra Nooyi","Bryan, I'm going to provide some overall comments on Russia and then I'll transfer to Hugh to provide you more detail. Let me just say, our business in Russia is a good one. Both in Russia and Ukraine businesses are doing well. The climate there has been very friendly to business and we have great relationships with the government, the local retailers. So the business is a very good business.","Clearly, the current geopolitical issues are impacting more the ruble and the Russian [indiscernible] as opposed to basic consumer demand, because they've devalued, input cost have gone up, and therefore consumer prices have had to go up. The consumer is extremely resilient in both countries at this point, so we have to watch and wait and see how things evolve. But those, as overall comment, let me just toss it to Hugh to give you some more color in details.","Hugh Johnston","For Russia in the first quarter, we had 10% revenue growth. Volume did grow across the businesses. You are calling out one of the questions that we wrestle with, which is the dairy inflation we faced in the business. The good news from that perspective is because we have such strong brands across the dairy category and as a leader there in many of those brands, we do have the ability to take pricing successful and that's where the consumer has been quite resilient against that pricing.","So I would expect to see some level of volume growth and then we will continue to take pricing to cover the vast majority of our inflation in the country. And we expect that we're going to see continued profit growth coming out of Russia. And that's true across all of the businesses, snacks and beverages.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Faucher with JPMorgan.","John Faucher - JPMorgan","Just want to talk a little bit about the pricing environment in North America in CSDs. You guys are reporting solid pricing. Coke, mean to say, Cokes had the pricing for carbonated soft drinks was up. We're not really seeing that in the market in terms of looking at the syndicated data. So could you talk a little bit about what you're seeing in the category? Whether some of the discounting we've seen has been able to stabilize demand a little bit? And then how you see the pricing going as we look into the summer selling season.","Indra Nooyi","I think at this point, I'd say we have been extremely disciplined in pricing across all parts of the LRB portfolio in all channels. Now and then we see some interesting pricing behavior in one retail channel or in one category, but as far as PepsiCo is concerned, John, we have, as we've communicated with you, decided to be extremely responsible and take pricing up both in carbs and non-carbs and that's what we've been doing in all channels.","Going to the summer selling season, that's going to be our strategy going forward, I think especially in the category like CSDs, taking down pricing is not going to drive up demand too much. So I think we have to play the overall LRB portfolio very, very carefully and balance pricing between CSDs and non-carbs and figure out a way to grow the whole pie very, very carefully. That's what we are doing and that's what we hope to see in the marketplace going into the year, but we can only talk about ourselves.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs.","Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs","I was hoping to just get a little bit more color on Mexico. You talked about the elasticity being pretty in line with your expectation. Can you talk about how much volume was down in beverages and snacks? Any major differences you're seeing from a consumer reaction perspective across both categories? And then a key be, is it profit decline that we saw in the first quarter, can you just talk about how much that was with Mexico?","Indra Nooyi","Judi, I mean the details on the volume decline in Mexico, things like that, we're not going to give you that level of detail, but overall I'll tell you, we've modeled out a trend that have elasticity. And interestingly, it's coming in exactly as we modeled out.","But let's be careful here. It's only about three months into the year after the taxes have gone into effect and it's going to effect on multiple, multiple, multiple categories, but the Mexican consumer is trying to figure out how to rebalance their basket. So I think we're going to let this thing play out another month or two, because our first quarter was just two month, so let's wait and see how this plays out in the next three or four months.","And I think we'll get a much better read as to what this taxation is going to do in Mexico and also what strategies we can deploy in terms of revenue management to really address price points for the consumer -- that would attract the consumer. So I'll tell you as an economy, Mexico remains robust and we still believe enormously in the Mexican economy. I think we have to give it time to allow this taxation to play through.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.","Dara Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley","Hugh, the international profit results were very strong even against the tough comp and excluding the gain and better than expected FX. From a margin perspective, should we view the Q1 strength as an aberration in a light seasonal quarter? Do you think the strong performance can continue in the balance of the year? And then also, can you give us update on the potential for emerging markets margins to expand longer-term as you gain scale and if we should expect an inflection point in emerging markets margins any time soon?","Indra Nooyi","Go ahead, Hugh.","Hugh Johnston","A couple of things on that. Yes, you're right. The emerging or the international margins expanded probably more than you're going to consistently see across the board in the first quarter. The productivity programs are kicking into the place and obviously that's helping us. In addition to that, some of the new pricing that we putted in is helping as well, but Q1 was probably a bit better than what you would expect over the course of the year.","The balancing act, of course, in developing and emerging markets as we have talked about before is one of how rapidly do you increase margins versus pricing a bit below your commodity inflation, in order to increase consumer adoption of our products and our categories, and also frankly to build competitive strength for ourselves through scaling and gaining market share across the businesses. I do think that by virtue of the scale gains, we will see natural margin accretion over time. To some degree, given the investments that we've made in brands, we can control how quickly we increase the margins in those businesses.","But frankly, what we're trying to do is build great competitive fortresses around the rest of the world, in places like Brazil and places like Russia and in places like India and China, in order to frankly generate lots of long-term value for shareholders. So the strategy we're following is to capture sufficient short-term financial gains in those markets, yet at the same time build great fortresses like we have here in North America for the long haul, in both the snacks and the beverage business.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank.","Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank","Couple of quick ones. Just in terms of cash flow in the quarter, I mean it looked like there were some working capital anomalies, and I know you've maintained your cash flow guidance for the year. So could you just explain kind of what happened there? And then I just have a really quick follow-up.","Hugh Johnston","Yes, Bill, you're right. This is Hugh. We had some timing on payments and a few timing items on inventory as well. Those are correct. In fact, they're already correcting through margin. And as we get to the full year, you will see the cash flow come in exactly as we expected.","As you try to manage cash flow, managing on a quarterly basis our cash flow is a little bit trickier than earnings on a quarterly basis. You're going to see some more bumps and it will be a bit more inconsistent, but I would expect the cash flow to come in as we expected for the year. And working capital will improve strongly during the year.","Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank","And then just, maybe it's too early, but can you just give us some early reads on the Pepsi next launch in Canada and kind of what you guys are thinking so far?","Indra Nooyi","I think it's hardly a couple of weeks since the launch, so let's wait and see. It's too early to call any results from that, because typically it takes about three to four months before you can get a first read. So let's wait and see how it evolves.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Caroline Levy with CLSA.","Caroline Levy - CLSA","Just wondering, there is a huge disconnect between the results, topline that Coke put up in Europe and you. And obviously Russia is a huge part of your Europe business, but in Western Europe and the U.K. in particular, which is a big business for you, could you talk about how your European beverage business performed? And what you're seeing in that market, please?","Indra Nooyi","I just think, our European business again, investments in brands, investments in stepped-up execution is all beginning to payoff. And our bottling partners are also performing very well. And I'd say across the board, pretty much in every country in Western Europe and parts of Eastern Europe, whether it's a company-own bottling operation or a franchise operation, first, our bottlers are healthy, which helps. And on top of that, they are executing exceeding well.","And I think the portfolio plays in our favor too. Pepsi MAX, for example, is a wonderful, wonderful product and is doing very well in the U.K., in the Nordic countries. So the choice of the portfolio works. The fact that we have financially strong bottlers helps. And third, I think businesses like Tropicana doing exceedingly well in France and the U.K.","So we have on target products, healthy bottlers and great execution, and together they're all beginning to work in Europe. So we're feeling good about the shape of the portfolio. And what I'd say is, what we can control, we're doing well. When it comes to geopolitics or macroeconomic turmoil, we try to navigate through it. But what we can control, we are doing a very job with it.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steve Powers with UBS.","Steve Powers - UBS","Indra, I thought maybe we could just talk a little bit about the productivity programs, $8 billion effectively over eight years is clearly impressive, and about a $1 billion per year run rate its about 10% less to EBITDA or is equal. Obviously that's not the expected flow-through, so can you give us just a little bit more sense of where the productivity is going from, in terms of reinvestments","And how you're measuring return on that investment, and then also in terms of where the productivity is being sourced from? It sounded like from some of your comments that there is a shift going on, changes of focus perhaps between Frito-Lay in North America to beverages, but is that correct, and perhaps maybe some quantification around the productivity opportunities there?","Indra Nooyi","Hugh wants to take it and then I'll add to it.","Hugh Johnston","First, in order to understand all these numbers, it maybe helpful to give a bit of context on the overall environment they're operating within. The cost base that we're drawing productivity from is what we refer to is operating expense. What's important is what that excludes. That excludes A&M, that excludes any financing cost below the line, and tax and things like that, that also excludes commodity. So it's really kind of the operating expense of the company, including corporate expenses. So that's point number one.","It's about $28 billion, $29 billion in terms of the overall size of that bucket. So when you're talking about $1 billion a year of productivity, you're talking about somewhere between 3.5% and 4% productivity out of that bucket. For a company that's a growth company, that's really quite strong productivity. We benchmark that against other companies that grow the revenues in mid single-digits and we do feel quite confident about that strong productivity.","Now, to your question around where does it go? That question is really a margin question, which is a bit more complex. But let me share a few thoughts that may help you bottle it and also just give you a little bit of an understanding of how it works.","Number one, based on our mix of countries, of course, there is operating expense inflation inside of those operating cost. The operating expense inflation inside of that bucket is also going to run in the 3% to 4% range depending on the particular year. Drivers of that obviously are labor increases. That bucket is about half labor cost, and obviously that's naturally inflationary.","In addition to that as the business grows, it is somewhat volume variable. So you're going to get a better growth in those expenses based on volume increases as well. So that's a bit of an offset as you think about the margin flow-through.","The second margin flow-through question is around geographic mix. Obviously, we're growing more quickly in developing and emerging markets. As Dara asked about earlier, margins in those markets are lower. The natural drag out of those markets is probably about 30 basis points per year. Now that's something that, if we were to take our prices more aggressively we could chose to mitigate, but frankly for shareholder value creation over a five-year timeframe, we think that's the wrong decision. So we're willing to live with that 30 basis point margin drag.","And then the third piece is how we manage pricing in individual markets, is both an outcome of what our pricing strategy is vis-\u00e0-vis commodities, and in addition to that, what the competitive situation is in that particular market. So that tends to be a bit of a margin drag as well.","So when you put all of those pieces together, I think what you can expect from us is, is that margin improvement overall of about 30 basis points or so per year. We ought to be able to do that on a reasonably consistent basis, and combined that with the mid single-digit revenue growth and below the line leverage, I think our long-term guidance have high single-digit is what you'd be thinking about.","So hopefully that gives you some sense as to taking the productivity and mapping it all the way through to the guidance. If you'd like to spend more time on that, obviously, Jamie and the team can spend more time with you.","Indra Nooyi","And the productivity in Frito-Lay and North American beverages, it's across every part of the company. And as Hugh said, it's in G&A, it's literally corporate costs, everything. What we don't talk to is A&M and R&D. Those are the two that we've said are protected. We'll focus on ROI on those two investments, but we're not going to cut that to make the numbers.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mark Swartzberg with Stifel.","Mark Swartzberg - Stifel","Two questions. I'm hoping to try to better understand from the thinking that you and your board have on TSR and CEO transition. On TSR, the 35% increase that you're announcing again, so to speak, or is a repeat of what we heard from the fourth quarter, is a very healthy, nice, good number. Can you give us some sense about the philosophy driving that?","I think one thing I'm really trying to better understand is you're putting optimal leverage target out there, do you do something to help us think beyond '14, how we should be thinking about how much cash shareholders get back from the company, again from a beyond '14 perspective? So looking for some color on TSR? And then simply any update on, Indra, how you are thinking and the larger Board is thinking on the subject of CEO transition?","Indra Nooyi","You want to take this up, and I will talk about CEO transition.","Hugh Johnston","Mark, from the perspective of TSR, I guess in terms of going beyond 2014, we haven't provided any specific guidance around share repurchase. We'll do that as we get into the next year. We've got a long history of share repurchase. We've been repurchasing our shares since 2001. So there is certainly a reasonable expectation that the share repurchase will continue to be relatively high. I don't want to get into 2015 guidance on share repo until we get closer to that timeframe.","In terms of TSR, though, perhaps from a different perspective, I would think about it from the standpoint of our long-term guidance is high single-digit EPS. So let's take the midpoint of that over time, and call it 8%. That's probably a reasonable proxy for share price increase assuming the market holds relatively stable.","Add to that, the dividend yield, right now that yield is, as I mentioned earlier, 3.1%. It's probably going to wind up hovering around the 3% range over time. So I would think of an 11 TSR is probably being a reasonable range to expect out of PepsiCo. We think with that combination of high-single digit EPS and a 3% or so yield, that's probably going to be near the top of the class in terms of TSR within the CPG space and within the F&B space. So that's the way I would think about it, more focusing on the TSR rather than the short-term cash return forecast.","Indra Nooyi","And in terms of succession, Mark, we start talking about CEO succession and all C-suite succession, the day after you appoint anybody into that job, because we have a very, very orderly succession process. The Board reviews it every other board meeting. We look at emergency succession, long-term succession. We have very deliberate talent development models within the company. And PepsiCo is known for that. We have an outstanding group of leaders within the company who can assume bigger and bigger jobs, but let me assure you at this point, I'm still on the Chair.","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo.","Bonnie Herzog - Wells Fargo","I just have a quick question on the double-digit increase in your advertising and marketing expense for Frito-Lay and if we should expect that level of investment to continue? And then you've reported flat organic beverage volume growth in North America this quarter, which is quite positive. So could you drill down a little further and maybe give us an idea where some of this strength came from in terms of channels and brands?","Indra Nooyi","I will take the beverage question and then Hugh you can take the question on the A&M and Frito-Lay. As I mentioned on my prepared remarks, Bonnie, I tell you, we had a very, very good first quarter in North American beverages. I think we had growth across the board in all parts of the portfolio. We gained or held value share in CSDs, sports drink, ready-to-drink tea, coffee.","We grew retail sales in measured channels in the U.S. for regular cola's and Mountain Dew within CSDs. Gatorade, Lipton Tea, Starbucks Coffee, Naked Juice and non-carbs, this is one of those quarters, in spite of the fact that we had bad weather for some of the days of the first quarter, which caused some routes not to service accounts, this is the quarter where innovation stuck, our execution was terrific, and we just performed well.","But let's also make sure we recognize that now for several quarters, we have held or gained value share in U.S. LRB in measured channels. So I think all the investments, the focus on execution, brand building in North American Beverages is beginning to payoff. We're feeling good about the prospects in this business.","Hugh Johnston","And Bonnie, I will talk about the advertising and marketing spending in Frito-Lay. Obviously, when we increase A&M across the company, a couple of years ago, Frito-Lay certainly got their share of that increase. And it's worked, is the great news. We've seen the brand equity score has increased. And we've seen our ability to price successfully increase because the brands are stronger.","Regarding go-forward, what we've said is, we do not expect A&M as a percent of revenue to go down. So that will line in the centers, as Indra mentioned, regarding where we sit as a company. Beyond that, it really comes down to not a strategic move anymore. We need to increase A&M for the competitive reasons, because we think we're underspending.","But frankly, we'll base it on the opportunities that we see in the demand spaces that we're working within and within the innovation ideas that we have. So you might see a growth faster than revenue in a year or two, because we have some great products that we're putting out there.","You might see it, because we have a great combination idea of something we want to advertise between the beverage business and the snack food business, and we'll always take advantages of those opportunities when we have that kind of an insight. But there is no strategy to increase A&M faster than revenue with Frito-Lay. I would expect to see them grow basically in line. That's a big idea.","Indra Nooyi","So let me just bring this to a close. Thank you all for your questions. In closing, I think we have taken the necessary steps to position ourselves for sustainable long-term growth. We're off to a good start in 2014 and we've done a good job navigating through an uncertain and volatile environment.","And I believe the first quarter of 2014 is a good example of how well-constructive portfolio, appropriate investment and disciplined execution can drive high quality top and bottomline results. Our first quarter results give me confidence that our plans are working and that we are on track to deliver our financial goals in 2014.","So let me thank you for your time this morning and for the confidence you've placed in us with your investment. Have a great day.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."],"16868":["PepsiCo, Inc.

Your lines have been placed on listen-only until the question-and-answer session (Operator Instructions). Today\u2019s call is being recorded and will be archived at www.pepsico.com.","It is now my pleasure to introduce Mr. Jamie Caulfield, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Caulfield, you may begin.","Jamie Caulfield","Thank you, Laurie. With me today are Indra Nooyi, PepsiCo\u2019s Chairman and CEO; and Hugh Johnston, PepsiCo\u2019s CFO. We\u2019ll lead off today\u2019s call with a review of our fourth quarter and full year 2014 performance and 2015 outlook and then we will move on to Q&A. We\u2019ve kept our comments brief this morning and intend to conclude the call by 08:45 and we will do our best to get to as many of your questions as we can.","Before we begin, please take note of our cautionary statement. This conference call includes forward-looking statements, including statements regarding 2015 guidance and our long-term targets based on currently available information. Forward-looking statements inherently involve risks and uncertainty that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those predicted in such forward-looking statements.

We are very pleased with our results for the quarter and for the full year, especially in light of the significant macroeconomic volatility being experienced in so many markets around the world. We've performed well in this challenging environment, largely in the strength of our brand and product portfolios and diversity of our geographic footprint. So while certain markets were hit with political disruptions, economic downturns or significant currency devaluation, other markets in our portfolio not experiencing these issues were able to offset their impact to deliver overall strong results.","We made a lot of progress in 2014, and I\u2019d like to recap some of those achievements, starting with our financial performance. I am pleased to report that we met or exceeded each of the targets we communicated at the beginning of the year. Organic revenue grew 4% for the full year and 5% in the fourth quarter. Core gross and operating margins expanded for the quarter and the full year. We delivered our productivity target for the year. Free cash flow exceeded $8 billion. Our focus on capital allocation discipline resulted in another year of significant core net ROIC improvements. We increased our annual dividend for the 42nd consecutive year and we returned $8.7 billion in total to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases, which is a 36% increase over 2013.","Just as importantly, we strengthened the foundations of our Company. First, we continue to invest in our portfolio of iconic global brands. In 2014, we sustained our increased A&M investment and focused our spending on our biggest brands. Additionally, we increased the impact of our investment by directing of the spending to consumer facing activity. We launched our largest ever global campaign for our two biggest brands, Pepsi and Lays with coordinated package graphics, use of sports and entertainment properties, point of sale material, ad copy and promotions.","We expanded our engagement in social and digital marketing. For example, Doritos CrashTheSuperBowl received nearly 5,000 consumer submissions from 29 countries around the world. And our Lays Do Us A Flavor campaign garnered more than 14 million submissions. Programs like these drive phenomenal consumer engagement, are highly complementary to our broader marketing efforts and are extremely financially efficient. Our investments are translating to tangible results with solid improvement in brand equity scores and market share performance in our priority markets for our global brands.","Second, we continue to strengthen our innovation engine. We have built a robust and sustainable innovation pipeline, perhaps the strongest in our history. Over the past two years, innovation as a percentage of total net revenue has climbed by 150 basis points and now stands at 9%. And we're innovating across our portfolio. For example, to meet the growing demand for nutritious products we introduced Naked Juice's Kale Blazer and Gatorade\u2019s new Whey Protein Bars. We bolstered our food service business with the introduction of Pepsi Spire fountain equipment in over 30 markets, giving our customers a choice of flexible and cost effective equipment and allowing our consumers to create more than 100,000 customized beverages with just the touch of a screen.","In snacks, we leveraged our global scale by lifting and shifting successful new products like Doritos Jacked and Deep Ridged chips from the United States into a number of international markets. And as a testament to the durability of our innovation, a number of our recent product introductions like Tostitos Cantina, Mountain Dew Kickstart and Pure Leaf generated double-digit estimated annual retail sales growth in 2014 after achieving over a $100 million in their launch year. So that\u2019s innovation.","Third, we stepped up our marketplace execution. As evidenced, in 2014 we were the largest contributor to U.S. retail sales growth among all food and beverage manufacturers. Based on IRR data in all measured channels, we contributed nearly $1 billion of retail sales growth, more than the combined sales growth of the next 27 largest manufacturers. In food service, we executed customized Better Together programs like the pairing of Doritos Loaded and Mountain Dew Solar Flare, and we secured attractive new businesses, such as a Disney Park in Shanghai leveraging the strength of our combined beverage and snack portfolio.","Fourth, we have taken productivity to a new level. We successfully completed our three year $3 billion productivity program launched in 2012 and we\u2019re entering our next phase of productivity with a new five-year $5 billion program, and we have a robust pipeline of productivity projects focused on increasing efficiency through automation, optimizing our global manufacturing footprint, advancing the competitiveness of our go-to-market models and utilizing shared services. These programs collectively are geared to deliver our targeted savings of approximately $1 billion per year through 2019.","At the same time, we have significantly evolved our organization structure and operating model to enable us to more fully capitalize on our scale, global presence and deep capabilities. And lastly, we have driven increased capital allocation discipline throughout the organization to drive higher returns of investment and increase cash returns to our shareholders.","So that's a summary at a high level of our accomplishments. So let me comment briefly on the performance highlights by business sector, starting with the Americas. PepsiCo Americas beverages had a terrific fourth quarter, 3% organic revenue growth translated to 11% core constant currency operating profit growth. The profit growth is especially notable given the fact we also increased A&M in the quarter by high single-digits. We have seen the business gain momentum beyond the efforts we\u2019ve been making in marketing, innovation and execution. And this has resulted in not only improved financial results, but better marketplace performance too, especially in our largest market, the United States.","Clearly our Latin American beverage business has had its challenges with the Mexico tax and deteriorating macros in Venezuela. Despite these challenges, our Latin American beverage business was a positive contributor to PAB's overall organic top-line and core constant currency bottom-line results.","Frito-Lay in North America delivered strong performance. Frito delivered 3% organic revenue growth for the full year and 3.5% in the fourth quarter and 6% core constant currency operating profit growth both for the quarter and the full year. Market share results have shown steady improvement and we gained savory snack value share in the fourth quarter.","Latin America foods performance, both for the quarter and full year was solid. For the full year Latin American food delivered 10% organic revenue growth and 9% core constant currency operating profit growth. Quaker Food North America performed well with some challenge categories. Despite the category challenges core constant currency operating profit was up 8% in the quarter and we gained value share for the full year in the each of our core categories, Hot Cereal, Ready-To-Eat Cereal and Snack Bars.","So very strong performance by our businesses based in the Americas and the U.S. in particular. As I mentioned earlier, our portfolio collectively was a largest contributor to retail food and beverage growth in the United States, both in the quarter and for the full year and this is a distinction we are very proud of.","Moving across to Europe, as you know, the majority of our European business is located in Eastern Europe and Russia in particular. Clearly the currency picture and macros in Russia have made operations more challenging. While the Russian consumer has been quite resilient at least for our business, the currency situations led to significant inflation because of the transaction ForEx on the materials we source from outside of Russia, resulting in significant input cost inflation. Despite these significant headwinds, Europe generated full year gains in volume, organic revenue and core constant currency operating profit. All things considered, solid performance for Europe.","And lastly EMEA, again good results despite some political macro volatility in many parts of the region. For both the quarter and the year, we had solid volume and organic revenue gains while full year operating profit performance was impacted by efficiency investments made in 2014 and by lapping the Vietnam refranchising gain we had in 2013.","Most of the global volatility has been concentrated in the developing and emerging markets. However as a group, even our developing and emerging markets grew organic revenue 10% in the quarter and 9% for the full year. So they continue to be major contributors to our growth. As I mentioned earlier, we have a terrific geographic portfolio and this allows us to balance challenges and opportunities in a way that tends to produce consistently good results overall, and we believe the fourth quarter and full year 2014 result are a reflection of this.","Now Hugh will take you the financial guidance in some detail in just a minute, but I want to highlight just a few key points. As an operating company we absolutely manage the things that are within our control, marketing, innovation, marketplace execution and productivity and we expect to continue to perform well in these areas. However we expect to face continued headwind related to macros, in particular weak currencies in a number of our key market and the impact of lower oil prices in countries whose economies are highly dependent on energy.","Obviously these are outside our control but we adjust the businesses to whether through the challenges as best as we can by controlling costs, adjusting our raw material sourcing and executing balanced pricing actions. As we balance all these factors, we have concluded that our outlook for 2014 will be within our long term financial goals.","With that I\u2019ll turn the call over to Hugh. Hugh?","Hugh Johnston","Thanks Indra, and good morning everyone. I'll start with the recap of the financial scorecard for 2014 and then move on to 2015 guidance. We're pleased to report that we met or exceeded each of our financial goals for the year. We targeted mid-single digit organic revenue growth and we delivered 4%. We targeted core operating margin improvement and it increased by 30 basis points. We targeted $1 billion in productivity savings and we delivered it. We targeted 7% core constant currency EPS growth with our initial guidance and delivered 9%, which is right in line with the increased target we communicated to you in October.","We targeted core net ROIC improvement and delivered 110 basis points. Our core net ROIC now stands at 17.5%. We targeted free cash flow of more than $7 billion and delivered $8.3 billion, and we committed to return $8.7 billion of cash to shareholders which is what we did. So overall good performance meeting or exceeding each of the targets we communicated at the beginning of 2014. We're particularly pleased with our cash flow management. Our free cash flow as a percent of our core net income exceeded 100% for the year and over the past three years. So we are converting earnings to free cash flow very efficiently.","Two big contributors to this performance are first the discipline and productivity we have on capital spending where we\u2019ve successfully held CapEx to less than 5% of net revenue since 2012. And second the improvement we've driven in working capital where we've shortened the cash conversion cycle by 50% over the past four years and have generated cash from working capital of over $2 billion in aggregate over the past three years. And it's this strong cash generation that is enabling us to provide attractive shareholder cash returns.","Let me spend a few minutes discussing our outlook for 2015 which is in line with our long term objectives. We expect another year of mid-single digit organic revenue growth. We expect core operating margin expansion as organic top line growth and productivity should offset negative geographic mix and cost inflation. Below the division operating profit line, we expect cooperate cost to be down and approximately 25% core tax rate and a reduced share account. All in, we expect core constant currency EPS growth of 7%.","Foreign exchange is expected to negatively impact revenue and core earnings per share by approximately 7 percentage points each based on current market consensus rates. As you saw in the release during the fourth quarter of 2014 we adopted the SICAD 1 rate of 12 bolivars per U.S. dollar and we assumed this same exchange rate for 2015. The currency exchange picture in Venezuela continues to be quite volatile. So I wanted to be absolutely transparent about what we have assumed in our 2015 guidance.","Putting it all together, taking our core 2014 EPS of $4.63 and applying our guidance implies 2015 core EPS of approximately $4.63 as well. Our outlook appropriately factors in both tailwinds and headwinds. To the positive, we expect to generate approximately $1 billion of productivity savings in 2015, which will offset operating cost inflation. We feel very good about our innovation agenda, which should enable to sustain our organic revenue growth rate. Our share account will benefit from continued share repurchases, although we won't recognize the full benefit of 2015 repurchases within 2015 as they'll be made throughout the year with some of the impact of the share account reduction falling into 2016. Our core tax rate is estimated to come in for the full year at approximately 25%, even with 2014 and we expect to be able to sustain this rate for the foreseeable future.","In terms of headwinds, we anticipate commodity cost inflation in the low single digits. Keep in mind that because of our forward buying strategies, our commodity cost changes will lag what you see in the spot market. I believe our expected inflation rate is a bit higher than what a number of you have modeled and this is because we are seeing more pronounced inflation in our non-market traded commodities, including certain packaging and agricultural raw materials. In addition, we will see an inflation impact from transaction ForEx in many of the markets whose currencies have weakened against the dollar. And foreign exchange translation will be a significant drag on our U.S. dollar earnings.","Finally, as you model out the quarters for 2015, please note that a number of our international market\u2019s currencies significantly weakened in the back half of 2014, so the currency lapse are most difficult in the first two quarters. Our long term goals remain intact, mid-single digit organic revenue growth, core operating margins expanding 30 to 50 basis points per year, high single digit core constant currency EPS growth, free cash flow growing roughly in line with earnings and core net ROIC improving 50 basis points per year.","We intend to responsibly manage the business for top line growth, drive productivity and reinvest appropriately to position PepsiCo for sustainable growth for the long term and we plan to remain highly disciplined toward capital allocation with the vast majority of free cash flow after capital spending being returned to shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks.","First, we\u2019re increasing our dividends per share by 7%, beginning with our June 2015 payment to $2.81 on an annualized basis. This represents the 43rd consecutive year of annual dividend increase, and an approximately 60% payout ratio based on the 2014 core EPS. At yesterday\u2019s closing stock price, it represents 2.9% yield and will bring our 10 year annualized dividend per share compound annual growth rate to 10%, and we expect to return an additional $4.5 billion and $5 billion in cash to shareholders through share repurchases. While doing so, we expect to maintain tier one commercial paper access, enabling us to retain low cost highly accessible financing.","So combined, these actions will result in cash returns to shareholders of $8.5 billion to $9 billion and will bring our cumulative 10 year cash returns to shareholders to $65 billion. As many of you know, we have stated disciplined capital allocation as a top priority for our management and our Board, and we trust these actions will again be seen by our shareholders as tangible evidence of this commitment.","Indra Nooyi","Thank you, Hugh. Before we open it up to questions, I want to take this opportunity to share with you how excited we are to be entering 2015 despite the challenges that we face, because this year marks the 50th anniversary of the coming together of PepsiCo and Frito-Lay in 1965. We set the foundation for what is today one of the world\u2019s most iconic and successful companies. This year we celebrate five decades of growing our business and creating substantial value for our shareholders, customers, consumers and communities.","It was a phenomenal vision of Don Kendall and Herman Lay, the architects of this combination, which set the stage to grow from $510 million in revenue in 1965 to almost $67 billion today. Of the companies in the Fortune 500 in 1965 just 79 remain today, and over this time frame, we\u2019ve generated extraordinary shareholder returns. In fact, $100 investment in PepsiCo in 1965 with dividends reinvested would be worth over $42,000 today. But PepsiCo\u2019s success over the past 50 years has not happened by chance. It happened because throughout our history PepsiCo has repeatedly adapted and retooled all with an eye to the future. More importantly we kept integrity at the heart of all we do, running the Company responsibly to generate sustainable long term value, and this is a formula for success that our current team will continue to apply.","With that let\u2019s open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question is coming from the line of Bryan Spillane of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Bryan Spillane","I\u2019ve got a question I guess about reinvestment rates. If you look at 2014, you really balanced a pretty good [indiscernible] you generate a 4% organic sales growth rate in this environment is a pretty big achievement. And my sense is at least partially related to just your choice; choices you are making in terms of reinvestment dropping the bottom line. When you look at 2015, is there anything you're thinking differently about how much you want to reinvest especially in sales growth in \u201915, just given some of the volatility you have in developing and emerging markets. And I guess related to that, given kind of the wide range of outcomes that could happen just because of the macros, are you looking for any more flexibility as you're planning in \u201915 in terms of reinvestment rate? So just trying to get your sense for the choices between top line and bottom line in \u201915 as you\u2019re looking into it.","Indra Nooyi","Bryan, 2014 was a tough year too. The market was quite volatile and as the year went on, we got to the second half of the year, we started to look -- really experience all the volatility. So I think between geopolitical issues, the oil price impact, other macroeconomic factors, we have actually had a volatility and I think we now have a playbook where we appropriately balance top-line growth, share and profit performance, because the challenge in these sorts of volatile environment is not to over invest and not to get the return or to under invest and lose too much share. So we are constantly balancing top-line growth, market-share and profit performance and I think over the year, we have developed a fairly good playbook which we\u2019re really going to put into action through 2015. Hugh, did you want to add something on this issue?","Hugh Johnston","Yes, I completely agree, Indra. And Bryan I guess I'd approach it from two perspectives. From a P&L perspective, we do feel like we\u2019ve found the right balance now between the productivity that we\u2019re driving and the investments that we\u2019re making in R&D, the investments we\u2019re making in innovation, the investments we\u2019re making in providing growth capacity through the P&L into the business. Then from a capital perspective, each of the last couple of years we\u2019ve started with a budget of somewhere between 4% and 5% and each of those years we\u2019ve landed at a little bit over 4%. The reason for that is we really do apply quite a bit of rigor to the investments that we\u2019re making. We\u2019re not afraid to invest in long-term growth, quite the opposite. I would argue both in R&D and in capital we have been investing in long-term growth. The focus here is sustainable value creation, and I think with the reinvestment rates we have right now, we will be able to deliver that sustainably.","Indra Nooyi","And Bryan if I can add to what Hugh said, in things like R&D spending, we cannot cut, because that\u2019s real spending on innovation and it doesn\u2019t matter what the volatility in the market is, these are long-term projects and we have to make sure we keep investing to get this innovation engine moving. In terms of A&M again, we want to make sure we put the appropriate A&M in the market, but we also watch to make sure that we\u2019re getting a return on investment on A&M in volatile environments. But our goal is to hold those relatively sacred and then work the other levels in the P&L.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Amit Sharma of BMO Capital Markets.","Amit Sharma","Indra, just given the recent resolution of really a very public disagreement with a shareholder, should we expect that the Company will probably focus a little bit more on some of the strategic other initiatives which might have been, not neglected, but probably not in front focus? So in terms of perhaps M&A into market or looking at your emerging market portfolio, where some of the things can be realigned?","Indra Nooyi","Amit, I'll tell you something. There was never a time that we did not focus on running the Company for all shareholders. I think between the senior management and the Board, we have constructive conversations with all our shareholders as we did with certain particularly outspoken shareholders. But there was never a time I\u2019d say over the last few years that we\u2019ve ever taken our eye off long-term investments to make our portfolio stronger. And if we see an opportunity that creates tremendous shareholder value, we\u2019ll certainly look at it. We\u2019ve looked at lot of things, but given the price expectations and given our assessment of what kind of value we can derive from these properties, we haven\u2019t seen the need to make any major investments in new M&A activities. But if something comes up that creates spectacular value, we\u2019ll be back to talk with you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Caroline Levy of CLSA.","Caroline Levy","Just a couple of questions. I noticed there is news out of Venezuela and how do you assess the risk of having to go to the 52 exchange rate? That would be the first one. And the second one is in Europe you had spectacular volume growth in both snack and beverage in the fourth quarter, considering the environment. I am trying to understand if that is sustainable, if you think that the underlying business is healthy enough that that\u2019s a real number we can look forward to going into\u201915?","Indra Nooyi","I\u2019ll talk to Europe and then Hugh, you've lived in Venezuela. So you talk about this. The Europe team is executing well. There is good innovation. Our portfolio is a bit more skewed towards products that the consumers want. For example a lot of what we sell in beverages in Europe is lower zero calorie beverages. We have a lot of baked product offerings in Europe, and even the Tropicana line-up we sell in France and the UK is a very different line-up than we sell here in the U.S. because the juice business evolved very, very differently there. On top of that, in a country like Russia, because our categories are in juice and dairy, stuff that the Russian consumer really needs, the businesses have been quite resilient. Now we have to wait and see how 2015 shapes up, but I\u2019d say for our categories and the nature of the products that we offer them the portfolio has remained quite resilient even going into 2015. But let's watch and see what happens.","The other thing too is in Western Europe the countries that we\u2019re in -- I think we have a slightly better skew to countries that are not in deep, deep troubles and I think that\u2019s helped us too in Europe. So -- and the team is very good, lot of depth of talent there and Europe is a good performer for us, especially given the incredibly difficult environment they're all operating under. Hugh, what about Venezuela?","Hugh Johnston","Yes. Regarding Venezuela Caroline, just a couple of comments. First, as you know, we spend the better part of the year at 6.3 last year and then moved to 12 in November. So the average for the year was 6.84. Our planning assumption right now is to be at SICAD 1, which is 12. Obviously there was news based on yesterday press conference out of Venezuela from the government talking about exchange rates. There was a lot of information mentioned there. It still isn\u2019t really clear because the details haven\u2019t been published as to what it all means yet. In general the fact that they seem to be going to a more market based supply and demand currency environment, those suggest I think long term positives for us.","In terms of the implications in the short term, we did hear that SICAD 1 would continue to exist. We will wait till we see more details on that and then we'll come back to investors with details as they emerge. But in the long run it seems to me it is probably encouraging based on what we heard yesterday in terms of being able to move currency and cash around more freely. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs. ","Judy Hong","I guess maybe just a little bit of color, just in terms of how you're thinking about your ability to price, particularly in markets like Russia or Latin America, where it is hyper inflationary. Indra, you've talked about Russia being resilient. But as you think about 2015 how much pricing have you taken already? Hugh, you've talked about some other commodity headwinds. Can you just talk about how you're looking for sort of the profit impact as the inflation comes up in those markets in the context of your ability and your flexibility to take price?","Indra Nooyi","Both Russia and Venezuela, oil dependent countries. Russia has its own set of additional issues. I think what the local teams do, they look to take as much pricing as they can to cover inflation, really assess the consumer demand and then they judiciously balance pricing and demand to make sure that we have a business that\u2019s in balance and we're not losing too much share or trying to gain too much share and destroy the P&L.","On top of that Judy, we don\u2019t stop there. The Russian team is restructuring its business to make sure they tighten the belt, restructure our footprint there so that we can become more productive in the middle of the P&L so that we can actually deliver profit in this difficult environment. And the Venezuela team has been doing this now for five or six years. And in a way you can take the playbook from Venezuela. In fact the playbook moved from Mexico from a few years ago to Venezuela today or Brazil from a few years ago to Venezuela, now to Russia. So this playbook is now becoming quite important as we navigate through currency volatility and economic volatility. So each country, it's the team that has to balance pricing, the elasticity in that marketplace, and how much cost controls they can put in place so that taken together you deliver whatever we have agreed with them is the right financial profile for that market. Anything else you wanted to add, Hugh?","Hugh Johnston","Yes. I think that\u2019s exactly right. The only thing I would add as a rule of thumb is in most markets when we run into these issues, we've sort of been able to price through somewhere between two thirds and three quarters of the inflation impact, and as Indra said, the rest of it we tend to handle through restructuring and productivity initiatives and things like that. Russia's obviously a more profound example of that but I think the rules of thumb will generally apply in that regard. But what it leads you to more broadly is the power of the PepsiCo integrated food and beverage portfolio and the size of geographic portfolio. As a few developing and emerging markets run into challenges, such as Russia, such as Venezuela, we also have markets like India, markets like Turkey that are performing very well. And as a result, the PepsiCo portfolio and the scale that food and beverage brings in each of those countries actually works quite well.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Faucher of JPMorgan.","John Faucher","Sort of a follow up question on that, we've seen a lot of Latin American pricing across the consumer stable complex over the past couple of quarters. It's mostly FX driven. So as you look out to 2015, the mid-single digit organic revenue growth targets, can you talk about sort of what you built in there for Latin American pricing and in sort of kind of talked about this to Caroline's question, but that sort of what's your view of the efficacy of that as sort of true organic revenue growth. And then a second question would be on the COGS guidance. Can you talk a little bit about sort of including transactional -- ex-transactional in terms of what you're seeing on a general raw material basis? Thanks.","Indra Nooyi","Hugh will take this.","Hugh Johnston","Yes, sure. John, in terms of both of those questions, regarding Latin America, you'll see us take a fairly significant pricing again. Inflation is obviously running in the high single to low double digits down there. And as I mentioned earlier we'll probably wind up pricing through somewhere in the neighborhood of three quarters of that. The rest we'll drive through restructuring and productivity. Regarding the transaction impact on commodities inflation, we talked about the fact that we're at low single digits for commodities inflation. About 40% to 50% of that is driven by transaction FX.","Indra Nooyi","I think the other thing that helps too, if I may add, across Latin America many of our businesses have a wide range of the portfolio from value to premium products. So you can actually price the portfolio differently. And that helps too because sometimes in the premium products you can take more pricing and it can stick while the value products you want to make sure that you don\u2019t get that pricing equation too much out of whack. So the teams have gotten pretty good at playing this revenue management game in a very careful way as they navigate through Brazil or Argentina or Venezuela or Mexico.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ali Dibadj of Bernstein.","Ali Dibadj","A couple of questions. One is around marketing spend and where you are on that. I only seen the quarter it listed up for LAF and PAB. So I just wanted to get a sense of where you are overall as a percentage for the year and how do we think about that going forward. As well as how we should think about the shift you mentioned from kind of pure marketing spend to gross to net I guess to consumer facing? So that\u2019s one entity of a question. The other one is\u2026.","Indra Nooyi","Ali just one second, may I stop you. What is the first question again, what\u2019s the word you used?","Ali Dibadj","The marketing spend.","Indra Nooyi","No, the previous one, you said on LAF and PAB. What did you ask me specifically?","Ali Dibadj","So LAF and PAB are the only places in the report in the release where we see marketing spend as mentioned as going higher. So overall wanted to get a sense of marketing spend on the quarter and for the year. And then the other question is actually around currencies. You guys have always had a very much more aligned impact of currencies on your top line and your bottom line. So sort of no multiplier for you guys. And I want to better understand the mechanics there. A lot of your peers have a bigger impact on the bottom line and the top line. And trying to understand where there are hedges? Are there natural hedges? How that flows through? So thanks very much on both of those, if that's clear.","Indra Nooyi","Thank you, Ali. I\u2019ll let Hugh answer the currencies. I think on the marketing spend, overall if you look at our A&M as a percentage of sales, we said we\u2019re going to hold it at 5.9% of sales and we\u2019re staying with that number. What happens is that in certain regions of the world, we shift the A&M depending on what kind of return we\u2019re getting for A&M spending. But more importantly we've been focused a lot Ali on working versus non-working spending. We\u2019re shifting a lot more to consumer facing programs and that\u2019s really what we were talking about because we believe that the more we focus on shifting the spending to working A&M away from sort of G&A type A&M, the more bang for the buck we get. So in every part of the world we\u2019re trying to put in place playbooks and best practices to increase the A&M that\u2019s consumer facing. So overall for the Company again, as we have said many times, we are holding to the A&M as a percentage of sales. But where we see an opportunity to increase it, we look for ways to reallocate it and at every moment we measure the return on investment on our marketing spend. With that, let me turn to Hugh to talk about the currencies in the top and the bottom line.","Hugh Johnston","Absolutely and Indra, just to add one more point around marketing spend to Ali\u2019s question. For the year we had marketing spend equal to the rate of sales growth. So we held as committed to at the beginning of the year. For the quarter A&M grew faster than sales. So A&M as a percent of sales went up in the quarter and obviously that was a bit of a margin drag in the quarter. Regarding your question comparing us to other companies in terms of our ability to equalize revenue and -- revenue and earnings FX impacts, I can\u2019t speak to what other companies are or aren\u2019t doing. What I can tell you is, number one, we do hedge transaction out several months. It varies from country to country based on what\u2019s economic. As you know in developing and emerging markets the hedges tend to get expensive when you go out more than a couple of months. So make good economic decisions in that regard.","Number two, I suspect the difference between us and most of our peer set is more of our costs are likely localized, because we do produce in so many countries. Our products don\u2019t ship as well as in particular HPC type companies. So I suspect that maybe the difference. But I don\u2019t know that for a fact because I haven\u2019t studied their cost structures that closely.","Indra Nooyi","I think it is also where we have our revenues and our margins. Latin America higher margins and Russia for example a lower margin. So the revenues gets hit more. So overall I think we have an aligned top and bottom line impact.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Schmitz of Deutsche Bank.","Bill Schmitz","I'm going to try to pull a fast one, sneak two or three questions in here if I could. Could you say what Russia was up in the quarter and I was wondering if there was any sort of pre-buy ahead of like big looming price increases which are probably coming this year or early this year? And then just on the Frito front I think it was an outcome this quarter. This is the first quarter in the last 12 where you've actually seen share gain. So do you think this is an inflection for Frito in terms of market share? And then maybe are you surprised that the category isn\u2019t accelerating faster given what\u2019s going on with gas prices at the pump and obviously a much better employment outlook and maybe even some nascent wage growth in the U.S.?","Indra Nooyi","Hugh, on pre-buys.","Hugh Johnston","Yes, pre-buys. Yes, we don\u2019t see a lot of evidence of that. Two things obviously work in our favor in that regard. One is just the fact that our products don\u2019t tend to last as long as perhaps other packaged goods companies products. The stale off factor matters. So it\u2019s difficult for people to pre-buy very far in advance for a lot of our products. That combined with the DSP system enables us to manage that. So we didn\u2019t see, we don\u2019t think a big impact from that perspective.","Frito-Lay, obviously we did see good performance in the quarter. We expect continued momentum out of Frito-Lay. In terms of the impact of gas prices, I think what we see happening is consistent with what we\u2019ve seen in the past which is -- it takes a number of months before the consumer fully spends back the so called benefit from lower gas prices. I think you're going to see that over the course of six months to eight months rather than an immediate change in consumer behavior. It just sort of assimilates over time. I am optimistic from the perspective that consumers right now, their personal balance sheets are pretty healthy. Most consumers have de-levered pretty well. So as a result of that I do think that money will make its way back into the marketplace, and as a Company that sells of more than a small amount of product through G stores and C stores, I think we\u2019ll benefit from it.","Indra Nooyi","And if the category keeps growing at this current rate, it's pretty good for us. Let me close by reiterating that we are pleased with our results for the quarter and for the full year. We are confident that our plans are working and as a result our outlook for 2015 is within our long-term financial goals. We want to thank you all for your time and questions this morning, and more importantly for the confidence you\u2019ve placed in us with your investments.

I\u2019m very pleased to report another quarter of strong results. In Q2 we had our sixth consecutive quarter of mid-single-digit organic revenue growth. We generated double-digit core EPS growth and drove significant improvement in cash flow. Our organic revenue growth in the quarter was 4.2%, in line with our mid-single-digit long-term target, with particularly strong growth in international beverages, at Frito-Lay North America, Latin American snacks, and snacks and beverages throughout Asia, Middle East, and Africa.","We are encouraged by the continued strength in the top line with our marketplace investments playing an important role in driving solid growth, brand equity and market share results. Organic revenue growth reflected each of our full business units achieving positive net price realization in the quarter. Our overall servings increased 4% with snacks volume growth of 3%. Beverage volume grew 1.5% on an organic basis and our international beverage growth was strong, up 11% on a reported basis and 5% on an organic basis. We had good profit flow through with core gross margins including 120 basis points in the quarter. A&M up 55 basis points, core constant currency operating profit up 11%, and our core operating margin up 120 basis points.","Ex the Vietnam gain and incremental investments, our core constant currency operating profit was up 8% and core operating margins improved by 60 basis points. Our productivity program remains clearly on track. We have targeted $900 million in savings this year which is the second year of our three-year program and we are well on our way to achieving our current goal of $3 billion. Year-to-date management operating cash flow excluding certain items was more than $2.3 billion, a significant increase over the first half of 2012. And we returned over $2.7 billion to shareholders in the first half in the form of dividends and share repurchases.","These results are especially pleasing in the context of some very difficult market conditions worldwide. Particularly, tough macro challenges challenging the consumer in developed markets, especially in Western Europe, slowing food and beverage growth in the United States, political unrest in several important markets most notably Egypt and Turkey, and adverse weather in the U.S. and Western Europe. We are able to continue to deliver in these trying conditions largely due to the strength of our portfolio, both the geographic diversity and product diversity. We have a wonderful balance of developed and emerging markets, with the developed markets providing strong cash flow generation and scale-enabled capability that we leverage globally.","Now emerging markets provide tremendous potential of top line growth and margin expansion. This is important. We have a diverse but highly complementary portfolio of brands and products. The high coincidence of snack and beverage purchase and consumption provides numerous commercial opportunity and our nutrition portfolio provides new growth avenues to capture expanding consumer demand. We continue to exploit the potential of our portfolio by sharpening our efforts against a few key platforms. We have stepped up our investments in advertising, marketing and R&D to further strengthen our brands and to accelerate our product innovation.","We have stepped our market based execution across the board. For example, we are driving even greater partnership with our customer by engaging in joint business planning that aligns our product, brands and in-store merchandizing capability with our customer's growth strategy. The scale and complementary nature of our categories makes us a clear partner of choice with our customer to drive their growth. We continue to refine our revenue management capability to drive both greater values for our consumer and price realization for PepsiCo. And in a number of international markets, we have improved the effectiveness of our go to market systems by driving synergies in selling and distribution systems across snacks and beverages.","We continue to execute against our productivity agenda that\u2019s funding, stepped up marketplace investments, and at the same time expanding our margins. We now have our team focused on identifying and planning the next generation of productivity projects that will extend our productivity savings beyond 2014. We have also strengthened our global bottling network and systems scale in a number of key markets through our new partnerships with Tingyi in China, with (inaudible) and Polar in Mexico, and in just this past quarter, our partnership with Suntory in Vietnam. And we're driving high returns in invested capital and cash returns to shareholders through highly disciplined capital allocation.","Let me now turn to specific businesses. All our business units performed well financial and in the marketplace in Q2. Let me share with you some of the highlights. At Frito-Lay North America, we generated 3% volume growth and mid-single-digit organic revenue growth, with net price realization widening sequentially from what we reported in Q1. We gained volume share and maintained value share across major channels in the United States. And we expanded core operating margins by 40 basis points even as we increased advertising and marketing expense. ","In Beverages Americas, we achieved another quarter of solid price realization in the United States. We held CSD share in U.S. major channel, with pricing and retail ahead of the category. We drove growth and core operating margin expansion while we increased advertising and marketing spend. We generated 4% core constant currency operating profitability. ","And innovation was encouraging, with Mountain Dew Kickstart, Tropicana Farmstand and Starbucks iced coffee each demonstrating potential to become $100 million plus at retail platforms and contributing to positive price utilization and value share gain. And strong marketing and merchandising led to value share gains by Gatorade sports drinks in our coffee, tea and chilled juice business. ","In other developed markets, despite the tough macros, we saw good performance in some of our larger markets. France grew organic revenue 9% and the UK and Germany each posted 3% organic revenue growth. Innovation played a large part of our success with the launch of the naturally sweetened Pepsi Next in France and Trop50 in the UK. We saw very good growth in our developing and emerging markets in Q2, with organic revenue of 11%, made up of 11% in snacks and 10% in beverages and this was driven by execution of our strategy to increase household penetration and frequency of consumption.","We had terrific growth from each of our major developing markets, with organic revenue growth of 7% in Mexico, 15% in the rest of Latin America and 12% in Turkey. And we are especially pleased with our beverage volume performance in Russia where we grew Pepsi, Lipton, 7UP and Russky Dar kvaas each in the double-digits. And we saw the benefits of our Russia platform with strong results in Ukraine. Our emerging markets performance drove the continued great results in our EMEA sector, where organic volume grew 6% in snacks and 9% in beverages and organic revenue grew 14%. Within our emerging markets organic revenue was especially strong in Pakistan and the Philippines, with each growing in excess of 20%. ","Organic revenue grew high teens in Jordan, mid-teens in India and Egypt and 12% in Saudi Arabia. We'd like to point out one of our emerging star brands in the region, Mountain Dew. It posted another quarter of double-digit volume growth in the region, marking the 10th consecutive quarter of double-digit volume growth in the region. And Mountain Dew is now our largest carbonated soft drink brand in Pakistan and growing rapidly in India.","And China performed especially well, with organic revenue growth of 22% in beverages and 23% in snacks. We are particularly pleased with our CSD performance in China, with year-to-date volumes up 10%, significantly outpacing the category. In addition, our beverage volume grew 24% in the Philippine, 13% in the in Pakistan, 11% in India and high single-digits in Egypt and Saudi Arabia. ","So overall we feel very good about our results in the state of the business. However, in any portfolio there are always areas that need some attention. So let me cover the two areas that we're especially focused on, North American Beverages and Quaker North America. Now, I must say we're making good progress at North American Beverages to accelerate innovation, improve our marketplace execution and drive productivity to improve our competitiveness and profitability. But the fact remains the beverage category in the U.S. has its challenges, especially carbonated soft drinks. Against this challenging backdrop, we are pleased with the progress we've made with our beverage business. We\u2019ve stayed focused on repositioning our business for long-term sustainable growth. We have made solid progress on brand building and innovation. We have improved marketplace execution. We've stepped up productivity, which coupled with disciplined pricing drove solid bottom line performance. ","We are leveraging the strength of the portfolio which is well balanced between CSDs and non-carbs, and within CSDs we possess the fastest growing mainstream brand, Mountain Dew. We will continue to invest in breakthrough innovation and new technologies that have the potential to reframe the beverage category by removing some of the compromises that consumers face with regard to calories and ingredients. In addition as we've said in the past, we're also exploring every possible alternative, including structural alternatives, to further improve our margins and returns in this business and we'll provide an update on our efforts in early 2014.","The second area is Quaker North America, This is a business with great brands, high margins, high returns on capital, and it generates a lot of U.S. cash flow. So there is a lot to like about this business. But a good deal of this business lives in the center of the store and the center of the place, and that makes it a challenge to grow especially as consumers increasingly see convenience. To be short, we've made good progress in this business with improved marketing and execution and we've had some recent innovation wins.","Real Medleys is being extended from a successful new product to a successful new brand platform. It's expanding into bars with double-digit revenue growth and has a lot more potential for growth. Plus the international Cracker business is doing exceedingly well and grew volume 5% in Q2. But we're still in the early innings of capturing the full potential of this business in North America. We are focusing on driving innovation that truly excites consumer and for us it's a work in progress and we have the right resources and talent dedicated to getting this business on a firmer footing.","You know the fact that PepsiCo continues to perform well even as it addresses these opportunities, speaks to the power of our portfolio. We have the products and geographic breadth to participate and thrive in categories in markets that are growing and that gives us the flexibility to address all opportunities in a sensible, responsible way without disrupting our overall financial results. So, as we look ahead to the balance of the year we are confident in our ability to achieve our full year 2013 financial goal. And as we look beyond 2013, we believe we're positioned well to deliver our long-term financial goals which we believe will translate top tier shareholder returns on a sustainable basis.","With that, let me turn the call over to Hugh. Hugh?","Hugh Johnston","Great. Thanks, Indra, and again good morning, everyone. I will spend just a minute covering the financial results and guidance in a little bit more detail and then we will open up the lines for your questions.","For Q2, organic volume grew 3% in snacks and 1.5% in beverages. Organic revenue grew 4.2%. Our core gross margins improved by about 120 basis points and we increased A&M expense by 13%. Core operating margin improved by 120 basis points and core constant currency operating profit grew 11%. As we've previously disclosed and mentioned in the release, we realized $137 million pre-tax gain on our Vietnam refranchising and incrementally invested $46 million pre-tax in the quarter. Excluding the impact of the Vietnam gain in incremental investments, core operating margin improved by 60 basis points and core constant currency operating profit grew by 8%.","Our core effective tax rate was 24.5%, approximately 335 basis points below Q2 2012. And core constant currency EPS grew 19% and 13% % excluding the Vietnam gain and incremental investment. So, between core constant currency division operating profit growth of 11% and core constant currency EPS growth of 19%, we got about 8 points of leverage. About 1.5 points of that came from net interest expense, 5 points came from tax rate which will reverse in the second half as we're forecasting the full year tax rate to come in at approximately 27%, and 1 point from weighted average share count which was down 1% year-on-year. Overall, the quarter came in as expected with pricing actions, commodity inflation and productivity all in line with our expectations.","On a reported basis, net revenue was up 2% and that was driven by a 1.5 point drag from ForEx and 1 point negative impact from structural change reflecting the China and Vietnam re-franchisings. We generated over $3 billion in cash flow from operations in the first half, a $1.8 billion positive swing versus last year. This was driven by lower pension contributions and strong working capital improvements. Management operating cash flow, excluding certain items was more than $2.3 billion, an increase of approximately $1 billion over the first half of last year. And we returned over $2.7 billion to shareholders in the first half in the form of dividends and share repurchases.","Turning to guidance. For 2013, we expect core constant currency EPS growth of 7% off a core 2012 base of $4.10. We expect organic revenue growth of mid-single-digits, core constant currency operating profit growth of approximately 6%, approximately 1 point of leverage below the operating profit line driven by share repurchases and we expect our core effective tax rate to be approximately 27% for the full year. Within these expectations, we assume positive price mix, low single-digit commodity inflation and productivity of $900 million. Our productivity assumption is completely in line with the three year, $3 billion program that we launched last year and the savings will be used to help offset inflation as well as provide funding for investments back into the business.","One of our key investment areas is supporting our brands with advertising and marketing where we'll grow our A&M investment at least in line with sales, meaning you should expect A&M spending of at least 5.7% of net revenue which was our 2012 base line investment. In addition, we're also accelerating our investment in R&D and in innovation. You should also take into account that we intend to incrementally invest the balance of the Vietnam gain in the second half of the year which will impact operating profit growth and margins. We expect the full year operating profit impact of the gain to be offset by incremental investments.","Regarding ForEx, based on current market consensus, we anticipate foreign exchange translation to have an approximately 1 point negative impact on our net revenue and a 2 point negative impact on operating profit and EPS for the full year, including the impact of the Venezuela devaluation. Our full year ForEx outlook for EPS is 1 point more negative than what we shared with you on the Q1 call, which is an incremental $0.04 versus where we were at the end of Q1. As we anticipate structural changes driven by China and Vietnam, we will have a negative impact of approximately 1 point on a full year on our net revenue growth. Overall, we're pleased with how the second quarter and first half came in.","For the full year, we are maintaining our constant currency guidance. The world remains a volatile place and we may also choose to incrementally invest in additional long-term value building initiatives such as advertising, innovation and in emerging markets growth capacity. As you model out the third quarter, we expect foreign exchange translation to have up to a negative 0.5 point impact on third quarter revenue and 1 point impact on EPS based on current market consensus rates. We expect revenue in the third quarter will have an estimated one-half of percentage point negative impact from structural changes due to the Vietnam re-franchising. ","Division operating profit will be impacted by commodity cost inflations sequentially higher than in the first half as we expected. Incremental investments funded by the Vietnam gain, increased A&M expense and negative ForEx. Below the division operating profit line, corporate costs in Q3 will be above Q2 levels based on the timing of investments, primarily in R&D. Net interest expense will increase sequentially from Q2, reflecting primarily higher rates. And our tax rate will be significantly higher than our half one tax rate as we trend toward our full year estimated tax rate of approximately 27%.","From a cash flow prospective, we expect full year core management operating cash flow, excluding certain items, of more than $7 billion. We'll continue to drive cash flow through an even more efficient working capital management program and continued tight controls over capital spending. And for 2013, we expect to see continued improvement in our key working capital metrics and to manage net capital spending to approximately $3 billion which is well within our long-term target of less than or equal to 5% of net revenue . As a result, we'll continue to return strong cash flow to our shareholders.","In total, we expect to return approximately $6.4 billion to shareholders in 2013. $3.4 billion in dividends and $3 billion in share repurchases. Our outlook for 2013 is unchanged from our last call and it's consistent with our long-term targets for net revenue, operating profit and core constant currency EPS. We expect to drive improved full year margins and net ROIC, and generating and returning cash flow to our shareholders remains a top priority for the company.","Operator, we will take the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our first question is coming from John Faucher from JPMorgan.","John Faucher - JPMorgan","Hugh, I want to talk a little about the gross margin. You talked about sort of more cost pressures flowing through in the back half. I'm assuming some of that's sort of corn in the cadence of the hedging and things like that, as well as may be some of the shorter term raw material impacts. Can you talk about how you see that playing out a little bit further forward? Will there be a corn benefit at some point over the next 12 to 18 months, do you see that roll out? And can you talk just about what you're seeing on sort of the resin side as well as some of the more chemical or petroleum based raw materials? Thanks.","Hugh Johnston","Yeah. Sure, John, happy to. Again a lot of the impact that we're seeing is, we were in the first half overlapping a higher inflation from 2012 and we're lapping lower inflation in the back half of 2012. As to the commodities, it's really a combination of a couple of areas. Some of it is in the whole Ag complex and corn obviously is a piece of that, and some of that is also PET as well in the back half, again driven more by the overlaps than anything else. It will be roughly even between Q3 and Q4 and it should play out as we mentioned earlier. Regarding 2014, it's really premature to comment on that. We're still six months away from that. We try not to get into 2014 until we get to the guidance on that and for me to just start talking about pieces of it probably wouldn't be beneficial to do right now. So, we'll hold on that until we get to our Q4 call in next February.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane from Bank of America.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi this is [Maria Golop], good morning. I'd like to ask about the Vietnam gain. So it's giving you some incremental funds to spend. You previously had a funding budget for 2013 and this adds to it. So my question really is, sort of what type of specific activities are you spending on and in what geographies? And then related to that, why shouldn't we expect sort of an incremental boost to sales in the near term from these investment activities?","Indra Nooyi","Hugh, you want to?","Hugh Johnston","Yeah, I would be happy to handle that. So where you're going to see us invested is largely in international and it will be geared towards top line driving types of activities. Now when we do these things they typically don't pay back immediately, you typically see the payback in one to two year types of time frames. So I wouldn't necessarily expect to see a short term acceleration in revenue driven by all of that. What we're really doing here is extending both the duration and the durability of our strong top-line growth as well as flowing it ultimately through to stronger bottom-line growth. So we feel these are the right decisions to make for the franchise as well as to enhance and solidify our operating performance.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Caroline Levy with CLSA.","Caroline Levy - CLSA","I just wondered if you could comment since your international and even your domestic quarter ends a little earlier than many other companies on how June looks and just volume wise, particularly in beverages if you still face huge challenges that then carry through to the third quarter giving you some pause on any recovery in beverage volumes looking out this year","Indra Nooyi","Caroline, we don't really comment on one month\u2019s performance, but we'll talk more about it in our Q3 call.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.","Dara Mohsenian \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Indra, you mentioned in your remarks that you're looking for ways to drive margin improvement on the beverage side of the business and obviously the strategic piece of that you probably will be hesitant to comment on. But I was hoping you could comment on what you can do internally to boost beverage margins as you look out over the next few years. And as you look at that business, do you think the lower margin structure that exists versus beverage or CPG peers in general, is that more due to structural reasons such as scale et cetera? Or are there significant cost savings opportunities you can go after internally on that business beyond what you've already outlined?","Indra Nooyi","Dara, I presume you\u2019re talking about North American beverages, because when I was talking about margin improvement opportunities I was talking about North American beverages. Just roughly speaking, our franchise business has got much better margins than an operating business in the beverage world, because you've got the entire cost line to work with. I think in the North American beverage business, as we've mentioned before Dara, we've been investing in many technologies, whether it's processing technology, packaging technology, ingredient technology and one-by-one some of these technologies are beginning to start being commercialized. So as we look at our productivity program and we\u2019ve talked about the next [branch] of productivity, some of that next branch of productivity is from North American beverages. And that comes from some of these technologies beginning to get implemented in the marketplace. And that's what gives us confidence that there are opportunities to improve margin performance.","On top of that, we\u2019ve really cranked up innovation machine and the combination of the new innovation coming to the marketplace driving top-line in a category that has slowed down a lot. But our goal is to use the power of our portfolio to drive the top-line growth. Coupled with these new technologies and different ways of working within North America to improve the productivity of the operations is what gives us confidence that we can improve the margins in North American Beverages.","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank.","Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank","Hey, can you just elaborate a little bit more, just update us on the acquisition strategy. I think you're still sticking with just smaller niche fields that fill in strategic holes. And then maybe just some commentary on some of the noise recently in the press.","Indra Nooyi","Bill, we\u2019ve been incredibly consistent. PepsiCo is an extremely well architected portfolio geographically. From a product perspective, we are hitting our stride. Every part of the business is functioning well and we do not need large scale M&A to deliver on our financial goals. We do have a strategy to focus on tuck-in acquisitions, and we\u2019ve said tuck-in acquisitions in any year will be $500 million or less. And that's all we are focused on. And I would look beyond the noise and let's just focus on PepsiCo and the performance of the company. And we feel very good about it. Thank you, Bill.","So thank you all for your questions. In closing, let me just say that our performance for the second quarter and through first half of 2013 are excellent indications of how our well constructed and developed portfolio, coupled with disciplined execution reinvestment, can drive high quality top and bottom line results on a sustainable basis. That is the purpose of PepsiCo. And I thank you for your time this morning and for the confidence you\u2019ve placed in us with your investments. Have a great day.","Operator","Thank you.

Today's call is being recorded and will be archived at www.PepsiCo.com.","It is now my pleasure to introduce Mr. Jamie Caulfield, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Caulfield, you may begin.","Jamie Caulfield - PepsiCo, Inc.","Thank you, operator. With me today are Indra Nooyi, PepsiCo's Chairman and CEO, and Hugh Johnston, PepsiCo's CFO. We'll lead off today's call with a review of our full-year 2016 performance and our initial full-year 2017 outlook, and then we'll move on to Q&A. We've kept our comments brief this morning and intend to conclude the call by 8:45.","Before we begin, please take note of our cautionary statement. This conference call includes forward-looking statements, including statements regarding 2017 guidance, based on currently available information. Forward-looking statements inherently involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those predicted.

Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.","Thank you, Jamie, and good morning, everyone.","As you saw on this morning's release, we concluded 2016 with another strong quarter of operating performance, capping off a very successful year. The operating environment continued to be challenging in 2016. So in this context, I am pleased to report that we achieved or exceeded each of the financial goals we shared with you at the beginning of the year.","To recap, we grew organic revenue 3.7%, in line with our goal of approximately 4%. We met our goal of expanding core operating margins, which were up 80 basis points compared to 2015. Core constant currency EPS grew 9% versus our initial goal of 6%. Keep in mind this includes the impact of deconsolidating Venezuela, which was approximate 2.5 point drag on earnings. Excluding the impact of deconsolidating Venezuela, core constant currency EPS grew 12%. We generated $7.8 billion in free cash flow, excluding certain items. We substantially exceeded our goal of $7 billion. Core net ROIC expanded by 190 basis points and now stands at 21.5%, well in excess of our cost of capital. And we met our goal of returning $7 billion in cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, bringing our 5-year cumulative shareholder cash returns to $38 billion.","And reflecting our continuing commitment to providing attractive cash returns to our owners, I'm also pleased to announce that we are increasing our annualized dividend per share for the 45th consecutive year beginning with our June 2017 payment, to $3.22 per share, which represents a 3% yield based on yesterday's closing share price.","We had notably good operating performance across our operating segments for the year. Our two largest divisions, Frito-Lay North America and North America Beverages, each had strong well-balanced performance with volume gains, net price realization and margin expansion, driving high single-digit core constant currency operating profit growth. And despite the macro volatility and weak currencies in many of our key overseas markets that impacted our reported results, our international divisions delivered very solid organic revenue growth, led by high single-digit growth in our developing and emerging markets businesses as a group, with particularly strong performance in Mexico, China and Egypt, which grew organic revenue in the double digits.","Our results reflect our commitment to plan and manage our business in a way that's self-sustaining and balances delivery of attractive short-term financial results with long-term shareholder value creation. We achieve this by executing a virtuous circle model that combines top-line growth, productivity and significant reinvestment in the business. Our top-line performance is underpinned by strong market positions in growing categories and an enviable portfolio of leading brands. And it is fueled by a product innovation engine built on consumer and shopper insights, deep research and development capabilities, and the broad market reach afforded by our advantaged go-to-market systems.","Our top line growth is also supported by strong collaborative customer relationships. Customers value our relationships with them because we deliver growth. Our brands and products drive basket size and an extremely high velocity off the shelf, and therefore generate significant cash flow for our retail partners. Our customers value our robust innovation, the in-store labor benefits of DSD [Direct Store Delivery], and our sophisticated consumer and shopper insights.","The strength of our customer relationships was evident in the most recent Kantar Retail PoweRanking in the United States, where we achieved the top spot as the number one best-in-class manufacturer, and we earned top marks in the individual categories of most important brands, use of digital platforms, insights and category management, growth and profitability, supply chain management, clear company strategy, and sales force and customer teams.","Beyond this impressive recognition, our capabilities and diligent execution enabled us once again to be the largest driver of growth for our food and beverage retail partners in the United States, which is our largest market. In fact, while we represent less than 10% of retail food and beverage sales, in 2016 we drove 18% of the total retail sales growth of food and beverage. This compares to a net decline in sales for all other $5 billion-plus manufacturers combined.","Our success is also supported by an aggressive and relentless drive for productivity that contributes to current financial performance and provides the funding for investments that will sustain our growth into the future. These substantial investments have largely been directed at capabilities that fuel top line growth. So to strengthen our brands, we've increased our advertising and marketing as a percent of sales by 145 basis points over the past five years and increased it by 40 basis points in just this past year alone.","At the same time, we have directed a higher percentage of our A&M budget from non-working A&M to consumer-facing working A&M to increase returns in our A&M spending. And we have strengthened our capabilities in digital marketing, enabling us to execute marketing campaigns that seamlessly weave together social media, traditional media, and point of sale for greater impact.","We've increased our investment in R&D by 45% since 2011 and have spent approximately $3.5 billion on R&D and food quality and safety initiatives cumulatively over the past five years. In addition, over the past several years, we have amplified our own financial investments in R&D by expanding and strengthening our relationships with key strategic suppliers and academic and research institutions to leverage their capabilities to our benefit.","We've also established a global design center staffed with world-class creative talent. Increasingly, we are incorporating design beginning in the earliest stages of innovation to take into account the entire purchase-to-consumption cycle, and this is resulting in the creation of not just products, but truly memorable experiences for our consumers.","Our R&D capability investments have led to the creation of new products in the short term and to the development of new platforms, ingredients, and packaging with longer-term potential for breakthrough benefits, such as sugar, calorie, fat and sodium reductions, and more sustainable packaging alternatives. Under this robust innovation agenda, net revenue from new products, which we define as products introduced within the past three years, has averaged more than $5 billion since 2013.","And we are pleased to report that in 2016, PepsiCo accounted for over 17% of innovation sales at retail, as measured by IRI in the United States, more innovation than from the next four innovation contributors combined. And it has also advanced our portfolio transformation. For example, we launched a number of new low and reduced calorie drinks in 2016, such as new recipes of Mirinda and 7UP with 30% less sugar, which is rolling out in over 80 international markets.","Meanwhile, we saw great momentum across our nutritious and functional beverages. Naked Juice is on its way to being our next $1 billion brand, while Tropicana launched Tropicana Essentials Probiotics, making it the first brand to bring probiotics to the mainstream juice consumer. Gatorade Frost exceeded $1 billion in measured retail sales, pushing Gatorade over a high watermark of $5 billion in measured retail sales. And our Russia team launched a new J7 apple juice that delivers all the fiber of a single apple in every glass.","At the same time, we grew our portfolio of healthier snacks with Quaker Breakfast Flats, a snack we plan to roll out in more than a dozen countries over the next two years. We are building on the success of Baked Lay's by broadening our lineup of baked products. And we're expanding Sabra, a brand that generates roughly $800 million in estimated annual retail sales. We are expanding it beyond hummus into a range of products, from guacamole and salsa to Greek yogurt dips and spreads.","Simply put, when it comes to transforming our portfolio, we are making considerable progress. In fact, some people are surprised to learn that our beloved Pepsi-Cola trademark accounted for 12% of net revenue in 2016. What we refer to as everyday nutrition products account for approximately 25% of our portfolio by net revenue. These are products that include positive nutrients like grains, fruits and vegetables, or protein, plus those that are naturally nutritious like water and unsweetened tea. And what we refer to as guilt-free products comprises about 45% of net revenue. This broader definition includes the everyday nutrition products plus diet beverages and other beverages with fewer than 70 calories per 12 ounce and snacks with low levels of sodium and saturated fat.","We've also made disciplined investments in our physical infrastructure. Over the past five years we've invested approximately $14 billion in property, plant, and equipment to support the growth of our business, maintain a safe work environment, use less energy and water, and achieve the highest levels of quality and safety in our products.","We also recognize that we're living in an era where all of our stakeholders, from shareholders like you to our consumers, associates, and partners, are all increasingly expecting corporations like ours not only to make a profit, but to do so in a way that's responsive to the needs of the local communities where we operate. And that's exactly what we've been doing, making investments to lift up farmers and workers, small businesses, families and children, from Mexico, where Quaker launched a pin oat malnutrition prevention trial with over 1,000 low-income children; to Pakistan, where we tripled the number of girls benefiting from our I am PepsiCo mentoring and social program; and forging strong ties with local communities. Forging strong ties with local communities isn't just the right thing to do. It's also the right thing to do for our business, reinforcing the bonds that will sustain our success over the long-term.","And finally, we are investing in our most valuable asset of all, our people by: expanding paid family leave; adopting flexible work arrangements; enhancing our learning and development programs; and many other actions. We are building a workplace that is diverse and inclusive and that will continue to attract the top talent in industry in all levels of the organization.","In summary, we've established solid momentum in our business, with strong financial performance generated through a healthy balance of top-line performance and productivity. And we have made, and will continue to make, investments in capability and infrastructure that we believe will strengthen the competitiveness of our business and lengthen the duration of our financial returns. Our results for 2016 reflect the effectiveness of this approach and gives us confidence in our ability to continue to perform well going forward.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Hugh to cover the 2017 outlook. Hugh?","Hugh F. Johnston - PepsiCo, Inc.","Thank you, Indra, and good morning, everyone.","Moving on to our outlook for 2017, as we set out in the release, we expect organic revenue growth of at least 3%, as we expect to continue to benefit from successful product innovation and strong marketplace execution, tempered by a cautious macro outlook. And we expect core earnings of $5.09 per share, which assumes core constant currency growth of 8%, offset by an expected 3 percentage point drag from foreign exchange translation based on current market consensus rates.","Let me touch on the key considerations and assumptions embedded in our outlook. We expect currency to be headwind as a majority of our major currencies, including the Mexican peso, the pound, the Egyptian pound and Turkish lira and others, are expected to devalue relative to the dollar based on the current consensus outlook.","Our guidance assumes a 3-point unfavorable impact on both revenue and core earnings per share. We expect raw material inflation to accelerate, both by an increase in our basket of commodities and additional pressure from transaction ForEx. We expect A&M as a percent of sales to be roughly in line with 2016. We expect continued operating margin expansion through a mix of where we are sourcing the expansion will be more heavily skewed to SG&A versus the COGS you have seen in recent years. And we expect our core effective tax rate to be approximately 24%.","Productivity will continue to contribute to our margin expansion, enabled by several important foundational initiatives we've put in place. First, by investments we have made in technology, starting with our implementation of SAP in the early 2000s, followed by implementation of many other complementary software, hardware and advanced manufacturing technology solutions that we are leveraging on a global scale.","Second, by our aggressive environmental sustainability programs that reduce our use of resources, particularly energy, packaging and water. Third, the global operating model we put in place beginning in 2012 has reduced management layers, increased management spans, promoted best practice sharing and accelerated decision-making.","And the fourth, Smart Spending, our version of zero-based budgeting that is capturing substantial savings across all major discretionary spending categories. For example, by increasing our use of relatively inexpensive teleconferencing by 30%, we also cut travel expense by over 30% and increased the productivity of our associates by reducing the time they spend in airports and on planes.","Our productivity agenda, focused on driving both efficiency and effectiveness, has resulted in approximately $1 billion of annual savings since 2012 and is expected to generate approximately $1 billion again in 2017. Over just the last three years, it has contributed to 140 basis points of core operating margin improvement, and led to a 510 basis point increase in our core net ROIC.","And our productivity programs have driven greater effectiveness across our value chain by increasing manufacturing throughput, expanding SKU capacity, improving job quality for our front-line associates, creating a safer work environment, reducing our environmental footprint, improving product freshness for our consumers and enhancing our customer service.","Turning to cash flow, we expect to continue to generate strong cash flow and to exercise discipline over capital allocation, with prudent reinvestment into the business and the majority of our free cash flow returned to shareholders. So for 2017, we expect: approximately $10 billion in cash flow from operations; net capital spending of approximately $3 billion; approximately $7 billion in free cash flow, excluding certain items; cash dividends of approximately $4.5 billion; and share repurchases of approximately $2 billion.","Finally, as you update your models, I'd like to highlight the following. As it relates to the first quarter, we expect both our organic revenue growth and core EPS growth rates to be below our full-year guidance levels due to four factors. First, at this stage of the quarter, we expect organic sales to decline at our AMENA [Asia-Middle East-North Africa] division, driven by increased levels of volatility throughout the region and Chinese New Year timing. Second, holiday calendar shifts will modestly impact our top-line results in North America. Third, FLNA and NAB face very difficult operating profit growth comparisons, as they lap both input cost deflation from last year. And finally, we expect foreign exchange translation to be a low single-digit headwind on both reported revenue and EPS based on current market consensus rates.","With that, we're ready to take the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Good morning, everyone.","Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.","Good morning, Bryan. Good morning.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Just a question about the 3% organic sales growth guidance for 2017. One, I just want to clarify. Is the 53rd week in the base? And then second, I think, Hugh, you touched on the tough macros as a consideration, so if you can, just expand upon that. Is that a comment about North America, a comment about markets outside the U.S.? Just a little more color there would be helpful.","Hugh F. Johnston - PepsiCo, Inc.","Sure, happy to, Bryan. Two things, one, in terms of the 53rd week, it is not included in the base. So the 3% is an apples-to-apples comparison between 2017 and 2016. That's a clean comparison. Number two, nothing specific in terms of anything attached to PepsiCo's business performance, I think our 3% revenue guidance reflects just a cautious outlook on the macros globally as well as a reflection of what is even a more volatile world relative to the volatility that we've seen in the past few years. So the combination of that increased volatility relative to the recent past and our general caution as we provide guidance at this time of the year has led us to the 3% growth outlook \u2013 at least 3% growth outlook.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley.","Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.","Good morning, Dara.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey, good morning, guys. So historically, you've had pretty consistent gross margin expansion over the last few years. This quarter was obviously a bit of a change with the modest year-over-year compression. So, Hugh, can you give us some more detail on what drove that different performance in Q4? And it sounds like in 2017, you're expecting muted expansion in terms of gross margin. So I guess what's changed on the gross margin front? And has anything changed in terms of the way you're managing pricing versus your commodity bucket? Thanks.","Hugh F. Johnston - PepsiCo, Inc.","Yeah, happy to, Dara. Two comments on that, number one, the Q4 gross margins were not a surprise to us in any way, shape, or form. I think as we had mentioned during the course of the year, our expectation was for inflation in commodities to pick up a bit in the fourth quarter, and that's exactly what happened. Now when we take pricing, we take pricing for the entire year. So we got a little bit of extra gross margin expansion during the first three quarters as we took our annual pricing, and we got a small amount of compression, 25 basis points, in the fourth quarter.","As we look forward into 2017, in the first half in particular, before we lap the inflation that we saw in 2016, we do expect to see a higher level of low single-digit inflation in commodities. And that combined with our annual pricing outlook will probably result in a bit of pressure on gross margins.","As I mentioned in the script that I just shared with you all as well, I would expect to see more of our operating and margin expansion coming from SG&A rather than coming from cost of goods. That's a result of an intentional strategy. As we saw ourselves moving to a slightly different commodity environment, we focused more of our productivity energy on SG&A to accommodate that to enable continued operating margin expansion.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman of Barclays.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great, thanks. Good morning. I just wanted to ask about reinvestments of the 53rd week. I thought it was interesting in the press release that you mentioned not just reinvesting in growth, but also reinvesting in productivity. So if you could talk a little bit about that, it would be great. And then also, in the outlook for the tax rate, is there anything incorporated for the change in accounting treatment for stock option? Thanks.","Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.","Hugh, go ahead.","Hugh F. Johnston - PepsiCo, Inc.","So, Lauren, let me talk a little bit about productivity reinvestment first. We have lots of productivity initiatives over the course of the company, whether it's things like GES, which we've been doing at Frito for a number of years and we've now expanded it into Latin America, as well as different types of capability building that continue the momentum that we've seen on productivity. With the 53rd week, we thought there was a good opportunity to continue to invest and accelerate that. We did so, particularly in Latin America but as well as in other businesses in Europe and to some degree in AMENA as well. That is going to be a part of the SG&A gross margin story going forward.","As relates to your question on tax treatment, the answer is yes, it is included.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ali Dibadj of Bernstein.","Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.","Good morning, Ali.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hey, how are you?","Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.","Well, thank you.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","So I had two questions. One is just to follow up a little bit more on the SG&A piece to it. Particularly in this quarter, it was down quite low, 110 basis points, to our math, I believe. Can you talk a little bit more about what drove that? Was advertising and marketing any piece of that driving downward in the SG&A line for this quarter and then, how we should think about it progressing it forward? It looks like you're going to be focused more on that, but what is that going to be from a SG&A perspective and what the buckets of productivity are for that?","And then a second, if I could, is just on your share repurchase guidance. I think it's about $2 billion; it has been about $3 billion. Can you talk a little bit about that decision-making or is that just again cautious on the operating macro environment so a little bit more cautious on the share buybacks? Thank you.","Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.","I'm going to let Hugh answer this. I'll just tell you one thing, Ali. As I mentioned in my script, investments in A&M, R&D, those we're not backing off of. We've increased investment in A&M. We've increased investment in R&D and we'll keep investing money in areas that drive the top-line growth of the company, but, Hugh, why don't you talk about the SG&A productivity plan and the share repurchase guidance?","Hugh F. Johnston - PepsiCo, Inc.","Sure, happy to. And, Ali, just to be even more specific on the A&M question, A&M was level for the fourth quarter, so the SG&A increase that you saw, the productivity increase in SG&A for the quarter, was not driven by A&M at all. A&M was level for the quarter as a percent of sales.","Regarding the benefits that we expect to see going forward, I think it's reflective of two things. Number one, it's continuing rollout of things like GES, which obviously make our selling system more effective. And as we take those capabilities in different forms to various regions of the world, you're going to continue to see more benefit in that regard. That's big point number one. Big point number two is around Smart Spending. As I think we've mentioned in earlier calls, we really focus Smart Spending on four categories in this year. We still have another 27 or 28 categories of spend. So you'll continue to see Smart Spending having a significant influence on our SG&A going forward.","Regarding your question on share repurchase, I think, more than anything else, that is driven by the fact that, I believe as you know, certainly many of our investors know, that we have been returning capital to shareholders in excess of free cash flow over the course of the last several years. By moving that number to $2 billion, that basically brings our cash return in line with our free cash flow generation, which obviously puts us in a very sustainable position going forward. Obviously, as everything else, to the degree there are changes in guidance, we'll update it, but, right now, that is our guidance and that's what we would expect for the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.","Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.","Good morning, Judy.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you, good morning. So, Hugh, your comment about the first quarter organic revenue growth that will come in below your full year outlook, I was just trying to get a little bit more color because, I mean, AMENA is not a huge region for you, so for that to be really a big cause, it seems a little bit more exaggerated. And then, also, just in light of softer trends that we've seen in North America for some of the food and beverage categories, I'm just wondering if that also has an impact on your 1Q outlook.","Hugh F. Johnston - PepsiCo, Inc.","Yes, Judy, happy to answer that. You're absolutely right. AMENA is only part of it. If you recall, part of my comments as well reflected holiday timing. Let me point to two things in particular that do have a meaningful impact on the quarter. Number one, New Year's actually this year fell into our 53rd week. In previous years, that's fallen into week one of the new year. So in effect, we lost New Year's out of this year. Now, the reality of it is because it fell into the 53rd week, we also really lost it out of last year as well. It wasn't captured in either year. So that takes away from our Q1 in North America.","Number two was the timing on Easter. We lose a week of the Easter build out of Q1. That moves into Q2. Those two big factors are basically the holiday timing point that I was making, and that focus is very specifically on our North American businesses. Other than that, our North American businesses are performing well. There's no issue with the performance of the businesses, but the holiday timing at both ends of the quarter do have a negative impact on it.","In addition to that, as we mentioned earlier, and this is part of AMENA's numbers, the timing impact on Chinese New Year, the move forward pulled some of that into the fourth quarter, whereas in the previous year, it had been entirely in the first quarter. So those are the specific holiday timing references, but nothing in the first quarter relating to the businesses themselves in terms of negative implications for performance.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Powers of UBS.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Hey, great. Thanks. Good morning.","Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.","Good morning.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","A quick clarification and then just a forward-looking question. On the clarification, maybe it's too early and I missed something, but I think you guided to 10% core EPS growth coming into the year, back in September. And you just delivered a really solid Q4 that beat expectations, exceeded your own guidance, et cetera. And yet, you're saying you only delivered 9% core EPS growth on the year. So if you can help me bridge that, that would be great. And then on the go-forward, your 3% organic growth guidance this year, 8% core EPS growth guidance, it represents a wider spread that we've seen in guidance starting out the past few years, even with the lower implied buyback.","So that implies really solid margin flow-through. And I'd just like a little bit more color on where that confidence comes from, because the glass half full view is that you feel great about the momentum. I guess the glass half empty view is that today's outlook is a bit more of a stretch that maybe we've seen in the prior few years, so just some comments there would be great. Thanks.","Hugh F. Johnston - PepsiCo, Inc.","Yes, Steve, happy to. Regarding the first one, just to clarify on the numbers, when we talked about 10%, that 10% number was ex-Venezuela. We delivered, ex-Venezuela, 12%. The 9% reference that you heard us talking to earlier was inclusive of the Venezuela overlap. So when you exclude Venezuela, the 10% became 12%. Hopefully, that clarifies it. If not, you can speak to the IR team. But the simple answer is the 10% that we had projected actually became 12% at the end of the year.","Regarding your question around the slightly wider gap between revenue growth and EPS growth, I think the revenue growth, as both Indra and I referenced earlier, is reflective of the fact that we are certainly cautious about the macros and the volatility and we want to ensure, as we do, that we give guidance that we have a very high confidence level that we can hit and, ideally, if the world turns out to be a better place, we can beat.","Regarding EPS, we have a very clear line of sight in terms of our productivity plans for the year. And it's really the productivity plans, more SG&A focused, that will drive the operating margin improvement that will allow us to stay on the 8% EPS guidance.","Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.","And basically what we're saying is what is under our control, we intend to execute very well. And then, whatever happens in the macro environment, we'll try to manage through it as best we can.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog of Wells Fargo.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning.","Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.","Good morning, Bonnie.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi. I have a little bit of a follow-on question regarding the 53rd week windfall. I was curious to hear why the decision was made to shift some of the windfall away from your North America segments to international segments. And then, I was hoping you could give a bit more color on the rising cost environment and how you expect this to change as we move throughout the year. And finally, if you could touch on the flexibility you may have to offset cost inflation with further productivity savings, that would be helpful. Thank you.","Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.","Hugh, go ahead. This is all walking through the P&L and balance sheet. Go right ahead.","Hugh F. Johnston - PepsiCo, Inc.","Sure, happy to. Good morning, Bonnie. Regarding the 53rd week, we prioritize investment funding not based on where we have upsides, but where the best opportunities are for growth. So some of the reinvestment in the business fell into North America, but some of it fell into our international businesses because we continue to see great opportunities for growth there. Obviously, internationally, the dollar continues to be a bit of a challenge. But that said, we still see terrific long-term value creation opportunities across many of our international businesses, and we want to invest in those businesses. So we took the opportunity with the 53rd week to do so.","As regards our go-forward on SG&A, I think you'll continue to see us, as I mentioned earlier, really drive productivity out of both the selling system and out of Smart Spending in order to continue to see margin expansion, so nothing further to add on that, other than the fact that we do continue to see opportunities there for further cost reduction.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Laurent Grandet of Credit Suisse.","Laurent Grandet - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Good morning, Indra, and good morning, Hugh. I would like to come back on this productivity effort you are doing, especially around SG&A first, and then I've got a second quick question. So with Kraft Heinz moving away from DSD, what's your assessment of DSD for your operations, as consumer is moving more to e-commerce? And to AMENA, could you give us a bit more granularity in terms of forecasted U.S. beverage growth going forward, the split between non-carbonated beverages and carbonated beverages? Thank you.","Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.","On DSD, DSD is the strength of our company. Given the nature of our categories, which are high velocity, relatively low value density, DSD is critical because they're impulse, and how we merchandise the product really drives the growth of the category. So we are totally committed to DSD. And we continue to make investments in DSD to modify it as we go along to account for whatever disruption happens in the retail channels. So PepsiCo remains committed to DSD.","Regarding the beverage outlook in North America, we've always tracked liquid refreshment beverage growth as a whole. We've expected for the past decade or more that there will be shifts within the category from carbonated soft drinks to non-carbonated soft drinks, and we've managed the portfolio accordingly. So I think you should focus on LRB [Liquid Refreshment Beverage] as a whole. And our expectation is that the overall LRB category will grow slightly above population growth and around GDP growth. And that's really what our anticipation is for the LRB category growth going forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Schmitz of Deutsche Bank.","Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. Are you guys there?","Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.","Yes, good morning.","Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Oh, good. Sorry. Sorry, I didn't hear you. I just had a couple quick ones. The first is just on the guidance for operating and then free cash flow. It looks like it's down slightly for 2017. And it doesn't make a lot of sense when you have decent organic growth and what the currency impact is. You're going to do the $1 billion in productivity again. So can you just give us some color on that?","And then the second question is just some of the share trends we're seeing in the U.S. with Frito. So the category is slowing, but also there's some share softness, and the same thing with Gatorade. So as you look into next year, do think that stuff will firm up, or are we just missing something because so much is in untracked channels now that that data is less relevant than it used to be? Thanks.","Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.","In the case of share in North America, we track LRB share. We track savory share. We track salty share, macro snack share. We track it every which way. And as we've always said, we want to make sure we balance share growth and profitability very, very judiciously. Our goal is never to hit the pricing lever too much in order to gain share. We want to make sure that we keep the pricing architecture across our portfolio very, very consistent over the quarter and over the year. So I wouldn't worry about small perturbations in share in any one quarter, in any one category. This is something we monitor very, very carefully.","And I'd say both Frito-Lay North America and our North America Beverage business as a whole are doing well. Gatorade, in particular, is one of our crown jewels, and the business is performing very, very well. We have a leadership position in the isotonic category. And the business is performing exceedingly well in the category, which involves active thirst, which is really what we track. So, Hugh, let me turn it over to you to answer the first part of the question.","Hugh F. Johnston - PepsiCo, Inc.","Yeah, Bill, regarding free cash flow, you're right. The number is down slightly, driven by two things: number one, the impact of foreign exchange, as you had speculated; and number two, a slightly higher level of CapEx, although lower than our 5% long-term guidance on CapEx. So CapEx will be up a little bit but still inside of the guidance that we've given you in the past.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Ottenstein of Evercore.","Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.","Good morning, Robert.","Robert Ottenstein - Evercore Group LLC","Hi, thank you, two lines of questions. One, Hugh, just so I'm clear in terms of the free cash flow, are there any other items that you haven't called out yet of size that will impact the conversion in 2017?","Hugh F. Johnston - PepsiCo, Inc.","No, nothing at all.","Robert Ottenstein - Evercore Group LLC","Great.","Hugh F. Johnston - PepsiCo, Inc.","In fact, we continue to make tremendous progress on working capital, and our cash conversion cycle is actually negative at this point.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer of Cowen.","Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.","Good morning, Vivien.","Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC","In terms of Frito-Lay, very consistently improving profit growth on a multiyear basis, and it seems that the revenue management that you deployed in the second quarter of 2015 was a good catalyst for that. So I what hoping you can give us an update on future opportunities around revenue management for Frito-Lay? Thank you.","Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.","I think that's way too detailed a question, Vivien. I'd just say that over time, across the company, not just Frito-Lay, but across all of PepsiCo, we have actually dialed up our revenue management capabilities. We've built revenue management centers of excellence across North America. And we've improved our understanding of household down to a very granular level that allows us to tailor products and packaging for individual households and get the price utilization we need, because we can put the right assortment on the shelves based on the trading area of that particular store and the households that that store targets. I think that's what drives revenue management. And you're going to see that being deployed across North America. And hopefully, that'll result in better revenue realization as we go forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Caroline Levy of CLSA.","Caroline Levy - CLSA Americas LLC","Good morning. Thanks so much. I was interested in a little more detailed description of what happened with your Mountain Dew franchise. I know Mutant had a C-store rollout, pretty small. I don't know how successful that was, but what your plans are for Dew and then specifically Pepsi, Diet Pepsi, and if you could comment on the demonetization in India and whether that had any impact on your beverage or snack business. Thank you.","Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.","Caroline, good morning. Good to hear you. The Mountain Dew franchise is alive and energetic, pardon the pun. If you include regular Mountain Dew, Diet, all the variants in Kickstart, it's a thriving franchising and perhaps one of the best-performing franchises in the CSD universe. And we intend to continue to invest behind Mountain Dew. We intend to continue to invest behind Kickstart and the franchise is doing well.","Regarding Diet Pepsi, we had a bit of a hiccup with Diet Pepsi with the rollout of the aspartame-free product, but now with the relaunch of the zero-sugar Pepsi, putting it on the Super Bowl, we're back in business. It's a great tasting product. It is a great tasting product. In fact, I'd say it's the best tasting diet in the market. Try it. And I think our plan is to invest behind the zero-sugar Pepsi rollout and make sure that it is the diet for the Pepsi portfolio.","Caroline Levy - CLSA Americas LLC","Great.","Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.","And on demonetization, across the board for pretty much all of industry and CPG in particular, because it hit the individual retailers significantly, demonetization had a significant impact on our India business in Q4. And there's still some lingering effects. I'm not sure we are totally out of the woods. It's a big country, a massive change because it's currency that was about 80% of the circulation out in the country that was taken out of circulation, and the implementation had its share of challenges. So our hope was that by the time Q2 rolls by, we would be through the bulk of the demonetization challenges. And the new currency and the digital currency will be back in circulation and we'll be back to retail activity coming back to normal.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Swartzberg of Stifel, Nicolaus.","Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah, thanks.

We look at the data. We read, but you guys are there operating. So I'm just wondering if you're seeing a deterioration in Mexico and an improvement perhaps in the UK in the way people are behaving vis-\u00e0-vis your products?","Indra K.

We'll lead off today's call with a review of our second quarter performance and our balance-of-year outlook, and then we'll move on to Q&A.","Before we begin, please take note of our cautionary statement.

Forward-looking statements inherently involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those predicted in such forward-looking statements.

Nooyi","Thanks, Jamie, and good morning, everyone. Our second quarter results came in right in line with our expectations. The major economies we do business in, consumer behavior, the competitive landscape and commodities were all in line with our assumptions and expectations. Net revenue in the quarter grew 5% on an organic basis, supported by organic net revenue growth in each of our 4 business units. This is a solid result, reflecting balanced revenue management, which led to a healthy price mix benefit.","Our organic net revenue growth was 5% year-to-date, and we're on track to deliver organic revenue growth of mid-single-digits for full year 2012. Our organic net revenue growth was ahead of our reported revenue growth, owing to structural changes and to the negative impact of translating our international revenues with the strengthened dollar in Q2. The structural changes included refranchising our bottling operations in Mexico in the fourth quarter of last year and, in China, with the transaction with Tingyi at the beginning of Q2.","As a consequence of entering into new franchise agreements with our highly capable partners, we no longer report bottling revenues in these markets. From a strategic standpoint, these transactions strengthen our operations and are expected to improve our operating margins and key efficiency metrics, including revenue and EBIT per employee, improve our returns on capital and reduce the capital intensity of PepsiCo's operations in these markets.","Importantly, in addition to very solid organic top line growth in the quarter, we continue to gain traction on the brand building, innovation, and execution of productivity initiatives that are key elements of our 2012 plan. Before I discuss progress on these initiatives though, let me quickly review the financial highlights for Q2.","Our financial results are right in line with our expectation. Core EPS was $1.12. As I just mentioned, organic net revenue grew 5% and it reflected strong price mix across all of our businesses. Globally, price mix was up 4%, and this pricing helped to offset the impact of about $350 million of commodity cost inflation. We had growth in both global snack revenue and global beverage revenue on an organic basis. In emerging and developing markets, revenue growth was particularly strong, up 9% on an organic basis, led by strong double-digit organic revenue growth in key emerging markets.","Results are generally strong across our 4 business units, and each business unit posted organic revenue growth and achieved solid productivity gains to help offset inflation. Within PepsiCo Americas Foods, Frito-Lay North America executed very deliberate channel and revenue management strategies that drove very good net price realization revenue growth, especially in the C-store and foodservice channels, and positive unit growth overall, while they delivered volume performance that was even with prior year. We could have employed different volume-oriented tactics, particularly in large format channels, but they would have been detrimental to our overall channel mix and net pricing objectives, and we are comfortable with the channel, pricing, unit and volume balance we achieved.","PepsiCo Americas Beverages had another solid quarter of solid net price realization. We remain highly disciplined in the execution of our price\/pack and channel strategies, and as a result, we are seeing very good performance in the immediate consumption packages, which led to strong net revenue growth in the C-store channel, and we are seeing good, stable and value share performance relative to our primary competitor in measured channels.","Europe was a terrific story with strong performance, with organic net revenue up 3% and constant currency operating profit up 15%. Zein will comment on Europe in more detail in a few minutes.","In AMEA, we had 10% organic net revenue growth and terrific operating profit performance, reflecting the strength of the top line growth and our productivity programs. Overall, our Q2 results encourage us that we're making good progress, and we're on track to deliver our full year financial targets.","Let me now turn to the progress we are making on our key initiatives for the year. We remain focused on 5 big areas: brand building, innovation, execution, productivity and driving cash returns. Let me talk to each of them.","On brand building. We're on target to increase our investment in advertising and marketing to 5.7% of revenue this year, which is an increase of 50 basis points over our investment level last year. We've made good progress on increasing our consumer-facing A&M investment, focused on 12 global mega brands, to drive greater scale and impact with our spending. Much of this is enabled by having much greater coordination among our operations globally, allowing us to leverage creative and production activities across multiple geographies, which gives us cost leverage and drives greater consistency in our brand messaging.","And we've significantly stepped up our media in key markets. For example, in the United States alone, our media spending was up over 40% in the second quarter and over 30% year-to-date. And we're beginning to gain traction with these efforts. Brand equity scores for our major brands in our key markets are showing improvement in many cases and are stabilizing in the remainder. We will sustain our efforts in this area, and we are confident we will see higher brand equity scores translate into strong top line growth with healthy price premiums.","Our second focus area is innovation, where our goal is to consistently increase the contribution of new  products to our total net revenue. Our innovation is targeted on specific channels, cohorts and occasion opportunities and with the balance focused on Fun-for-You, Better-for-You and Good-for-You products.","For example, at Frito-Lay North America, innovation drove incremental sales all across the portfolio. Doritos had double-digit sales growth in the quarter behind innovations such as Doritos JACKED and Doritos Locos Tacos, which continues to drive strong growth at Taco Bell. Ruffles delivered mid-single-digit sales growth, supported by incremental sales from Ruffles Ultimate, which continues to gain distribution during ramp up, with strong retail activations surrounding the launch.","In our Frito-Lay growth ventures business, which is focused on incubating new premium and value products, revenue grew 13% in the quarter, led by double-digit gains in Stacy's and our Smartfood platform.","In North American beverages, Pepsi Next is off to a strong start, and we have just launched 2 new limited-time-only flavors, Pepsi Next Cherry Vanilla and Pepsi Next Paradise Mango, to satisfy the thirst of cola lovers looking for unique fruit flavor blends, both with 60% less sugar than regular colas.","We're also driving growth across the Gatorade portfolio, with additions to the G Series line and introduction of differentiated packaging. One of our most recent introductions is the Prime Chew. The Chews come in 3 flavors and contain 25 grams of carbohydrates, as well as B vitamins, to help your body break down carbs into fuel and helps you maintain your performance throughout your activity.","And at Quaker, we are driving organic sales growth and share gains with innovation like Quaker Real Medleys and Quaker Yogurt Bars. Interestingly, on both Quaker Real Medleys and the Gatorade Chews, we are selling all we have the capacity to make. Year-to-date, our innovation is off to a good start, and it provides a good base to build on.","Let me turn to execution. We are measuring and driving execution across every element of the value chain to increase efficiency, quality and service to best-in-class levels, and we are seeing good results across our functions and businesses. One example is how we've executed our price\/pack and channel mix strategies this year, driving strong revenue realization and positive mix. This is evident in North America where our C-store growth remains very strong, with retail sales gaining 8% in both snacks and beverages in the second quarter, making us the #1 contributor to growth in the channel. In fact, PepsiCo was the largest contributor to food and nonalcoholic beverage growth across all measured channels in the United States in the second quarter.","And our businesses are executing well together. We launched our Rock Your Summer campaign, where consumers are encouraged to match, snap and win. Match any Frito-Lay product with any Pepsi beverage product and then snap and submit a picture of the 2 products for a chance to win a variety of prizes. We featured the campaign in 46 of our top 50 retail accounts and increased our Power of One displays on the grocery channel by 13% compared to last summer. Joint promotion merchandising is a key element of our Power of One programming, and it's driving coincidence of purchase of PepsiCo beverages and PepsiCo snacks at a rate well above our fair share.","And our execution focus is especially evident in many of our emerging and developing markets. For example, we had strong double-digit organic revenue growth in beverages in India and Brazil and snacks in Mexico and India, and we are especially pleased with the progress we've made in Eastern Europe.","I'd like to ask Zein to give us a quick update on this business, which had very good results this quarter. Zein?","Zein Abdalla","Thank you, Indra, and good morning, everyone. Despite the well-known challenges in Europe, we continue to build momentum in our business, beginning with a very solid performance in Q1 followed by strong results in Q2. We grew our organic net revenue by 3% and delivered 15% growth in our core constant currency net operating profits. We've done this through a disciplined approach to pricing and mix management, together with terrific execution against an aggressive productivity agenda. A particular highlight this quarter has been our acceleration in Eastern Europe, where our successful integration of Wimm-Bill-Dann and our Power of One initiatives drove outstanding results in Russia.","Our success has really been enabled by the transformation we've made to our business over the last few years, with a strong focus on expanding in the faster-growing Eastern European markets, encompassing a broader set of categories to cater for more consumer needs and day part, a portfolio that is wonderfully balanced across Fun-for-You, Better-for-You and Good-for-You, which is the best way to compete in this region. In 2008, less than 25% of Europe's revenue mix came from the east. And by last year, that figure had increased to well over 50%. And this portfolio transformation is helping us weather the macroeconomic headwinds facing other parts of Europe.","PepsiCo Europe's increasingly diverse category portfolio -- about 40% of net revenue comes from snack, with the remainder well balanced across noncarbonated beverages, DSDs and dairy -- has positioned us to respond to changing consumer preferences and to strengthen our mix.","Central to these changes has been PepsiCo's journey in Russia, one we embarked upon some 50 years ago. Through our recent investments, we've built the largest food and beverage business in Russia, a powerhouse business primed for growth and positioned to capitalize on the market with lots of growth potential. PepsiCo Russia net revenues now represent some 40% of our total sector's revenue, and Russia is growing profit at the fastest rate in Europe.","We have leading positions in multiple categories: savory snacks, juice, tea, water, energy and dairy, with a portfolio of strong global and local brands. In fact, we now have 10 of the top 25 nonalcoholic food and beverage brands in Russia, each with retail sales of more than $250 million.","By building on this strong base, PepsiCo Russia provides a gateway to more than 400 million consumers. It's our base for expanding successfully across Eastern and Central Europe, and we started to see the benefits of this in the quarter with accelerated growth in Ukraine and other CIS markets.","The integration of Wimm-Bill-Dann is progressing very well. Adding this to the Power of One business infrastructure we had already put into place across our Russian businesses, we've been able to drive significant synergies and productivity. We have a fully integrated and low-cost supply chain and back office, delivering substantial cost synergies.","We have tremendous go-to-market advantage with unparalleled reach across the organized and traditional trade channels. We've created a single-sales structure to our top 8 national accounts, enabling us to capitalize on the benefits of scale to enhance customer engagement. We've integrated our foodservice teams in Moscow and St. Petersburg, now delivering dairy, juice, beverages and snacks to on-premise and social channels.","The top line synergies have come in, in the form of convergence and brand building and go-to-market, which is the recent launch of Oats products under Chudo branding and with single-serve kefir, or drinkable yogurt, being distributed through the PepsiCo system. All this is helping us to deliver strong revenue realization through selective pricing, portfolio management and strong, speedy innovation.","We have very strong share positions across our strategic categories in Russia. Highlights include very favorable savory snack share, with 1.9 percentage point value share gains year-to-date, and strong CSD share, with 0.8 percentage point value share gains year-to-date. In short, we are pleased with our results in Europe overall, enabled by a well-architected geographic and product portfolio, with Russia and the balance of Eastern Europe well positioned to be a substantial growth engine, not only for -- in the European sector but for all of PepsiCo.","Indra K. Nooyi","Thank you, Zein, and that's a great report out on East Europe and Russia.","Let me now turn to productivity. We're targeting more than $1 billion in productivity this year and $3 billion in total over the next 3 years, which includes the restructuring program we announced earlier this year and our other productivity initiatives that are incremental to our ongoing productivity agenda. Our productivity programs for 2012 are locked in, and we are very confident to deliver these targeted savings.","We made substantial progress against our productivity plans in the first half of the year. The financial benefits of the restructuring accelerated in Q2 and will continue to benefit financial performance as we move through the second half of the year.","In addition to the restructuring programs, we've also accelerated other productivity initiatives. We're driving hard against reducing the capital intensity of our business and improving working capital efficiency, and we are already seeing good results.","Finally, we are doing a better job leveraging global capability and know-how. By sharing best practices and implementing best-in-class processes, we are improving operating performance. So we are encouraged by the pace and progress of our productivity plan.","And finally, we are taking steps to drive higher returns on our invested capital and enhance cash return to shareholders. We have reduced our net capital spending year-to-date by $338 million and reduced our net CapEx as a percentage of sales over the last 4 quarters by more than 100 basis points. We are achieving this, both by driving higher utilization of our assets and by reducing the cost of replacement and growth capacity through value engineering and through enhanced global procurement management.","And we remain committed to returning cash to our shareholders. In the first half, we returned $2.8 billion in cash to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, and we expect to return more than $6 billion for the full year, an increase of approximately 12%.  Our dividend increased again this June, making 2012 our 40th consecutive year of dividend per share increase. Based on yesterday's closing stock price, our current dividend represents a 3.1% annual dividend yield.","To recap, we are focused on brand building, innovation, execution, productivity and cash return. We are making good progress. We expect momentum to continue to build as the year progresses, and we are confident in achieving our 2012 goals in these areas.","Let me now turn the call over to Hugh Johnston. Hugh?","Hugh F. Johnston","Thanks, Indra, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start by reviewing the scorecard we introduced at our investor meeting in February. At that time, we shared that we'd review with you on a semiannual basis our performance in 8 key areas, and I'm pleased to share our initial results with you today and look forward to providing another update following Q4.","Let me review the results briefly. We're focused on 4 key input metrics: brand strength, innovation, execution and cost and capital spending; and then 4 key output metrics: value share, EPS, net return on invested capital and operating cash flow. We're making good progress on each of these, and our results were right in line with where we expected to be at this point in the year.","On brand strength, our objectives are to step up the level of investment in A&M and to improve the brand equity for our major brands in our key markets. At the end of Q2, our brand equity scores are stable or improving in 85% of our key brands in strategic markets with sequential improvement from Q1 to Q2, and we're on track to achieve our targeted A&M investment level of 5.7% of sales for the full year.","On innovation, our goal is to increase the contribution of innovation to our overall net sales. Year-to-date, our innovation is currently at 7% of net revenue and is on track with where we want to be. And our expectation is for this number to trend up as we launch products currently in the pipeline.","Turning to execution. As a proxy for overall execution, we're providing share of inventory on display and coincidence of PepsiCo snack and beverage purchases in the United States. Share of inventory on display increased in the second quarter for both snacks and carbonated soft drinks, and we continue to achieve above our fair share of co-purchases of salty snacks and CSDs, which improved from 2011 to 2012.","From a market share perspective, we're gaining or holding LRB value share versus our primary competitor in a majority of our strategic markets. While our value share trends in savory are a bit more mixed, we've shown sequential improvement from Q1 to Q2, and we expect this to continue to improve. This is not an area where we expect to see results overnight because it's partly an outcome of our brand-building efforts, which are just beginning to gain traction. We stay -- we're staying focus on this and expect to continue to see sequential improvement.","And we feel good about our performance against our financial metrics. Cost and CapEx performance are both positive, with CapEx trending at 4.4% of net revenue over the last 4 quarters, and we're projecting to meet our targeted operating cost reduction of 75 basis points of net revenue. And with respect to EPS, ROIC and operating cash flow, as Indra mentioned earlier, we're on track to deliver our EPS and cash flow targets for 2012, and our capital investment in 2012 is in line with our target to begin to see ROIC improvement of 50 basis points per year beginning in 2013. So overall, we're pleased with the progress we're making on our scorecard, and we'll provide another update on our Q4 call.","I'll wrap up now with a quick discussion of the numbers in our outlook, and then we'll turn to Q&A. As Indra mentioned, the quarter came in, in line with what we expected. Organic net revenue increased 5% while our reported net revenue declined, reflecting the structural changes, including Mexico and China, which reduced the reported number by approximately 4 points and by negative currency translation, which was a 3-point drag on the reported net revenue. We realized 4 percentage points of effective net pricing with increases across each of our divisions.","Core gross margins were down 64 basis points, driven by higher commodity costs in the quarter, which is a sequential improvement from the first quarter. And core division operating margins were down by 22 basis points with productivity and SG&A helping to offset a substantial portion of the commodity inflation. All-in, this resulted in a 1% decline in core division operating profit on a constant-currency basis and a 3% decline in core division operating profit on a U.S. dollar basis, reflecting a nearly 3-point drag from currency, in line with our expectations.","Core corporate unallocated expenses increased in the quarter, reflecting higher pension-related costs. Net interest expense was $208 million in the quarter, an increase of approximately $30 million over Q2 of 2011, which is a function of both lower net interest income and higher average debt balances.","And our core tax rate for the quarter was 27.8%, which is 180 basis points higher than the rate in Q2 of 2011, driven by country mix and the favorable resolution of some tax items in Q2 of last year. And finally, our fully diluted share count was down 1.5% in the quarter compared to the prior-year period, reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program.","So in total, below-the-line items, mainly pension-related expenses we record at the corporate level, interest and tax rate, offset somewhat by the benefit of the reduced share count, drove about 3 points of deleverage from our core constant currency division operating profit decline of 1% to our core constant currency EPS decline of 4%.","Now turning to our outlook. We anticipate continued strong net effective pricing, which will contribute to net revenue growth but expect continued impact from negative currency translation and from the deconsolidation of revenue related to structural changes. We expect continued commodity cost pressures. Our current outlook on commodities is consistent with our previous outlook at about $1.5 billion for the full year.","As Indra mentioned, we're on track to deliver productivity of more than $1 billion this year, which represents a substantial increase versus our historical productivity target. The incremental productivity is largely driven by the restructuring program we announced earlier this year. A majority of the restructuring actions have already taken place, and we expect the remainder will take place over the course of this year. So the productivity benefits should accelerate as we move through the year.","We're investing more in A&M this year to support our brands, and we're making incremental marketplace investments in routes and racks. We expect A&M as a percent of sales to increase by approximately 50 basis points on a full year basis. We began to put more media in the market in the first half, but the increase in A&M expense as a percent of net revenue in the P&L will actually be more pronounced in the back half based on how the accounting curve of the expense works. In fact, we expect A&M as a percent of sales will increase by approximately 100 basis points year-on-year in the second half, so you should model this increase into your operating margin and operating profit growth assumptions with the impact heavier in Q3 than in Q4.","Below the division operating profit line, we expect an increase in corporate unallocated expenses, reflecting higher pension cost related to the change in the discount rate and investments in productivity capability, with Q3 corporate unallocated expected to be a bit higher than what we saw in Q2 based on the timing of expenses.","Full year net interest expense is expected to be higher, driven by higher debt balances and higher rates as we term out some of our debt during the year. And we expect our core tax rate to be approximately 27% for the full year but with some level of variability between the quarters. Based on current ForEx market consensus, currency translation would have approximately 3 points unfavorable impact on our full year core EPS, with a Q3 impact on both net revenue and operating profit estimated at approximately 5 points.","As you model out the second half, you should be mindful of 3 structural changes we've mentioned, where we will no longer record the revenue. First, we re-franchised our Mexican beverage business in early Q4 of 2011. We adjusted our ownership in our joint venture in Almarai, such that we are now in the minority. And finally, we entered our alliance with Tingyi, which closed on March 31. We estimate the impact of these changes will be an approximately 5-point drag on our reported net revenue in Q3 and approximately 3 points in Q4. The impact abates somewhat in Q4 as we lack the Mexico re-franchising that occurred in Q4 2011.","From a cash flow standpoint, year-to-date reported cash generated by operating activities was $1.2 billion, which includes a $1 billion discretionary pension and retiree medical contribution we made in Q1. Reflecting our capital spending productivity initiatives, net CapEx is down $338 million year-to-date and down more than 100 basis points as a percentage of revenue on a rolling 4 quarters basis. In addition, our working capital also improved year-to-date with net working capital on receivables, inventory, prepaids and payables improving by more than $300 million year-on-year.","Our management operating cash flow, excluding certain items, improved by $28 million to $1.4 billion year-to-date. We returned $2.8 billion to shareholders year-to-date through dividends of $1.6 billion and share repurchases of $1.2 billion. For the full year, we expect to generate more than $6 billion in management operating cash flow, excluding certain items, and return more than $6 billion in dividends and share repurchases, including our previously announced increase in our quarterly dividend that took effect with the June dividend payment.","Finally, from an earnings perspective, consistent with our previous outlook, we expect our core constant currency EPS to decline 5% for the year. Now I realize that the first cap came in a bit ahead of the consensus estimate, but you should not flow that through to the bottom line as you model the full year. As I mentioned, A&M expense, based on how it was curved in last year and in this year, will result in a substantial reported increase in the back half. In addition, if we have upside in areas like commodities, our intention is to reinvest those in the business to support and accelerate our brand building, innovation and productivity initiatives.","Net, the quarter came in as we expected. The pricing picture was positive, and our outlook for the year for earnings, cash flow and cash returns is exactly and completely consistent with what we previously shared with you.","And now we'll open the lines for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from John Faucher with JPMorgan.","John A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","You talked about the convenience store business doing better generally, which would imply, I guess, that the large format store business is probably struggling a little bit. So can you talk a little bit about some of the challenges there? Is it just fundamentally a consumer spending issue, or -- what color can you give us on the large format store business?","Indra K. Nooyi","John, I'm going to toss this over to Brian Cornell, and then maybe Al Carey. So Brian, do you want to take it from here?","Brian C. Cornell","Yes. And John, I think as you've seen, there has been considerable weakness in the core grocery channel, but that's being offset by growth in other channels: foodservice, C-store and, certainly, club. So as we look at our business, we're managing through those channel mixes and making sure we're making profitable investments to grow our business and sustain the volume in those channels.","Indra K. Nooyi","Al, did you want to add anything?","Albert P. Carey","I'll just add one thing. It was mentioned earlier that the discounting for holidays, that's a disproportionate amount of the business, and we need to spread the value throughout the month rather than just during those holiday peak periods. And I think we're doing some work on that right now that I have optimism for in the future.","Hugh F. Johnston","John, this is Hugh. The only thing I'd add to that is, one of the things that's important to us in large format is that we have consistency in our pricing across the channels, and that's been a real point of emphasis for us. So to the degree that, that has something of an impact on volumes, particularly in areas like bottled water where we're not electing to go chase that type of volume, we don't view that as detrimental to the performance of the business nor do we do it as value creating by chasing those things. So from our standpoint, we're trying to maintain consistent levels of pricing discipline across large format channels.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I was hoping for more color on trends in the gas-convenience channel, post quarter end, over the last month or so here in the U.S. Have you seen any type of slowdown, or is the momentum continuing there? And what are your thoughts around the sustainability of some of the year-to-date strength, just given we saw weather boost first half results?","Brian C. Cornell","This is Brian Cornell. We're seeing very consistent performance trends in both the convenience and gas channels. Their traffic trends remain strong. They're seeing broad growth across regions, but very, very consistent traffic and revenue gains. So it's a channel that's performing very consistently across the country with strong traffic and revenue gain.","Indra K. Nooyi","And we have not seen a slowdown. Not seeing that at all.","Brian C. Cornell","We've not seen any signs of slowdown in the C&G channel.","Albert P. Carey","I'd add to that, and say that sometime ago, the convenience business was losing a fair amount of their volume for cigarettes, and they have done a pretty good job of offering food service that I think has picked up their business. So our trends are very solid in the convenience business.","Indra K. Nooyi","Go ahead, John.","John C. Compton","Dara, the other thing that the teams are doing is their more coordinated effort across Power of One snacks and beverages. And I think particularly in the convenience and gas channel, that's a benefit to PepsiCo.","Indra K. Nooyi","And, what is it? We have 11 of the 15 top-selling SKUs in C-stores?","John C. Compton","Yes, 11 of the 15 top-selling SKUs. And as Hugh and Indra both mentioned in their comments, I mean, we're far and away the largest contributor of growth to the C-store channel.","Albert P. Carey","Our Mountain Dew and Gatorade business is very strong in the small format.","Indra K. Nooyi","And I think we have innovation and good execution of the DSD system. We were able to drive growth in this channel. Traffic still seems to be okay, Dara.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then, Al, at the Deutsche Bank conference, you seemed to be more focused on using mix to drive CSD pricing longer term than we've heard from Pepsi in the past. So is that an increased area of focus, and can you discuss how much tangible incremental benefit we could expect from that focus over the next few years? And then also, you mentioned managing the highs and lows from a pricing standpoint in terms of everyday versus holiday pricing more over time and mentioned it again here today. It sounds great in theory, but it's often hard to execute day-to-day. So in your mind, is that also a significant opportunity or something which takes a long time to play out?","Albert P. Carey","Well, I think 2 areas that will help us improve in the future, and this is balancing out the value across the month in the large format. And we're working on that, but it's tricky. It'll take us a little bit of time to get there. And the second thing is to offer flexible package opportunities in that channel as well, which we're putting capacity and capability in our system right now, so that in 2013, you'll see us offer more flex packaging, different packages that will be variety packs and those kinds of things in the marketplace.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane of Bank of America.","Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just 2 questions related to the Europe and AMEA segments and profitability, specifically. First, in AMEA, just what effect did the implementation of the Tingyi relationship have on the profitability in the quarter? I guess what I'm trying to drive at is, was there a profit lift that we realized in the quarter because of the structural change? And then second, in Europe. Just in Russia -- the margin expansion there or the profit growth there, how much of that is a function of your pricing and maybe some improvement in the consumer, and how much of it is still structural benefits? So integration benefits from Wimm-Bill-Dann. And I'm just trying to understand how much more runway we have in terms of margin growth there.","Hugh F. Johnston","Bryan, it's Hugh. Regarding Tingyi, we haven't disclosed specifics on the bottom line on that. It sufficed to say, in the context of the overall AMEA business, that we clearly got a bit of a benefit but it was not, by any stretch of the imagination, the big driver. The big driver was the organic performance of the business. Russia.","Zein Abdalla","Bryan, on Russia, I'd say the performance is just very balanced across top line initiatives and management of the cost [indiscernible] to productivity initiatives. Clearly, as we put these businesses together, we have tremendous scale benefits as we drive supply chain consolidation, and that, obviously, is helping -- they're helping margin expansions. But equally, we're able to drive now a much more positive mix as we drive our brands into the convenience channel, and also, we build out innovation that is highly accretive, highly accretive to the margin mix. So it's a very good balance across both.","Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Has the nature of the competition in Russia changed at all? You've got so many more multinationals now operating in that market. Has that affected the competitive landscape at all?","Zein Abdalla","Clearly. I mean, Russia is an attractive market across all -- for all of the multinationals. But we enjoy considerable scale and considerable operating history in Russia. What it's allowed us to do is to build a talented management team and a capability across many years. So I mean, our sources of competitive advantage are both scale and the -- of the development of the capability of our business over time.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kaumil Gajrawala with UBS.","Kaumil S. Gajrawala - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I know you maintained your guidance on COGS inflation and such. But I just want to ask, given the drought situation, if there's something we need to be thinking about -- perhaps about next year or maybe even perhaps from a supply chain standpoint, maybe there's not enough supply.","Hugh F. Johnston","Kaumil, this is Hugh. I'll handle that -- this one. From the perspective of 2012, because of the forward buying or the hedging program that we have in place, really, nothing to discuss in that regard. Obviously, and I talked about this in the past, we're out about 9 months. So we were also starting to buy into 2013, given that it's already -- it was already June before the drought situation really started to hit and before prices started to pop in the last couple of weeks. The thing I would tell you in that regard is while grains are certainly up, remember that there is no individual commodity that accounts for even 10% of PepsiCo's overall commodity buy. So grains are up. Aluminum's obviously moved in the other direction. Oil and all of the things that flow out of energy move in the other direction. So really nothing to report in terms of 2013 at this point, because we're not going to get into that until we get into pricing and get into more of the details of 2013. I do, though, just want to remind you that our basket of commodities is pretty broad. So I know corn's certainly been in the news, but we buy an awful lot of other commodities as well. And the commodities numbers are moving both up and down depending on the individual commodity.","Kaumil S. Gajrawala - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay, got it. And then if I can -- if I can ask you, maybe this is a softer answer, is operationally, obviously, earnings were a little bit ahead of expectations. You'll be spending that back behind the business. Is that in incremental spend? Are you stepping up -- are you further stepping up how much you're going to be spending on marketing versus what your initial plan was, or is this part of the original plan?","Indra K. Nooyi","Go ahead.","Hugh F. Johnston","Yes. Right now, Kaumil, we're still basically saying we're going to spend 5.7%, which was the number that we originally put out for the year. But we'll obviously continue as the year evolves to look at opportunities. And as the overall margin mix of the business comes in to the degree that we do have upsides, we will look to invest it behind -- behind brand-building activities. So -- but no, the 5.7% is still the number that we're talking to right now. The one thing to keep in mind in that regard, though, is there is marketing that we spend in the A&M line, which shows up through SG&A. There's also marketing in joint ventures that gets reported just in the consolidated joint venture line. And then there is marketing that is -- it comes in the form of bottler support, but it's bottler support that is clearly A&M that occurs between gross and net revenue. Where we talked about 5.2% to 5.7%, we were talking specifically about the SG&A, and that's the number that we're still saying is going to be consistent. But to the degree that we choose to do some more marketing through bottlers, you could see some of those numbers change as well. We'll talk about that in Q4 as to where all of the numbers came out, but the one thing I want to emphasize is there's no change in the 5.7% number. That's the number that we are managing to, and that's the number we'll look to hit. And as the business presents more opportunities, we'll evaluate what types of brand-building investment opportunities are before us at that time.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I just wanted to drill into Frito-Lay a little bit. So from a share perspective, I know you talked about, sequentially, maybe getting a little bit better, and it looks like the C-stores and non-measured channels are doing a little bit better. But just sort of taking a step back, if you can just tell us kind of what you're seeing from a competitive perspective and just what's holding back from Frito's -- from getting better more quickly? And then on the profit side in the quarter, I'm just wondering how much of the margin decline was commodities. They're still -- they're not being fully offset by pricing. And then how much of that was marketing spending step-up?","Indra K. Nooyi","Go ahead, Brian.","Brian C. Cornell","Yes. As Indra mentioned, we took a very disciplined approach to managing revenue and our channel mix during the quarter. We're really focused on investing in brand building, in innovation and continuing to deliver the productivity initiatives at Frito. I expect that's going to serve us well as we go into Q3 and Q4, and you're starting to see evidence of that in our P4 share result, particularly during the important 4th of July period where we grow -- we grew share at Frito. So I think we're well positioned right now to continue to see performance improvement in Q3 and Q4. We're going to continue to focus on being very disciplined in our revenue management and channel management mix and continue to invest in our brands and innovation to make sure that we can continue to deliver sustainable growth at Frito.","Indra K. Nooyi","Yes. Judy, if you recall, I think it was at CAGNY when John Compton presented, he talked about the Frito-Lay business growing at the 2 ends, the value and the premium side, and we had a very, very, very strong position in the middle. The middle continues to grow. We were looking for the right model to compete against the value segment of the business and the premium segment. The premium segment, we started to compete with our growth ventures business, and that's doing very well. Again, also for small base. But it's doing well, and that growth will continue. Our challenge is to figure out the right model to play against the value players without impacting the middle, and we wanted to make sure we did it the right way and not take down the pricing level of the middle. And that's why when Brian talked about playing the channels and the portfolio very carefully, we want to make sure that we keep the pricing in place and don't take it down, because getting pricing back in the market is much harder than tweaking the product portfolio to go against specific consumer needs. So as the year goes on, you see improvement in Frito-Lay because we are fine-tuning the model and doing better as the quarters go on.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then, Hugh, when you put up the slide with the brand strength, the equity scorecard?","Hugh F. Johnston","Yes.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Basically, that 85% of your core brands are showing improvement, up from 81%. Can you give us a little bit more color just in terms of what brands you're actually seeing maybe a better improvement versus what are the 15% that's not showing improvement?","Hugh F. Johnston","Yes. I mean, to talk to the ones that are doing better, Lay's was notably strong in the quarter. We really saw terrific results on Lay's, and Gatorade, we also saw terrific results on. The Lemon-Lime, still a little bit more work to do.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That's the brand equity scores or the share scores?","Hugh F. Johnston","Those are the equity scores.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Caroline Levy with CLSA.","Caroline S. Levy - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","I just wanted to follow up on Judy's question. If you could talk about brand Pepsi, which is the centerpiece of everything you're doing, just in terms of what we can look for, what you've seen so far. I know it's very, very early, but it's such a huge brand that -- within the total company. And I'd like to also understand what we can look for as progress measures in the Tingyi JV going forward now.","Indra K. Nooyi","Al, you want to talk about brand Pepsi?","Albert P. Carey","Yes. Brand Pepsi, the campaign began in about April, and it's very early to try to indicate whether or not we've seen a result. But the thing that I like to look at is our single-serve business, which will be a first indicator, and that's usually not impacted by these holiday discounting overlaps. So we see growth in brand Pepsi on single serve for the first time in a very long time, and our brand equity scores have improved for the second quarter. So some improvement. We have Pepsi Next in the marketplace that is delivering about what we expected, very happy with it. And in the just recent few weeks, we've just launched the -- a new TV campaign and also 2 new flavors of the product. So let's say, cautiously optimistic on that brand.","Indra K. Nooyi","And on China, Saad, you want to give some color on Tingyi?","Saad Abdul-Latif","Yes. Caroline, we really feel good about the progress of our transitioning our business in China to Tingyi. As you know, we've got the approval in the end of March, and we've spent the months of April and May and big part of June transitioning our business into our partner. We've moved upwards of 20 plants and about 20,000 employees into that. Now I think the transition is complete, that we're going to see sequential improvement into our volumes. And basically, there are 3 areas where we will see huge improvement as we go Q3, Q4 and for next year. One, a new area is white areas we will have accessible to us that we would not have before. Two, we will have production availability for water and other products, such as the Gatorade and that. And thirdly, we will benefit a huge deal from the distribution strength of Tingyi. So we really feel good about that alliance, and we're going to start bearing the fruit Q3 and going forward.","Caroline S. Levy - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","That's very helpful. Can I also just clarify? I think you said you did raise your efficiency target for the total company. Can you just remind us how much you've increased that now?","Hugh F. Johnston","This is Hugh. No -- I'm sorry, we didn't raise the efficiency target. So we said $1 billion -- $1 billion plus this year, $3 billion over 3 years. And that's exactly where we are. No change on that at all.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I have a long question. So I'm sort of confused on some of the numbers. So I think you said U.S. media spend was up 40%, and then you looked at sort of the year-over-year SG&A and that was down. And then I think you said 100 basis points increase in that ad ratio on the back half of the year, which sort of implies that there was sort of flat advertising ratio on the front half. And then let's kind of take it a step forward. I was looking at the Pepsi Americas Beverages margins and given that shift away from the center store and towards the C-stores, you would have thought you would've seen a little bigger uptick in the margin structure. Can you sort of square this for me? I know it's a long question.","Hugh F. Johnston","Yes. Bill, why don't I take a shot at that, because that's a big causal chain you just laid out. The thing that -- first and foremost, the thing to keep in mind is, the way we talk about media is that's publicly reported media data. Okay? And that's based on the actual spending that's going into the marketplace. At the same time, when we talk about advertising and marketing expense, which is obviously inside of SG&A, that's curved over the volume curve during the course of the year. And you have to consider those numbers from 2 perspectives: number one, what's happening this year with the curve; and then number two, what's happened last year with the curve. And the way our spending -- or the way our curve worked last year was, you saw the A&M number fall off during the latter portion of the year. So we had, from an expense standpoint, more of the spending in the first half of the year, relatively speaking, compared to the 2012 timing of the spend. So it's almost impossible to connect the media number to the A&M expense in the P&L. I wouldn't spend a whole lot of time doing that. And what I wanted to do when I gave you the A&M expense timing comments was not so much to tie to the media spend, but rather to connect the fact that the year-over-year impact in H1 versus the year-over-year of impact in H2, it's much more substantial in H2. So hopefully, that kind of addresses your A&M question. Regarding the bottling or the beverage -- PAB business and the impact on margins, there's 2 things to keep in mind there that are also important to balance out. On the one hand, the convenience store business performance was strong. On the other hand, the inflation that we have inside of PepsiCo, particularly in beverages, is much more front loaded than it is back loaded. So those 2 are probably having something of an offsetting effect, and therefore, in the back half of the year, you should see the margin impacts start to improve really in the PAB business in the back half of the year, due to the commodities overlap timing muting, while we certainly expect the C-store business to continue to perform well.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Great, thanks. And then just to quickly follow up, did you see a benefit from the PET deflation? Because I think that's one of the few commodities you can't hedge out 9 months, and I think a lot of your competitors have talked about some relief there.","Hugh F. Johnston","Yes. Bill, we actually can hedge out PET pretty well because of the nature of the relationships that our global procurement team has created. You're right in saying there's no market to do that. But through suppliers, we've been pretty successful in moving our PET buy further and further out over the last couple of years. So in terms of your question on any benefit, the answer is basically no. From our perspective, the commodities for this year have been largely hedged out for a couple of months now. So not a whole lot of change is going be coming in the balance of the year on that.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Ali Dibadj with Sanford Bernstein.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I want to follow up on a couple of things and ask a slightly different question. Just to follow up on Frito-Lay North America. In February, and I think since then, we've also heard you guys still expect flat volumes, flat margins. Now that's a little bit better than what we've seen in the first half of the year. It sounds like you're expecting an inflection as you go into the back half of the year for Frito to maintain that flat margin-flat volume expectation for the year. Is that the right way to interpret your comments today?","Indra K. Nooyi","Brian?","Brian C. Cornell","Ali, it would be. I think we expect to see improved performance in the third and fourth quarter. The benefits of our investments in brand, the continued focus on innovation and productivity should show improvements in our third and fourth quarter results.","Indra K. Nooyi","And, Ali, we started the year across all of PepsiCo saying, \"Don't chase volume for the sake of volume, chase share in a very responsible way.\" So we've tried to balance volume, pricing, revenue and profit in a very, very balanced way through the first half of the year.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. So still sticking to flat margins, flat volume for the year for Frito?","Indra K. Nooyi","Yes.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. And then on PAB, the volumes, whether it be negative 1% or negative 1.4%, were I guess a little bit lower than I'm hearing some folks expected. Can you help us disaggregate that? I know you're going to do it in your Q, but disaggregate that between North America and the rest of PAB, Latin America. And then also between CSDs and fill, just to give us a sense of where the volumes were looking for each of those segments.","Hugh F. Johnston","Yes. Ali, this is Hugh. From the standpoint of CSDs, again, we -- our focus was, first and foremost, on let's make sure that we get the right place -- pricing into the marketplace and let's make sure we maintain the consistent funding behind the brands and behind the innovation that we've launched this year. So as you know, because you've been around the consumer space for a while, when you're doing brand building and innovation types of build, it takes a bit longer for those things to get traction. But when they get traction, they are more advantaged than simply dropping price, and that's the strategy that we've chosen to follow. And frankly, the expectations that we had for the volumes in the business are basically right on where we would have expected them to come out, both from a volume perspective and from a market share perspective, in terms of the reported market share numbers that are out there. Regarding the other piece, the non-carbs in the overall volumes, I think the other factor that you have to consider is around this whole area of water and, in particular, case-packed water. We're in the business. We promoted sufficiently to stay in the business, but we're not interested in chasing case-packed water pricing down. We just don't think that's the right strategy for us. We do think it's an important part of the overall Aquafina business, but we do -- we promote it just enough to really maintain our relevance. On the other hand, the single-serve side of water is -- obviously, it's a great business. It's a profitable business. We like that business quite a bit, but we're not interested in chasing volume just by promoting case-packed water at the end of the quarter.","Indra K. Nooyi","Ali, the other thing, too, is we don't have as much of a tailwind on the distribution of energy drinks as anybody else might have. And second, our foodservice business is substantially different. As you know, our footprint is very different, and therefore, our foodservice volume uplift is overall lower than it might be for other people. So if you take into account these fundamental structural differences in our respective businesses, between us and competition, you'd see that we held value share, which is what we are focused on, in the measured channel business, and on foodservice, we gained share but from a very, very small base. And the energy drink is the big wildcard and something we distribute but we not -- we don't get as much tailwind as the market does.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. So that makes sense from the spirit of the answer. But would you care to offer numbers on North America CSD volume growth, Latin America fill, especially. So if you broke that down, would you care to offer those? I think a lot of that will be in your Q, but I was trying to get a head start on that.","Hugh F. Johnston","Yes. So basically, the way the numbers came in, North America volumes were down 2; North America volumes on CSDs were down 4; and non-carbs were up 1.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay, cool. And then just the last thing, if you would indulge me. So I guess we do appreciate -- you've heard this from others as well. But we appreciate the change to how you're disclosing things like organic growth. And that -- for us, at least, that's been very helpful in understanding how you actually are operating. If we could push for another potential change or, at least, some clarity is -- within SG&A. So I think it might help answer some part of Bill's question a little while ago as well. So in your SG&A, obviously, you put your JVs. So there's a bunch of income with no revenue attached to it, whether it'd be Lipton or -- Tea, in your Starbucks or Muller or Almarai, I'm probably missing a few. So it's difficult for us, at least for me and maybe I'm just missing something, to figure out what your real SG&A productivity is or what your real level of improvement is at the overall company level, but also at the -- perhaps even more importantly, the operating segment level. So is there consideration to split that out as you go forward, given it's become a big chunk, number one? And number two is to the question part. Can you help us understand what were the actual operating leverage on SG&A if you excluded those JV incomes that you report through that line item?","Hugh F. Johnston","Yes. Ali, this is Hugh. I hear your feedback on that one. And one of the things that we do every year is we both look at the disclosure to ensure that we're maintaining the right level of transparency without, obviously, giving away anything that would be competitively sensitive. Now SG&A would be less concerning in that regard, although I'm not crazy about the idea of breaking out JV profitability. I hear your feedback on that. We, at the same time, also look at other big multinationals, and we're trying to position ourselves where we're certainly at or better than most in terms of disclosure. But at a certain point, it also makes sense to limit the amount of disclosure based on, frankly, not giving away competitive information. So I appreciate the perspective. We're going to take a look at it again during the course of the fall as we think about 2013, and perhaps we can talk off-line a little bit more about some of the detailed thoughts that you have on that. It'd be helpful to get your point of view.","Indra K. Nooyi","But, Ali, I'll tell you one thing. When we look at productivity, we look at every item of the cost structure, including G&A: what's the corporate unallocated, what's the infrastructure running to the sectors and are we actually making that bucket more and more efficient over time? And so, from an internal management of the cost structure, believe me, we are maniacally focused on any sort of overhead structure to run this company. And based on all of our benchmarks, our core G&As around the company is among the lowest of any multinational company. So we feel good about the way we're managing G&A.","So let me just close by saying Q2 marked good progress against a clear, focused game plan that's allowing us to compete effectively today while positioning us for sustainable, long-term growth and shareholder value creation. And you have my and our entire leadership team's commitment that we'll continue to act with great urgency to deliver against our 2012 targets and our strategic objectives.","So let me close by thanking you all for joining us and for the confidence you place in us with your investment. Have a great day.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's PepsiCo Second Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. You may now disconnect."],"16872":["PepsiCo, Inc.

Your lines have been placed on listen-only until the question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded and will be archived at www.pepsico.com.","It is now my pleasure to introduce Mr. Jamie Caulfield, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Caulfield, you may begin.","Jamie Caulfield - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you. Joining me on the call today are Indra Nooyi, PepsiCo's Chairman and CEO; and Hugh Johnston, PepsiCo's Vice Chairman and CFO. We'll lead off with prepared comments and then we'll turn to Q&A. And recognizing it's a busy earnings day, we'll end the call at about 8:45.","As we begin the call, it's important to note the following. We will make forward-looking statements on this call. Any forward-looking statement inherently involves risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the current predictions and expectations. Information on such risks can be found in today's earnings release and our most recent Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings. In addition, we will discuss results using non-GAAP measures. You can find GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations on our website in the Investors section under the Events and Presentations tab.","As we discuss today's results, keep in mind that our fourth quarter comprises the 16 weeks ended December 26 for our North American operations and the months of September through December for most of our operations outside North America.","And now, it's my pleasure to introduce Indra Nooyi.","Indra K. Nooyi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Jamie, and good morning, everyone. And if I sound funny this morning, it's because I'm nursing a very bad cold. I'm pleased to announce that PepsiCo has delivered to shareholders a terrific year in 2015, with strong organic revenue growth and 10% core constant currency EPS growth. We simultaneously enhanced our competitiveness and prospects for future growth, while meeting or exceeding each of the 2015 financial goals that we shared with you this time last year.","From a strategic perspective, we held or gained market share across most of our key markets. We built the strength of our brands, evidenced by both our strong organic top-line growth and 40 basis point increase in A&M as a percentage of sales. We continued to extend our innovation advantage, growing new platforms such as MTN DEW Kickstart, Stacy's Pita snacks and Inner Smile dairy drinks in China, and simultaneously invested for the future by increasing our R&D spending.","We continued to win in foodservice by adding Disney in China, SUBWAY across several countries and renewing Yum! in China, due primarily to our broad product portfolio and superior customer service. And we enhanced our offerings to our foodservice partners in 2015 through the establishment of exciting new platforms like Stubborn Soda, MTN DEW BLACK LABEL and Hello Goodness vending. We added major new marketing properties with the NBA and the UEFA Champions League. And we expect to derive value from them through our rapidly-expanding global marketing and design capabilities. And we delivered a record-setting year for productivity as our outstanding operating teams leveraged our global supply chain Center of Excellence to execute best practices and new ideas with great precision across all of our businesses.","While delivering strong strategic results, we delivered financially. We targeted mid-single-digit organic revenue growth and delivered 5% growth. We targeted core operating margin expansion and delivered a 30 basis point improvement. We delivered 10% core constant currency EPS growth against our initial target of 7% and converted 120% of core net income to free cash flow, excluding certain items, through strong capital management. This strong cash generation enabled us to provide attractive cash returns to our shareholders, a total of $9 billion in 2015. And our core net return on invested capital stands at 19.6% at the end of 2015, up 430 basis points over the past three years.","I am particularly pleased to note that we achieved these results in the face of a challenging macro and external environment. Over my several decades in business, I have never seen this combination of sustained headwinds across most economies, combined with high volatility across global financial markets. From my meetings and observations traveling around the world, I have noted slow economic growth or recession across all but the U.S. \u2013 across the U.S. and a few other countries, as a combination of geopolitics and oil have created many challenging economic outcomes.","The slower economic growth has resulted in lower demand for commodities, which has put extreme pressure on previously-booming economies like Russia, Canada and Brazil, just to name a few. In order to address slowing demand, central banks have few tools to kick-start their economies, as these tools have largely been fully exploited over the past several years. In addition, increased government regulation, including increased taxation, labeling requirements and limitations on social programs, are placing further pressure on consumer demand.","These macro issues have created three broad risks for the consumer and for CPG companies. First, the widespread economic malaise has created a strong U.S. dollar, which has the effect of creating local inflation in international markets and threatens to derail the U.S. economic recovery. Second, volatile financial markets may cause a pullback in corporate investment and consumer spending. And finally, the continued weak economic performance is causing widespread political and social turmoil across the globe, which may create even greater economic harm.","In the face of these challenges, our geographic sectors managed very well during 2015, exploiting the more positive environments for superior results, while carefully navigating weak environments to balance tight cost management with judicious investment to surgically capture growth.","In a relatively positive macro environment, our performance in North America was particularly strong, with both Frito-Lay North America and North American Beverages turning in very good operating and financial performances. Each posted 3% organic revenue growth and 7% core constant currency operating profit growth for the year.","Frito-Lay North America once again delivered consistent results, while continuing to transform its package architecture in potato chips and its go-to-market system through further expansion of the GES program.","North American Beverages had its best financial performance in recent memory, benefiting from the continuation of improved industry pricing dynamics, a broad product portfolio and continued positive innovation performance.","And Quaker Foods North America began a turnaround in 2015, delivering positive organic revenue results for the first time in several years and gaining value share across its breakfast categories of hot and ready-to-eat cereal and Aunt Jemima syrup and mix. And I'm pleased to report that PepsiCo once again was the single largest contributor to U.S. retail food and beverage growth for our customers. For the full year, we provided more growth in U.S. retail sales than the next 15 largest food and beverage manufacturers combined. And it's this success that uniquely positions us as our customers' go-to partner to drive growth.","When we look beyond North America, our international divisions clearly dealt with the lion's share of the macro challenges that I mentioned earlier. And yet despite these challenges, we were able to grow organic revenue 8% and core constant currency operating profit 6% for the year by executing effective pricing strategies, launching exciting innovative products, localizing sourcing to address FX transaction headwinds and driving productivity that provided investment funding that will propel future growth.","So overall, a very good performance for the year and we believe we are well-positioned as we enter 2016.","Now, you may recall that we focused on one of our big performance-driving initiatives on each of the last three earnings calls. On our prior calls, we covered innovation supported by sensible brand management, then we talked about flawless execution. And last time, we talked about self-sustaining productivity. Today I want to focus on the fourth of these initiatives, cash generation and food and capital allocation.","Now, a substantial portion of our earnings converts to free cash flow and we generate a lot of cash. In fact, over the past three years, we've converted more than 100% of our core earnings to free cash flow and we generated more than $24 billion in free cash flow, excluding certain items, including $8 billion generated in 2015 alone. More broadly, we are highly disciplined in how we allocate this cash, with a particular focus on returning cash to shareholders.","Our first capital allocation priority is to invest in the business, not only in the form of CapEx and working capital, but also within the P&L, in A&M, R&D and marketplace investment in routes and racks. In fact, since 2011, we've increased A&M as a percentage of sales by 110 basis points and R&D spending is up 40%.","We have rigorous capital planning and review processes. Our CapEx investments have very attractive returns on investment. And we continually find ways to drive returns even higher by driving greater fixed asset utilization and by reducing the cost of adding capacity. Over the past four years, we have reduced CapEx as a percentage of sales to 4.4% on a rolling four quarter basis, which is an improvement of 60 basis points. On a revenue base of $63 billion, this equates to an annual cash savings of approximately $380 million.","Similarly, our efforts to improve our working capital have yielded positive results. Over the past three years, we have improved our working capital cash conversion cycle by more than 30 days, which contributed $2.5 billion to cash flow improvement. So both our CapEx and working capital productivity have been significant contributors to our very favorable free cash flow performance.","Our second priority is to pay dividends to our shareholders. We have raised our dividend for 44 consecutive years, effective with the June 2016 payment. And this is through both consistent earnings growth and by raising our payout ratio over time. With this morning's announced dividend increase, we expect to pay out approximately 60% of our core 2015 earnings. And our dividend yield at yesterday's closing stock price is an attractive 3%. And our ten-year compound annual growth in dividend per share is 10%. Continuity of dividends and growth in annual dividend per share are a point of great pride for PepsiCo and we view them as a vitally important element to the total shareholder return equation.","Our third priority is to strengthen our market positions and create value through responsible tuck-in acquisitions, generally less than $500 million a year in total, which equates to a relatively small percentage of annual free cash flow. We've built a lot of capability in evaluating and integrating tuck-in acquisitions. And we have very disciplined strategic and financial guidelines to ensure that they are value creating. Our acquisition evaluation is comprehensive and includes assessment of geographic considerations, category growth and attractiveness, scalability, competitive dynamics, people and business systems, integration, cultural fit and transaction complexity.","And our fourth capital allocation priority is to return residual cash to our shareholders through share repurchases, and we plan to do so within the confines of maintaining a capital structure that provides us ready access to the debt capital markets at attractive rates. Over the past three and 10 years, we returned more than $13 billion and $35 billion, respectively, to shareholders in the form of share repurchases. Net, our focus on capital allocation discipline has yielded impressive results. We've returned more than $65 billion to shareholders over the past 10 years in combined dividends and share repurchases.","Before Hugh covers guidance in detail, I'll just make a few broader points about the landscape going forward. We expect a continuation of the many macro challenges we face this year: a strong U.S. dollar; sluggish growth or recession in most developing and emerging markets; political and social unrest in a number of regions; and increased government regulation.","And, as I mentioned, while the U.S. economy is experiencing a recovery, it's delicate. And there is a risk that it will not sustain itself if the rest of the globe continues to experience such massive pressures. But even in the face of this rather challenging global landscape, I'm optimistic about PepsiCo's future. We have made a prudent appraisal of those factors outside of our control and we are controlling those factors we can control.","Our teams around the globe are executing well. Our innovation pipeline is full and promising. And the sustained investments we've made in strengthening marketing and developing cutting-edge capabilities will serve us well as we move through the year.","We believe we have the plans in place for 2016 to continue to deliver strong financial results. And there is something that's equally important as the right plans. We have the right people. The fact that we've achieved so much in what has been a protracted and extremely challenging and volatile environment, is a testament to the strength and experience of our management team. We benefit greatly from a senior management team distinguished by continuity, experience and skill. Our sector heads and CFO, Al, Tom, Laxman, Ramon, Sanjeev and Hugh, have 140 years of combined PepsiCo experience across multiple categories, markets and functions. And at the same time, we are developing and advancing PepsiCo's next generation of leadership.","The appointments over just the past 24 months of Laxman and Ramon to their respective sector leadership roles and the appointments of Brian Newman to run Global Operations and Eugene Willemsen to run our global category groups are a few key examples of such next-generation leaders who have gained tremendous experience already and have much runway ahead of them at PepsiCo.","So with these comments, let me turn the call over to Hugh. Hugh?","Hugh F. Johnston - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer","Great, and good morning, everyone. Moving on to our outlook for 2016, as we set out in the release, we expect organic revenue growth of approximately 4%, with the top-line continuing to benefit from the investments we've made in our brands and innovation, as well as our revenue management capabilities, driving organic revenue growth and positive net price realization. And taking our core 2015 EPS of $4.57 and applying our guidance and current foreign exchange market consensus rates, implies a 2016 core EPS of approximately $4.66.","Let me touch on the key considerations and assumptions embedded in our outlook. First, we will have a 53rd week in 2016, as we do every five or six years, which principally impacts our North American businesses, given that our international businesses report on a monthly calendar. Our organic revenue growth outlook excludes the impact of this extra week. And our intention is to reinvest the benefit from the extra week in growth and productivity initiatives.","Second, we will be lapping the deconsolidation of our Venezuela business, which occurred at the end of Q3 in 2015. Venezuela contributed approximately $0.10 per share to core earnings in the first three quarters of 2015. And third, foreign exchange translation will continue to be a headwind, with most of our key international markets' currencies expected to decline versus the U.S. dollar in 2016. Based on current foreign exchange market consensus rates, this is expected to be a four point drag on both net revenue and core EPS.","Additionally, to the positive, we expect to generate approximately $1 billion of productivity savings in 2016, which is in line with our overall objective of achieving $5 billion of productivity over the five years through 2019. We anticipate continued reduction in corporate expenses, and we expect our share count to benefit from a targeted $3 billion in share repurchases.","In terms of headwinds, we anticipate continued volatile macros, especially in the developing and emerging markets. And commodity inflation is deflationary in the low single digits, excluding foreign exchange, and low single digit inflationary, including the impact of transaction-related foreign exchange in many of the markets whose currencies have and are expected to continue to weaken against the U.S. dollar. Also, keep in mind that because of our forward buying approach, our commodity costs tend to lag what you see in the spot markets.","As you model out the quarters, we ask you to consider the following. We deconsolidated our Venezuela operations at the end of Q3 in 2015, so our EPS comparisons will be impacted by lapping the elimination of earnings from Venezuela during the first three quarters of 2016.","The AMENA division will face a difficult operating profit comparison during Q1 2016, as the business laps a gain related to re-franchising a portion of India bottling operations, and the benefit of the 53rd week will fall in the fourth quarter of the year, while our reinvestment of the benefit of the 53rd week will be made throughout the year.","We will maintain a high level of discipline toward capital allocation, with the vast majority of free cash flow after capital spending being returned to shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks. We expect to return $4 billion in cash to shareholders through dividends, and we expect to return an additional $3 billion in cash to shareholders through share repurchases.","So combined, we expect these actions will result in cash returns to shareholders of $7 billion in 2016. Capital allocation is a top priority for our management and our board, and we trust these actions will again be seen by shareholders as tangible evidence of this commitment.","With that, we are ready to take the first question.","Indra K. Nooyi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Hugh.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey. Good morning.","Indra K. Nooyi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Morning, Dara.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","So first, can you give us your organic sales growth in emerging markets in Q4? And as we look out to 2016, Indra, it sounded like you were very cautious on the macro environment, so any impact in terms of macros on your business in emerging markets in Q4, if you could provide some more detail there and also, so far, what you're seeing in Q1, given we're well into the quarter, and any thoughts just in general on the level of risk and your visibility on the 4% organic sales growth guidance. And then also, on the macro side, can you just review trends in gas and convenience in the U.S. in both snacks and beverages and your thoughts on consumer spending in that channel for 2016? Thanks.","Indra K. Nooyi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So let me start with the macro numbers. Go ahead.","Hugh F. Johnston - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, Dara, this is Hugh. To answer your question on developing and emerging markets, the growth rate would've been about 6% for the quarter.","Indra K. Nooyi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So, Dara, let me talk about the world and what we're seeing around the world. And it's not just emerging markets. We travel around the world, and let me just take a quick walk around the world. As you look at Latin America, Brazil, Argentina, if you look at Colombia, between a combination of the economic issues in the country and the currency devaluation, it's causing tremendous strain on anybody who is operating in that country, leave alone American companies have to report in U.S. dollars because you have both a transaction and a translation problem to deal with. Transaction because a lot of the commodities we buy are denominated in dollars, so we have to figure out how to price that through.","If you go over to Europe, the Western European market, I would say, did show some signs of recovery, but not to the level that we would like to see it. Interestingly, our businesses in East Europe are doing well with respect to the local market, but again the currency is really taking a bite out of the profit streams that come out of that market.","I was in the Middle East about three weeks ago. The teams there are very resilient, but they have to cope every day with the issues in the Middle East, whether it's countries going through attacks or the refugee crisis. It is pretty severe what's going on there. And many routes have to get off the market at times. And our teams are all local, so they figure out a way to operate, but it is tough. And I think we are one of the few companies that keeps an operation going because the routes can come on quickly when there's a lull in the activity there. So I would say it's difficult to watch that region going through the problems it's going through.","And as you move further east, India's holding up. The Pacific Rim is holding up nicely, don't see too many issues. And China, going into the Chinese New Year, last year, I think the market was very sluggish, but this year it started off moderately okay. And if you ask me about how the year has started off, look, one period or one month a year does not make, but the year has started off okay.","And again, I want to be very clear. What we can control, we are doing very well: execution; productivity; innovation now on the shelf. We are doing a very good job. And that's giving us some tailwinds. What we cannot control, which is the geopolitical issues, this incredible currency turmoil, we just have to accept it for the moment. And so I'd say the teams are executing very well in the marketplace. And that's why we feel cautiously optimistic, on the one hand, while feeling despondent about the macros on the other hand.","As far as the convenience store is concerned, in the past, we used to say when gas prices came down, there used to be a perceptible increase in convenience store traffic. Yes, we did see an increase in convenience store traffic and convenience stores were up, what, 6%, Hugh?","Hugh F. Johnston - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer","About 6%, yeah.","Indra K. Nooyi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","About 6%. But you know, I think that game has played out. Now, it's going to be how much innovation you put on the shelves and how you execute. And this is where again our DSD systems, our Power of One, and the fact that we have the right products for the convenience stores is going to stand us in great stead.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ali Dibadj of Bernstein.","Indra K. Nooyi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Morning, Ali.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","How are you? Hopefully, you'll feel better soon. So I wanted to get a better sense of your 2015 to 2016 EPS bridge, because if you're still actually getting this $1 billion of cost savings, you're buying back kind of this $3 billion similar level of stock purchase, that, together, would be kind of 11% or 12% EPS growth. And ex-Venezuela, ex-currencies, you're only saying you're going to get something like 8%. And I'm having trouble figuring out what that gap is. It makes me feel that all else equal, so if you're not cutting costs, you're not doing anything, the core business is actually shrinking, which clearly can't be with a 4% top-line growth number organically for next year. So I'm just trying to figure out the bridge, if you can, more quantitatively between 2015 and 2016 than what you've already offered, particularly on the core piece, please.","Indra K. Nooyi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Absolutely, Ali. Let me toss this to Hugh, who'll give you a complete answer on this.","Hugh F. Johnston - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer","Sure, happy to. Good morning, Ali. If you add up the numbers, you're right. Revenue growth, as we've said, is to be about 4%. Productivity will be about a $1 billion benefit. Commodities, of course, are inflationary, low single digits. The other factors built into our numbers are number one, we will see operating expense inflation. Recall, our bucket of OpEx is about $28 billion. A little over half of that is labor, and labor will inflate somewhere around 4% for the year. In addition to that, you'll see continued investments in advertising and marketing, as you have over the last couple of years. And the reason we continue to invest in that is we continue to get good returns on it, hence the 4% to 5% revenue growth you've seen over the last couple of years.","You will see higher investment in research and development as well, same answer on that. We're continuing to see good returns on that. And then, of course, with the revenue growth that we've seen over the last couple of years, we do need to invest in manufacturing lines. We need to invest in routes. We need to invest in racks to place the products on. So when you add all of those factors up and then add into that geographic mix, which is a slight drag, you wind up with a total of 8% on earnings per share growth.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Faucher of JPMorgan.","Indra K. Nooyi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Morning, John.","John A. Faucher - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning, Indra. Wanted to talk a little bit about sort of the longer-term outlook for the pricing environment; and so it makes sense, given all the inflationary pressures that we're seeing in terms of pricing in emerging markets, I guess the question really becomes can you sustain pricing in developed markets, particularly given \u2013 I know your raw materials are up slightly, but there are some deflationary raw materials. And there seems to be some concern about downward pressure on pricing maybe in the U.S. So as we look at the 2015 results, low single-digit volume, a little bit more pricing, do you see that changing over time? And can you continue to get the pricing in developed markets that would allow you to sort of sustain that sort of, let's say, 3% to 4% pricing number going forward? Thanks.","Indra K. Nooyi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","John, that's a great question because we talk about that and worry about that all the time. I think there are two or three things to think about. One is in categories which are not growing robustly, like carbonated soft drinks, there you should manage pricing very carefully because there's no point trying to drop the pricing, because it's not going to drive additional demand. So in that particular category, through a combination of revenue management, through a combination of intelligent price pack architecture, you just figure out how to get some pricing from the marketplace. So let's hold that on the side.","Second, the area where we really look for pricing is through innovation. Because if there's one place where the consumer likes the news and is willing to pay up for, it's for innovation. And we've been really ramping up our innovation machine to be able to get price realization through innovation.","The third is through channel mix. And if you sell more single-serve, if you sell to the channels where the consumer is willing to pay a little bit more, that clearly is a help.","And lastly, even if you don't get the pricing in some places, we want to take our costs down. So we've been looking at how to reengineer our supply chain end-to-end, how to work with customers to re-think our supply chain. So there's a lot of work going on in our company in terms of rethinking our end-to-end costs to align our supply chains with customers, so we can mutually take out costs and then figure out a way to pass some of it to the consumer. So that's really our strategy on pricing.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Powers of UBS Investment.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Hi. Thanks. Good morning. So, on the marketing step-up, which you obviously increased a lot this year and in the fourth quarter especially, can you talk a little bit more about where that investment is focused? Is it broad-based? Is it more food versus beverages, domestic versus international? Any skew would be helpful. And then more broadly, I'm just wondering if there's anything you're seeing out there that gives you more confidence on the margin in that spending, because I'm struck now by how many CPG companies that have emphasized a return to A&P investment in the last few weeks. But it's interesting against the backdrop \u2013 the macro backdrop, as you pointed out, is not getting easier. So is the increase that you're making, is it PepsiCo-specific against proactive opportunities? Is it against things that may be sort of deceptively encouraging for the broader industry? Or is any of your increase simply driven by a need to kind of keep pace and maintain share of voice versus peers that are also stepping up their investments? Any clarity there would be helpful. Thank you.","Indra K. Nooyi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hugh, why don't you talk to the where we're putting the money and then I'll talk about the rest here.","Hugh F. Johnston - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer","Sure, happy to. A couple of comments on that, Steve, number one, it is broad-based. I wouldn't say it's targeted to any particular business or any particular geography. As we cut across snacks and beverages, numbers went up in both categories. As we cut across the geographies, all of our geographies saw an increase in advertising and marketing spend.","Number two, in terms of where is the money going, I would say that more of it is going to digital over time. The big constraint on moving more to digital is identifying high-quality properties to advertise on. So it's not just a matter of going for pop-up ads anymore. It's really more sophisticated digital advertising. And that is probably \u2013 more than anything, the rate-limiting factor is finding high-quality assets to invest in.","Third, as you've seen as recently as the Super Bowl this past weekend, we are investing in big properties, because these big properties do enable breakthrough types of messaging. And I think we, over the last several years, as well as for a longer period of time, have been quite successful in investing in those big properties.","And then fourth, from a returns perspective, obviously, measuring advertising and a marketing return is a little bit trickier than measuring return on price reductions and things like that. That said, with the advent of big data, we actually are getting more sophisticated in terms of our ability to measure those returns. Without getting into all of the details of it, the things I'd point to on a macro level are, we've been able to sustain 4% to 5% revenue growth in what's been a challenging environment.","So when you add all of it up, we'll continue to invest more in advertising and marketing as we see good payback on it. As a management team, we are acutely focused on shareholder value creation as the meta-metric for all that we do around here. And advertising and marketing is giving us good payback for the shareholders.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank.","Indra K. Nooyi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Morning, Bill.","William G. Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. Hey, can we just go back to North America a second and just talk about the impact on Frito from the pack down (34:00) changes and the go-to-market changes? So can you just quantify what you guys think that did to sales over the last year and when it gets lapped?","And then maybe the sustainability of growth at Gatorade, which has been phenomenal, and a lot of it's been driven by category growth. So is that broadly just sort of like the fitness health and wellness trend in the U.S. or do you think it's driven by something more dynamic?","Indra K. Nooyi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I'll talk about Gatorade and then you can get your thoughts straight...","Hugh F. Johnston - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer","Sure.","Indra K. Nooyi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","On what detail you can provide on Frito. I think Gatorade benefited in 2015 from three factors. One is, it was a hot year, and it was hotter for a longer period of time. And Gatorade does well when the temperature is above normal, especially for as long as it was during the year. So we shouldn't underestimate the impact of that.","Second is, the Gatorade innovation has been very good. Fierce and Frost alone, I think, contributed significantly to sales growth. And all the new stuff that Gatorade is doing with the smart bottle, with the pods that are tailored for the athlete, the Gatorade Prime and Recover, all of that is giving more legitimacy to the brand. And I think that it's driving more of the Gatorade sales.","And third, I think on a competitive basis, relatively speaking, the fact that so many athletes are choosing Gatorade now is allowing Gatorade to far outdistance any emerging competitors in the space who tried to attack Gatorade just on price. And Gatorade has managed to hold its own and, in fact, extend its advantage. And so a combination of these three have served us well.","Going into 2016, I think we'll keep the pedal to the metal on innovation, on execution and hope that the weather holds up. That's the best we can do. So Frito, Hugh?","Hugh F. Johnston - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, so from a Frito perspective, Bill, I assume your question is around the potato chip promotional package, moving from the XXL to the XL bag. That probably cost us from a volume perspective about a point. Recall, that the reason for the strategy, as we talked during last year, was to increase household penetration with smaller household sizes. The objective was to get a package that smaller households would find attractive as the primary promotional package. In that regard, the strategy has actually been quite successful and I think gotten our volume re-based in a good spot from the standpoint of how we're managing the Lay's business.","More broadly in terms of Frito-Lay performance, you saw 1%, 3%, 7% last year in terms of volume, revenue and profit. If you look at Frito's performance over the last four or five years, it's been remarkably consistent, volume's been around 2%. Revenue's been around 4% and profit's been around 6%, plus or minus a point, for quite a few years. I think you can continue, even as we invest and make changes in Frito, you can expect to see that type of performance going forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.","Indra K. Nooyi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Morning, Judy.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Good morning, everyone. How are you?","Indra K. Nooyi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.","So I guess I just wanted to go back to Frito-Lay and maybe just get your color on the broader kind of macro snacking environment in the U.S. The confectionery category has been a little bit soft. Salty snacks is more stable, but just in terms of the context of the U.S. consumers perhaps being a bit better off, seems like maybe the category could do a little bit better. So any color just in terms of where the consumers are going across the broader macro snacking category would be helpful.","Indra K. Nooyi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Let me step back. The overall macro snacking category probably growing somewhere in the 3% to 4%, and the reason Frito does as well as it does is because it takes occasions from all other macro snacking categories. And so Frito's able to go after crackers, able to go after sweet occasions, through interesting products that comes from a salty heritage. So we have a frying platform. We have a baking platform, different sort of baking platforms. And we leverage those platforms to go after all of those occasions. And I think that's what creates an advantaged model within Frito-Lay.","We are not in a zero-sum game within macro snacks, where any growth that we get has to come at the expense of another category already participating. In the case of Frito, we are in one category and reach out of the core (38:56). Remember the old strategy of grow the core and add more? That's really what we're doing. We're looking at the demand of consumers and wondering how we can serve that demand with a Frito-Lay option.","And whether it's Cheetos, Fritos or it's the chocolate-covered Lay's that we offered or all the new products on slate for next year, I think we're just going after other macro snacking occasions. And that's why other companies are hurting and Frito-Lay is doing so well. And you combine that with our DSD system, our Power of One advantage, we can really get a tremendous advantage with customers.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Swartzberg of Stifel, Nicolaus.","Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks. Good morning, Indra. Good morning, Hugh.","Indra K. Nooyi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Morning, Mark.","Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Two questions on Latin America, if I could, one is, any detail you can give us on the \"strategic investments\" in the quarter, to what extent they're brand and forward-facing and to what extent they were otherwise. And then secondly, it's kind of early days since you've integrated snacks and beverage in Latin America, but could you give us an update on how that's going and whether 2016 is a year where we should expect benefits from that to be more significant? Just how that's going and what your outlook from that is.","Indra K. Nooyi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Investments in Latin America.","Hugh F. Johnston - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, sure, happy to start with that. Good morning, Mark. When you look at Latin America, you really have to take a step back, because it's such a broad and diverse geography, both in terms of cultures and in terms of economic outlook for the near-term. Obviously, Brazil has got a significant number of challenges facing into 2016, as it has over the last couple of years. At the other end of the spectrum, Mexico is, as an economy, performing quite well. So if you think about what we're trying to accomplish, as you move south into Latin America, a lot of our focus has been around making our supply chain more efficient and making our management structures more efficient. And a number of the investments that we made in the fourth quarter there were geared towards productivity-driving initiatives.","On the other hand, in Mexico, where the outlook is more positive, the investments we made during the course of 2015 were more growth-oriented. And as we think about our outlook going forward, we expect that mix of probably stronger performance out of Mexico, more margin improving performance out of the balance of Latin America. That said, we're long-term, very positive on the geography. We think we've got great market positions and great people down there. And we think it's one of the most important regions of the world for us going forward.","Indra K. Nooyi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And then, in terms of integrating snacks and beverages under one leader, look, if we didn't have economies in Latin America that were performing so poorly at this point, we'd start to see results sooner. But right now, it's very hard to really point to when we will see results, based on the fact that any progress we make is eaten up by macroeconomic challenges. So we look at underlying in-process metrics, if you want to call it that, as opposed to tailpipe metrics. And everything we're seeing says that we are making great progress in figuring out how to leverage a franchise bottler system with our snacks business to create advantage. And it's going well so far.","Indra K. Nooyi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So with that, let me just thank you all for your questions. And in closing, let me reiterate that we are pleased with our 2015 results. Looking ahead to 2016, we are confident that we have the right plans in place. We are executing well against those plans. And we've set appropriately aggressive targets for 2016. We look forward to updating you on our progress as the year advances. Thank you for your time and questions this morning and, more importantly, for the confidence you've placed in us with your investment.

We will start off this morning with highlights for the third quarter and a discussion of each of the operating sectors' performances in a little more detail; and then Hugh will cover the full year outlook.","For the quarter, we delivered revenue, operating profit, and EPS growth in what continues to be a volatile macro environment. Organic revenue was up 1.7% for the quarter and 2.3% year-to-date with solid net price realization operating margin expansion in most of the sectors.","Although we have moderated our full year organic revenue growth outlook, we now expect full year core EPS of $5.23, which is 2 percentage points or $0.10 higher than our previous expectation. This improvement is being driven by the strength of our year-to-date results, coupled with an improved outlook on foreign exchange impact.","Each of our operating sector\u2019s performance came in on or ahead of expectations with the numbers showing sequential topline acceleration, with the exception of our North American Beverages business, where net revenue and operating profit declined. So, let me start with that.","While North American Beverage performance was below our expectations, I will tell you upfront that the issues are temporary and we believe we have taken the necessary actions to improve the performance of this business beginning in Q4.","So, what happened? From an industry perspective, weather was comparatively negative, both temperature and precipitation, following record hot summers in 2015 and 2016, and there was a marked slowdown in the C-store channel in Q3. Now given this as a background, our performance did lag the industry, no question about it.","First, Gatorade, which accounts for approximately one-fifth of our Q3 volume declined following two sequential years of terrific Q3 growth. In fact, Q3 volumes were up a total of 18% over 2015 and 2016.","Relative to other beverage categories, this is one that is both much more sensitive to weather and more exposed to the C-store channel. So the broader weather and C-store industry themes I just mentioned had an outsized impact on Gatorade.","Second, we underperformed the industry in carbonated beverages. This summer, we directed too much of our media spending and shelf space to new low-calorie, much smaller brands at the expense of our Pepsi and Mountain Dew trademarks. While our plans for the summer were consistent with our continued and deliberate strategy to transform our beverage portfolio.","Clearly, we redirected some big brand space to these new products as opposed to focusing on new incremental space. We view both of these conditions as temporary and not structural, and we fully expect topline performance to improve in the coming quarters.","We have a good handle on what happened, and we are making immediate adjustments to get the business back to growth. We are stepping up marketing spending on Pepsi and Mountain Dew, including our zero and low calorie products under these trademarks.","We are reallocating and securing incremental shelf space in this place for our existing and new products to drive better overall velocity. We are tweaking our consumer communication with sharper brand messaging on pack, at point of sale, and through traditional social and digital media.","We have more innovation directed at our biggest trademarks, including low and no calorie products that will hit the market starting in early 2018, and we're executing our programs responsibly to ensure that we're driving profitable growth. With the expected improved topline, we also expect improved profit performance as we realize both mix and scale benefits from the improved sales trajectory.","To be clear, our beverage transformation initiatives over the longer term have been very successful in shifting our mix to faster growing subcategories and providing more low and zero sugar options.","Since 2010, we have increased our mix of non-carbonated beverages by 7 percentage points. Over the decades, we have established and maintained leadership positions in many of the most attractive noncarbonated categories, and we have successfully introduced many offerings to appeal to consumers' increasing demand for zero and low calorie offers. So, make no mistake about it, we remain squarely on strategy and having made a few course corrections, expect NAB to return to growth in the coming quarters.","Moving on to Frito-Lay North America, we had another quarter of very strong results, with a good balance of volume growth, net price realization, and operating margin expansion.","We feel very good about the business with innovation, pricing, execution, and market share performance all on target. We are particularly pleased with the continuing strength in organic sales growth, which is being fueled by effective price pack management and innovation backed by great marketing.","Take Cheetos as an example. We drove 6% net revenue growth for the trademark in Q3 with new products, such as Cheetos Paws, Jalape\u00f1o Cheetos, and our SIMPLY line, and Mac n' Cheetos also contributing to the growth.","The innovation is well-supported by creative consumer engagement that included our award-winning Cheetos virtual museum campaign that asks, \"What do you see in your Cheetos?\" The program garnered 100,000 online consumer submissions and countless earned media impressions.","Ruffles, which grew net revenue 11% in the quarter benefited from innovations such as Spicy Jalape\u00f1o Ranch and Flamin' Hot that appeal to consumers' increasing desire for both flavors.","And beyond our largest trademarks, we saw impressive double-digit net revenue growth in premium and better-for-you offerings such as SunChips, Smartfood Popcorn, and Miss Vickie's and in our variety multipacks that provided great assortment of our top brands in convenient single-serve packages.","At Quaker Foods North America, we are pleased with the sequential acceleration in organic volume, organic revenue, and core operating profit performance, and we continue to feel positive about the trends in the business.","Our activations of portable breakfast innovation, namely Breakfast Flats launched in 2016 and Breakfast Squares that were launched in the first quarter are yielding positive results.","And our second quarter launch of Overnight Oats Cups, capitalizing on the growing trend of preparing chilled oats using a variety of healthy ingredients is also gaining traction with consumers. Taken together, our innovation and other programming drove mid-single-digit volume growth in our base oatmeal portfolio.","To wrap-up North America, I'm pleased to report that year-to-date through the third quarter, we generated more retail food and beverage revenue growth in the United States measured channels than all other 5 billion plus manufacturers combined. And in the third quarter, Frito-Lay on a standalone basis was once again the number one contributor to total U.S. food and beverage retail growth among all 5 billion plus manufacturers.","Turning now to our sectors outside North America. In Latin America, we continue to see very challenging macroeconomic conditions and geopolitical instability, which dampened consumer spending.","As we enter our fourth quarter, the devastating impact of the Mexico earthquakes and hurricanes in the Caribbean and Puerto Rico are clearly adding to these challenges. Within this context, our businesses in the region performed well in the third quarter, posting 5% organic revenue growth.","Mexico, our largest market in the region, had high single-digit organic revenue growth, while Brazil grew organic revenue mid-single-digits. Similarly, we have continued to experience macro challenges in a number of markets throughout our Asia, Middle East, and North Africa segment, including the significant currency devaluation in Egypt and the economic impacts in a number of markets across the Middle East stemming from persistently low oil prices.","However, we have been adjusting our business to address these challenges. We are pricing to cover the increased cost of doing business and we are going more aggressively after productivity to reduce our overall costs. As a result, we saw a noticeable improvement this quarter as AMENA delivered 9% organic revenue growth driven by double-digit organic revenue growth in China, Pakistan, Philippines, Egypt.","And turning to Europe and Sub-Sahara Africa, we had very good results across the region, with organic revenue growth in each of our top four markets, along with six of the next seven key markets and a sequential acceleration overall, which translates to margin expansion and 12% core constant currency operating profit growth.","Organic revenue growth was well balanced across snacks and beverages, which grew high single-digit and mid-single-digit respectively, driven by strong product innovation and in-market executions.","Russia, our largest market in the region, had mid-single-digit organic revenue growth and very strong operating margin improvement. Among our other key markets, we delivered double-digit organic revenue growth in Turkey, mid-single-digit organic revenue growth in France, Poland and Germany, and low single-digit organic revenue growth in the U.K.","Now as we mentioned last quarter, across our businesses, we're pleased with the progress we're making in the e-commerce channels, and I say channels, plural, because we're addressing growth opportunities across eGrocery, pureplay, urban grocery delivery, direct-to-business and direct-to-consumer models.","Our success is underpinned by the significant investments we've made in attracting talents to and building capabilities in our dedicated global e-commerce business unit. So today, we have a team of roughly 200 e-commerce professionals supporting our businesses to capture growth in the rapidly emerging e-commerce channels.","It's made up of seasoned e-commerce and tech professionals, combined with our best entrepreneurial talent from within PepsiCo and we're managing this unit more like a tech company than a traditional CPG from how and where they work, the risks they can take, to how they are compensated. And we continue to fortify and enhance the full suite of capabilities that we believe will enable us to win in these channels from data analytics to specialized e-commerce supply chain knowhow.","Importantly, we're increasingly collaborating with our retail customers to make our e-commerce capabilities yet another point of differentiation in our value-added relationships with them.","For example, using big data and predictive analytics to shape real-time marketing messages, dynamic merchandising, and tailored offers, our team is enabling us to drive greater purchase instrumentality and higher basket size for our customers online.","As a result of these efforts, we have a business that's approximately $1 billion in annualized retail sales with impressive growth in key e-commerce markets. For example, this year, our e-commerce retail sales are projected to be up 80% in the United States and nearly double in China.","In many cases, our online share exceeds our offline share and we are gaining online pretty much across the Board. While overall penetration of food and beverage remains relatively low compared to most of the categories, it is growing fast and its development is sure to be highly dynamic, and we believe we are well-positioned to win in this space.","Despite the many macro challenges, we continue to feel good about the state of our business. The fundamentals we have been focusing on and discussing with you remains solidly intact. We have a leading product portfolio and deep capabilities.","We continue to drive growth, product innovation, exceptional marketing, and innovation. We continue to transform our portfolio to capitalize on evolving consumer trends and we have a robust productivity agenda that is enabling us to continue to invest in the business, while delivering attractive earnings growth.","And finally this quarter demonstrated that the PepsiCo portfolio does have the capacity to generate topline and bottom-line growth even in the occasional quarter where we see a downturn in a particular sector. And it is the resilience of the portfolio that is also enabling us to increase our earnings outlook for the year.","With that, let me turn the call over to Hugh. Hugh?","Hugh Johnston","Thank you, Indra and good morning everyone. Turning to guidance, we expect our full year organic revenue growth to approximate the 2.3% rate we have achieved through the first three quarters. We expect core constant currency EPS to grow 9%, a one percentage point increase compared to our previous guidance.","Based on current market consensus rates, foreign exchange is expected to negatively impact both full year reported net revenue and EPS by approximately one percentage point, which compares to the previous market estimates of two points. So, as a result of the improved outlooks for both core constant currency EPS growth and foreign exchange, we now expect core earnings of $5.23 per share.","In terms of other key considerations and assumptions embedded in our full year outlook, we continue to expect low single-digit raw material inflation, driven both by an increase in our basket of commodities, and some pressure from transaction ForEx.","We continue to expect core operating margin expansion fueled by our productivity programs. Our productivity programs are on track to achieve our annual $1 billion target and we continue to expect our core effective tax rate to be approximately 24%.","Turning to cash flow, we expect to continue to generate strong cash flow and to exercise discipline over capital allocation with prudent reinvestment in the business and the majority of our free cash flow, excluding certain items, to be returned to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.","So, for 2017, we continue to expect approximately $10 billion in cash flow from operations, net capital spending of approximately $3 billion, approximately $7 billion in free cash flow, excluding certain items, cash dividends of approximately $4.5 billion. Recall that we previously announced a 7% increase in our quarterly dividend that began with the June payment. This represents the 45th consecutive year in which we've increased our dividend and share repurchases of approximately $2 billion.","Finally, as you update your models, I'd like to highlight the following three items as they relate to the fourth quarter. We are lapping the 53rd-week from 2016 and expect our reported revenue to be negatively impacted by three percentage points, we estimate the impact of the recent natural disasters to negatively impact EPS of by approximately three percentage points, and we expect sequential improvement at our North American Beverage business.","With that, we are ready to take the first question. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]","Our first question comes from Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs.","Judy Hong","Thank you. Good morning everyone. So, Indra I guess I just wanted to get a little bit more color just in terms of North America. Clearly, you've seen some volume pressure in the quarter, maybe a little bit more details around the brand performance in terms of how much volume was down across your brands.","And then I think you talked about some of the challenges from a weather and C-store traffic perspective, but maybe talk a little bit more about the competitive backdrop, because it does seem like there's some small brands that are gaining share, maybe there is a little bit better execution from your key competitors, so if you could just talk through those issues?","Indra Nooyi","Look, we have gone deep on the business to understand what is environmental factors that contributed to our performance and what is our own execution aspects that contributed to performance, and I\u2019d tell you that, roughly speaking, my assessment is about 70 -30 in terms of what the weather, the precipitation, what the C-store slowdown caused to the business, and what we could have done differently.","And as I said in the script, Judy, Gatorade is a big part of our business and we were lapping 18% over 2015 and 2016, and with a slowdown of C-stores -- C-store traffic and the weather patterns in Q3, clearly Gatorade was impacted because the weather has an outsized impact on Gatorade. That was the first one.","The second is CSDs. We've been embarking on a deliberate strategy to shift the portfolio to lower calorie offerings and they tend to be more non-carbonated beverages, and that's why we shifted about seven points of the portfolio to non-carbs.","We have a lot more lower calorie and zero calorie innovation in CSDs, and we actually have it even under the big brands, the Pepsi and the Mountain Dew brands. So, what we're going to be doing going forward is taking the big brands and doing a lot more low calorie and zero calorie offerings under that brand.","So, I tell you if I looked at this quarter, the only two that we need to focus on is getting Gatorade back to growth, which we're already beginning to see and tweaking our advertising spending against Pepsi and Dew.","The thing to be very careful about is we are focused on responsible growth. During the quarter, as we saw the trends, we could have very quickly hit a promotional lever and tried to drive growth, and we tried our best not to do that because we think that once you go down this promotional spiral, it's never-ending. So, our team is focused on profitable growth, responsible growth, and we are all focused on getting CSD trademarks and Gatorade back to growth.","Operator","Our next question comes from Laurent Grandet with from Credit Suisse.","Indra Nooyi","Good morning Laurent.","Laurent Grandet","Hey good morning Indra. Good morning Hugh. I\u2019d like to ask you about I mean specifically -- I mean more structural issues I mean of CSD the business. I mean, it seems like Coke is getting shares clearly -- the competition would be higher next year as, I mean, your competitor would be fully refranchised.","What do you think about what's happening really in the marketplace against your key competitors? And how you think you will be able to turn this business around? I'm thinking more about the CSD business here. I know you said you will spend more in your A&M, but in terms of operating more in the business would be interesting to understand.","Indra Nooyi","Okay. Let me give my comments and then Hugh step in with yours. I actually believe ownership of the bulk of the bottling system is an advantage because you can actually do two things. One, you can flex them quickly and second is that you can extract more productivity from a bigger base. So, I actually believe it's a good thing.","During a period when a refranchising is going on, what happens is that you have funds that you can use to deploy against the market. But that is a temporary situation and that is going to get exhausted very soon.","So, we have to be careful that while the marketplace might have extra funding during a refranchising activity, we don't overreact by hitting a promotion lever to get short-term value -- volume in the business.","Having said that, what are the structural issues we see? One, we see a continued decline in full-sugar beverages. We see consumers shifting to lower calorie and zero calorie beverages. And we do see a lot of little competitors coming into the marketplace with interesting new beverage offerings, some of which stick, many of them don't stick.","So, what we have to do is create an entity within our company that does smaller brands, but smaller brands that stick and grow into medium size and bigger brands, we have to create that capability, which we are doing; and second is that the big lesson from Q3 is that it is an and game, not an or game.","When we launch new products, we have to go for new shelf space. The core shelf space, especially in C-stores for the big brand, we have to protect the hell out of it and that's what we're going to do. And Hugh, do you want to add anything to it?","Hugh Johnston","No, I think you've captured it well. The only thing that I would add is there clearly is going to be a competitive difference between the way our primary competitor is going to the market and the way we are. As Indra said, we think our strategy is the right one for all the reasons that are mentioned. And in addition to that, we think that that structure of the industry will lead to healthy competition, not destructive competition.","So, I think we are positioned well to see a healthy competitive environment. The consumer change is going to continue to be more towards lower calorie options and because of our investments in R&D, we think we are advantaged to capture those consumers as they move into the healthier options.","Indra Nooyi","But you know, Hugh, it's also safe to say that, as a leadership, we are focused singularly on value creation, shareholder value creation and we spot trends and if we think we have to make changes in our business, we do that. So, at this point, we think our strategy is the right strategy. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo.","Bonnie Herzog","Good morning. Hi. I guess I was just hoping you could drill down a little more on your full year guidance and really what has changed now that you expect to deliver the 9% EPS growth despite your topline being slightly weaker. I know, Indra, you touched on topline for your North American Beverage business improving. So, I'm trying to think about that relative to what your expectations are for Frito revenue?","And then I still really unfair what of the levers are that you can pull to drive the faster EPS growth in light of a more difficult cost environment? And then maybe if you could just touch what drove the sharp reduction in your corporate expense line in the quarter? What that was from and then how much more of an opportunity there could be for further reduction? Thanks.","Indra Nooyi","Go ahead Hugh.","Hugh Johnston","Yes, Bonnie, happy to answer that. Two factors, all right. It's not being driven by aggregate revenue and it's not being driven by tax rate. As we noted the tax rates are same. Two primary factors. Number one is costs we're expecting now to come in a little bit better than we had previously forecast. And number two, we expect the mix of business to be a little bit more profitable, little better and those two factors gave us about an extra point of EPS growth.","Indra Nooyi","And in terms of overall cost management, we put in place a Smart Spending program about one year ago. And as the months go by, we just get better at being smarter and smarter with Smart Spending. And what you're seeing, because right here in corporate, we drive Smart Spending very, very seriously and that's where you're seeing the reduction in corporate cost.","Operator","Our next question comes from Vivien Azer with Cowen and Company.","Indra Nooyi","Good morning Vivien.","Vivien Azer","Good morning. Indra I was hoping we could touch on C-store again, please? I appreciated your comments on the channel sluggishness and the impact that's having on your Beverage business, but it does seem like there is a disconnect. And specifically, that's while beverages are under pressure, your salty snacks business actually looks to be outperforming pretty materially in that channel. So, if you could address that divergence that would be helpful? Thank you.","Hugh Johnston","Yes, I'm happy to answer that one, Vivien. A couple of things going on there. One, Frito-Lay really does have a wonderful balance of core products and great execution this year, and that's certainly helping us in the convenience store channel. And the truth is Frito-Lay is actually bucking what's a broad trend of challenges across most products in the channel.","In terms of what's driving the channel, volumes are down a little bit across the Board and C-store; pricing is up a little bit, three biggest factors in challenging the channel traffic. Number one, gas prices were up particularly in the latter half of the third quarter.","Number two, construction was down a little bit during the course of the summer and that negatively impacted traffic. And number three, we didn't get the heat burst this summer in late July and August that we had seen in the previous two summers and that negatively impacted the channel.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.","Indra Nooyi","Dara good morning.","Dara Mohsenian","Hi, good morning. So, if we look at the year-to-date results or your full year guidance, it looks like versus years past, we're seeing low organic sales growth, weaker gross margin trends to get to that very solid 9% core EPS growth.","So clearly, you're relying more on SG&A leverage and cost cutting. So just a couple of questions off that. First, Hugh, is there something that's changed from an SG&A or cost-control standpoint, where this improved pace of SG&A leverage see longer term? Or is it more isolated to this year and some of the Smart Spending Indra mentioned? So, just trying to understand if that changing trend is something that can get you to longer term.","And then second, Indra, you obviously made comments on the Beverage business and reinvestment in Q4 and theoretically within the next couple of quarters. Given the overall topline slowdown in the industry pressure points, is there greater reinvestment in your mind that's needed back behind the business, beyond just Q4 in light of the difficult industry environment and just that pressure of the typical earnings algorithm you've been able to deliver historically? Thanks.","Indra Nooyi","I'll answer the second answer, and then, Hugh, you should take the first one and talk about what's changed. I think that the thing to be careful about is not just the reinvestment, it's how much and in what. It's better to invest in pull activities than to hit the pedal on push activities. Because when you start getting into this competitive battle of more and more promotions, we've been there, done that, I don't think that's a way to create long-term, strong businesses. So, we've tended to focus more on innovation and pull-related spending, more A&M spending.","The shift to digital is a question mark because I don't know what the ROI on digital is as yet. And we're relooking at all elements of our marketing spending to see exactly which method of spending gives us the best ROI by brand. So, that's a piece of work we are doing.","What we want to do over the next few quarters is look at our brand portfolio and see how best to do trademark advertising, so we can focus on the big brands and still drive lower calorie products.","The thing to be careful about is this industry should not escalate to going from push spending to pull spending and everybody throws a lot of money into this business. It's going to be a judicious management of this business, where you've got the right amount of A&M spending and judicious execution, so this business remains profitable going forward.","I think that's where ownership of the bottling business is going to make a huge difference because we can work all of these levers very carefully. So, the next few quarters, watch and see what we do to tweak our spending and what the benefits are. We feel reasonably confident.","Hugh Johnston","Yes, I'm happy to jump in on the SG&A question, Dara. You're right, we -- our gross margins were down a few basis points, operating margin was up a few basis point. The biggest change that we've seen over the last couple of years is Smart Spending. We have about 30 big categories of spend. We've really only gotten into about five or six of them at this point. The ones that we've done are the relatively simpler ones that -- the travel outside services, facilities and things like that.","The more complex areas of spend when you get into distribution, when you get into selling, when you get into certain elements of non-working A&M, those take a little bit longer. We're working on them right now. We have plans to and expect to see results from those areas of spend over the next couple of years. So, to complete the answer to your question, we do expect to be able to continue to leverage Smart Spending to deliver outsized productivity results for the coming years.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America.","Indra Nooyi","Good morning Bryan.","Bryan Spillane","Hi, good morning everyone. I guess my question is maybe a follow-up to Dara's question with regard to the algorithm. One of the questions that we fielded a lot this year is just whether or not the PepsiCo long-term algorithm is really sustainable given how -- all the dynamic changes happening at retail in the U.S., category trends in beverages.","So Indra, could you just sort of give your sort of state of the algorithm relative to all the changes that we're seeing occur in the marketplace today, and sort of how PepsiCo is just ensuring that you've still got the sort of the right resources and whether that algorithm is still right?","Indra Nooyi","So, Bryan, we're not a talking about any long-term algorithm or guidance at this point. We usually do that in the February meeting. But let me tell you in broad shapes, our focus is on innovation, our focus is on portfolio expansion, our focus is on shift to Better For You, Good For You products. And our focus is on productivity and stepped up levels of productivity.","The whole goal is to marry our innovation capability with our productivity programs. And we've had remarkable success over many, many, many quarters. This one quarter was a bit of a [Indiscernible] on North American Beverages, and I call it [Indiscernible] because there were many external factors that caused this. And believe me, we are all over this business and we will be back. There is no issue.","So from a long-term algorithm, just wait until February next year when we do give you the guidance. But all I say to you, our focus is on balanced top and bottom-line growth. Invest in the topline; make sure the right productivity to deliver the bottom-line growth. Make sure that you invest in all the new capabilities needed and generate the productivity to invest in new capabilities. That is a tried and tested playbook, and we're not backing off of that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.","Indra Nooyi","Lauren good morning.","Lauren Lieberman","Good morning. Thank you. Two things. First was just a follow-up for Hugh on the Smart Spend conversation. You've mentioned I think 30 buckets; you're five to six in so far. I'm just curious, is it sort like a pro rata potential, where these first five to six are not just a little easier to get at, but also bigger pools than kind of what's still to be explored and understand the complexity? That was one.","Two is just going back again; I apologize, to North America Beverages, but year-to-date, at least externally the trends haven't been great or less good than they've been in the past. So, you'd also already talked about prior to today putting more money behind big franchises, you talked about behind CSDs. If I think back to the Super Bowl, it was Pepsi Zero Sugar that was supported.","So, I'm just curious kind of how some of this redirecting spending already started? It seems on TV -- I know I'm seeing a lot of the Pepsi ads, are you seeing any lift from that yet? I'm just -- I'm surprised the degree to which -- at sort of this point in time, that something went off internally that say we need to redirect and replan and it didn't happen earlier in the year. So, if you can just address kind of what flipped the switch for guys on thinking through this a bit differently?","Indra Nooyi","You want to take the first part, Hugh?","Hugh Johnston","Yes, I'm happy to handle that one. Lauren, in terms of the buckets, I would characterize our timing of them not about size, but just about complexity. Travel is obviously a relatively simple bucket to get after when you get into distribution and selling and things like, those are just more complex buckets of spend.","The size actually of the buckets that we haven't gotten to yet is substantially larger than the size of the buckets that we have already gotten to. So, I would think of it as there's lots more opportunity out there, but it just takes more time to get at them.","Travel and facilities and outside services and things like that are relatively simple and straightforward to get at, so that's why we're seeing those benefits more immediately. But it's not a question of running out of runway on the size of opportunity.","Indra Nooyi","And talking about NAB trends. When you're looking at weather and you're looking at precipitation, you don't plan for a cooler weather or higher levels of precipitation. So, we fully expected that this summer would be a normal summer, not a flaming hot summer, but we thought it'd be normal summer. And so we kept investing behind the brands like Gatorade, but then when the weather completely turned south and -- not literally, but it was cooler and a lot more precipitation, that advertising spending did not give us much lift as we would've liked the business to get.","Now, if we have not been lapping the 18% growth, it's a whole different ballgame. The problem is the combination of lapping the 18% growth for the last two years in Gatorade, plus the fact that we had a cooler summer this year, when it's our seasonally big quarter is what caused the issue.","And one of the things we've told our businesses is that don't do anything in the short-term which will have no lasting impact for the long-term. Many years ago, we use to just hit the promotional spending lever. And I think what we're doing very carefully now is saying don't hit the promotional spending lever because that won't last for the long-term.","So, the weather was a big factor. And we hate to use weather as an excuse, Lauren, but the weather was a big factor. And we didn't make all the changes anticipating poor weather, we just kept playing our playbook and that's what caused the issue. Again, it's temporary, we're taking the actions and we are all over it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein.","Indra Nooyi","Good morning Ali.","Ali Dibadj","Hey how are you? So, I actually have two questions. One is I really appreciate the conversation about responsible growth and push versus pull. So, I just really want to make sure that I'm understanding correctly that the tactics going forward to improve some of the slowdown in a NAB is not going to be major increase in promotion, it's not going to be lowering price mix. So, I just want to underline that point and make sure that's not part of the plan going forward.","And then related to that, second question, I guess I'm a little confused about the margin discussion that we've been having here. Because it sounds like we're saying there are bigger pies to go after, we're going to get more savings, more spending is going to be better. But we haven't really changed the $1 billion gross cost savings that we've been talking about for a very, very long time.","And that number hasn't changed, it's a very good number. But it feels like there's a gap between gross to net, right? So, this year, call it, 20 basis points of margin improvement, 30 basis points on the quarter, less obviously if you take away the NAB asset sale, if you take away the Britvic stake, et cetera, and you're saying you going to invest more back.","So, I guess long question as usual for the second one, but is that $1 billion gross savings going to go up so you're going to have to spend more back, so you're getting more margin expansion? Or are you going to have to -- are you just going to spend the same amount more efficiently? Because I'm just confused, the $1 billion number hasn't changed and I don't know if you're suggesting that's going to go up. So, thanks for the pricing question and just margin clarification for me, please.","Indra Nooyi","Well, I'm going to talk about the pricing question and then Hugh is going to give you a good answer on the rest of it. As I said, Ali, at least two or three times, and thank you for asking the question, we are focused on responsible growth. The goal is not to hit the promotional lever and try to just buy short-term volume. And that's the message that's been made very clear to our entire North American beverage Business, and Al and Kirk and the team are singularly focused on that.","So, you will see PepsiCo executing a very responsible strategy going forward, balancing push and pull spending so that it's profitable growth. In terms of productivity and the plans for cost reduction, Hugh, why don't you just provide the answer for that?","Hugh Johnston","Yes, happy to do that. I think, Ali, the confusion that you're experiencing is a result of timing. My comment earlier about we think there's a little bit more cost benefit is a way of explaining why the 9% EPS growth for this year.","Regarding the longer term, my broader points there around Smart Spending, where just that there's lots of productivity opportunity left out there. We're not making any changes to the long-term guidance, we're not making any changes to our long-term productivity targets and we're not talking about 2018 yet. I was really just offering some robustness to why we think we can continue to drive the productivity that we've already talked about. Hopefully that helps.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robert Ottenstein with Evercore ISI.","Indra Nooyi","Good morning Robert.","Robert Ottenstein","Great. Obviously, a lot of focus on the U.S. business. Could you give us a little bit more color on what's going on outside of the U.S.? And you gave us some broad-brush, but are you seeing, for instance in Brazil, some of the other markets, some underlying stabilization and improvement that would give perhaps some confidence going forward of an acceleration?","Indra Nooyi","Hugh, do you want to take that? So, let me give you some of the -- what we're seeing in some of the geographies. We're actually seeing a strong lift in European business. All of our business -- actually West and East Europe, we're seeing tremendous strength. All our businesses are doing well. We have a wonderful portfolio in the ESSA market. And we have the right marketing programs, the right pricing programs in place and that's why you're seeing such a stepped up growth rate in the ESSA market, both East Europe and Western Europe. And our Russia business in particular is doing very well, and so we feel very, very good about that.","In the Middle East, which is another big market for us, clearly this year we saw the impact of the lower oil price, the tax on CSDs, all of that went into place. Again, we have taken all the appropriate actions to implement more productivity, start to shift the product portfolio. And while we took a short-term shock to the system, we're coming out of that. And we think that the Middle East, North Africa still represents a very, very good market with lots of consumers is still in coming into the peak consumption years. So, we feel good about that market. The prospects for recovery in those markets are good.","As I look at China and the Asia-Pacific region, our business in China is doing well, especially our Snacks business is doing very well. Our Quaker business is doing exceedingly well in China. The team is a good team. Our e-commerce business is on fire in China and doubling in size every year. And it's becoming a learning lab for us to learn how to do e-commerce for the rest of the world, so we feel good about China.","The wonderful thing about the rest of Pacific Rim is that you've got many markets; all these little tigers are recording pretty good GDP growth. The markets may not be big as a China or India, but each of these markets contributes positively to our performance, and we've been doing well on those markets and gaining share in all of those markets. We have good bottling partners. Our own operating businesses are very good. Good leadership teams. Those businesses are doing well. We don't see much of a concern in those markets, even though they've gone through some political ups and downs.","In the South Asian subcontinent -- India, Pakistan, Nepal, Sri Lanka, we face the normal upheavals from GST, the demonetization -- or remonetization, I should say. We are through all that now. And hopefully the business will start to steadily recover in India. But Pakistan has been a big success story for us. We have a good business there and it's growing very nicely and profitably.","Latin America is a big question. We have strong businesses in Mexico and Brazil in Central America. Clearly, Latin America has gone through its share of geopolitical issues, and recently, the earthquakes have really had a devastating impact in Mexico; and the hurricanes that swept through the Caribbean and Puerto Rico have a really decimated those islands.","In spite of that, the teams have performed well. And our Brazil business is doing very well and our Mexico business is doing well across both Snacks and Beverages. So, in those markets, I would say we're holding in Latin America, doing exceedingly well in the ESSA region.","Our AMENA sector is, in spite of all the issues, coming back very nicely. North America is our core, and we remain positive about the North American business. Now and then, there will be a quarter where some business has a hiccup or a toast up. The resilience of our overall portfolio is what allows us to deliver the numbers we're delivering.","So, overall, we still feel quite confident about our prospects and we are buckling our seatbelts and saying, \"There will be geopolitical instability, there will be weather-related issues, we just have to build a portfolio that can weather that and somehow profit through and deliver the performance.\"","Operator","Our next question comes from Pablo Zuanic with SIG.","Indra Nooyi","Good morning Pablo.","Pablo Zuanic","Thanks for taking -- thanks Indra for taking the last question. Look, just two quick ones. One, I understand the idea with retailers who will try to get space back for CSDs, that it's a case of and, and not or. But when I see LaCroix in some targets having 30 feet of space and Coke and Pepsi each maybe five or six, I wonder how much is it about what you can do and about what the retailers and the consumer wants. So, if you can comment on this strategy, on the retailers, on the retail space, I find that it would face a lot of pushback from the retailers? And number two -- which maybe means you just have to double-down on non-CSDs, but that's the question.","And the second one, I know this is going back in time, but when you bought Wimm-Bill-Dann back then, you were talking about dealing a third leg with this big nutrition arm. And since then it's been -- it's become more about transforming the potato chips, to better nutrition and drinks and so on. Maybe you got -- things got changed because of [Indiscernible] back then, but is there -- is this a moment to maybe think about that third leg again? Thanks.","Indra Nooyi","Pablo, great question. First of all, we always get pushback from retailers and everything. I think the real thing is that from PepsiCo's perspective and DSD company, we have big brands and our brands have high velocity. So the combination of those three yields tremendous profitability for retailers. And clearly, some upside brands have come in and taken a lot of shelf space.","Our challenge is not to just say, \"Hey, give us more space for core CSDs,\" it's how do we provide the right innovation to go after those upstarts who are taking a lot of space. I tell you one of the issues I would say, and I take full responsibility for this, maybe in a couple of cases we were slow to respond to some of these newcomers who have taken a lot of space.","And believe me, we will fix that. And going forward, the agility and speed of response from our company will go up significantly. Sometimes when you have too many big brands and too much success under your belt, you lose a little bit on speed, and we are working to fix that.","So, I think you'll find that the retailers actually welcome the DSD suppliers to keep their shelves looking good going forward and that's what we provide with our beverage portfolio.","In terms of the third leg, we've tried to build it organically with success, Wimm-Bill-Dann was the last big acquisition we made, and except for the Russian ruble that went through its own share of challenges after we bought Wimm-Bill-Dann, coming out of that, the business has performed exceedingly well. It's an ideal portfolio.","I think what we have to be very, very careful about -- if we went off and built that third leg through acquisitions, we have to think hard whether they're shareholder value creating, what kind of a premium do you pay for any acquisition and how do we realize the benefits of that deal enough to offset the acquisition premium.","And believe me, the stuff we've looked at so far, we don't see a clear path to that. And so as we've said many, many times to all of you, we want to make sure that any major acquisition we may -- minor or major, I'm sorry; any acquisition we make has a clear path to value creation. And if we don't see that, we typically do not make the acquisition. We try to do things organically. It may take longer, but they create much more value over the long-term. Hugh, did you want to add anything on that?","Hugh Johnston","No, I think that was perfect.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Swartzberg with Stifel Financial.","Indra Nooyi","Mark good morning.","Mark Swartzberg","Hi Indra, good morning. Hi Hugh. Thanks for taking the question. Continuing this line of questioning on the algorithm, of course you're not going to give us an update. But I do wonder if we're seeing a bit of a prequel to how you'll keep delivering the algorithm, meaning it seems that productivity and cost savings are gaining importance. And while I think we all agree that 1.7% is not the right run rate, you're going to be do better than that. You did take your revenue growth for the year down to at least 3% before we had the third quarter. So, -- and you were doing 4s and 5s. So, is it right to think that you need to lean harder into productivity to get to the same outcome over a series of years to come?","Indra Nooyi","Don't know. Don't know, Mark. You know what I think with our revenue growth rate, they're still up there in the top performance in the Whole Food and Beverage space. And so it's an environment that requires us to modify our model, our innovation model, our retail, our outreach model. And you know what, when you go through these sorts of transformations and you're tweaking part of the business model, there will be issues along the way.","If we focus on the year and looked at our performance versus other people in the space, I think we stack up pretty well, both on the top and the bottom-line. And so will we lean harder on productivity, we will always lean harder on productivity, because we believe that we ought to take out any cost that is not value creating and put it back into investments in the business or flow it through to the bottom-line. And that has been our modus operandi.","So, productivity will always be paramount in PepsiCo. As we get better at it, we will keep doing more of it. But we're not taking our focus off of growing the topline. To us, growing the topline is really the right way to grow the company in a very, very balanced way.","So, we are redoubling our efforts to grow the topline. We're looking to see how to spend the A&M that we put out in a much more efficient way. To me, that's the Holy Grail. We all spend a lot of money on A&M, how do you spend it in an efficient way so we get the appropriate lift from the A&M?","But you know it's interesting times in the entire CPG world globally. And we have the size, scale, capabilities, the brands to be a very, very important player in this business and a top performer and that's what we're focused on maniacally.","And Mark let me just close by saying; personally, I'm completely committed to this company because 50 time my salary is in PepsiCo stock. And with that level of ownership, believe me, this is something Hugh and I focus on 24 hours a day.","Operator","Our next question comes from Caroline Levy with Macquarie.","Indra Nooyi","Good morning Caroline. Caroline, good morning.","Operator","Caroline your line is open.","Caroline Levy","Good morning. Can you hear me now?","Indra Nooyi","Yes, good morning Caroline.","Caroline Levy","Sorry. Thank you very much. I would really appreciate your take on the changing climate of retail, because that is on everybody's mind so much with Amazon buying Whole Foods. I know that you touched upon what's going on in your e-commerce business. But the other conversation that's raised its head is private label. And over many decades we've had this conversation about will it suddenly take off and become like Europe and the U.S. So, I'd really love your opinion as to what e-commerce and Amazon probably change that dynamic, because private levels really never succeeded in your categories.","Indra Nooyi","Yes, look even in Europe, our categories have had private label penetration, but not to the extent that many other HPC or other categories have had. Having said that, we are not complacent about any of this. Basically, I think, as we look forward, we're still looking at retailers, if they want to deliver margin growth in a period in which they're seeing price compression, they have a couple choices. They can do private label or they can get more efficient or they can get innovation to the stores from the big manufacturers that drive more traffic and velocity.","So, I think what could happen -- Caroline, this is just my perspective, is that you could see a bifurcation. You could see big brands, big companies taking the burden off of retailers through DSD and by bringing our own label into the store and driving more velocity and traffic through the big brands and innovation. And then you could see on the other end, a combination of small brands and private label that flanks it on the other side. What could be squeezed in the middle is sort of the mid-size brands.","Now, this is just my perspective, and we've been looking at all of this really hard. We think that could be a possible scenario going forward. So, from our perspective, doubling down on big brands, making sure innovation is -- making sure execution is perfect; our whole system is aligned, so when we have to make changes, we can do it fast.","And then within our company, making sure we have enough levers on productivity so we can get more and more efficient deploying automation and other tools to be able to put it back on innovation, driving the topline growth, whatever we have to do. I think that's going to be the game going forward.","As we said in the last call, this is going to be a period of brilliant disruption over the next three to five years and we're going to approach it with pessimism or optimism. We actually think this could be a time when a lot of competitor balances could be reset. And as perhaps the largest U.S. company in food and beverages and the second largest food and beverage company in the world, believe me, we will play an outsized role in this resetting of the competitive balance.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with J.P. Morgan.","Indra Nooyi","Good morning.","Andrea Teixeira","Good morning everyone. Thank you. Thank you for taking the questions. So, first on Frito, I think going back to Caroline's question and I think also boding into what your comments, but just curious how you're seeing your competitor -- any competitor reaction, because clearly you have been gaining share consistently there. And if you're seeing anything in terms of your DSD against one of your competitors kind of getting out of DSD, if you're seeing any potential reaction to that? Or are you sort of seeing that market share gains as secular and more resilient than before?","Indra Nooyi","Go ahead Hugh.","Hugh Johnston","Yes. I'm happy to answer that Andrea. I think what you see is more resilient rather than temporary. A lot what's happening right now with Frito-Lay is less driven by what competition is doing and just more driven by the fact that Frito-Lay is both running the core portfolio very well and innovating well around that portfolio with products like Stacy's and Smartfood and many of the premium products.","So, if you look at what's going to drive Frito-Lay's growth for the future, it's going to be continuing to execute that core portfolio and continuing to innovate premium and that will likely result in continued share gains over time, not anything that's happening competitively.","Indra Nooyi","So, thank you all for your questions. And let me just summarize by saying we are pleased with our year-to-date results for the third quarter with strong results across most of our sectors and we expect our topline performance to accelerate in Q4 as performance at NAB recovers.","And we're on track to deliver our fifth consecutive year of at least 9% core constant currency EPS growth. And we believe we are well positioned to continue to perform well over the long run.","As always, thank you for joining us this morning and for the confidence you have placed in us with your investment. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the PepsiCo third quarter 2017 earnings conference call.

And now, it's my pleasure to introduce Indra Nooyi.","Indra K. Nooyi","Thank you, Jamie, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us in person here today. My goal is to cover 5 topics this morning. I'm going to very briefly cover 2011 results and take a little journey back over the last 5 years and tell you what we've accomplished. And then we'll give you an overview of PepsiCo and outline our strategic priorities very briefly. We're then going to spend quite a lot of time reviewing the results for comprehensive review of our businesses that we recently completed. Then we'll provide you our financial outlook for 2012 and beyond, and then introduce to you a scorecard, which we will use to measure our progress. ","So with that, let me start with our 2011 performance. We issued our 2011 results this morning, and I'm not going to spend too much time going into details except to tell you that 2011 on balance was a good year. Snacks volume grew about 8%. Beverages volume grew about 5%. Net revenue was up 14%, and both core division operating profit and core EPS grew 7%. ","We had broad-based gains in snack and beverage volume and net revenue. And we were able to achieve net price realization that partially offset the extraordinary commodity inflation we faced. More importantly, in 2011, we made disciplined investments in the business to generate long-term growth. We drove productivity through cost management. And more importantly, we were able to offset the impact in some of our markets, our skittish economy, natural disasters and political unrest with gains from some selective disposals of noncore businesses. ","And of course, we benefited from the acquisition of Wimm-Bill-Dann, which is a critical addition to our Russia business that further strengthened our already strong position in this key developing market. Importantly, we also continue to generate strong cash flow. Management operating cash flow exceeded $6 billion. And as a result, we were able to return $5.6 billion in cash to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.","So that's 2011. For 2011 really caps a 5-year performance that delivered core net revenue compounded growth rate of 13%, core operating profit growth of 9% and core EPS growth of 8%. This performance also drove terrific cash returns. Dividends per share grew at 12% annually. And our cash return to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases totaled $30 billion over the past 5 years. ","This is the financial scorecard. What's not evident from the 5-year financial performance is the incredible transformation that took place in PepsiCo during the same time. When I came into the CEO job in late 2006, I realized that PepsiCo had to make some bold transformative moves to remain successful well into the future. Because most the tailwinds of the first part of the decade were not going to be around in the second half, and in fact some of them became headwinds in the second half of the decade, so we got to work. ","Starting in 2007, we began to scale up our emerging and developing market business. In fact, our emerging and developing markets revenues went from $8 billion in 2006 to $22 billion in 2011, with the mix increasing from 22% of revenues to 34% of the revenues over that same time frame. ","Over that period, we also addressed a number of business issues that faced us. First, we had to reconfigure our North American bottling operation in order to address the serious structural issues of not having an integrated bottling operation in this increasingly diversifying but slow growth liquid refreshment beverage market. We had to restate the Gatorade brand and return it to growth, following significant volume declines in 2007 to 2009. Then we had to restructure and refranchise our Mexican beverage operation to create a single entity with capable partners so that we can restore that business to growth. ","And then to kickstart the China business to a level -- beverage business to a level that was higher than the past, we refranchised our business to Tingyi, which is now in the midst of government approval. And with this partnership, I think we really take our whole China beverage growth to a whole new level.","I think all of this creates tremendous vehicles for sustainable profit growth across many of our markets. But beyond that, we also increased our investment in R&D by 50%, boosting our core capabilities and making substantial talent additions and partnership investments in areas such as advanced retail technology; packaging, where we came out with the first 100% plants derived bottle; and equipment innovation, where we're going to be alpha testing a very exciting food service beverage dispenser in 2012.","In 2007 to '11 period, we also significantly expanded the health and wellness offerings of our portfolio. And I know some of you have expressed some concern, whether the pendulum swung too far in the direction and whether we took our eye off the core offerings. What I'd like to tell you is that, the direct answer is this is an and game not an or game. We have to focus on both growing the core, which is the Fun-for-You products and the Better-for-you products and step up our investment in Good-for-You products. And I assure you that, that's what we've done and we'll continue doing. So let me provide some context on what we've done in the whole health and wellness space.","First, we increased the permissibility of our core salty-snack and beverage products by reducing sodium, frying them in heart-healthy oils, using natural ingredients and reducing sugar and reducing calories. The second thing we did was dialing up the sales of our baked products and snacks and 0-calorie beverages, which is really capitalizing on a sustainable consumer trend. And the third thing we did was focus significant attention resources on our Good-for-You businesses to make sure that we're fully capitalizing on their global growth potential.","In North America, for example, we've been very successful in restoring momentum to Gatorade. We've made good progress with Tropicana. And the next one we have to address is Quaker Oats, especially North America. Internationally, we've had strong double-digit growth over the past 5 years for both Tropicana and Quaker, and we've expanded this well through juice and dairy acquisitions. ","Importantly, we've targeted resources working on nutrition platforms globally, the benefits of which we will start seeing over the next few years. As a result of these efforts, we've enhanced our core offerings and our Good-for-You portfolio. And the Good-for-You part has now increased its share in our portfolio from 17% to 20% of our revenue over the past 5 years. So that's our narrative on our product shift.","But the other thing we did over the last 5 years was continue our investment in SAP. And we did that without taking any chance to the P&L. We just kept investing because we believe that we had to really fix the technology base of the company, so that we can have more opportunities for productivity improvement. ","And beyond financial investments, we made a major commitment to start shifting the culture of the company. The first thing we did was put in place an organization structure that leverages the scale of PepsiCo in a much more substantial way. And I believe the change was absolutely necessary. Because with this shift, we've gone from decentralized silos, decentralized regional silos, to what I would call now as much more of a connected autonomy structure. ","And if you look at the chart, the primacy of the P&L still stays with the regions, the geographies. And that's the fundamental principle of PepsiCo. But we\u2019ve begun to connect important elements of the enterprise to much more effectively leveraged ideas, capabilities and scale across the globe.","But this organization shift was just one piece of the culture change. We began to address other aspects of our culture we just absolutely had to change. We're evolving from being developed market dominant to having a truly global mindset in the company. We're also moving from a trade spending push model of selling to a more balanced push\/pull model of both marketing and selling. ","The other change is that emerging markets in the first part of the decade used to largely be a pay-as-you-go approach. But it doesn't work for emerging and developing markets, which take a lot of time to build. So over the past 5 years, we made deliberate choices to step up our investments in key emerging markets because, I think, it's absolutely necessary to fully capitalize on the growth opportunities and keep PepsiCo growing well into the future. ","And lastly, over the last 5 years, we started to change our talent development process from a traditional model, which has been very effective for us, to a more strategic approach to build, buy and bond talent to the company. We have tremendous talent within PepsiCo, and we're absolutely committed to developing the talent. But it's also important to note, that as we implement some of the changes in the company into our portfolio, we need experienced people with different skills to help us navigate through this new volatile environment so that we can remain a growth company. ","And I want to mention to you that the portfolio changes, the transformation, the culture changes, all of these changes were affected in a difficult macro environment. So on balance, I believe we've done many of the right things over the past 5 years to improve the business and position for sustained growth and attractive financial results for years to come. ","Now let me be clear on one thing. I'm not suggesting we executed everything perfectly over the last 5 years. Could we have done something differently or better? Sure. So we've gone back and looked at every one of our decisions and said, what could we have done differently? ","Let me give you some of these things that I think we could have done differently. First, I think we could have used the synergies from the bottling acquisition to invest more in growing the top line rather than committing to flow it through to the bottom line. Second, I wish we had stepped up our overall brand support, especially in North American beverages earlier. Third, had we anticipated the commodity volatility that we saw in 2010, 2011 and going into 2012, we could have gone after productivity much more aggressively sooner to help cushion some of those commodity cost increases. ","I also think some of the people moves that I made perhaps could have been made a bit earlier so that we could have gotten on with this program faster. And lastly, I think we could have done a better job establishing performance expectations with you, our investors, at a level that we could absolutely deliver on. And I think some of these topics, addressed earlier or more effectively, would have resulted in even better operating performance. And as a result, better stock price performance, an area that I know has been frustrating for many of you in this room in this morning. ","And to be honest, the reason I didn't take some of these resets earlier is because a CEO gets a chance to make a reset once every 10 years. And you only make a major reset when you have a clean line of sight to bounce back. And I didn't feel I had that clean line of sight the last 5 years. We have it now, and that's why we're doing it today. And that's why, today, as you see in the press release, we are taking clear actions right now to step up brand investment, increase productivity, reduce capital spending and improve shareholder returns. ","So as we pause to look at PepsiCo today, I think we are extremely well positioned. We generate $66 billion in annual revenue. We're the second largest food and beverage business globally. We have operating margins of 16%. We have net ROIC of 17%, and we have return on equity of 31%.","Our mission for the company is clear and focused. We want to captivate consumers with the world's most loved and best-tasting convenient foods and beverages. And we feel confident in our ability to deliver on this mission, based on the significant structure and capability advantages that we possess as a company. ","We compete in categories with attractive growth, margins and returns, whether it's snacks, beverages or the nutritional category, because all of these categories have global growth of 5% or more. Our core businesses of convenient foods and beverages are highly complementary. They share not only common consumers and customers, but they also share resources and capabilities like agro sourcing, R&D capabilities, packaging, flavoring, go-to-market systems, finance, HR talent and all the G&A functions. ","And I think our businesses will continue to benefit from global mega trends like on-the-go lifestyle, a rapidly growing middle class in emerging and developing markets and consumer seeking a repertoire of products that spans Fun-for-You to Good-for-You. We have a very broad and powerful brand portfolio that connects with consumers, including 22 iconic billion-dollar brands, a number that's doubled in the past 11 years. And these brands span everything from Fun-for-You to Good-for-You, and all of our brands are typically #1 or #2 in their respective categories. ","I don't know if you know this little factoid, but Lay's is the #1 global food brand. Lay's is the #1 global food brand. And Pepsi, as you well know, is the #2 global beverage brand. We also have a truly global footprint with trends in more than 150 countries. And as I mentioned earlier, we have a $22 billion emerging market business. And we have tremendous go-to-market reach, which is largely enabled by our DSD systems, which have been developed over many, many decades. And they're all tailored to suit local market dynamics, so that we can efficiently and effectively reach millions of points of sale everyday and billions of end consumers. ","And we leverage all of these strengths to deliver against our 5 strategic priorities, which we've been focused on for the past several years. To build and extend macrosnacks globally. As most of you know, we have a 10x relative market share in salty snacks globally and we are growing the core or extending towards adjacencies. We just keep growing this macrosnack business. ","Secondly, we are the #2 player in beverages globally. And our goal is to sustainably and profitably grow this beverage business worldwide. Third, we have 3 of the top brands in health and wellness. And we're going to leverage these brands in the health and wellness category momentum to grow this Nutrition business. The fourth strategic priority is to leverage the coincidence of consumption between snacks and beverages and capitalize on this cross category presence to grow our scale in individual countries. And lastly, we will manage the financial results and position of this company in a prudent and responsible way.","These strategic priorities have not changed over the several years, and we will remain focused on them going forward. Taken together, we believe our mission, the strength of our portfolio and strategic priorities will enable us to generate top-tier financial results for our investors over the long term. Revenue growth in the mid-single digits. We expect balanced growth between Fun-for-You, Better-for-You, Good-for-You. And this growth will be predominantly organic. And we expect to continue to benefit from an increasing emerging and developing market presence. And this portfolio translates to high-single digit earnings per share growth, with increasing margins and return on capital and leads to free cash flow growing in line with net income. Which in turn, enables strong cash returns to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. ","So the key question that U.S. investors have asked us is, can this portfolio generate these kinds of returns on an ongoing basis? And that's what prompted us to undertake a comprehensive review of our business. We looked at every aspect of our portfolio and operating practices. And what I'd like to do is to share with you the scope, findings and the go-forward actions, now that the review is complete.","So the first area we examined was our portfolio. We began with a question that's been speculated upon a lot in the recent months. Should PepsiCo split its snack and beverage businesses? And the overriding finding from our portfolio analysis is that PepsiCo's value is maximized as one company. Because the current structure, there's 3 things. ","First, it provides compelling cross leverage across the value chain from an R&D, procurement, consumer insight, sales, merchandising, back-office functions. It provides compelling scale and cost leverage. "," Second, it enables us to accelerate in-market growth. Because in market, we benefit from the coincidence of snack and beverage consumption occasions. We benefit from the commonality of consumer and the opportunity to cross-merchandise and promote our products. But in emerging markets, in particular, our Snacks business benefits massively from the scale of our Beverage business, which can be scaled up very quickly. And without the presence of our Beverage businesses, our ability to establish and grow Snacks businesses in emerging markets would be significantly reduced. It will take much more time and require a significant amount more of investment. That's the second reason. ","The third reason is that, our operation as one company, enables us to share capabilities across geographies and sectors and allows us to attract better talent. This is important everywhere in the world, but particularly in emerging and developing markets where the combined scale of our 2 businesses helps us be the preferred company to work for. ","I can tell you that in emerging markets, and I travel there all the time, Pepsi is such an iconic brand that young people want to come to work for Pepsi. You bring them into Pepsi and a little while later, you put them into Lay's and Coqueiro and those products. So that's the virtuous circle how it works. ","We estimate that simply on the cost side of the equation, the benefits of having an integrated company are somewhere between $800 million to $1 billion, primarily related to in-country G&A, procurement, share distribution and infrastructure, corporate G&A and financing costs. And this does not take into account the profitability associated with top line synergies. And it does not factor in the massive disruption that would surely occur if we try to separate these 2 businesses. ","So net-net, based on this exhaustive analysis we undertook as a management team with external advisors, with the involvement of our Board of Directors, we are absolutely convinced that PepsiCo's value is maximized as one company. Well, we didn't stop there. We expanded our portfolio review to dig deeper into our portfolio of countries and businesses. And we asked ourselves the question, what is the performance trajectory of the individual businesses in countries and how can we sustain or improve well-performing businesses? And what can we do to fix the few underperforming business we have? And we looked at what additional options exist to strengthen the portfolio and the optimal portfolio configuration to maximize shareholder value.","And to answer all of these questions, we mapped our businesses across 2 dimensions: margin and growth performance. With performance relative to each businesses respective market and whether the business was related to our mission. And what we found is that, for the most part, our businesses are highly related to our mission and are generally performing well. So this chart shows how our division operating profit falls across these dimensions. ","75% of our profit comes from businesses highly related to our mission, and performing very well. Noncore businesses comprise a relatively small percentage of the overall portfolio, about 5%. And these are well-performing businesses. The gray box down there represents less than 1% of our profit. And we have largely addressed these opportunities, and I'll tell you what they are. And that leaves 20% that are related to the mission, but with some opportunity to improve their growth and\/or margins. ","And we are absolutely clear on what needs to be done in each of these quadrants. High-performing rate of business will be sustained, invested in and supported. Higher performing but unrelated business will be managed judiciously and they'll be divested, only if it makes financial sense. Because most of them contribute positively to our returns and cash flow. Lower-performing unrelated businesses should be divested, and will be divested. And low-performing related businesses will be operationally improved to drive better growth and return with clear timetables for improvement. And if the underperformance cannot be addressed operationally, then we will seek structural solutions to improve return or reduce our exposure.  And this quadrant is clearly a major area of focus for us. ","So let me give you examples of how our businesses mapped across these quadrants. Clearly, on the upper left, you see Frito-Lay North America, our Quaker, Tropicana, Gatorade businesses, many of our international beverage and snack businesses. On the upper right, you'll find some of our central store food businesses, which are pretty small compared to the size of our portfolio. And while they don't really relate to our Convenience mandate, they are prolific cash generators with very high returns, and will be dilutive to our returns and earnings under any divestiture scenario that we want. ","In our lower right box, there are a couple of very small businesses, Kretschmer Wheat Germ, Coqueiro, our fish business in Brazil, and they've all been divested now. Finally, in the lower left, we find a couple of our emerging market beverage businesses, our North American DSD Beverage business and some emerging markets snacks businesses. And we're making great progress in addressing each of these businesses. ","One of the businesses that was in this box was Mexico beverages. By refranchising it and creating a very strong entity with 2 highly capable beverage partners, I believe we've addressed the Mexico beverage underperformance issue. In China, the growth of the market is explosive. Our growth was explosive, but we needed a partner to really kickstart this growth. ","We now have a transaction with Tingyi pending. Tingyi will be our franchisee, it's pending regulatory approval, and will create an anchor bottle in China that will really help PepsiCo take its Beverage business to a whole new level. We have a few snack businesses in emerging markets, where I believe the natural growth of these businesses will improve the results and the operating margins of those businesses. That leaves the North American DSD business, DSD Beverage business, which accounts for a lion's share of the profits in this quadrant. ","So I want to set the context for North American DSD beverages. It's a large highly profitable category, North American beverages. It's important to retailers because of its ability to generate shopper traffic, and because it's profitable and an excellent cash-generator even to retailers. As PepsiCo, we have a very good competitive position with the #1 share of the liquid refreshment beverage category in retail. And most importantly, we own 3 of the top 5 LRB trademarks with Pepsi, Mountain Dew and Gatorade. And with Mountain Dew, we have the fastest growing major CSD trademark in the industry. ","However, there are some issues. Category growth has been challenging. The marketplace is intensely competitive. Commodity inflation and volatility have made this market that much more difficult. And let's not forget, we do face a competitor who's emerged from a major reset that they undertook between 2004 and 2008. And I will tell you, between 2007 and 2010, we did lose some market share. Recently, our share trends have begun to improve, but we are not happy with the pace of improvement and recognized the need to accelerate progress. One of the reasons we brought the bottlers back is because we wanted to address the share issue in this business. ","So against this backdrop, we are totally committed to actions to improve both the growth and returns of our North American Beverage business. So what are we going to do? We are going to significantly step up our A&M support to reengage consumers with our terrific brand, focusing on our most important brands to drive the maximum impact from our investment. And you know what's interesting? Over the last 5 years, North American A&M did not decline, but the spending was supporting too many brands and was spread across too many agencies. We allowed nonworking A&M to squeeze out working A&M. So we went to work and we cleaned house. We've reduced agency relationships in North American beverage from 150 to about 50. So it's not just a step up in A&M. The impact of shifting nonworking A&M to A&M will be significant and this whole A&M spending will be amplified. ","We're also accelerating our innovation across product and package with a very special focus on revenue management. For example, Pepsi NEXT is a great example of leading the market in product innovation. And thanks to the investments we made in long-term sweetener technology. We are launching a product that delivers the great taste of Pepsi with 60% less sugar. We're also going to step up our package innovation. And great examples that will drive our revenue management agenda are the 24-ounce Dew can, which will drive further growth of this $1 billion brand into new location. And the Starbucks Refreshers launch in the 12-ounce slim can. Grab a can of that Mountain Dew as you leave and the Refreshers are out there in the lobby. ","We're also going to capitalize on the food service opportunity, especially local and regional food service. As many of you know, this was an area where we had a structural disadvantage, relative to our largest competitor, prior to our acquisition of the bottlers. We've made the appropriate changes, and we're making good progress in food service. ","We're also dialing up our excellence in execution by shifting distribution systems that will improve performance. A good example of that was moving Gatorade to DSD in small format. But we're not stopping there. We're looking for other opportunities to leverage the right distribution system for the right product. We're also going to use our snack business to drive greater frequency of coincidence of consumption. And linked to our overall productivity efforts, we are stepping up productivity to improve margins and create additional funding for future investment. ","We intend to take out about $500 million to $600 million in costs to the North American Beverage business by 2014. We're also accelerating R&D in key breakthrough areas like low-cost natural sweeteners, more packaging innovation and food service equipment innovation. So a lot is happening in North American beverages, all focused on one thing: to hold or increase value share in this market. ","And while we work through these operational improvements, we are simultaneously exploring structural options to jump shift PepsiCo's returns on capital that's deployed into this business. So that's a summary of the overall portfolio look that we undertook. ","While our operational review of the last 6 months went beyond a high level portfolio analysis, and really took a deep dive on the supporting fundamentals that drive our business. We know that success for PepsiCo is dependent on world-class brand building and innovation. It's dependent on excellence in execution every day and every moment of truth, achieving the right cost structure and the optimal capital structure and most importantly, being a great place to work. ","We went through and looked at how we stack up against each of these requirements. And let me walk you through the conclusions of our review on each of these items, what we found and what we'll be doing as a result. On brand management. In PepsiCo, our marketing approach has historically been highly decentralized with each country introducing brands as needed. To prove the point, it may surprise you that we have more than 400 brands in our portfolio, and this brand proliferation over the years has diluted the incrementality of our initiatives. ","And there's no point stepping up the A&M investment if it's going to be fragmented across 400 brands. So we knew there was a consolidation opportunity here. So as a result of our deep dive, we'll be refocusing and streamlining our brand portfolio, sharpening their positioning with consumers, herding a lot of the new innovations of the big brands and slowly start shifting volumes from the tail of the portfolio to the core brand portfolio. ","We're going to invest and drive growth behind 12 mega brands: Pepsi, Dew, Sierra Mist, 7Up in international markets, Gatorade, Tropicana, Mirinda, Lay's, Doritos, Cheetos, Lipton, Quaker and the Sun brand. These 12 brands will have aligned positioning globally. They'll have consistent campaigns and scaled innovation platforms. ","For example, we'll be launching the first global Pepsi campaign in the summer of this year with common iconography, a common approach and common positioning. The first global Pepsi campaign in PepsiCo's history. We're also stepping up our investment, our A&M investment, behind these 12 brands by $500 million to $600 million in 2012, which represents about a 15% increase. And because North America is such a large market, it will receive a disproportionate share of this increased funding. ","And while we are increasing the A&M, we're also streamlining our agency relationships. Today, we have about 300 relationships with strategic vendors across the globe. And we're looking to reduce that number by more than half, driving greater efficiency of spend. But spend is one thing. We're also instituting joined performance metrics with our partners. And we're implementing a pay-for-performance model, which makes sure that we get the best talents and agencies devoted to PepsiCo's businesses. ","So what all of this will do is allow us to shift more of our overall A&M from nonworking A&M to working A&M, which means reduce what we spend on production costs and agency fees to actually consumer facing A&M. And this target of shift of spending to more working A&M will add considerably to the brand presence consumers will feel, than just the $500 million to $600 million in incremental spending. ","And beyond just the spending increase and the shifting of A&M, we've developed one common way to measure brand equity across the world. And our goal is to track the brand equity evolution of each of these global brands regularly and intervene, when appropriate, to make sure we hold or increase the brand equity with our overall consumers in every one of the key countries in the world. And that was all the brand work we did. ","The next area that we reviewed was innovation. And innovation is our lifeblood, we need that to keep growing. But as we dug deep into innovation, no surprise to you, the consumer environment has changed radically. Retail shelf space is scarce. Consumers have become more demanding. Competition has intensified, especially with the emergence of pure-play competitors fragmenting the market a lot. ","PepsiCo is a prolific innovator. And there's a lot about our innovation that we should feel great about and you should admire. IRI consistently ranks us as a leader in innovation in their center [ph] report. And in 2011 alone, we have 11 of the 15 top-selling items in C-stores, and a lot of them were new products that came into the market in 2010 and '11. ","But the problem is that, yes, we are a prolific innovator, but the staying power of this innovation can be much better. Some of it relates to the quality of the innovation. Sometimes it also relates to our lack of patience and a bit of Darwinian mindset that's engendered by the DSD go-to-market system. So as we sat back and looked at all of our innovation, we realized that something had to change in what we were doing in PepsiCo. We don't believe we are delivering enough incremental innovation. And we can do better. So we are rebalancing our approach. ","We have now set very specific goals for 3 innovation types: refresh innovation, which is mostly line extensions; reframe innovations; and breakthrough innovations. And our goal is to drive a higher mix of reframe and breakthrough, which have the potential of being a lot more incremental. ","So examples of reframe innovation would be Trop50. Which has brought back users into the juice category who left the category because of the high calories of juice. And Tostitos Scoops. We've solved the issue of getting dip on your tie or dress when you eat a regular Tostitos. An example of breakthrough innovation would be products based on the work we're doing with natural 0-calorie sweeteners. Our belief is that, when that commercializes, which I hope is pretty soon, it will really start reframing the carbonated soft drink category. ","And to enable all of this, we've improved the stage gate process to allow for greater incubation of new products. And we're doing one more thing, we are leveraging a Frito-Lay North America best practice. They have something called a new growth ventures model. They incubate products in a second distribution system and it reaches a certain size, bringing it in to DSD if necessary. We're going to lift and shift that idea to North American beverages, because I believe we have a lot of great innovation which are smaller volume and tend to die in the DSD system if you put it in there right away. So we're going to incubate it into a second distribution system in PepsiCo and then bring it into DSD. ","More importantly, the fact that we've now created a horizontal structures with the global groups is enabling the creation and development of more innovation platforms, as opposed to products. And we're also able now to lift and shift ideas across the globe, so we don't keep repeating what we're doing country after country. ","And the other amazing thing is in somewhat of a role reversal. We're explicitly taking innovation from our developing market, especially their great work on value innovation and bringing it back to the developed markets. Stila Bars and Quaker cookies from Mexico is one example of a developing market innovation that's being launched very successfully in North America. ","The last thing we've done on innovation is we restructured our relationships with our consumer insights providers. And what we've told them is we're going to pay for insight, not data. So we've given them specific questions, and we want them to answer those questions, as opposed to just buying data and allowing us to troll for it. ","So our priorities here are to drive higher top line, get better price realization but most importantly, increase our value share. And that's the result of our brand and innovation look. ","Let me turn to the third area we looked at in great detail, which is our execution. Some of you asked in the reports you wrote or in meetings we've had with you, whether we've lost our execution edge especially here in North America. I would say no, but we went back and looked at it in great detail anyway. Generally speaking, this is an area where we are very good at. And in many cases, I'll argue we have best-in-class execution. ","Frito-Lay North America in particular is awesome at execution. But we have to push the boundaries and not just be complacent that we're very good. And we also have to learn to share best practices across the company. So in the case of our North American bottling, this is going to be a renewed area of focus having just spent the last 2 years with an appropriate focus on getting the integration complete and delivering against the synergy targets. ","And we know there's a lot of best practice sharing that can go on between North American bottling and Frito-Lay, both ways. So our execution focus going forward has several elements. In terms of driving inventory share in the store, our Beverage business as one company is beginning to align marketing and sales to one set of programs on promotional inventory. ","In terms of ensuring perfect orders and on-time delivery, our Beverage business will be creating a centralized dispatch headquarters in order to use sophisticated dynamic routing algorithms currently being used by Frito-Lay to improve service levels and reduce costs. And in terms of new product execution, our Beverage business will start to deploy Frito-Lay's industry-leading tools to ensure disciplined store-level execution and tracking of all new products. ","And these programs respond directly to the measures most important to our customers, and they have the highest correlation to increasing sales. We're also going to leverage data we've collected for our top accounts across both snacks and beverages to drive continuous improvement, and perhaps stimulate some healthy internal competition to ensure that we're best in class in this critical area. ","And the last thing we're going to be doing on execution is driving and tracking coincidence of purchase between snacks and beverages. We have told you many times that our snacks and beverages are highly complementary and are consumed and purchased together. For example, 30% of CSD shopper occasions include salty-snack purchase and 30% of salty-snack purchases include a CSD. So the opportunity for PepsiCo is tremendous as we drive incremental core purchases. And every point of additional share is worth $120 million in retail sales. So we intend to exploit this coincidence a lot more. ","Finally, now that we have food service in our control, we are increasing our push on gaining both local and regional food service accounts. And in 2011, we had real progress. We gained 2 points of market share in food service. I mean, that's a lot on this business. We converted key accounts from our primary competitor Papa John's, Chuck E. Cheese, Tim Horton, to name a few. And most importantly, we achieved a 98% contract renewal rate for our existing customers. ","We launched new product innovations in food service. For example, oatmeal in McDonald's and Burger King and culinary innovation at Taco Bell via Fritos Burritos. I hope you've had a chance to enjoy the product. And we acquired 35,000 new food service accounts, as a result of expanding the use of broad line distributors to secure new local and regional beverage accounts and all of our field acquisition efforts. ","So let me assure you, if you had any doubt, execution excellence is what we are about, what we're really good at and we will ensure that we drive ourselves and each other to be best in class uniformly. And that's execution.","Now let me turn to the whole area of cost and productivity, which is another area that we spent a lot of time on as part of this operating review. PepsiCo's always been known to be a highly productive and cost-efficient company, and we aggressively manage our cost year in and year out. We know that we're in a new environment with tremendous macroeconomic volatility, including commodity cost volatility. So we knew that we had to get even more productive to create the breathing room to deliver our numbers. So let's just take a quick look at our cost structure. ","About 29% of the cost structure's raw commodities, a little over 5% is A&M and 50% is manufacturing and SG&A excluding A&M, which results in this operating profit of 16% of revenues. Our goal is to increase that operating profit number. So let me just walk you through each of the pieces. ","From a commodity cost standpoint, the way we manage risk is through systematic forward buying so that we can get more cost certainty and increase cost visibility. But we're going to keep reviewing our commodity procurement approach to make sure that we have the optimal balance between risk management and visibility. ","On A&M, we're going to grow it from 5.2% of sales to 6% of revenues by 2015. And in 2012, with the increase in A&M, it'll actually go up to 5.7% of sales. So the focus then is on this 50%, the big bucket. Our goal over the next 3 to 4 years is to take out 250 to 300 basis points of cost from this bucket. ","And today we announced a 3-year plan to double our ongoing productivity, which will generate over $1 billion in cost savings in 2012 and $3 billion by 2014. And $1.5 billion of the $3 billion is incremental productivity versus our historical run rate. These productivity initiatives are multifunction, cross sector, and they're going to be delivering benefits throughout the entire value chain. ","Our plan will become the new norm for PepsiCo by creating an ongoing global productivity culture. And this productivity program just didn't happen. It's been months of efforts across people, across the world, across all of our businesses involving all of the functions, all of the businesses, all of the sectors. We are taking actions to significantly reduce our G&A by implementing simplified organization structures. We're going to wider spans of control, fewer layers of management with consolidating facilities. We are accelerating the development and deployment of global projects impacting our products, packaging, manufacturing, transportation, how we grew our various factories and much more. ","We set up a global operations group. And that's been a critical unlock, because they've been able to coordinate all of these new ideas and facilitate the lift and shift of current best practices across all of our businesses. And we have a program management office to track each of these initiatives, monitor progress, manage priorities, review achievements, identify key risks and develop mitigation plan for the global leadership team. ","A critical aspect of this program is a focus on increasing operational productivity into 3 key areas of make, move and sell. And what we plan to do here is to drive world-class efficiencies through the deployment and execution of what we call global playbooks. Because these global playbooks are targeted to positively impact areas such as yield, change over times, labor and asset utilization across geographies and key lines of businesses. ","Now as I mentioned to you the financial results of all of this work is that, we're going to take our 250 to 300 basis points of operating cost over the next 3 years. Now these productivity efforts will impact about 8,700 associates worldwide. Let me tell you the most difficult part of this whole productivity program has been the fact that we have to take out people. It's never easy when we have to take out people from the organization. The 8,700 people represent about 3% of our workforce. And we have to make these tough choices if we are to create the breathing room to keep reinvesting in the company. ","And the other thing we did, just to give you comfort, is that we were very careful to make sure that we were not impacting the core operations of the business in taking out these people. We looked very carefully to make sure that we had all of the right functions, staffed with the right people and have the right resources so that we can keep the growth of the company going in the future. ","Well, we didn't stop just with productivity and the P&L. We also looked at capital productivity. Over the last 5 years, CapEx has been about 5.5% of revenue. For 2012, we've reduced CapEx to 4.5% of net revenues. Now some of you might say, \"Oh, you must have just cut it.\" Now we reduced it. We took a very granular approach to understand where the capacity was in the organization, where the underutilization was, how can we get lower capital into emerging markets so that we can match capital cost with the economies, of the economics of that marketplace. So we took a very granular look at our capital, and that's what allowed us to cut the CapEx into 2012. And our goal beyond 2012 is to run our business with the CapEx level of about 5% of net sales. ","But it's not just capital expenditures, we're also looking at working capital. We believe we do a pretty good job with our cash conversion cycle. But again, as we looked at our cash conversion cycle in a lot more granularity, we think there's improvement in our days in inventory, DSO and DPO days. And we think there's an opportunity to reduce this whole cash conversion cycle by 10%, which will actually generate about $200 million of cash annually, incremental cash. ","And to institutionalize capital productivity in the company, we will implement an EVA approach at the operating unit level, an economic value-added approach at the operating unit level, so each of our businesses can see the direct cost of the capital they deploy, whether it's normal capital expenditures or tuck-in acquisitions they propose. This is going to be part of our ongoing performance management system, and all of these efforts are designed to increase management operating cash flow and improve ROIC. ","Finally, let me turn to last and most important part of our operating review, which is our organization and people. We looked at every aspect of the company in terms of morale, succession, organizational structure. We looked at everything. And let me start by telling you that PepsiCo is, and will always remain, an academy company. We are a highly desirable place to work. And in fact, according to the Chief Executive Magazine, we just moved up on the list of leadership companies from #17 to 7. And we've been named the Fortune's Top 10 Companies for Leaders.","But as a company we don't just rest on those laurels. We actually assess the morale of the company every year because we conduct an annual organization health survey, which we then augment with a midyear pulse survey, just to get a sense for how people are feeling. And then we compare it on a cross-sectional basis across the company over years. We look at it by function, across genders, ethnicities, and we benchmark ourselves against the peer group of companies who conduct similar org health surveys. ","I'm pleased to report to you that our org health survey results show that by and large, we are doing better than the peer group, and the basic morale of the organization is pretty good. So from an organization perspective, we feel good about where we are. ","From a succession perspective, for the top 200 roles in the company, we have a 5 deep bench. We identify people who can fill the job if somebody is hit by a bus, ready in 1 to 2 years or ready in 3-plus years. And coming out of this exercise, we have identified 500 high-potential executives who we are going to -- we've developed 10-year development plan for them and we're going to accelerate their progress with the company. ","Let me briefly touch on CEO succession. CEO succession at PepsiCo started day 1, when I became CEO. We've updated our Board of Directors every year and we provide midyear updates, as necessary, on this topic of CEO succession. This is very much on top of my priority list, has been since 2006. And I believe we have outstanding leaders running each of our major businesses who are all CEO capable. So from an organization perspective, from a people perspective, succession perspective, we feel very good about where we are. ","So that was the summary of our detailed operational review and a look at all the drivers of our performance. Once again, based on this very detailed look, we are comfortable with our long-term targets, grow revenues in mid-single digits, deliver high-single digit EPS growth, grow free cash flow in line with net income and deliver attractive cash returns to our shareholders. ","This performance will be balanced across our geographies and our categories. And as you can see, we plan to do a lot of things differently in 2012 and going forward. We're going to increase A&M spend by $500 million to $600 million, and total marketplace spend by $600 million to $700 million. We're going to focus our brands, reduce the numbers of agencies and strategic partnerships we have. We're going to focus on improving brand equity for our key brands, and you're going to start seeing stepped-up innovation levels in the marketplace.","We will deliver incremental productivity of over $500 million this year and a total of $1.5 billion of incremental productivity over the next 3 years. We will reduce CapEx to 4.5% of net revenue, which is about $300 million lower than it was in 2011 while still growing the top line. ","We'll generate more than $6 billion of management operating cash flow and return $3.3 billion in dividends, which is about $100 million increase over 2011, and we'll repurchase at least $3 billion in shares, which is an increase of about $600 million over 2011. And we'll do all this while navigating through incremental commodity costs -- or additional commodity costs of $1.5 billion. ","Finally, in terms of operating and reporting transparency, historically, we provided you data on Pepsi Americas Foods, Pepsi Americas Beverages Europe and EMEA. Going forward, we will provide additional data on global snacks and global beverages. And within that, we will provide you top line numbers volume revenue on our global nutrition business also. ","So that's the comprehensive summary of our operating review, the findings, and what we're going to do differently going forward. With that, let me turn it over to Hugh Johnston to talk in detail about 2012 and go through all of the financial information. Thank you.","Hugh F. Johnston","Great. Thank you, Indra, and good morning, everyone. As discussed earlier, 2012 is a year of transition with EPS down 5% on a core constant-currency basis. As we compare 2012 to our high single-digit long-term growth targets, there are several key drivers for this gap. I'll cover them briefly here, and then we'll look at each individually. ","First, we face another year of higher-than-normal commodity inflation driven by the lag effect of our forward-buying program. This negatively impacts our EPS growth by 9 points. Second, the extraordinary investments we are making in the marketplace, both A&M and to a lesser degree in racks and routes, drives another 8 points of EPS gap. To help offset this marketplace investment, we are, as Indra mentioned, embarking on a multi-year productivity effort, which is expected to deliver over $500 million in incremental productivity savings in 2012 for cumulative incremental productivity of $1.5 billion through 2014. This initiative is expected in 2012 to contribute 7 points of EPS growth. ","Below-the-line pension cost will increase as a result of the lower discount rate we used to calculate pension expense. And finally, our net interest cost also rises. We increased our borrowings and term out debt in a low interest rate environment, and our tax rate will be slightly higher at 27%. The net impact of the latter 2 items is a reduction of 3 points. Note at this point, based on market consensus forecast, we anticipate FX to be a 3-point headwind in 2012. ","Now I'd like to take a moment to go a little bit deeper on some of these. Overall, we are anticipating 7% commodity inflation for this year. Our commodity spend consists of 3 components: raw commodities, which we purchased via a systematic forward-buying program; raw commodities for which there is no active traded market; and then finally, cost our suppliers incur to convert raw commodities into ingredients and packaging materials. ","On non-traded raw commodities, we will have moderate inflation of 4% this year. And on conversion costs, we are actually benefiting from 5% deflation as a result of value engineering and productivity efforts with our suppliers. But we are facing a steep 16% inflation in market trade and commodity purchases. Because we secure coverage in advance of the start of the year via our systematic forward-buying program, 35% of our commodity purchases were already locked by July 2011, more than 40% by September and almost 2\/3 by the end of December 2011. ","As a result, we are not fully benefiting from the recent declines in raw commodity prices yet. While this program proved to be very beneficial to us in the past 2 years and over a cumulative period, we are still ahead of the market. Our cost for traded commodities are unfavorable to the market in 2012 on a percentage basis. It's important to note though that we expect our actual prices to be at or below the market prices on many commodities, but the rate of inflation will be higher because of the different prior-year basis. ","The commodity inflation is highest in the first quarter and mitigates as we move forward through the year as you would expect with the lagging effect. Regarding our productivity program, as indicated earlier, we expect to deliver $3 billion in savings over the next 3 years, which is double our historical productivity run rate. Our productivity program will touch virtually every aspect of our business, including manufacturing, distribution and SG&A. ","Specifically, we are heightening our ability to execute best practice sharing across our organization, leveraging new technologies and processes across our entire cost structure and will increase yield and throughput and reduce waste throughout the value chain. In addition, we are consolidating a number of manufacturing warehouse and sales facilities, and we're implementing a more simplified organization structure with wider spans of control and fewer layers of management, which will enhance our cost competitiveness and drive more effective accountability. ","The restructuring actions will have a onetime cost of about $910 million, of which about $750 million is cash. As mentioned earlier, overall below-the-line costs are a 3-point drag on EPS. Our pension costs are increasing by almost $100 million this year as a result of a decrease in the discount rates. This is after a $1 billion discretionary pretax contribution to the pension and retiree medical plans, which reduced the expense by $100 million. ","In addition, our net interest costs are increasing by about $200 million as we term out debt to benefit from long-term low interest rates. Borrowing increases generally in line with cash, which sits internationally. All other corporate G&A costs are flat as reductions in corporate G&A are being redeployed to support the global productivity initiative. ","Turning to capital allocation and cash return. We announced this morning that we will increase our dividend by 4% to $2.15 with the June dividend payment, and we intend to step up our share repurchase program to at least $3 billion in 2012. Simultaneously, we will term out debt, taking advantage of that low interest rate environment. This will increase our leverage, which we are comfortable with because we intend to limit both our number and size of tuck-in acquisitions and to do them only in emerging and developing markets. ","Net, we expect to increase our borrowing, but again, it will only increase in line with our growth in cash. This cash is largely offshore and is, therefore, tax inefficient to repatriate. With this, despite a year of earnings decline, we expect to return about $6.3 billion to shareholders this year, up from $5.6 billion in 2011.","Turning to the portfolio review. I'm sure many of you focused on the lower-left quadrant of the matrix that Indra showed you earlier and have questions about how we will scorecard that. For these businesses, we expect them to hold their grow of share, begin to achieve profitable growth and improve their ROICs within a 12- to 18-month time frame. If they don't, we will seek structural solutions as an alternative, collaborations, JVs, refranchisings or divestitures are all on the table, all with the objective to improve PepsiCo's shareholder value creation. ","Summarizing 2012, we're targeting EPS to decline by approximately 5% on a constant-currency basis. Based on current market consensus ForEx, this is a 3-point headwind resulting in an 8% decline in EPS on a USD basis. As you model out the quarters, please keep in mind that commodity inflation is steepest in the first quarter and consequently, we anticipate first quarter earnings to decline high-single digits. ","We expect CapEx to be approximately $3 billion, a 10% reduction from our 2011 CapEx level. Management operating cash flow is targeted at about $6 billion, an amount similar to our 2011 management operating cash flow despite an earnings decline in 2012. And we have plans in place to return over $6 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.","Long term, as many of the headwinds we are experiencing in 2012 moderate and as our A&M investments take hold, we anticipate returning to our long-term targets of 6% to 7% core constant currency growth in division operating profit, core constant currency EPS growth in the high-single digits, CapEx investment of no more than 5% of net revenue and core management operating cash flow growing in line with net income on a rolling 3-year basis. ","Now let's turn to how we'll measure progress on our performance scorecard. We will measure our performance along 8 key metrics, 4 of which relate to what we do to deliver results, and 4 of which reflect the results of what we do. Let's talk first about what we do or what I call our input metrics, which include brand strength, execution, cost and CapEx efficiency and innovation. ","For brand strength, we expect brand equity on our top 12 global brands to improve year-over-year, and we expect A&M spend as a percentage of revenue to increase or stay flat after 2012. In terms of execution, we will track 2 key measures: inventory share and coincidence of purchase. These each have a strong correlation with sales growth and do so in a cost-efficient manner. ","Cost and CapEx efficiency are critical to our ability to deliver profit and returns to shareholders. We are confident that our productivity programs in both P&L and CapEx investments will enable us to deliver on these targets. ","Last, we'll measure the success of our innovation defined as new product sales as a percent of total PepsiCo sales. While we expect the first 3 metrics to deliver in line with our long-term target in 2012, we are not counting on an increase in innovation as a percentage of sales in 2012. For these metrics, we expect to share our performance with you on a semiannual basis, and we expect to perform against these targets beginning in 2012. ","Obviously, we'll also measure our performance against key output metrics that are highly relevant to investors. The metrics are value share, EPS, ROIC and operating cash flow. Our guidance and performance targets are consistent with these long-term targets, and we'll continue to report to them -- to report them to you as we currently do. Because 2012 is a transition year, however, we expect to achieve only the value share targets in 2012. We believe that this scorecard is well-connected to both operating performance and shareholder value creation and will enable you to clearly understand our results. ","With that, now I'll turn the meeting back over to Indra.","Indra K. Nooyi","Thank you, Hugh. Thanks to all of you for your attention this morning. And before we open it up for questions, let me just recap the key points we'd like you to takeaway this morning by returning to one of our earlier slides. ","We're excited about the initiatives we shared with you this morning and look forward to sharing with you our progress as the year progresses. And as I said as I close my talk this morning, you should expect to see the following: a substantial increase in our brand support and focus, improvement in our brands' health, delivery of significant incremental cost productivity, greater efficiency in capital spending, strong cash flow generation and attractive cash returns to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. ","Now as I turn it over to you for Q&A, and if I could just have John, Zein, Al and Saad join me here on the podium, and we will take questions from you, and then we'll toss it to our sector heads so that they, too, can share their thoughts with you. So with that, it's over to you. Yes? Go ahead.","Question-and-Answer Session","Unknown Analyst","Indra, how do you know this is enough? And I say that in the context particularly around the spend back so $500 million to $600 million A&M only gets you kind of halfway to where you were at the beginning part of this decade even if you pull out PB U.K. asset [PH] and Wimm-Bill-Dann. How do you know that's enough? And in particular, what does it tell us about the ROI of the overall business and the trend of the ROI in the overall business as you're spending more and more and more, you're doing more and more, but you're getting to the same number from a growth perspective. How should we feel about that?","Indra K. Nooyi","I'll make a couple or 3 comments, and I'm going to toss it to Al to talk about how they're reorienting the advertising spending especially -- you focus more on North American beverages, right? Let me start by saying to you that over the last 5 years, the A&M has not been cut. That's the interesting part of the whole North American beverage discussion. So the dollar amount has not been cut. The non-working A&M squeezed out the working A&M. That's the big issue. What you see is measured media. We look at total A&M in the North American beverage business, nothing has changed. The thing to be careful about Gatorade, for example, the working media that you see, the ads are a very small portion of Gatorade. A lot of Gatorade is more what they do with sideline presence and what they do with athletes and what they do to market the product to them. So you've got to look at the overall A&M bucket. Over the last 5 years, the single biggest trend is that we had non-working A&M squeezed out working A&M because inflation and contracts and we had too many agency relationships. And the second is that we supported too many brands. I mean, in North America, because we are a total beverage company with a large portfolio of non-carbon, carbonated brand, we supported too many brands. So the first thing they're doing is first, focusing our effort behind a few brands -- and Al's got a list of brands he's really going to focus on. And by shifting more non-working to working A&M, what you're going to see is that 15% to 20% increase in visible dollars that we're talking about is going to feel like hell of a lot more in North America. So that's the top line number. But that's not enough. If you don't support the A&M with innovation and execution, you can talk about the brands all you want, but you need news to drive incrementality, so that's why we're going to focus a lot more on innovation. And Al, maybe you can talk about some of the innovations the second point, and execution on the ground is going to really go up when we start tailoring assortments by store so we can actually get that incremental growth. Lastly, on total growth, the marketplace in North American Beverage business is only growing 1% in volume; and in value, maybe 3% to 4%. In the last 4 to 5 years, the new entrants in the pure plays have taken a lot of the growth and the big 2, 2.5, 3 have not really had as much of the growth as the pure plays. So we have to figure out how to be a pure play within our own company, and it's not for not having the innovation. We have had tons of innovation. We just kill it too fast, and this new growth ventures that Al is setting up now, mirroring what we've done with Frito-Lay will allow us to incubate these new products so that it doesn't always have to be a $50 million, $100 million case innovation the first year. We can actually start smaller and build up the business. So let me turn it to Al to give you his perspective. Al, it's all yours.","Albert P. Carey","Okay. Indra's mentioned already -- spent the money on many brands, not the 5 core brands. So this coming year, you'll see on Pepsi, Mountain Dew, Gatorade, Tropicana and Lipton, substantial increases, not the usual just double-digit increases in these campaigns. And the campaigns are not going to be just increases in media television, also digital is -- shows tremendous promise. I think not just digital but customer digital. Some of our customers are on the leading edge of digital shows some remarkable new ideas that we could probably tie into and drive business much more directly and focused to those consumers. So if we're looking at selling Gatorade to athletes or families that have young athletes, we can get to these consumers much more directly by using, let's say, the Safeway card and the digital approaches that they use. But let me go back on a couple of the key things that we're going to be working on at PepsiCo beverages North America. I don't believe -- my observation is the business is not broken. It needs to be -- I would describe it as a focus on the back to basics, and that means investment -- substantial investments in the top 5 brands. And then the other thing we need to do is significantly improve the innovation that we have going into the marketplace, both on healthy and core. So this year in 2012, you're going to see a substantial improvement in innovation, but the 2013 pipeline is the one that we really expect to see some really big gains. But this year as well, you'll see things like this that I would call not giant innovation, but we've worked with customers on this particular product right here, it's a 24 ounce can of Mountain Dew. Our initial test market, we blew out every can that we made, and it appeals not only to Mountain Dew users, but also to energy drink users. So if they normally pay $2.99 for a can like this, this will be a lot less. Then I'd call it mid-type of innovation like Pepsi NEXT, and Pepsi NEXT will have 60% less calories than a normal Pepsi, and I'd ask you to try some of it on your way out. I think you'll find that it tastes exactly like a regular Pepsi. I'm a regular Pepsi drinker, and it really is the same. We've made a substantial progress on that product. And then big innovation is all-natural sweeteners, big breakthrough in fountain equipment. And those things are towards the end of this year and really into 2013. And we'll have the -- what I would call the proper investments against those brands. One last thing I'd mention, putting a local structure in place that allows us to get the most out of these big national ideas but also to capitalize on these granular opportunities that exist in the marketplace. Today, I believe we call too many of the plays out of the center, meaning in my group. We're going to have a structure that's announced very quickly here, where we'll have general managers in the marketplace. They will have regional resources for marketing, and we'll be able to work with our customers on things that are going on specifically in Los Angeles. I just don't think we're able to make these calls out of the center as good as the people who were down in the marketplace in the Californias, and in Texases and in those kinds of markets.","Indra K. Nooyi","And let me just add one last point. As I said to you in the opening comments, this is the first time we're going to have global management of big brands. I mean, it might seem unusual to you, but Pepsi was never managed as a global brand. It was managed in a much more fragmented way. Brad Jakeman, who joined us 6, 9 months ago is doing a fabulous job thinking about Pepsi as a global brand, and you'll start seeing the results of this global brand work in summer of this year. And so the leverage of all of this investment is what gives us confidence that -- at first step, hold share, start slowly moving this value share to pick it up. And then would be technology breakthrough, really start thinking about how to gain share. But the real important thing in all of this is to play in this market in a responsible way. I think this category has been played in interesting ways by the competitors, too much pricing action even when commodities have gone up. So it's very important that pricing is responsible, and that's what we've been trying to do in the last 6, 9 months. Go ahead.","Caroline S. Levy - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","A couple of questions, one is on China. It's such a strategically important market for long-term growth. And having met with Tingyi over the last couple of years, a number of times, they've always said, \"We don't think carbonated soft drinks are a good business in China.\" People like teas. People like this. So, there was -- I don't know if they've changed their tune, but it scares me that that's been their attitude in the past. So my question would be, I see the short-term benefit of getting losses of the income statement from the refranchising. But what are the measurements that you're putting in place to make sure that Tingyi doesn't do a blast to target all the volume benefit, but actually delivers over time in this critical market? And then a question for John. Just on the volume growth at Frito, which was the slowest it's been in the last, as I remember the 1%, what do you think it looks like over time and why?","Indra K. Nooyi","So, Saad, you want to take the Tingyi question because you meet with Chairman there on regular basis...","Saad Abdul-Latif","Yes, we're extremely very pleased about the alliance if approved by the Chinese government with Tingyi. The CSD category in China has been growing. And, in fact, in 2011 has grown faster than NCBs. And Tingyi and their portfolio, it doesn't have that. So our alliance with them actually is complementary. It will give us access to wide areas where we don't have production facilities with them. So we have planned our CSD business there. It's an alliance between the #1 ready-to-drink tea, the #1 water, the #1 cola and the #1 flavor. So I think now we've set and transformed, if approved by the Chinese government, this alliance, our Beverage business on trajectory for growth for many, many years to come. How are we going to measure the performance of Tingyi going forward? We have a joint planning with them. We operate as we operate with the franchise there, bottler. Every year, we set up the annual operating plan. We measure it quarterly. We adjust where we need to adjust, and then so forth. Most of our people running our business will be working with Tingyi on this, so there is no change. So we're not like giving our business with these people. Actually, we're moving a lot of our people in operation to Tingyi. The beauty about this alliance is we get access to distribution points, we get access to wide areas where we've never existed before. There was a structural disadvantage on operating plants. We had 22, Coke have 34. With this now, probably we will be set for good, for sustainable growth. And once approved, we will be the #1, actually, beverage company with Tingyi overnight.","Indra K. Nooyi","Caroline, that's a great question. And when we went into the alliance with Tingyi, I mean, we've all had a chance to meet with Chairman Wei, who we adore. I want to tell you, that was the thing we worried about the most. And what we found that was refreshing was Chairman Wei actually -- I don't know what he told you, but he sought us as much as we sought him. He wanted this business because he realized that this business had more price incrementality than tea where there's so much local competition. So this actually gives him some insulation. PepsiCo also provides him a lot of best practice sharing from all of the stuff we do around the world, whether it's marketplace investments, how we grow the business, how we put in coolers, how we put in the route. There's a lot of sharing of knowledge and know-how. And he genuinely believed that carbonated soft drinks will actually grow as a percentage of sales in China, may not be to the U.S. level, but it will grow. It's about 20% today, it will grow. So this was a mutually sought after marriage, and we feel very good about the prospects for this business. So now let me toss it to John to talk about the...","John C. Compton","So let me -- 2 weeks ago, I gave a big speech to an industry conference of the Food Marketing Institute, and I was challenging the group on how to rethink growth because if you look at all food and beverage in the fourth quarter of 2011, volume declined 1.5%. Revenues grew 5%, but there was almost 7 points of pricing behind that 5% revenue growth. So I look at Frito-Lay North America and say 1% volume growth in the quarter compared to everyone else declining 1.5% I think is pretty good. And the algorithm for the quarter of a 1 7 10, I would say, is world-class. Ongoing when we took, as you know, almost 6 points of pricing and drove 1% volume growth in that business. Ongoing we said for Frito-Lay, is a low single-digit volume growth company. We expect a positive spread between volume and revenue and a positive spread between revenue and profit, and that's our expectation. We're very proud of Frito-Lay.","Indra K. Nooyi","Judy?","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just in terms of commodities, the $1.5 billion step up in 2012, a little bit more color just in terms of maybe key inputs or by-product categories where you're seeing the most pressure? And then as related to that, the inflation impact for 2012 that you won't be able to cover price -- with pricing just seems a little bit larger. So is it really a consumer issue? Is it -- is there an element of a brand equity issue that you're really trying to address here? And then how much is also driven by perhaps maybe your hedge position being a little bit of a disadvantage versus your competitors?","Indra K. Nooyi","Hugh, go ahead.","Hugh F. Johnston","Sure. So in terms of the key commodities, obviously, we tend not to talk about specific commodity pricing for obvious reasons. That's information we'd rather not share with competitors. What I would say to though, Judy, is it is very much driven by the lagging effect of the timing of purchases. We do think based on the pricing that we have, and we obviously have knowledge of what the marketplace prices are with 1 or 2 notable exceptions, the pricing that we're paying is better than what's in the market or equal to what's in the market right now. Relative to competition hedging strategies, that's hard for me to speculate on. Obviously, it's just difficult to say what competition is doing. We've seen, obviously, a number of CPGs come out and start to share guidance. And I think we've seen people talk about anything from low- to mid-single digits. Obviously, the number that we shared is a notch above that. I guess generally speaking, the more you're exposed to agro, you probably have a bit more commodity inflation as opposed to being exposed more to energy. So the food and beverage company is probably a little bit higher than the HPCs. And the longer you tend to hedge, and we've been pretty open about the fact that we tend to work about 9 months out, the more the effect will hit in 2012.","Indra K. Nooyi","In terms of pricing behind the brands, we actually lead pricing in many parts of even North America. None of our snack businesses are an issue. But in beverages, we've been trying to take pricing up. It is a very competitive market out there. And if the market place behaves in a sensible way based on commodities, I think the pricing will go up. This has nothing to do with our brand. One example I'll give you is in the cold channel, and Al you can talk about it. We've taken pricing up and it stuck. And our cold channel volume is up significantly.","Albert P. Carey","Yes. Our cold channel business right now for probably the last 12 weeks is very solid, and a good indicator of the brand strength as we put some programs in place on Mountain Dew and Pepsi. But the pricing in the marketplace even on large format is rational right now, which is a good thing for all of us.","Indra K. Nooyi","Let me take a question here and then come there.","Unknown Analyst","Indra, could you talk about why you have a line of sight now and it's the right time to reset? So why do you have it now? Why didn't you have it 3 years ago? Is it due to the macro, or can you just explain that a little further? I have a follow up.","Indra K. Nooyi","Good question, and I tell you, 2007, '08 -- let me -- just typically, when new CEOs come, they just like to sort of throw everything in the kitchen sink and reset. I was looking at the portfolio and saying, \"Hey, you can reset all you want, but developed markets are getting a little soft.\" We don't have much emerging and developing markets in my portfolio. And sometimes, when you have a problem in the portfolio overall, you take a gigantic reset. The issues that I was facing at that time required transformation, which was going to take several years. I'll be honest with you. Had we not had this macroeconomic meltdown and this commodity cost volatility, this whole reset would have happened earlier, and the transformation could have happened earlier. The problem is, we faced the worst crisis, and we had to reset in the middle of this crisis. The other problem was anytime we wanted a reset for North American beverages, there was this giant sucking sound where the bottling systems took out all of the extra funding and demanded bottle funding, okay? And so we had to address that structural problem we had with the bottling systems so that we didn't have 2 companies fighting over a shrinking profit or a flat profit pool. So I had to wait for that bottling system integration to happen, okay? And so finished the bottling system integration 2010; in 2011, brought the management of all of it under one person, Al Carey, and said okay, now is the time to go off and make the reset happen because now we know that every dollar of shareholders' money we put behind the reset will actually yield results as opposed to you put the money -- and as I said, every CEO gets an opportunity once in a decade to make a reset. It's like running a car race. You got to take a pit stop at some point, and you don't get too many chances to take a pit stop and then still win the race. We want to win the race. So this was the pit stop, and we had to pick it very strategically. So that's what we did. Talked through about it every year, I'll be honest with you.","Unknown Analyst","Got you. And then Hugh can you just talk about volume was a little tight into this year and maybe the long term because I don't think it was mentioned in any of the slides.","Indra K. Nooyi","Revenue was at mid-single digits this year, too.","Hugh F. Johnston","Yes, we said mid-single on revenue.","Unknown Analyst","And then no volume?","Hugh F. Johnston","Yes, revenue is probably the more relevant thing at this point.","Indra K. Nooyi","Because of the pricing, yes. Can I take a question, then come to you?","Unknown Analyst","Yes.","Indra K. Nooyi","A question there, please.","Unknown Analyst","Yes, Indra, 2 questions. One on North America beverages. You talked about the opportunity through structural change to jump shift ROIC. Could you elaborate on that comment? Are you rethinking about how you're thinking about wholly owning the bottling assets for the long term? What did you mean by that comment is question one. And then question two is, as you think about the larger organization, the whole of PepsiCo and as the Chairman of the company and its CEO, how do you think about a, kind of internal versus external candidates for key leadership roles; and b, how are you thinking about those 2 roles being occupied by one person?","Indra K. Nooyi","Let me first turn to Hugh on the structural issue.","Hugh F. Johnston","Sure. Well, as we laid out in the scorecard, I think we're open about how we are going to look at the business. Regarding alternatives to increased returns, first of all, from an operating perspective, we're obviously going to be looking at capital investments with extreme scrutiny when the business is challenged from a growth perspective. Working capital, the same. We do think that there are lots of opportunities to manage inventory more tightly, and as Indra said, to reduce days both on the payables and -- or on the receivable side and increase on the payable side. From a structural alternative perspective, I think it's fair to say that there's a variety of items on the table. And we're going to look at each of the options and determine what makes sense if we don't see internal operating performance of the business and the returns of the business improve over time. That can be anything from collaborations right through to all variety of other options as well.","Indra K. Nooyi","Let me talk to you about organization. We do a great job developing our internal talent for succession at the senior-most level. You see an outstanding group of leaders here, who've all grown up in the PepsiCo system doing outstanding job, but I think the mark of a good company is to be able to bring in external talent when needed at the right level, whatever the level of the company is, if the belief of the leadership of the company is that this external talent will significantly improve the thinking of the company and help us position ourselves to perform in a new and changing environment. I think all of us are in an extraordinary period of change. Many of the skills we had over the -- that we learned over the last 10 or 15 years don't apply in the future. So very often, you have to buy some of this talent to just improve the overall knowledge base in the company. I mean, I'll give you an example, Enderson Guimaraes. Where are you, Enderson? Enderson came to us from Electrolux, and he was running a big piece of Electrolux. Now he's running global operations for PepsiCo. The thinking that Enderson brings to us challenges the way we do things in PepsiCo, which is great because it makes us all a better company, a better group of leaders. So I think any good company, the mark of a great company is to be willing, to be open to bringing an external talent when needed, assimilating them, learning from them and then getting better as an overall company. On the last thing on the Chairman and CEO roles, look, I've been Chairman and CEO, and I've seen the benefits of being both the Chairman and CEO being able to manage the board, external constituencies and be able to run the company. If you have a Chairman and CEO that runs a very flat organization, 20 reports, and they're not of the caliber of being Chairman and CEO themselves, then you have a problem. I have the unusual benefit of having 4 sector heads who each of them can be Chairman and CEO in their own right and a phenomenal CFO. So I look at my team and say, \"I work for them, they are all Chairman and CEOs in their own way.\" And so I think in PepsiCo, this role combination actually works. I promised to come here. Yes, right here on the first row.","Unknown Analyst","Indra, can you discuss your level of confidence that you will get returns behind this marketing spending in beverages? And also, as we look at 2013 and '14, I'm assuming that your EPS growth will be in line with your long-term goals. Why would that be if you're getting a return on the marketing investment in 2012 versus depressing the earnings base, and you've also got incremental cost cutting in those years?","Indra K. Nooyi","Your question is why isn't it higher in 2013?","Unknown Analyst","Yes.","Indra K. Nooyi","Look, what we've given you is the long-term algorithm. We said high-single digit. We'll come to 2013 guidance as we get to the early part of 2013. Let's see what the environment is like, what all of the cost situation looks like. Why do we believe that we'll get a return on investment? I'm going to use Pepsi Max as an example. We invested heavily behind Pepsi Max and the restaging of Pepsi Max last year and this year. Pepsi Max is up more than 50% in volume between last year and this year. Now it's off a small base, but it's up 50%, and it's almost one share of the carbonated soft drink business. So you can't run 20 brands and try to invest behind all of them and expect them to cut through the clutter. But if you take a focus group of brands, that actually belong in different aisles in store, look at the brands that Al talked about. You've got Pepsi, Dew in the CSD aisle. You've got Gatorade in the sports aisle. You've got Tropicana sitting in the refrigerated aisle. If you invest behind each of these sitting in different parts of the store and put the appropriate media rates, our testing shows that you can actually get growth in each of these brands. And that's the model we've been using. We have tested that, and we believe we will get a return on it, okay. I have to go to a question there. Yes, go ahead.","Unknown Analyst","Two questions. One, just implied in your long-term model, is there an expectation that gross margins will expand over time, or is all the leverage going to be below the gross profit line?","Indra K. Nooyi","Hugh?","Hugh F. Johnston","To be perfectly candid, a little tough to say given commodities have been so volatile. We will clearly see margins below the line improve where the impact of lower cost below the line. NVA, which is the non-commodity portion of cost of goods sold, we clearly expect to see productivity there. How commodities shakeout and how that balances out to me is very much an open question. Under normal circumstances, yes, I would expect to see gross margin improvement as well, but...","Unknown Analyst","So you'd expect to be able to start to -- or be able over time to cover some level of commodity inflation with pricing, I guess, is my -- did the company loss pricing power, is what I'm asking.","Hugh F. Johnston","Yes. The way I think about it is, when I think about commodities, I tend to think about them longer term growing roughly in line with global GDP, and so somewhere in 3%, 3.5% range. At that level, certainly, we would expect to be able to price the cover. What happens in any individual year, tough to ascertain further out than a few months before the year begins.","Indra K. Nooyi","The thing to be careful about just, say, on pricing, I'd be careful about assuming that the brands don't have pricing power. I'll tell you why because this is a tough economy. It's not that the brands don't have pricing power. Consumers don't have the buying power. Okay, if you had a normal year, we would be looking at a very different dynamic. In countries where consumers have buying power, the emerging market of EMEA, Asia and Middle East, we have been able to price. We are getting the value -- volume growth and the value growth, not an issue. The last thing I'd tell you is on gross margins. As the mix of countries changes and as we get more growth in emerging and developing markets, which is what all of us should want because that drives long-term growth, sometimes the gross margin picture starts looking muddy because in those markets, we're still in the early stages so the gross margin is a little bit lower and then they ramp up. So when you have a large company and you're looking at a combination of different businesses, categories, countries with different dynamics and a combination of franchise and operating business, there's not a linear relationship on the gross margin. So it requires explanation. And we'll provide it to you in our quarterly calls. Okay, I'll take a question on this side. Is there a question on this side? No? Go ahead. I'll come back again for you.","Unknown Analyst","Hugh, thank you so much for your commentary around balancing your leverage increase in tuck-in acquisitions. If I could just dig in to that a little bit. When you look at your short-term borrowings and your access to commercial paper, do you see a need to maintain Tier 1 CP access, or could you look for increased balance sheet flexibility by moving towards Tier 2?","Hugh F. Johnston","It's a good question. At this point, in terms of commenting on specific ratings, it would probably be inappropriate for me to do that right now. I've -- we've shared with you what our plans are and what our leverage roughly looks like. Beyond that, I probably rather not get into it. I wouldn't necessarily take anything off the table.","Indra K. Nooyi","A question there. One back, and then you, John.","Unknown Analyst","Yes, I just wanted to ask you, you have an increased budget for advertising. Just wanted to know which sectors are you targeting? Are you moving more or less towards the Internet, print or TV? And also, do you have any hand in the Olympics with your Gatorade drinks and so forth?","Indra K. Nooyi","I mean, the advertising spending is broad-based. As Al mentioned, it's a 360 degree activation. So each of those elements you talked about will get an increase in advertising spending. And no, we are not in the Olympics. We were the proud sponsors of the NFL and the outstanding Super Bowl we just witnessed where we had phenomenal results with our advertising campaign. And that's what we're doing.","Hugh F. Johnston","And I would not say, we're not in the Olympics, but we have 3 substantial campaigns this summer. One on Gatorade, one on Pepsi and Mountain Dew.","Indra K. Nooyi","Yes, John?","Unknown Analyst","So you talked about one of the targets that you are going to keep for 2012. You had those targets when you talked about the bottom the page. One of them was value share growth. So going back to Dara's  Question, I guess, historically, advertising takes a little bit of time to seed. And so can you talk about what you see as the key drivers of those values -- of that value share growth? So advertising takes a little time seed, the innovation is a little back-end loaded. Taking less price relative to raw material inflation sounds like we could actually see price gaps widening from that standpoint. So how much of that short-term value share growth do you think comes from potentially widening of price point gaps?","Indra K. Nooyi","Hugh?","Hugh F. Johnston","John, from that standpoint, we -- and let me focus more on North America because that's sort of the more logical area of emphasis. We really did get our pricing in place in the fourth quarter, particularly in the Beverage business. And we were comfortable with where we are right now, and I think we\u2019d expect to see that stay roughly where it is right now.","Indra K. Nooyi","Any other question this time? Yes, go ahead, Damian.","Damian Witkowski - Gabelli & Company, Inc.","Indra, just a 2-part question. On -- just give us your global perspective in terms of what's happening around the globe currently, what do you think of each market in terms of is it getting better or worse? And then I don't know if I missed it, but if I look at your goal for Good-for-You, the $30 billion by 2020, is that still a target? And since you sort of said no big acquisitions, do you think that you can still get there with organic or mostly organic growth?","Indra K. Nooyi","I'm going to answer that question, and then what I'm going to do, Damian, is give you a gift. I'm going to have Saad, Zein talk about their regions, and then I'm going to have John and Al talk about Latin America because they also cover Latin America. Currently, our Good-for-You portfolio is about $14 billion in PepsiCo. That market category is growing between 89% globally. If we just keep growing at that rate between now and 2020, we will be a $30 billion business. So we don't need any extraordinary intervention to grow that business. What we need to do is to invest, to grow in those markets we are in and go into new markets with just our Quaker, Tropicana, Gatorade and where appropriate, our Naked Juice brands. So we're not looking at any dramatic expansion through acquisitions at this point. So let me turn -- Zein, let me turn it to you to talk about what you're seeing in Europe, especially Western Europe, Eastern Europe, Southern. Give us your perspective.","Zein Abdalla","Yes, well, I mean, clearly, you all read the news. Europe is going through a lot of challenges. And you almost see either issues unfold by the week, or some issues just repeat by the week. One of the, I think, wonderful things about our business in Europe is it's very finely balanced between the East and the West. We're pretty evenly split between the emerging markets of Europe and the developed markets of Europe. And what that tends to do for us is in good times, allows us to accelerate growth and move ahead of the pack. And obviously, in more challenging times when the developed markets tend to be more stable, it allows us to hedge against the challenges. So even in a very difficult year like 2011, we still delivered very, very solid top line growth. I would say looking back 2011, obviously, the developed markets are more stable and performed better. Russia had a particular challenge. You\u2019ll have heard that from many food and beverage companies, from many FMCG companies, not so much drive by their economy where they actually had good GDP growth, but much more driven by the excessive inflation in the country because they suffered both from the global inflation but also particularly in Russia a very severe crop shortage in 2010 as a result of a very hot summer that played out into basic commodities, hurt consumers really in terms of their basic, basic purchases. And you saw a decline in disposable incomes. Now we do see that normalizing in Russia, and we do see the market coming back. And we will see a stronger performance in Russia in 2012. Now again having said that, we're very pleased with the top line performance around Russia growing double digits in 2011. And again, the wonderful hedging of that business across the multiple categories in which we compete. Following the Wimm-Bill-Dann acquisition and the integration, we're nearly 12 months into that now and the integration of it into our business. I can tell you, we've gone in 12 months from essentially serving consumers between about 12:00 midday to about 6:00 in the evening. They're now serving them from the moment they wake up to actually, the moment before they go to sleep. And the traditional drink in Russia before you go to bed is a glass of Kefir, which is a fermented yogurt drink. It's a digestive. It helps you sleep, and that's actually one of the fastest-growing beverage categories. When you talk about snacking, and we all tend to think about nutrition versus Fun-for-You, well, one of the fastest-growing snacking areas in many of these emerging markets is as the meals deconstruct and as people move from formal breakfast at home before they leave home, to needing that midmorning snack or that second breakfast. And again, products like value-added dairy play very, very strongly in that segment. So yes, I mean, a challenging macroeconomic picture in Europe, challenging consumer picture. But we've always, I think, said to you that the good news is people have to eat and drink. The really good news is we have a balanced portfolio, both geographically and in terms of the categories and the consumer needs and occasions that we service.","Indra K. Nooyi","Saad?","Saad Abdul-Latif","Yes. Well, EMEA is a vast territory, as you know, and I have three-quarters of the world's population, and...","Indra K. Nooyi","Then we want 3 quarters of the profits of the company come from your group.","Saad Abdul-Latif","We're working towards that. I'll tell you, we called engine for growth for PepsiCo for a reason. First of all, the economies are growing, where China and India they're growing at high single-digits GDP. The population is young, and the per capita consumption of both snacks and beverages is a fraction of the developed world. So we have a huge runway to grow in both businesses, and we are poised to capture that growth. We have outstanding businesses in beverages and in snacks, and I'll just tour around the area with you area by area. So if we take the Middle East, we are the overwhelming choice of consumers there in beverages and in snacks. But that's been happening lately in the Middle East while it would set us back a little bit for a year or 2. However, for the long term, it's great because it will bring a lot of transparency and governance and it will bring a lot of employment at greater stage to our businesses. And we are very well positioned to capture that growth. India has been great. We have fantastic businesses in beverages and in snacks. In fact, in 2011, we out grew our competitor by 6, 7 factor points in LRB. Our snacks business is -- close to 100,000 tons [ph] and then doing great. And we're capturing all the growth of the GDP. It slowed a little bit down, but not at the level that really worried us. There is a lot of consumers coming in with purchasing power into that as in China. In China, our snacks business is doing great. We are growing in high, high teens. And in the beverages, when the government approves the alliance with Tingyi, we have really set our beverage business on sustainable growth path. As I said earlier, we\u2019re aligned with the #1 tea and the #1 water. We're the #1 cola and #1 flavor. So coming together, we put that business on a trajectory to growth. And with snacks, it's a very fragmented market. And we are very well poised with the capability of people that we have there to grow. Asia-Pacific is the mixture of countries there we have developed such as Australia. Like the other developed world, there have seen some challenges there, but we are managing these challenges and actually, we are growing on the snacks business. And we have a lot of emerging markets that we are doing extremely well, such as Vietnam where, actually, we are the choice of consumer there for both snacks and beverages. Pakistan, which is part of the Asia-Pacific there, is also growing. So overall, we have the great businesses in foods and beverages. The economies are growing. The population is young, and we are very well poised to capture that growth for the future.","Indra K. Nooyi","John, can you talk about Latin America, but stay with the macroeconomic...","John C. Compton","Yes, Latin America remains 3% to 4% GDP growth. Obviously, that's driven by Mexico and Brazil. Mexico for the year was around 3%. Brazil slowed some, but I think as you look forward, you've got to believe that, that economy is going to continue to grow 4%, 5%, maybe 6% going forward with the Olympics and the World Cup coming there. And our business collectively grew volume about 5% during the year, so strong. And in Brazil, our snack business was up 8%, and I think it's -- to Indra's point about the dis-synergies of the 2, it's one of our best markets with the Power of One where we leverage the Frito-Lay's system to distribute many of the beverage brands. So very optimistic about Latin America.","Indra K. Nooyi","Yes?","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Indra, 2 questions. One, I didn't hear a lot about mix on a consolidated basis. I think you touched on the fact that emerging markets are in negative to mix, but if you're no longer doing as much M&A, I would assume that's no longer going to be as much of a drag. And if you're focusing on the top 12 global brands, I assume they typically have a higher-than-average mix benefit. So maybe you could touch on those, and then I'll follow up.","Indra K. Nooyi","Yes. Mix, I think, our expectations again depends on how the economies evolve, Eric. But right now, emerging markets -- emerging and developing markets about 35% of the revenue of PepsiCo. We think it'll get to 50% by the end of the decade, okay. That's the range. And it takes that long only because our developed markets business is also growing, okay. So that's how we think it will evolve. The good news is, in emerging and developing markets, once they get to a certain scale, their margins escalate quite fast. The best example is Sabritas in Mexico. It's a developing market. But if you look at the margins we get in our Sabritas business, it's very attractive. And so because we have scale, we are the largest salty-snack player there. So I think it's a couple of dynamics. One, we'll keep moving the emerging and developing markets up, get it to half-and-half and there should be even more skewed to emerging and developing markets based on the world population. But let's start with 50-50. And then, hopefully, sometime around 2015, the profit acceleration from emerging markets will start picking up even more because the investments to build scale now are returns from the scale investments. So I hope that change will happen.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And then in looking at that 4-quad grid that you put up, so basically, in the top left quadrant, it was 74% to the business and the other 26% had issues one way or the other. And I'm kind of wanting to think about that like -- or how should we think about that relative to the Power of One? Because it seem like the top-left quadrant was what really benefited from Power of One, whereas the others were more difficult to kind of see where that -- where the benefit comes in there. And then to the extent that you get a 1% lift from the Power of One quantified, I guess, is like $120 million in sales, I mean, you're talking relative to a business that's got $60 billion, $70 billion of sales. So how is that like incremental?","Indra K. Nooyi","So Eric, the Power of One increment we're talking about in North America, all right, that number was a North American coincidence number increasing about 1%. Believe me, our normal businesses grow. Frito-Lay grows, North American beverage grows. Over and above that, if we can get an additional $120 million sales, 2 or 3 points from that in North America, that's a bonanza. I mean, to get $300 million, $400 million from an over-the-top co-merchandising activity, co-promotion activity is gigantic for an overall food and beverage business market that's not growing as robustly as it used to grow. I have looked at the portfolio differently. I actually -- when putting it together, I looked at it very carefully, the businesses on the lower-left quadrant, okay, some of the emerging market snack businesses, they're only there because we don't have the scale as yet. They're going to use the Beverage business to plus up their scale. They'll quickly move into the top-left quadrant, okay. But we need to make sure that we manage that business to drive the growth, make sure that we leverage the Beverage business to drive the growth, get the right people, and we have to do that. That's why we put it there, honestly. The -- some of the emerging market Beverage business, we've done the Pareto. We have looked at each of these businesses and said, \"Do we have an operational line of sight to get to the top quadrant, or do we have to consider structural option that is refranchising into a well-capitalized bottler, who has a reason to refranchised?\" And let me speak to that a little bit. In the past, one of the mistakes we made as a company, I'll go back, when we gave Mexico, Russia to PBG, all right, we gave it to them because we felt they needed a growth market. Well one of the big lessons, Eric, was that you give a growth market, which is not the whole market, to a bottler only they have reason to combine with something else they have and get scale. You just don't throw a growth markets to them, okay. And that's why the whole international experiment of PBG wasn't wildly successful. So when we think about refranchising some of these emerging market Beverage businesses, we have to find a bottler who has other businesses so that they can leverage the scale like AmBev in Brazil was a great example. And we have partners like that in Asia-Pacific. I look at our Japanese bottlers who are absolute terrific partners, taking them to other parts of Asia-Pacific. I think there are lots of opportunities there to think about how to move emerging market Beverage businesses to the top box. The biggest elephant there is North American DSD in that bottom box. If commodity inflation wasn't prevalent, we wouldn't have put it in that bottom box because margins for that business normally are in the teens. It shouldn't have been a problem at all. And then we bought the bottlers back, I mean, we were thrilled at the synergies and what we can do.  What we need to navigate through now is how do you manage a Beverage business, which is not growing too much, but not a commodity inflation? How do you reset that whole business? And if you can't reset it through a technology breakthrough, through a different way of operating it, through innovation, through brand building, then you have to think about structural options. And that's what we're going through. So what I would suggest is, just focus on the percentage of profitability from North American DSD beverage that belongs in that box. The rest of it will take care of itself because of the growth and the way we are managing it today, okay. Caroline, I think we have to shut it down, but one last question. Go ahead.","Caroline S. Levy - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","This is just for Al.","Indra K. Nooyi","Make it a good one.","Caroline S. Levy - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","It will be -- well, a good 2 for Al, or maybe both for Al. On feet on the street, you've got a lot of layoffs coming. How do you feel about the capability of the Pepsi system right now? Do you need more people rather than less? And the other is, do you think you should be doing more targeted Hispanic marketing given the growth rate in consumption of beverages by that consumer group?","Albert P. Carey","Now those are good questions. I -- let me just say, with the layoffs that will occur at Pepsi North America, very few will be at the front line. Most will be focused on middle and above management. So I'm not worried about this feet on the street. But as time goes on, there are a few gaps in service and those are being taken care of, I believe, in customer service just like at the Frito-Lay system. So I feel very good where we are there. On the Hispanic opportunity, I think probably more than 60% of the growth in the category is going to come from the Hispanic consumer, and I have seen some estimates that are quite a bit higher than that. And this whole local campaign that we're putting together in our local region markets, very focused on that as opportunities come up in the Texas, Florida, California market. And actually, that opportunity is becoming bigger in almost every city, not just in those Southwest cities that we typically talk about.","Indra K. Nooyi","Thank you, Caroline. So let me just close by saying thank you again to all of you for coming to our meeting this morning, and thank you for your attention over the past couple of hours. We look forward to seeing a lot of you over the next few weeks, and certainly reconnecting with all of you at CAGNY later this month. But as you leave, I just want you to take a picture of PepsiCo back with you. $66 billion of revenue, 16% operating margin, 17% net return on invested capital, 31% return on equity, a prolific cash generator and a company with 22 brands, each one generating over $1 billion in retail sales, and a company with terrific people and great growth prospects. So with that, thank you for your time and hope to reconnect with you soon.

",".","Now, it\u2019s my pleasure to introduce Indra Nooyi.","","Indra Nooyi","Thank you, Jamie and good morning everyone, and thank you very much for joining us this morning. As we close our 2013 and look ahead to 2014 and beyond, we have a few key themes we\u2019d like to share with you. ","Through a multiyear process, we\u2019ve largely transformed PepsiCo for sustained performance. We are executing on our plan to deliver on our stated goals. This execution has enabled us to deliver and in many cases exceed all of our financial goals in 2013.","Our portfolio is complementary and our geographic and product portfolio positions us well for sustainable growth. We believe that our portfolio, as currently constructed, positions us to maximize value creation. As a result, we are not making significant structural changes, including to North American Beverages.","We are extending our $1 billion annual productivity savings target through 2019. Our 2014 guidance is in line with our long term financial targets, and the actions that we\u2019re taking to execute our strategy provide us further confidence in the long term durability of these targets.","Consistent with our commitment to disciplined capital allocation, we\u2019re increasing our cash returns to shareholders by 35% in 2014, significantly stepping up both our dividends and share repurchases to a total of $8.7 billion while maintaining appropriate capital investment in the business.","Finally, and most importantly, our recently completed [all health] survey tells us that our associates are motivated, engaged, and positive about being part of, and the future of, PepsiCo.","So let me walk you through each of these themes. As you know, over the past few years, we\u2019ve had to address a number of macro trends that have reshaped and will continue to shape our industry. We made the required investments and changes to preemptively transform ourselves to capitalize on the opportunities these shifts presented and to position the company for long term growth and value creation. ","First, we expanded our presence and plans to grow in developing and emerging markets in response to a shift in the [unintelligible] of global growth. ","Second, we continue to balance our portfolio of offerings to include more nutrition and healthy offerings while increasing the [permissibility] of our social snacks and beverages by reducing calories and sodium in key products to address consumers\u2019 growing concern with health and wellness.","Third, we\u2019ve stepped up investment in R&D, digital capabilities, and food quality and safety in acknowledgement that social media is an ever-increasing powerful force with greater availability of more sophisticated tools and product formulations and food safety and security are now greatly enhanced by more tools providing ingredient traceability. ","Fourth, we invested to enhance the equity of our $22 billion brand, which together accounts for more than 70% of our total revenue. We also upgraded our revenue management skills to give us the ability to take pricing. ","Fifth, we built a cultural productivity into the company to deal with the reality of a volatile and inflationary commodity environment.","Sixth, we designed sustainability into our operations in response to growing environmental consciousness.","And lastly, on the talent front, we upgraded our skills through selective hiring in several new and emerging areas, and we completely revamped our talent management processes and training curriculum with a view to equipping our people with the skills needed to perform better in a volatile environment. ","Through these transformative actions, we have fundamentally changed the profile of the company. Our product profile has grown from fun for you to a more balanced offering of good for you, better for you, and fun for you products. ","Geographically, we\u2019ve shifted PepsiCo to a company with a more balanced global footprint, and our culture has shifted to a decentralized one with businesses operating completely independently through what we refer to as \u201cconnected autonomy,\u201d a model that combines the best of an entrepreneurial ownership culture with the benefits of global scale and coordination.","As a result, PepsiCo today is positioned to deliver, over the long term, top-tier financial performance and value creation for our shareholders. Our 2013 results demonstrate our portfolio strength and execution capabilities. Despite a challenging macro-environment, we delivered strong and well-balanced operating performance in 2013. Organic revenue grew mid-single digits, both gross and operating margins expanded, cash flow is very strong, and we managed our portfolio of businesses effectively. ","Let me comment briefly on each of our businesses, beginning with North American beverages. We are encouraged with the progress we\u2019ve made in North American beverages but the category remains challenged. We have managed the business responsibly, achieving 2.5 points of price realization at retail while stabilizing our share performance in measured channels and generating profit growth.","We were especially pleased with the successful innovation in North American beverages with four products, Mountain Dew Kickstart, Gatorade Frost Glacier Cherry, Starbucks Iced Coffee, and Lipton Pure Leaf, on track to achieve $100 million in annual retail sales. This success was realized with strict execution against initiatives and the stepped up investment levels we made in 2012. We feel good about North American beverages. ","Frito Lay in North America delivered consistent, solid performance throughout 2013. Organic revenue growth of 4% in the quarter and for the full year was well-balanced between volume and price. Our innovation was also very strong at Frito Lay, including Tostitos Cantina, Lays Do Us A Flavor, Cheetos Mix Ups, and the new flavors of Doritos Jack and Tostitos Artisan.","And the business delivered solid operating leverage and margin expansion, with core constant currency operating profit growth of 7% for the quarter and 6% for the full year. We have good momentum and we\u2019re seeing returns from all of the investments we\u2019ve made to strengthen our inside capabilities, brand, and go-to-market systems. So again, we feel very good about the outlook for this business. ","Our other developed markets also showed solid performance during 2013, with organic revenue growth in our overall Western Europe business. While macroeconomic data shows signs of improvement, developed world economies outside the United States remain sluggish. We have relatively limited exposure to slow growth areas such as Southern Europe and Japan, so the shape of our portfolio shields us from these challenges to a degree.","Turning now to our developing and emerging markets, these continue to perform well, despite some volatility in key regions. As a group, our D&E markets posted 10% organic revenue growth for the year, with double-digit growth in China in both snacks and beverages, double-digit growth in Pakistan, high single-digit growth in Saudi Arabia, Brazil, Mexico, and Turkey, just to name a few.","These markets have a long run rate for growth, driven by increasing demand for our convenient, on-trend, affordable products supported by rapidly growing middle class. The investments that we\u2019ve made in these markets place us in an advantaged position. ","The shape and resilience of our portfolio, combined with strong execution across the value chain, enables us to meet, and in many instances exceed, our 2013 financial goals. Organic revenue grew 4%, in line with our mid-single digit target. Core operating margin expanded 40 basis points, in line with our goal of 30 to 50 basis point expansion.","We delivered over $900 million of productivity savings, slightly ahead of our target. Core constant currency EPS grew 9%, ahead of our 2013 guidance, and at the high end of our long term, high single-digit goal. ","Free cash flow, excluding certain items, was $8.2 billion, well ahead of our 2013 goal, driven by exceptional working capital management and disciplined capital spending. Core net return on invested capital improved 110 basis points, 60 points ahead of our target, and cash returns to shareholders were $6.4 billion, right in line with our target.","So, we feel very good about the financial performance of the business. Just as importantly, we\u2019ve continued to invest in the business to ensure the sustainability of our performance well into the future. [A&M] as a percentage of sales was up 70 basis points compared to 2011, and we continue to invest in innovation. Our R&D spending has increased over 25% since 2011.","We improved our capabilities in food quality and safety, invested in multiple process technologies, both to reduce cost and deliver new capabilities, and we invested in product innovation. In 2013, we had one of our most successful years ever in new product launches, with six new products in the United States, on track to achieve $100 million in annual retail sales. And this is a first for PepsiCo.","So we feel good about our 2013. Turning now to our portfolio, it\u2019s evenly distributed across snacks and beverages, both of which are attractive global categories. And within these categories, there\u2019s a highly attractive portfolio of nutritious products, including brands like Quaker in grain, Tropicana in naked fruits and vegetables, and Gatorade in sports nutrition.","Our geographic footprint is very well balanced, with 35% of our net revenue in high-growth developing and emerging markets and about two-thirds in stable, highly profitable developed markets.","Our portfolio is also truly better together, or what we refer to as \u201cthe power of one.\u201d Our entire portfolio is focused on taste and convenience. Our products are purchased together and consumed together. Our presence in beverages supports our snacks growth, and the heft of our portfolio positions us as the largest food and beverage business in many of our key markets, and this makes us a key partner to retailers and food service customers.","We realize $800 million to $1 billion in annual savings by operating our business as one. Our priorities for managing the portfolio are very clear. In developed markets snacks, where we have an incredibly strong business that combines high market share and high margins, we intend to defend and grow our share of salty snacks. ","We want to grow organically into the broader macro snacks space, and this will leverage our core salty snacks foundation capabilities to capture a broader range of day parts and locations. And we want to leverage our beverage business to increase our snack trends in the large, profitable food service business. ","In developed market beverages, a huge category where we have good competitive positions in many markets, here we intend to sensibly defend our LRB share and improve margins and returns with an intense focus on unlocking productivity, especially in North America. And we are focused on achieving product disruption and differentiation through science-based R&D , especially in the area of sweetener innovation.","In our developing and emerging markets, where we have strong salty snack shares in most markets, and leadership of [parity] system beverage positions in many key markets, we intend to continue to build our share positions, capture our fair share of growing beverage locations, and selectively pursue tuck-in acquisitions to build out our scale and our geographic footprint. ","And in the nutrition arena, where we are one of the leading [unintelligible] globally in everyday nutrition, we intend to benefit from the high growth of this category, leveraging the presence and scale of our existing businesses.","Now, these category country combinations, with their demographic tailwinds and related product diversity, give us line of sight to our mid-single digit organic revenue growth goal. From a category perspective, we expect our global beverage business to grow revenue in the low to mid-single digits and global snacks and nutrition to grow revenue in the mid-single digits.","From a market perspective, we expect developed markets to grow revenue low to mid-single digits and our developing and emerging markets to grow revenue high single to low double-digits.","Based on this growth profile, and because we have full operating businesses in snacks, we expect about two-thirds of our revenue growth to come from snacks, and from a geographic perspective, about two-thirds of our revenue growth to come from developing and emerging markets.","As a result, over time, our business mix will gradually shift to be more heavily weighted toward snacks and more heavily weighted towards developing and emerging markets than we are today. This revenue growth profile is the foundation of PepsiCo\u2019s reliable long term growth model.","So how does this all translate to future results? From a geographic perspective, each market type plays an important role in our portfolio. Emerging markets have primarily top line growth drivers, with some potential for margin improvement in the short term. Developing markets drive balanced top line growth and margin and ROIC improvement, and developed markets contribute relatively less to top line growth but at very attractive margins and returns, and are prodigious cash flow generators, and this is true of both snacks and beverages.","So, holistically, this portfolio provides a platform for balanced growth, margin, and return improvement for sustainable future growth opportunities, cementing the durability of our long term core constant currency EPS algorithm and superior cash returns to shareholders, all of which leads to top tier total shareholder return.","But as many of you know, we did commit to reexamine our North American beverage business\u2019s role in our portfolio, especially given some of the recent challenges in the category. So let me start off by saying that our highly integrated food and beverage portfolio positions us as a vital supplier to our retail trade customers, where we are the single largest supplier in many instances.","Decoupling our beverage and snack business in North America would significantly reduce our relevance to our customers. Within most of our largest grocery channel customers, we would fall from being the top supplier to a top four or below supplier, and in the mass merchant drug channels, we would drop below the top 10.","In addition, we would forfeit a number of synergies within North America, including shared procurement, consumer and customer insights organizations, joint advertising, and use of major properties like the NFL and Major League Baseball, and joint promotional and display activity and coordinated national account activity.","So, with all of this as a background, we undertook our evaluation of the overall category and our competitive position within it. Let me provide you with some facts. First, liquid refreshment beverages in North America continue to be the largest food and beverage category by a wide margin. It drives tremendous traffic and cash flow for retailers. It also plays a very important role in food away from home, where food service customers are increasingly using beverage offerings to drive excitement and profitability.","And PepsiCo is relatively well-positioned within the LRB category. We are the LRB leader in measured channels. We are the clear share leader in non-carbs, with leading positions in many segments. Our CSD portfolio has a 0.8x relative market share, with Mountain Dew the fastest-growing CSD trademark. We are making slow and steady progress growing our share in food away from home. We believe the opportunities are many.","There\u2019s no question that the growth of the LRB category in North America has slowed, and within this overall industry, the cola segment is particularly challenged, as consumers look for alternative beverage offerings. ","PepsiCo\u2019s exposure to colas is less than 25% of our total North American beverage portfolio, and less than 15% of our total North American business. We believe that the cola category is still relevant to consumers, but is going through a secular change as consumers look to address the twin issues of calories and artificial sweeteners.","We have several great tasting cola product variations using zero calorie natural sweeteners blended with sugar that we\u2019re testing in various markets in the world. And so far, these test results are promising. However, our U.S. launches of these sweeteners will begin this year, primarily with non-cola products, to build and test consumer acceptance before we launch low-calorie naturally sweetened cola products. ","Additionally, we are encouraged by the progress we made in 2013 in our North American beverage performance. Our objective was to hold or grow LRB value share relative to our primary competitor. And as you can see, our LRB value share performance for the full year 2013 was even with primary competition, based on IRI all measured channel data.","What\u2019s notable there is that we also achieved very strong net price realization at retail across virtually every major subcategory, while holding our value share position. Net-net, we feel cautiously optimistic about our prospects in the North American LRB market. ","So when we reevaluated structural alternatives for the North American beverage business, we established very clear principles to guide our decision. First, we would not return to the contracted franchisee\/franchiser model of the past. We needed a structure that ensures rapid decision making with low coordination costs and friction. We needed to limit value chain decoupling and operating redundancies. ","We did not want to competitively disadvantage our North American beverage business, and we wanted to maintain control over core strategic activities of our global beverage business, such as marketing, innovation, and R&D. We knew we had to maintain or advance our alignment with national accounts, and it didn\u2019t make sense to sacrifice meaningful scale advantages of the PepsiCo system.","So our assessment was driven by a highly objective consideration of what structure would create the greatest, most sustainable shareholder value. And we studied numerous structures, from a full separation of North American beverages from PepsiCo to a separate of some elements of the traditional bottling operations, and everything else in between. We used the best bankers and consultants to think about structural alternatives, all with an eye to creating long term shareholder value. ","And after an exhaustive analysis and review with our board of directors, we\u2019ve concluded that North American beverages creates value and is optimized within PepsiCo\u2019s structure today. Any structural separation would, among other things, result in loss of significant synergies, both between snacks and beverages in North America and between North American beverages and the balance of our international beverage operations. ","It would significantly decrease our relevance to U.S. retailers and jeopardize our ability to grow in food service. It would make our remaining international beverage business less competitive, and finally, it would forfeit the potential value creation of investments we\u2019ve made in sweetener technologies, the full benefits realization of our A&M investment and year-end productivity savings.","So, we\u2019ve concluded that ownership by PepsiCo of the North American beverage business in its current form maximizes shareholder value, because our current ownership structure allows for optimally aligned objectives and execution, allows us to capture potential upside from innovation and productivity, enables us to continue to benefit from scale advantages, and finally, it continues to provide access to the U.S. cash flow that is so important to our shareholder cash return model.","That\u2019s North American beverages. Let me now turn to productivity. You know, back in 2012, we announced a major three-year, $3 billion program enabled in part by our SAP investments, which began in 2002 and our new operating model, which we put in place in 2011, that allows us to lift and shift best practices across the company to improve both the efficiency and effectiveness of our enterprise.","Last year, we also told you that we had begun work on the next tranche of productivity, mostly enabled by our operating model, which is gaining traction in the company, and the availability of new technology and tools. So today we are pleased to announce this next productivity program, $5 billion over five years, beginning in 2015, and also to tell you that we are on track to achieve the $3 billion, three-year program we announced in 2012.","So as we enter our next phase of productivity, let me provide some color to the areas we\u2019re focused on. The first is embedding more automation in our operations to replace labor with capital. An example here would be further automating packaging in our snack plant, where secondary packaging hot of products remains a highly manual process.","The second area is expanding shared services, including global financial shared services for the handling of routine back office transaction processing. The third area is restructuring manufacturing to optimize our global manufacturing footprint. Examples here would be evolving from local to regional manufacturing networks and adopting more third-party manufacturing.","And the fourth area is restructuring our go-to-market systems to optimize our distribution network. Let me give you a couple of examples under the go-to-market systems. The first is our global enterprise system, or GES, at Frito Lay North America. GES is significantly reducing the amount of manual handling of our products up and down the supply chain. ","Because we have such a high transaction rate, every touch of a case or a bag drives a lot of labor cost. GES minimizes product touches between the plant and customer location through streamlined distribution center networks, in some cases delivering direct from the plant to the store. The benefits extend to capital, labor, inventory, and fleet fuel reductions. ","This model continues to roll out across Frito Lay North America and is now being applied to the North American beverage business, where we are maximizing asset utilization by reducing distribution centers, leveraging automation, deploying fleet and route trucks more efficiently, and reducing inventory while improving service and product freshness. We\u2019re encouraged with the progress being made, and have a long runway of savings opportunities ahead of us.","Another initiative is implementation across PepsiCo of the global transportation management system, a leading example of global IT systems driving productivity at PepsiCo. GTMS enables the data, analytics, and processes to effectively manage our consolidated transportation network. We can model different asset choices, consider inbound freight to optimize traffic lanes and maximize every load, and we can do this regardless of whether it\u2019s a common carrier or company owned fleet.","And leveraging this North America systems foundation, we\u2019ve now developed a global template and our GTMS is live in Mexico, Brazil, and Russia. It\u2019s now being expanded to Egypt, Saudi, Australia, and other parts of South America. So these are some of the examples of initiatives that enable the five-year, $5 billion productivity program. ","A portion of these savings will be generated from labor cost efficiency. As you can understand, such initiatives have people implications globally at all levels. In addition to providing transition support, PepsiCo is establishing a fund for eligible front line employees to provide job training to assist them in their pursuit of employment opportunities outside the company. Over the next 60 days, we will finalize the details of how this fund will be administered. The cost of this fund is captured within the economics of our productivity program. ","So let me sum up before I hand off to Hugh for the 2014 guidance. First, execution of our strategy enabled us to meet and exceed our 2013 financial goals. Second, we are confident that our continued execution will enable us to do so again in 2014. Our geographic and product portfolio positions us well for future growth and at the same time provides an attractive shareholder cash return model.","We\u2019re announcing a new five-year, $5 billion productivity program through 2019, strengthening the durability and duration of our expected financial performance. And finally, we are substantially increasing our cash returns, up 35% versus 2013, consistent with our commitment to disciplined capital allocation.","So let me now turn it to Hugh Johnston. Hugh? ","Hugh Johnston ","Thank you, Indra, and good morning, everyone. Let me spend a few minutes discussing our outlook for 2014, which is in line with our long term objectives. We expect another year of mid-single digit organic revenue growth. ","We expect operating margin expansion as top line growth and productivity should offset negative geographic mix and cost inflation. Below the division operating profit line, we expect corporate cost efficiency and approximately 25% core tax rate and a reduced share count. ","All-in, we expect core constant currency EPS growth of 7%. Foreign exchange is expected to impact revenue and core earnings per share by approximately 3% and 4% respectively, based on current market consensus rates. ","Taking our 2013 core EPS of $4.37 and applying our guidance implies a 2014 core EPS of approximately $4.50. Our outlook appropriately factors in both tailwinds and headwinds. To the positive, we expect to generate over $1 billion of productivity savings in 2014, which will offset operating cost inflation. ","We feel very good about our innovation agenda, which should enable us to sustain our organic revenue growth rate. Our share count will benefit from stepped up share repurchases, although we won\u2019t recognize the full benefit of the 2014 purchases within 2014 as they\u2019ll be made throughout the year with some of the share count reduction falling into 2015.","Our tax rate will be lower, and is estimated to come in for the full year at approximately 25%, which we expect to be able to sustain for the foreseeable future. And we will realize a modest benefit from pension expense, due to a higher discount rate.","In terms of headwinds, the food and beverage taxes enacted in Mexico will impact both top line growth and profitability. The rate of our commodity cost inflation will be higher in 2014 than in 2015. Foreign exchange translation, and to a lesser extent transaction, will be a significant drag on our U.S. dollar results and we expect continued challenges in demand for colas.","Finally, as you model out the quarters for 2014, please note the following. For the first quarter of 2014, we expect foreign exchange translation to have an approximately 4% impact on net revenue and 6% impact on core earnings per share based on current market consensus rates. In addition, we expect structural changes, primarily the refranchising of beverage operations in Vietnam, to impact first quarter revenue by approximately half a percentage point.","The second quarter of 2013 included a $137 million gain from the refranchising of our Vietnam operations, the majority of which was invested back into the business during Q2 through Q4. The phasing of this gain versus reinvestment will impact core EPS growth during Q2 through Q4. Finally, our stepped up share repurchase activity will occur throughout the year but should have a more pronounced impact in the back half of 2014 and into 2015.","Our long term goals remain intact: mid-single digit organic revenue growth, core operating margins expanding 30 to 50 basis points per year, high single-digit core constant currency EPS growth, free cash flow, excluding certain items, growing roughly in line with earnings, and core net ROIC improving 50 basis points per year.","We intend to responsibly manage the business for top line growth, drive productivity, and reinvest appropriately to position PepsiCo for sustainable growth for the long term. And, we plan to remain highly disciplined toward capital allocation, with the vast majority of free cash flow after capital spending being returned to shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks.","So, based on our assessment of the strong and sustainable cash flow generation capacity of the portfolio, driven by our expectation of mid-single digit organic revenue growth, robust productivity programs, and efficient capital investment, we\u2019re pleased to announce today that we\u2019ll substantially increase our cash returns to shareholders in 2014. This decision is consistent with our commitment to disciplined capital allocation and our strong bias to returning cash to our investors.","First, we\u2019re increasing our dividend per share by 15%, beginning with our 2014 June payment, to $2.62 on an annualized basis. This represents the 42nd consecutive year of annual dividend increase, and approximately 60% payout ratio based on 2013 core EPS. At today\u2019s stock price, it represents a 3.2% yield and will bring our 10-year annualized dividend per share compound annual growth to 11%.","And we\u2019re further increasing expected shareholder cash returns with a targeted $5 billion share repurchase target. This represents a 67% increase over our 2013 repurchase, and is approximately 4% of our market capitalization. While doing so, we expect to maintain tier one commercial paper access, enabling us to retain low cost, highly accessible, financing.","Taken together, these actions reflect a 35% increase in total shareholder cash returns compared to 2013, and will bring our cumulative 10-year cash returns to shareholders to over $60 billion. As many of you know, we have stated disciplined capital allocation as a top priority for our management and our board, and we trust these actions will be seen by our shareholders as tangible evidence of this commitment.","With that, we\u2019ll take the first question. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions.] Our first question is coming from Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley.","Dara Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley ","On the NA beverage side, it sounds like the decision to not pursue structural options is more of a permanent one, as opposed to a decision just for now, given the current environment. That could change down the road. Is that the right way to think about the decision? And then also can you give us more insight on how you expect to turn around trends in NA beverages going forward in its current state, given you\u2019re not making structural changes and we\u2019re still seeing weakness here in the market share trends and profitability?","Indra Nooyi","Let\u2019s start off with the performance in 2013. It\u2019s very important to put NAB in context. If you look at measured channel performance, because that\u2019s where we are not disadvantaged, because in the past, clearly in food service we were disadvantaged. In [unintelligible], which is measured channels, we actually held value share versus our primary competitor in 2013.","So we feel very good about that. This is focus on value share. We\u2019ve got price realization. We\u2019ve played the game very responsibly, which is what you do when categories are going through the volatility that LRB was going through. And importantly, in many subsegments of the LRB business, we gained share. And even within CSDs, products like Mountain Dew did exceedingly well.","So I\u2019d say that the core metrics on LRB performance are trending upwards. On food service, which is, as you know, a good size of the market, these are long term contracts, and you\u2019ve got to enter those markets very, very carefully. And where we did bid on food service accounts, we did win them. And so we feel good about the fact that our integrated portfolio of snacks and beverages is now giving us some wins, and I think this has term run rate for growth, and we feel good about that too. ","So park that core performance aside. Let me now talk about our decision. We studied North American beverages and beverages in total in our portfolio exhaustively. We spent a whole year looking at this, and there isn\u2019t a stone that we didn\u2019t turn over. And I\u2019ll tell you, at the end of the day, we concluded that long term value is maximized with NAB staying in PepsiCo\u2019s portfolio.","I think it\u2019s very, very important we return to focusing on running the business, minimizing the disruption, but more importantly, I think it would help hugely if we could just let our North American beverage business employees focus on running the business as opposed to worrying about what the future is going to be.","I think the study we\u2019ve done was exhaustive. There isn\u2019t a bank or consultant that we didn\u2019t use that had an idea. And at the end of the day, we have to go off and run the business. It\u2019s a great business, big, profitable. It generates a lot of cash. ","Yet there are segments of that business, large segments of the business, going through a secular change. We have to reinvent it with technology. We will start launching products this year with the Stevia\/sugar combination non-cola products, while we test the cola products with these combinations in some markets of the world.","So I think we have to allow this transformation to play out, because it\u2019s too big a business, and too profitable a business, not to allow the transformation to play out. So the long answer to your question is, yes, the decision has been made. We\u2019re going to go back to operating it.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. ","Bryan Spillane - Bank of America","Just a follow up to Dara\u2019s question, I guess I would be interested to know, as you went through the analysis on North American beverages, you know, the market\u2019s changed a lot, right? The channels are changing and blurring. Potential to sell product over the internet. Coke is going to experiment with more single serve product or potential for single serve product at home. So that, plus the potential to use technology to change the production in manufacturing, make it more efficient. ","How do you fit your franchise bottlers into that changing market? Is the next step here, or an important step, to really improve NAB, to make some changes with the way you interact with the franchisees, to get the franchisees to sort of come along as you kind of bring them into a different world, a more modern world? Do the franchisees become an impediment, or in some way how are you going to change the way you interact with them? ","Indra Nooyi ","It\u2019s a great question, and in a way, you explained why it\u2019s critically important that you own the system, because with the amount of disruptive change coming, you\u2019ve got to reduce the friction in the system so that you can actually go with the flow. Having said that, on the online, shipping things through various fulfillment companies, we are looking at all of that and in fact doing tests with all of them.","In terms of single serve products at home, we are participating with multiple single serve home delivery product tests, and I think it\u2019s very important that we ultimately commit and play with people where we know the technology is working. I think it\u2019s too premature to commit without having a technology that actually works. ","And finally, you know, our franchise bottlers are also seeing all the changes. We have a good relationship with our franchise bottlers. I think [unintelligible] has done a terrific job building the relationships with the franchise bottlers. And they\u2019re seeing the changing environment too. And they want to work with us to make sure that together we grow the overall franchise.","So I think this is not about conflict. This is about how we work together to solve a market disruption, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re going through right now. The good news is that 75% of the system, we own. So we have far fewer bottlers to deal with, and they\u2019re all smaller bottlers. We don\u2019t have the overhang of a big independent bottler to deal with anymore.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Faucher with JPMorgan.","John Faucher - JPMorgan ","Hugh, could you talk a little bit about your earnings target? Instead of giving a range, you gave sort of a 7% number here. So can you talk about this? Is this sort of 7% plus or minus? And then to sort of keep on the North American beverage bandwagon here, but a little more micro, can you talk a little bit about how you guys are perceiving the pricing environment, less so in terms of what we\u2019re seeing in the market right now, but more so what you guys are building in heading into the summer selling season?","Indra Nooyi ","On the North American beverage pricing, we\u2019ve said very clearly that we intend to play a very responsible game. We\u2019ve got a couple of points of price [unintelligible] last year, and our goal is to make sure that we take the price increases that we have to, because in categories that are going through the kind of change that the cola category and CSDs is going through, particularly, it\u2019s very important that we don\u2019t take down pricing. Because a lot of the research is showing that just taking down pricing is not going to drive consumption. ","So it\u2019s very important that we execute responsible pricing, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing. A couple of points of pricing going forward is really what we\u2019re looking for in North American beverages. And with that, let me turn to Hugh to talk about the earnings target.  ","Hugh Johnston ","Obviously we give long term guidance of high single-digits in order to be as transparent as we can in terms of what we think the portfolio is capable of generating. And then as we get to the beginning of the year, we really try to give you a four quarter target as best we can estimate in this volatile, uncertain world of what we think is a likely delivery. This year, as we looked at that, we pinned 7% as the likely number, and I know it sounds specific, but I think our investors appreciate the specificity in terms of what we do. As we go through the year, we\u2019ll update on that, as the year progresses and as the world evolves. But when we say 7%, we\u2019re saying 7%. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ali Dibadj from Bernstein.","Ali Dibadj - Bernstein ","The first is just if you could quantify the Mexico tax effects? Because if we look for 2014, better taxes, better buybacks, better cost cutting, you can kind of model commodity to currencies, but Mexico quantification we have trouble with. ","But the second question is a broader one. You guys today, Dr. Pepper [unintelligible] yesterday, both with guidance that was really tough on top line but very significant cost cutting, to get to kind of mid-single digit type FX growth rates. Do you think that this kind of running very fast on cost cutting, more return to shareholders, is going to become, essentially, the new norm in this industry, especially to your earlier comment that where pricing is not up as much as it probably should be? ","And if that\u2019s the case, and I kind of think it is, but if that\u2019s the case, can you give us a sense of what you think your ongoing, not just EPS growth target is, but kind of almost a TSR, so EPS plus dividend, that investors should think about in this new industry norm?","Indra Nooyi ","I\u2019m going to let Hugh give you some information on the details of the question that you asked about, and then I\u2019m going to give you some overall observations.","Hugh Johnston ","First, regarding your question on Mexico, obviously this is a difficult one for us even with all the information that we have to ascertain, because what it\u2019s created is a substantial price increase to consumers in the Mexican marketplace regarding our products. Further, obviously, Mexican consumers are facing significant price increases across a broad variety of their baskets. So our traditional elasticity models just don\u2019t extend out to the size of the price increases that people are seeing. ","We\u2019ve obviously put a number in as a part of the guidance. I think what we\u2019ll do instead of sharing specific numbers right now is, as the situation evolves, as consumers get through the sticker shock of what they\u2019re facing and we settle into what is a new demand level, I think we\u2019ll probably just update you quarter to quarter on what\u2019s happening inside of Mexico. So I think that\u2019s probably the most efficient way to communicate this, because it is a challenge right now for everyone to sort out what the likely impact is in Mexico.","Regarding your broader question, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve entered a new era of cost cutting alone. I think it\u2019s always going to be a balancing act in our space. Certainly our geographic and product portfolio provide us with the opportunity to grow the top line in a pretty reasonable way, hence the mid-single digit long term guidance. That said, we will certainly always look to be more efficient with the resources that we have, some of which we\u2019ll deliver to the bottom line, some of which we will invest in capability and invest in innovation and brand building in order to fuel that top line growth to continue the virtuous cycle.","Regarding TSR, we\u2019ve talked about high single-digit as our long term earnings per share growth target. Obviously we\u2019ve taken the dividend up and those tend to be pretty permanent, and that\u2019s north of 3% right now in terms of the yield. So I think that\u2019s reasonable math for you to be working with. That\u2019s certainly our best estimation as a management team.","Indra Nooyi ","And I think, just in terms of overall observation, I would say now\u2019s the time that we have to keep growing in emerging and developing markets. You can\u2019t back off that growth, because all the competitive positions are being established. So as you grow rapidly in emerging and developing markets, the margin profile is different, and cost inflation is very different than it is in developed markets. ","You have a slowdown in developed markets and you have continued [unintelligible] growth in emerging and developing markets. In terms of the overall portfolio, you\u2019ve got to make sure that you look at the dilutive effect of the emerging and developing market growth and offset that with increased productivity so overall the portfolio works. ","And that\u2019s the whole portfolio play that we\u2019re focused on, but it\u2019s very important that you don\u2019t talk about it as cost cutting. Because if you cut costs for the sake of cost cutting, it\u2019s very different than meaningful productivity programs to fundamentally change the cost basis of the company. ","So when we talk about a productivity program, we think, okay, we put in the SAP system starting in 2002, we now have more visibility, we can harmonize processes, so we can do shared services, or we can ensure compliance when we lift and shift ideas. So it\u2019s got to be a very deliberate program to fundamentally take the cost structure to a new level, not just cut costs to deliver one year of earnings growth.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank.","Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank ","Obviously 2013 was a terrific year for Frito, both in terms of growth and market share. So could you just give us some indication as to what\u2019s coming in 2014? And then obviously a lot of that growth was driven by a terrific step up, especially North America, in marketing spending. So do you still intend to obviously increase that [unintelligible] in 2014? ","And then one very quick one after that. Do you have any interest in home carbonation? Obviously the Green Mountain Coke partnership was announced, and I know Bryan asked about it briefly, but I didn\u2019t hear a response.","Indra Nooyi ","We\u2019ll try to answer both your questions. The first, on Frito Lay North America, you\u2019re absolutely right. Frito Lay North America had a terrific year, but let\u2019s just talk about the Frito journey. From about 2011 to 2012, those years, we revamped Frito Lay. ","We re-looked at the insights model. We tried to understand what was going on in the consumer landscape. How should we think about our product positioning, our brands, which composition to go after, this was a fundamental relook at everything we did at Frito Lay. We re-looked at the costs, [unintelligible] really took root during that time.","And in 2012, we stepped up investment behind this whole model on demand spaces and insight that we had worked on. So we\u2019re beginning to see the benefits of that in 2013. And you\u2019ll see more of that going into 2014, 2015, and 2016, because we have the entire macro snacks space that we can go after with our strong salty snack base. And that\u2019s our plan, to selectively go after certain demand moments with the salty snack base that we have.","The good news is that a lot of that insight work, the demand spaces work, that was done at Frito Lay we are now taking to beverages. And since 2013, we\u2019ve been working at fine tuning the beverages insights engine so it can get to the Frito Lay North America level. So we have great optimism for how this whole North American business is going to think about consumers, brand, innovation, demand growth. I think the future looks good.","Let\u2019s now talk about in-home carbonation. The way you should think about this is another distribution channel for carbonated beverages, or sparkling beverages. GMCR is one option. Interestingly, there are multiple, multiple, multiple technologies out there. ","What we\u2019ve been sorting through, I\u2019d say for at least 12 months, is making sure that we don\u2019t lock and load with any technology until the technology has proven out. There\u2019s going to be one technology today that\u2019s functioning, but it\u2019s based on a system that\u2019s very different than what GMCR is thinking about launching. But we have to make sure that we align with partners who we are sure will commercialize the product. So we are working with multiple people. Stay tuned.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs. ","Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs","When I look at your revenue target for 2014, it\u2019s mid-single digits, so that\u2019s in line with your long term target, which is different than your EPS target that\u2019s at the low end of your long term target. So I just want to get an understanding of, within your revenue growth target, you have confidence in high single to low double-digit growth that you expect to see in your emerging markets. And just maybe a little bit more color around your key markets. What are you expecting from markets like Russia, China, etc.? ","And Hugh, just on the currency guidance, I just wanted to understand what you\u2019re baking in for Venezuela? ","Indra Nooyi ","I\u2019ll just talk to you about overall emerging and developing markets rather than individual countries. I\u2019ll tell you, taken together, and it\u2019s very important that we look at emerging and developing markets as a portfolio, because in any one year you\u2019re going to see some markets go through volatility and other markets perform well. If you look over the last 10 years, that\u2019s been the case.","And so I don\u2019t think we should pick out any individual country. When something goes up, something else goes down. So as a portfolio, in emerging and developing markets, we\u2019ll deliver the kind of numbers that we talked about. We feel fairly confident. Barring any major crisis, which we do not anticipate, we think our emerging and developing markets will deliver the numbers that we talked about. ","On Venezuela? ","Hugh Johnston ","Judy, as you know, Venezuela is certainly an interesting and challenging environment right now. You know, there are two rates out there. There\u2019s the 6.3 rate and then the 11 rate. We haven\u2019t seen any \u201cofficial\u201d devaluation yet out of Venezuela. The planning assumption that we\u2019re using, based on the blend of the two rates, is 10. So that\u2019s our operating assumption right now. Obviously, until the valuation comes, if it comes, we haven\u2019t run it through the balance sheet yet, but that\u2019s our planning assumption right now. ","Operator","And our final question comes from the line of Mark Schwartzberg with Stifel Nicolaus. ","Mark Schwartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus","Question about how you\u2019re thinking about the balance sheet and the leverage. Nice to see the return of cash exceeding the free cash flow. What do you think of having some sort of EBITDA target, a 2.5 or even a 3x target? Or how are you thinking beyond \u201914, treating the leverage, given the more aggressive approach to returning cash?","Hugh Johnston ","What we talked about, rather than getting into specific leverage targets and specific long term ratings targets, is maintaining access to tier one commercial paper. I think that\u2019s the best way for us to think about it, because for a company that generates a lot of cash, for a company that has an excellent business rating from the various rating agencies, tier one CP access is really the thing we\u2019ll probably manage to more than anything else. So that\u2019s the way we\u2019re thinking about it on a go-forward basis, rather than getting into specific leverage targets or long term ratings targets. ","Operator","We have time for one additional question. Our final question comes from Caroline Levy from CLSA.","Caroline Levy - CLSA ","Just a question, which I think I know the answer to, but I have to ask it again. Given that you\u2019ve got this valuable distribution system and the fastest growing carbonated drink out there right now is still in the energy category, do you still rule out the idea of acquisitions?","Indra Nooyi ","Yes.","Caroline Levy - CLSA ","Can you explain why? Because you\u2019re not participating in this business that appears to have legs. Do you think you can go after it in another way?","Indra Nooyi ","Mountain Dew Kickstart is our version of the energy drink that\u2019s right for the masses. And we distribute other energy drinks. Caroline, I\u2019ll tell you something, we\u2019ve looked at this category long and hard, and we look at what we can do with those businesses, and whether it\u2019s value creating for shareholders, if we were to make any acquisition, and all our analysis says it will not. And so we\u2019ve chosen not to do an acquisition here.","Hugh Johnston ","And Caroline, if I can add to that as well. From the standpoint of the energy category, I think you\u2019re aware that we do have a distribution arrangement with Rock Star. That is a distribution arrangement that\u2019s worked very well for them and it\u2019s worked very well for us. And that is our play in the energy category in North America. Mountain Dew Kickstart plays around the energy space, but it\u2019s not in the energy space, in a similar way that Starbucks Frappuccino and iced coffee and other potential innovations go down that path as well. So I think we have a full complement of products to meet the energy need space for consumers, and I think we\u2019re positioned well.","Indra Nooyi ","Thank you all for your questions. In closing, we delivered on our financial goals for 2013. We have confidence in our ability to meet our goals for 2014. Our portfolio positions us well for future growth and at the same time provides attractive shareholder cash returns.","I thank you for your time this morning, and for the confidence you\u2019ve placed in us with your investments. Have a good day. "],"16867":["PepsiCo, Inc.

(Operator Instructions) Today\u2019s call is being recorded and will be archived at www.pepsico.com. It is now my pleasure to introduce Mr. Jamie Caulfield, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Caulfield, you may begin.","Jamie Caulfield","Thank you, operator. With me today are Indra Nooyi, PepsiCo\u2019s Chairman and CEO; and Hugh Johnston, PepsiCo\u2019s CFO. We will lead off today\u2019s call with a review of our third quarter 2014 performance and outlook and then we will move on to Q&A. We have kept our comments brief this morning and intend to conclude the call by 08:45 and we will do our best to get to as many of your questions as we can.","Before we begin, please take note of our cautionary statement. This conference call includes forward-looking statements, including statements regarding 2014 guidance and our long-term targets based on currently available information. Forward-looking statements inherently involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those predicted in such forward-looking statements. Statements made on this conference call should be considered together with cautionary statements and other information contained in today\u2019s earnings release and in our most recent periodic reports filed with the SEC.","Unless otherwise indicated, all references to EPS and operating profit growth are on a core basis. In addition, references to organic revenue results in this call exclude the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, structural changes and foreign exchange translation. To find disclosures and reconciliations of non-GAAP measures that we use when discussing PepsiCo\u2019s financial results, you should refer to the glossary and other attachments to this morning\u2019s earnings release and to the Investors section of PepsiCo\u2019s website under the Events & Presentations tab.","As we discuss today\u2019s results, please keep in mind that our third quarter comprises the 12 weeks ended September 6, for our North American operations in the months of June, July and August for most of our operations outside North America. As you saw in the release, we are no longer reporting PepsiCo Americas Foods as a business unit. Consistent with our prior practice, we continue to report results for the divisions that had comprised PAF, namely Frito-Lay North America, Quaker Foods North America, and Latin America Foods. This change does not have any impact on the overall results of PepsiCo or these divisions. Also reflected in our Q3 2014 core earnings results are aggregate gains associated with the divestitures of approximately $34 million and a $23 million impairment of a brand in Greece.","Now, it\u2019s my pleasure to introduce Indra Nooyi.","Indra Nooyi","Thank you, Jamie and good morning everyone. We are pleased with our results for the quarter and year-to-date, particularly given the continued macro challenges we see across the globe. Specifically in developed markets, the consumer category demand continues to be sluggish and in developing and emerging markets, there is continued macro and political volatility, most notably in Eastern Europe, the Middle East and a number of markets in Latin America. In other key emerging markets, China, India and Brazil even though the political environments are relatively stable, GDP and consumer spending growth remains mixed.","Despite these challenges, our businesses performed well in the third quarter and year-to-date. Global volume grew in both snacks and beverages in the quarter and year-to-date. Organic net revenue grew at a rate ahead of volume in the quarter and year-to-date reflecting execution of effective revenue management strategies and successful introduction of innovative new products.","In the quarter, organic revenue grew 3.1% with developing and emerging markets up high single-digits led by key contributions from the BRIC markets. And notably, our developing and emerging markets business has proven to be resilient with high single-digit organic revenue growth year-to-date, including double-digit growth in Egypt and India, high single-digit growth in China, Brazil and Turkey, and mid single-digit growth in Russia.","In North America, Frito-Lay led performance with 3% organic revenue growth in the quarter and year-to-date. And core gross and operating margins both expanded by 45 basis points in the quarter aided by the benefits of our global productivity initiatives. Year-to-date, core gross margin expanded 50 basis points and core operating margin expanded 35 basis points.","Overall, core constant currency EPS grew 11% in the quarter driven by the solid operating performance supplemented by responsible financial management. Importantly, these results have translated to strong cash generation and consequently strong cash returns to shareholders. Returning capital to shareholders is a top priority and we are pleased to report that year-to-date we have returned $6 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases and we remain on track to return a total of $8.7 billion to shareholders in 2014, which is a 35% increase over our 2013 shareholder cash returns.","Based on the strength of our year-to-date results and our outlook for the fourth quarter, we raised our full year core constant currency EPS growth target to 9% from 8% previously. We believe our year-to-date performance is a good reflection of the strength of our business. In today\u2019s difficult environment, retailers value the benefits of partners with strong brands and high velocity products that drive traffic, build basket size and generate attractive cash flow. And that\u2019s exactly why our retail partners like to do business with PepsiCo. And as a company, we continue to strengthen our business to position it for continued successful performance well into the future. And we are encouraged by the progress we are making in three areas, in particular: first, leveraging our complementary product portfolio and global scale; second, product and packaging innovation; and third, productivity.","So, let me give you a quick update on each of these areas and share some of the tangible evidence we are seeing as proof of our progress starting with how we are increasingly leveraging the complementary nature of our products and brands. A case in point is Mountain Dew and Doritos. Dew and Doritos have extremely high co-purchase incidence. In the U.S., over 60% of Mountain Dew households buy Doritos. Both brands are deeply rooted in gaming with legacies of high engagement partnerships and activations around Blockbuster video games. In the U.S. this fall, Dew and Doritos are giving consumers access to Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare. They are going to give them exclusive in-game gear, double XP and rapid supply rewards.","And all of this is to dial up their gaming experience. Only Mountain Dew and Doritos consumers will be able to unlock these coveted advantages and customize their gaming experience through the Fuel Up for Battle promotion. A number of our largest customers will run better together programs linked to this promotion and we are concurrently reintroducing on a limited time basis a true gamer favorite, Mountain Dew Game Fuel, in original citrus cherry and a new lemonade flavor.","Across many of our international markets, we are focused on driving greater co-purchase incidence of Lays and Pepsi with joint packaging graphics, sports properties, point-of-sale material, ad copy and promotions. These cross branding activations are now taking place in many of our key markets across the globe. For example, Poland, we created excitement for the Lays brand by hiding coupons for 100,000 free Pepsi\u2019s in bags. The promotion was supported by ads and point-of-sale material featuring the soccer great Lionel Messi.","Similarly in Colombia, we ran joint Lays, Pepsi and Tropicana Quaker soccer team promotions offering discounts and prized for joint purchases in the organized way. And across the Middle East, we had great success of our joint Lays Pepsi promotions during the Ramadan season. In addition to the commercial benefits afforded by these cross category promotions, we continued to yield cost synergies through continued integration. For example, integrating our snack and beverage media sourcing in China, fully consolidating and integrating our administrative functions under one roof in Russia and consolidating common carriers for snacks and beverages in the more rural regions of India, so that\u2019s the better together story.","The second area is product and package innovation. We continued to make very good progress. As evidenced on a rolling four quarter basis our innovation as a percentage of sales is steadily increasing and is up 90 basis points versus the comparable year ago period. And in our biggest markets, the United States, we were the largest contributor to retail sales food and beverage growth both in the third quarter and year-to-date which really benefited from the strength of our innovation. And we are seeing innovation success across brands and geographies. For example, at Frito-Lay North America we launched our 2014 Lays Do Us a Flavor campaign. And this followed its past success in the U.S. and 12 other markets around the globe. This year\u2019s consumer submitted finalists are Cappuccino, Cheddar Bacon Mac & Cheese, Mango Salsa and Wasabi Ginger hot bite. This program helped to drive strong mid-single digit Lays net revenue growth in the third quarter.","At Quaker Foods North America we have launched Quaker Express Cups to capitalize on the ever growing demand for greater on-the-go convenience. And Quaker Warm & Crunchy Granola which delivers both the wholesome goodness of Quaker oatmeal and the satisfying crunch of multigrain Granola. So while center of the store category growth remains challenged the success of these and other new products launched by Quaker have contributed to value share gains in each of Quaker\u2019s key categories Hot Cereal, Ready-To-Eat Cereal and Snack Bars both in the quarter and year-to-date.","Our North American beverage business has strong innovation in both product and packaging. Over the past several years we have significantly increased the variety of primary and secondary package configurations. With greater packaging flexibility we now have more tools in our kit to drive price utilization and higher margins through the price back management. The case in point is our 12 ounce glass bottle which sells at more than 100% premium with 12 ounce can. And our innovation has become increasingly more durable. For example, a number of 2012 and 2013 introductions Tostitos Cantina, Mountain Dew Kickstart, Lipton Pure Leaf have all achieved more than $100 million in retail sales in their launch year and have generated double-digit retail sales growth in their second year. Our beverage product and packaging innovation in the U.S. has led to improved sales, improved net price utilization and improved market share performance.","We held LRB value share in measured channels in the third quarter and year-to-date, held CSDs at retail in the third quarter led by trademark Mountain Dew and gained or held value share in a number of important sub-categories including CSDs, sports drinks, ready-to-drink tea and unflavored water. And in our international markets we are both leveraging our global scale and capitalizing on local insights to fuel innovation. For example, within snacks since its initial U.S. introduction in 2012, Doritos Jacked has launched in 10 international markets. We also lifted and shifted a larger and thicker cut chip with deep ridges which originated from our Ruffles brand and lunched it into several key countries such as Russia, Brazil, the Middle East and India under the Lays Max brand. And in the UK, we launched a new range of premium potato, tortilla and pita chips under the Market Deli brand. The Market Deli brand really caters to local taste preferences with flavors such as balsamic vinegar of Modena and Wiltshire cured ham, mature cheddar and farmhouse chutney.","Within beverages, the SPIRE family of digital fountain dispensers continues to build momentum. Currently, SPIRE is in the United States, Canada, France, Turkey, Ireland and Switzerland. The equipment capabilities range from pouring 8 brands and 4 flavor shots to a maximum of 16 brands and 8 flavor shots resulting in over 1,000 flavor combinations. And the global expansion of our highly successful Mountain Dew franchise continues. The brand has expanded to two new markets in 2014 and it is now available in over 40 countries around the world. And we have built terrific brand recognition with the continued expansion of our DEWmocracy and Dew Tour support programs.","And finally, turning to productivity, we achieved our targeted productivity savings for the third quarter and year-to-date and we are on track to achieve a full year target of $1 billion in savings. This year, we expect to successfully complete the 3-year $3 billion productivity program we launched in 2012 and we are now focused on our next generation\u2019s 5-year $5 billion productivity program announced earlier this year, which we expect will extend annual savings of $1 billion through 2019.","Our next generation productivity will focus on four areas: first, embedding more automation in our operations to replace labor with capital and at the same time removing bottlenecks from our operations, which will increase capacity utilization; second, expanding shared services, including global financial shared services for the handling of routine back office transaction processing; third, restructuring manufacturing to optimize our global manufacturing footprint; and fourth, restructuring our go-to-market systems to optimize our distribution network. As a result of these initiatives, we expect to see continued improvement in net revenue and core earnings before interest and taxes per employee as well as margin expansions and increase returns in invested capital.","So, to conclude, we feel pretty good about our results for the quarter and year-to-date. We remain focused on generating cash and providing attractive cash returns to our shareholders and we are encouraged by the continued progress we have made to strengthen our business, which we expect will make our performance all the more durable and reliable looking to the future.","With that, let me turn the call over to Hugh Johnston. Hugh?","Hugh Johnston","Great, thank you Indra and good morning, everyone. Let me spend a few minutes discussing the quarter and our upwardly revised core constant currency earnings per share outlook for 2014. For Q3, organic revenue grew 3%. On a reported basis, net revenue was 2% versus year ago, reflecting 1 point of unfavorable foreign exchange translation. Commodity costs had low single-digit inflation. Our core gross margin and core operating margin each rose 45 basis points. Core constant currency operating profit grew 5.5%. Our core effective tax rate was 24.2%. Our diluted share count declined 2% reflecting the benefits of our ongoing share repurchase program and core constant currency EPS grew 11%.","On a rolling four quarter basis, our net capital spending is 4.1% of sales, which is well within our long-term target of less than or equal to 5% of net revenue and our core net return on invested capital improved by approximately 40 basis points and now stands at 16.9%. And we returned $6 billion to shareholders in the first three quarters in the form of dividends and share repurchases, which is almost 30% above year ago levels and reflective of our commitment to return cash to shareholders.","Turning to guidance, as Indra mentioned, we have increased our full year core constant currency EPS growth target to 9%, up from 8% previously. In addition for the full year, we expect mid single-digit organic revenue growth, low single-digit commodity inflation and productivity savings of approximately $1 billion. Below the division operating profit line, we expect corporate cost efficiencies driven by productivity initiatives, a core effective tax rate of approximately 25% and a reduced share count from our share repurchase program. Foreign exchange is expected to negatively impact net revenue by 3 percentage points and core earnings per share by 4 percentage points for the full year 2014 based on current market consensus rates. Taking our 2013 core EPS of $4.37 and applying our guidance implies a 2014 core EPS of approximately $4.57.","As you model out the fourth quarter, I would ask you to consider the following. We expect advertising and marketing expense to grow at a rate ahead of net revenue growth. And below the operating profit line, net interest expense is expected to increase in the fourth quarter, primarily reflecting higher debt balances and higher rates. From a cash flow perspective, we continue to expect full year free cash flow excluding certain items of more than $7 billion. We will continue to drive cash flow through efficient working capital management and continued tight controls over capital spending. Net capital spending is expected to be approximately $3 billion, which is well within our long-term target of less than or equal to 5% of net revenue. And we expect to return approximately $8.7 billion to shareholders in 2014, a 35% increase over 2013 through $3.7 billion in dividends and $5 billion in share repurchases.","So, to summarize, we have increased our core constant currency EPS growth outlook for the full year 2014 to 9% from 8% previously. We expect to drive improved full year margins and net ROIC and disciplined capital allocation and returning cash to shareholders remain top priorities for the company.","With that, operator, we will take the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch.","Bryan Spillane - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Hi, good morning.","Indra Nooyi","Good morning, Bryan.","Bryan Spillane - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","A question just about the balance between reinvestment in the business and the focus on productivity and dropping it to the bottom line, if you look at this quarter\u2019s results, the results over the course of the year and really beginning last year, it\u2019s been a pretty good balance of maintaining a good relative organic sales growth relative to lot of your competitors and peers with also driving some margin improvement? And I guess as you move into this next productivity program and also just some of the challenges you are facing I guess in some key markets, developing markets at least in the next year, macro challenges. Can you just sort of give us a sense for how you feel about that current balance of investment in A&M, in R&D, in selling effectiveness or selling systems versus dropping some of that to the bottom line? Do you feel like you have the right balance and especially as things maybe get a little bit more challenging in some of these markets, do you feel like you might have to tweak that balance into next year?","Indra Nooyi","Bryan, it\u2019s a great question. And at this point, I\u2019d say we feel good about the balance. We increased A&M spending. We are running at about 5.9% of sales. We increased R&D spending significantly over the past 3 to 4 years, because we really believe that investing in R&D in particular is critical to the future success of the company and we invested in that. We invested in foodservice equipment. That\u2019s why the SPIRE equipments come out and is very successful today. So, at this point, we feel good about the investments we are making in product line transformation, media spending, advertising spending against our brands, and most importantly, long-term investment in R&D platforms. I agree with you that there is volatility in the world. And as we sort of model out 2015 and beyond, we will come back and talk about what the outlook is for the financials, but at this point, we feel comfortable with what we have articulated in terms of the long-term algorithm for the company and we feel comfortable about our productivity programs. So, I think we have to watch and wait.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Faucher with JPMorgan.","John Faucher - JPMorgan","Thanks. I wanted to follow-up on \u2013 good morning Indra. I want to follow-up on some of the comments about raw materials, but also sort of start off with pricing in that context which is getting a lot of pricing in Latin America which is helping the organic revenue number. And I guess can you talk a little bit about what you have seen from a real pricing standpoint in Latin America not just related to the FX. And then as you look out over the next sort of 12 to 18 months on raw materials, have you \u2013 we have seen some favorable movements in things like corn or are you guys still sort of continuing that process of trying to capture some of that benefits through the hedging, can you talk about how we should look at that going forward? Thanks.","Indra Nooyi","Go ahead Hugh.","Hugh Johnston","Yes, happy to. Hey John, it\u2019s Hugh. In terms of the Latin America numbers, we are obviously as is everyone else in this space benefiting from the relatively high overall inflationary environment there, what I can tell you is we are getting positive real pricing there and it is in line with what you would see the commodities basket cost growing in those markets. So if you look at it more from a global perspective and think about commodities inflation from a global perspective, we are getting pricing in line with that on a more real basis. Regarding your broader question on commodities without a doubt the commodities numbers overall are coming down. The couple of facts I would remind you on that. Number one, we have a very, very broad basket not one commodity accounts for even 10% of our overall commodities basket. Number two we do continue to follow the forward buying strategy that we have had in the past, so we tend to be about six to nine months out. So as those prices come down we will tend to see them reflected in our basket over time. We do that again because we want to give the businesses and our customers pricing predictability, I mean it\u2019s been an effective strategy for us over the last few years.","And number three, people tend to focus on a few market traded commodities, those market traded commodities represents somewhere between 30% or 40% of our overall basket. So I am not sure often times that the market focused commodities give a full picture of it. In terms of 2015 as it\u2019s been our practice in the past we will comment on that in February timeframe because we think that\u2019s the right time to give guidance to investors overall and we won\u2019t try to parse out the pieces right now because it tends to create more confusion than benefit.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ali Dibadj with Bernstein.","Ali Dibadj - Bernstein","Hey guys.","Indra Nooyi","Good morning Ali.","Ali Dibadj - Bernstein","So your organic sales growth was about 3% which translated to the core constant currency operating profit of about 5.5% and an EPS growth of about 11% and if you look at the gaps between top line operating profit and EPS growth rates seems to be widening more and more as the quarters progress here. So can you please give us a quantification of first how much of the operating profit to sales gap was negative commodities and negative mix versus cost cutting positive and acquisition divesture is positive which for some reason you guys keep considering core. And second how sustainable is the operating profit to EPS growth gap driven by lower net interest expense even though there is a little bit of higher debt it looks like the lower net interest expense and buyback and the spirit of the question to understand sustainability of these gaps? Thanks.","Indra Nooyi","Thanks Ali. I am going to have Hugh walk you through the details and I presume the first thing you are saying is it\u2019s good that PepsiCo is delivering good results. So with that let me turn it to you Hugh.","Hugh Johnston","Yes, absolutely Indra. So if you look over the last three quarters we have seen operating profit growth on a core constant currency basis of 7%, 3% and 5.5%. We have seen EPS growth of 10%, 3% and 11%. So I think that gap has been actually relatively constant over the course of the timeframe. What are the drivers between operating profit growth and EPS you really have three things going on? Interest cost without a doubt we are getting some leverage on that. The only thing that I would want to share on that front is we are operating right now in a zero net floating debt environment. We do have some floating debt but that is offset by floating cash held outside the U.S.","So, I think from the standpoint of rising interest rates, we are relatively well protected compared to most of our peer companies in that regard. Obviously like everyone else, we would have some refinancing over time, but I think we have adopted a relatively conservative posture on the way that we are managing fixed float within the balance sheet. Number two, taxes are really coming in for the year right as we expected and that\u2019s been a bit of a benefit for this year. And then number three, our share repurchase is obviously lowering the share count and that\u2019s driving some of the gap from operating profit to EPS. We won\u2019t talk about 2015 right now, but obviously as a company we have a long history of share repurchase and I would certainly expect we would continue that going forward.","Indra Nooyi","In terms of sustainability, Hugh, I mean our long-term guidance has been mid single-digit operating profit and high single-digit EPS. And that\u2019s really the envelope in which we are operating.","Hugh Johnston","Absolutely.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.","Indra Nooyi","Good morning, Dara.","Dara Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley","Hey, good morning guys. So, Frito-Lay organic revenue growth improved a bit sequentially in the quarter, but the 3% result is still below the 4% to 5% levels we were seeing over the prior year and a half before Q2\u2019s result. Is \u2013 do you think this level is kind of more like a new normal here in your mind given the difficult consumer environment or do you think you can accelerate that business going forward? And can you discuss Frito-Lay market share performance in North America, it looks like you are still losing slight share in track channels and your expectations going forward from a market share standpoint?","Indra Nooyi","Yes. Dara, I think overall in Q3, food industry sales in retail was challenging. And within that, Frito-Lay performed well, in fact, was the best performer in that group. And sequentially from the first quarter of the year to the third quarter, the share loss has narrowed. Now, let me be clear, the share loss is really to premium players who don\u2019t last for long time in the market people come in and out of the market. And Frito has been very careful not to react to players who are not long-term players in the marketplace. So, Frito has been playing a very, very responsible game. What we have been trying to do at Frito is to say, let\u2019s make the core very solid, deliver on the core and start expanding the shoulders of the business in a profitable way.","And I think Frito in this very difficult environment has done a very good job balancing pound growth, revenue growth and profit growth and that\u2019s why you have seen relatively steady performance from Frito in what I would consider is a very challenging overall retail environment for all kinds of food. I mean, center of the store is particularly challenged, but I would say overall, food industry sales are challenged, but Frito has been a shining star. So, I think overall whether this is a new normal or not I don\u2019t know, it really depends on the overall environment, but within this environment, Frito has been performing quite well and the share losses have been coming down. And we don\u2019t like any share losses, I will be honest with you, but we have to make sure the business behaves very responsibly and that\u2019s what they have been doing.","Hugh Johnston","And in terms of addressing those premium innovation opportunities, we have been building more capability. You see products like Stacy\u2019s Pretzel Crisps, you see products like Smartfood Selects, all of which are entering that premium space and to-date we have been quite successful with them. So, we would certainly expect to see that aspect improving over time.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank.","Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank","Hi, good morning.","Indra Nooyi","Good morning, Bill.","Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank","Hey, the first one is just sort of like a curiosity question, because currencies obviously moved a ton over the last couple of months, but you kept your currency outlook on the EPS line. So, I am just trying to figure out if it was conservative before and now it\u2019s more realistic or how you kept that currency item? And then the second question is just \u2013 and maybe it\u2019s a tough one to answer, but do you guys have a view on some of these contemplated consumption taxes in California? I mean, they sound pretty significant, some of them are couple of cents an ounce and it looks like there is a decent probability they are going to go through, so how do you kind of operate the business in that kind of environment?","Indra Nooyi","I will speak to the second point and then Hugh will speak to the first one. I believe discriminatory taxes on certain categories are just wrong. I think we have to understand what the issue is we are trying to address and address it in a holistic way. We will make our case and hope that the voters are sensible enough to look at the right answer to address whatever issue they are addressing. With that, let me turn it over to Hugh.","Hugh Johnston","Yes. Bill, happy to answer the currency question, we take a basket of market currency rates and we follow the same methodology every quarter. And we have been consistent in taking that approach for quite a number of years. So I don\u2019t think we will change that approach. You are right, in the last couple of quarters it\u2019s come in a little bit lighter than the original forecast but it\u2019s the best way I know of to do it. In addition to that as you all likely know we do hedge some transactional effects of foreign exchange, we do not hedge translation. We don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good use of investors\u2019 money, so we don\u2019t hedge accounting at all, we just take the market consensus rates. And then as the currencies flow we report them to you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mark Swartzberg with Stifel Nicolaus.","Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus","Yes. Thanks. Good morning Indra. Good morning Hugh. A question on the \u2013 it\u2019s also a curiosity question but with the core earnings you are including gains and they are not large this quarter but can you just speak to the principle behind including these gains on asset sales?","Hugh Johnston","Yes, why don\u2019t I handle that one Mark? You are right, in the overall scheme of things there are three items. There is a small gain in the Quaker business related to the sale of a small cereal brand. There is a small gain from a bottling perspective in EMEA. And then there is the write-down of a small brand in Greece from an asset impairment perspective. If you net all of those three factors the grand total was a benefit to earnings of $11 million, so basically less than a penny of impact overall. More broadly, we do have a consistent set of principles we apply in terms of what is core versus non-core in the overall scheme of things it really is not a substantive impact to earnings.","Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus","But what\u2019s the principle behind having them in there, because again it\u2019s not large in the quarter but it could become something we are all talking about if it \u2013 because of the principle being there, if there is a large gain at some point in the future or for that matter a large loss?","Hugh Johnston","Yes.","Indra Nooyi","Mark, most importantly we publicly disclosed exactly what the gains are and if there are any charges against it so you can model out the impact on earnings from our disclosures.","Hugh Johnston","Yes. So and Mark to your point that there is obviously in a company the size of PepsiCo with $66 billion in revenue, 275,000 employees and operating in almost 200 countries there are lots of things that you would consider to be perhaps one-time in nature. The approach that we have taken on this is we have said in terms of a test of core versus non-core is a transaction one-time and then is it of a certain size. If we called everything above $1 million one-time we would be excluding an enormous number of items. So we have drawn a line in terms of the specific number that it equates to core versus non-core that number has been the same for years and we applied consistently in all of these transactions to your point are small but we do disclose them to allow investors to model them anyway they choose.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs.","Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs","Thank you. Good morning.","Indra Nooyi","Good morning Judy.","Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs","So, I guess a lot of just volatility around Europe in terms of the macro and political standpoint, so wanted to just get a little bit more color from your perspective what you are seeing in terms of underlying consumer demand in your various categories in markets like Russia and Eastern Europe. And it looks like your market share in markets like UK despite tough competitive environments actually doing pretty well, so maybe just talk about Russia and Eastern Europe and then separately in the UK in the context of the competitive and tough retail environments?","Indra Nooyi","Let me talk overall about Western Europe and then talk about Russia and Ukraine. I would say when you have poor weather or when you have some macro factor we have to worry about how we perform in that environment. So for example Western Europe volumes in beverage decelerated a bit in Q3 because the weather was poor, but otherwise I would say the overall Western European markets are doing quite well. Yes, we have a retail situation that\u2019s quite interesting in the UK, but our brands are strong and we are powering through that.","When it comes to Russia and Ukraine, again, we sell dairy products, juice as well as snacks and soft drinks. Dairy and juice tend to be much more stable kind of products for Russian consumers. So, even though the Russian market is going through its challenges in terms of the devaluation of the ruble and the hryvnia in Ukraine and also inflation in raw materials for dairy in particular, our top line growth is still mid single-digit. So, we are holding on the top line growth. The real challenge is what\u2019s the impact to the bottom line? A lot of the products we sell in Russia are made in Russia. We sourced a lot of our raw materials from local suppliers. So that part is okay, but anything that\u2019s imported clearly is impacted by the devaluation of the ruble and then any translation of Russian profit is impacted by the devaluation of the ruble. So, at this point, we are watching and waiting and to see how the Russian market evolves, but our growth is still in the mid single-digits and we are doing okay.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets.","Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets","Yes, good morning everyone.","Indra Nooyi","Good morning, Nik.","Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets","Good morning. So, couple of questions from my end. I was just curious if maybe you can provide some context on PAB in terms of how the up and down the street channel did versus kind of the larger format? And if you could provide any perspective on foodservice since you have been investing there so heavily? And then the second question is Indra just curious on your view on execution at the company on bottling operations and if you think that, that is an area of improvement for PepsiCo going forward within the U.S.?","Indra Nooyi","Yes. When it comes to the performance in convenience stores, the overall \u2013 we are holding share in LRB in Q3 and whether it\u2019s in CSDs or isotonics, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, what we feel good about in Q3 is that we held LRB share in this highly competitive marketplace. I think since we bought back the bottlers, we have actually been able to do a few things. One, we have invested in foodservice, because we have put routes back into local foodservice. We are able to go after national accounts without any discussion of bottlers versus the parent company. And as a consequence, we have been winning big accounts and we are beginning to actually increase our shares in colleges and universities and local foodservice accounts. So, I think our foodservice performance is improving. Again, as you know in foodservice, you don\u2019t see big improvements in a short timeframe. You have got to build this business very, very steadily, so that you balance growth with profitable growth. And so I think over the next few years, you start beginning to see meaningful contributions from our foodservice business, one because we are fixing the core beverage foodservice business, which is a critical driver of foodservice and then we are able to leverage that beverage foodservice to sell more snacks. So, the better together really works with foodservice.","And overall execution, we have \u2013 since we have bought back the bottlers we have invested so much in terms of improving our manufacturing lines to have more packaging flexibility. We have put more routes back in the marketplace. We have put in more tools \u2013 given more tools to the frontlines, so that they can actually sell better at the point of sale. I think overall our execution has improved substantially. And that\u2019s why you are seeing several quarters now, where we are holding share in the LRB category and we are doing it in a very responsible way, because we are also able to get pricing. We are getting low single-digit pricing in the marketplace in North America and we are able to push through all our innovation. I mean, the market is fragmenting quite a bit and we have got to have a distribution system that\u2019s completely aligned with the brand company, so that you can get all this innovation into the marketplace. And by removing any friction that exists in the system, we are actually able to get all of our products to the marketplace. So, overall, we feel pretty good about the progress we are making in North American beverages and how well North American beverages and Frito-Lay are working together to really service both retail customers and foodservice customers to help us improve the performance of North American beverages substantially. And in terms of convenience store performance, it\u2019s ahead of overall performance by about 50 basis points.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we have time for one additional question. Your final question comes from the line of Steve Powers with UBS.","Steve Powers - UBS","Thanks. Good morning. I guess two more questions related to PAB if I could. First, we saw a noticeable operating margin expansion in that division this quarter building on some initial progress made last quarter. And I guess just want to get your sense for whether or not you feel this is the beginning of a trend that can continue to gain momentum and assuming so what the biggest drivers will be is kind of question number one. Question two, related to that is as you said Indra we saw again kind of 1% net realized pricing in the quarter which is in line with the year-to-date trend and I guess positive relative to muted commodities, but I was wondering whether you see further upsides of that number over time maybe if the individual categories are actually better than and we are seeing some negative category or geographic mix across the division I am not sure, but just further details there will be helpful as well? Thanks.","Indra Nooyi","Yes. I mean I think what the beverage business is doing is focusing on revenue management and productivity in addition to innovation. Innovation is driving top line growth nicely and getting good price realization. And all of our revenue management initiatives backed up by more packing flexibility is actually helping this business. And remember all of our productivity initiatives touch the North American beverage business too. So taken together the business is beginning to hit its stride and our net realized pricing in the quarter in North American beverages was in the low-single digits. We actually feel very good about the pricing that we have been able to get. Now you asked about the sustainability of this. We will continue to do the revenue management work, the productivity work, the innovation. We will continue to do everything that\u2019s in our control. And we will continue to play a very responsible game in this marketplace. And then we will just see how the marketplace evolves. But at this point we are cautiously optimistic about the outlook for North American beverages.","So let me just close by reiterating that we are pleased with our results to-date. We are confident that our plans are working and we are on track to deliver our financial targets for 2014. I thank you for your time and questions this morning and for the confidence you have placed in us with your investment. Have a wonderful day.","Operator","Thank you.

[Operator Instructions] Today's call is being recorded and will be archived at www.pepsico.com.","It is now my pleasure to introduce Mr. Jamie Caulfield, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Caulfield, please go ahead.","Jamie Caulfield","Thank you, operator. With me today are Indra Nooyi, PepsiCo's Chairman and CEO; and Hugh Johnston, PepsiCo's CFO.","We'll lead off today's call with a review of our third quarter performance and our balance-of-year outlook, and then we'll move on to Q&A.","In an effort to get through as many analysts' questions as possible within the hour, we're doing 2 things today: first, we've shortened the amount of time for management's prepared remarks; and second, we're going to have a one-question limit so we can hopefully get through the full queue of analysts' questions.","Before we begin, please take note of our cautionary statement. This conference call includes forward-looking statements, including statements regarding 2012 guidance based on currently available information. Forward-looking statements inherently involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those predicted in such forward-looking statements.

Nooyi","Thank you, Jamie, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report that we continue to make progress against the plan we shared with you earlier this year.","Let me give you the headlines on our progress for the quarter. Our Asia, Middle East, Africa division had an excellent quarter across-the-board. Europe delivered solid results with very good pricing. Frito-Lay North America and Latin American Foods had good volume growth and net price utilization. And within Pepsi Americas Beverages, we gained value-sharing carbonated beverages while executing a much-needed cleanup of unprofitable segments of our noncarbonated portfolio.","And across our businesses, we continued our stepped-up brand investment programs, heightened focus on innovation, productivity and execution and cash returns to you, our shareholders.","Our financial results for the quarter were in line with our expectations. Core EPS was $1.20. Our 5% organic revenue growth reflected organic volume growth of 1% and positive price mix of 4%, which helped to offset steep commodity inflation. And our organic net revenue growth for the quarter is right in line with our year-to-date performance and they're on track to deliver the mid-single digit organic revenue growth target we shared with you at the beginning of the year.","So overall, our results for the quarter and year-to-date, as well as the outlook for the remainder of the year, are right on track.","So let me comment on each of our business units, share what's working and what we are pleased with and what aspects of the businesses we are still making progress on but remain work in process.","Frito-Lay North America delivered a strong quarter. We saw a 3% organic revenue growth in the quarter, and our brand equity scores continue to strengthen. Our premium products gained share in the quarter, and the increased advertising behind our mainstream products is strengthening our performance. Our value share trends have sequentially improved throughout the year and Q3 was no exception. And as we enter Q4, we are seeing that trend continue.","Our Quaker Foods business also had a good quarter. We are gaining share in hot cereal, driven by both increased advertising and breakthrough innovation with Quaker Medleys. The oatmeal category is very much on trend both in the United States and globally, and you can expect us to leverage our global groups to take innovation like Real Medleys around the world.","Our Latin American Foods business delivered strong volume and double-digit organic revenue growth, and we continue to invest in routes and racks to support the robust growth in these markets.","In Europe, we had strong performance with organic net revenue up 7% on 6 points of net price realization despite a challenging macroeconomic environment. Our performance is a result of both the portfolio strategies that we've executed, including our move to strengthen our presence in the faster-growing eastern European region coupled with good operating execution to capture growth opportunities.","Our AMEA performance for the quarter was outstanding with strong volume growth, double-digit organic revenue growth and 14% core constant-currency operating profit growth. The strong results were across both our snacks and beverages businesses. For example, in India, our snack volume grew 12% and our beverage volume grew 23%. In Pakistan, our snack volume grew 27% and beverage volume grew 25%. Beverage volume grew 34% in Vietnam, 10% in Saudi Arabia and 7% in the Philippines. And in China, the Tingyi integration is substantially complete, and we've seen volume growth accelerating every month since June. The fourth quarter is off to a strong start with CSD volume up 15% in the month of September.","Our North American beverage performance was mixed, some positives and a few areas that are works in progress. As we look at Q3 performance, keep in mind that we had one fewer trading day due to the timing of Labor Day, which impacted volumes by 1 percentage point. On the positive side, I am pleased with the discipline we've maintained on pricing. We achieved 3 points of positive price mix in the quarter. And we are pleased with our carbonated soft drink performance. Based on the IRI all channel data, we gained both value and volume share in the quarter. So even at higher pricing at retail, we grew our volume share. Our brand equity scores are strong, and our brand-building investments are working.","Our noncarbonated beverage performance in North America was more challenged, driven by 3 factors: first, we cleaned up our juice portfolio by pulling out of unprofitable juice drinks; second, we made deliberate decision not to compete in case-packed water at unprofitable pricing levels; and third, Gatorade's performance was off this quarter, which was really a function of competitive pricing actions and an inventory outage at one of our major accounts. Q4 is off to a good start, and we expect the business to be positive for Q4.","So we are being deliberate about where we're choosing to compete and about maintaining disciplined pricing. Our objective is to grow beverages profitably in North America and we're making the right decisions for the long-term health of the business.","Across PepsiCo, we continue to make good progress on the brand building, innovation, execution, productivity and cash-return initiatives that are key elements of our long-term plan.","From a brand perspective, we continue to increase the level of effectiveness of our advertising through our global campaigns by directing more of our spending to consumer-facing media. We are seeing positive results already, but as we've mentioned in the past, these investments typically take a year to fully take hold. We are 6 to 8 months into the program and I'm pleased with our steady improvement in brand-building initiatives. We'll be back to you on the fourth quarter call with another update on the specific brand equity performance just as we did on the second quarter call.","Innovation has been solid across our businesses and was a key driver of our organic net revenue growth in the quarter. Our global beverage, snack and nutrition groups are having a positive impact. They are making good progress in refresh, reframe and breakthrough innovation and that's reflecting the solid top line growth we've seen over the past few quarters and the fact that our innovation, as a percentage of net revenue, is now running at approximately 8% of sales. In particular, I am pleased with breakthrough products like Quaker Real Medley, Pepsi Next and Gatorade Energy Chews, which have continued to steadily build during the quarter. We're on track to deliver in excess of $1 billion in productivity this year and to deliver our 3-year target of $3 billion. We're driving productivity across the entire value chain across all our businesses and have a robust pipeline of projects that span from best practice sharing to increased automation to new processing technology, which all give us confidence that we will achieve our 3-year target.","And we continue to execute well. A good example is our activation of our partnership with the NFL. We are building on our 28-year relationship with the NFL, one of the world's most valuable sports properties. We are integrating on execution activities from national advertising to localized packaging, in-store activities and promotions. The national ties between the NFL and PepsiCo are happening across our portfolio, from Gatorade to Pepsi and Lay's to even Quaker and we're leveraging them both using traditional and social media. And at the local level, we're bringing them to life in the marketplace with team-specific packaging and merchandising displays in 22 of 32 team markets. We also have retail store managing incentives and player appearances right through to the stadium with beverage and snack time promotions. In short, the connection between the NFL and PepsiCo is bigger and better than ever and enabling us to convert fans' passion for their teams into passion for our products.","We'll cap off the season's partnership with the NFL by having Pepsi as the official sponsor of the Super Bowl's halftime show. And just yesterday, we announced that Beyonc\u00e9 will be the featured artist, so it will be a performance you just don't want to miss. This is just one of the many examples of our sharpened execution and it's one of the reasons why we are making steady progress on improving our share results.","Finally, we are making progress to drive higher returns on our invested capital and enhance shareholder return. We're delivering our earnings goals and we're converting them to stronger cash flow. We've reduced our net capital spending this year by $565 million year-to-date. We've returned $4.8 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases year-to-date, a 12% increase over the comparable prior year period and remain on track to return more than $6 billion for the full year.","Overall, in a cautious consumer and retail environment in developed markets and generally strong consumer conditions in the developing and emerging markets, we continue to build our businesses in a fundamentally sound, focused, consistent manner. Our balanced portfolio of Fun-for-You, Better-for-You and Good-for-You products positions well with consumer trends. And our investments in brand building, innovation and execution are working well and enhancing both our competitiveness and capability for margin-accretive, sustainable growth in the future.","To recap. We are pleased with our year-to-date progress in this reinvestment year and are executing well against our plan. Overall, our Q3 and year-to-date results give us confidence that we're on track to deliver a full year of financial targets for 2012. Just as important, our growth is balanced and reflects the successful execution of our strategy.","So with that, let me turn the call over to Hugh Johnston. Hugh?","Hugh F. Johnston","Great. Thanks, Indra, and good morning, everyone. As Indra mentioned, the quarter came in, in line with what we were expecting. Organic net revenue growth increased 5% while our reported net revenue declined, reflecting the structural changes including Mexico and China, which reduced the reported number by approximately 5 points and by negative currency translation, which was a 5-point drag on the reported net revenue. We realized 1 point of organic volume growth and 4 points of effective net pricing globally. Core gross margins rose 56 basis points, driven by our effective net pricing and productivity initiatives, offsetting commodity inflation. And core division operating margins were down by 13 basis points, reflecting a substantial increase in advertising and marketing investment to grow our brand equity.","All-in and in line with expectations, this resulted in a 3% decline in core division operating profit on a constant-currency basis and a 6% decline in core division operating profit on a U.S. dollar basis, reflecting a nearly 3-point drag from currency.","Core corporate unallocated expenses increased in the quarter, reflecting higher pension-related costs and a deferred compensation charge that was offset by a corresponding credit reflected in net interest expense.","Net interest expense was $181 million for the quarter, a decrease of approximately $28 million over Q3 of 2011. The impact of higher debt balances was more than offset by lapping a debt tender premium included in the prior year and by the deferred compensation hedge credit I just mentioned.","And our core tax rate for the quarter was 26.3%, which is 90 basis points higher than the rate in Q3 of 2011.","And finally, our fully diluted share count was down 2% in the quarter compared to the prior year period, reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program.","So in total, below-the-line items, mainly pension-related expenses we recorded at the corporate level and a higher tax rate offset somewhat by the benefit of reduced share count drove about 1 point of deleverage from our core constant-currency division operating profit decline of 3% to our core constant-currency EPS decline of 4%.","Turning to our outlook. From an earnings perspective, consistent with our previous outlook and what we've been saying since February, we expect our core constant-currency EPS to decline 5% for the year. We're on target to increase our investment in advertising and marketing to 5.7% of revenue this year, an increase of 50 basis points over our investment level last year.","Now I realize that EPS for the first 3 quarters came in a bit ahead of consensus estimate, but you should not flow that through to the bottom line as you update your full year models. Our intention is to reinvest any upside into the business to support and accelerate our brand building, innovation and productivity initiatives.","Based on current ForEx market consensus, currency translation would have approximately 3 points unfavorable impact on our full year core EPS, and we expect the core tax rate to be approximately 27% for the full year.","As you update your models for the fourth quarter, you should be mindful of a few items in particular. The impact of structural changes will have an approximate 2.5-point negative impact on revenue. ForEx is expected to have an approximate 1 point negative impact on revenue and operating profit. We anticipate both commodity inflation and price realization to moderate somewhat in the fourth quarter from the level we saw in Q3.","We're lapping several divestiture gains from Q4 of 2011, most notably the sales of several unrelated businesses within QFNA and LAF and the sale of our interest in a bottler in AMEA.","Corporate unallocated expenses in Q4 are expected to be higher than in Q3 due to the fact that Q4 is a longer reported period, so we have 4 additional weeks of costs in the fourth quarter as compared to the third quarter.","Net interest expense is expected to be higher year-on-year in Q4, given higher debt balances and higher rates.","From a cash flow standpoint, year-to-date reported cash generated by operating activities was $5.1 billion, which includes a $1 billion discretionary pension and retiree medical contribution that we made in Q1. Reflecting our capital spending productivity initiatives, net CapEx is down $565 million year-to-date and down more than 120 basis points as a percentage of revenue on a rolling 4-quarters basis.","In addition, our operating working capital also improved year-to-date with net working capital on receivables, inventory, prepaid expenses and payables improving by $685 million year-on-year.","Our management operating cash flow, excluding certain items, improved by $670 million to $4.9 billion year-to-date.","For the full year, we expect to generate more than $6 billion in management operating cash flow, excluding certain items, and return more than $6 billion in dividends and share repurchases.","Net, the quarter came in where we expected. The pricing picture and volumes overall were positive, and our outlook for the year for earnings, cash flow and cash returns is completely consistent with what we've shared previously with you.","Operator, we'll take the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Bryan Spillane of Bank of America.","Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just a question on Americas Beverages. Just if -- just want to understand the drag that you saw in the quarter in the noncarb portfolio relative to the inventory outage, I guess, on Gatorade and also calling some SKUs. Does that also continue into the fourth quarter and 2013, or is that just a 3Q effect?","Indra K. Nooyi","It's a 3Q effect.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I was hoping for more detail on your progress so far with the Tingyi alliance, and specifically I'm curious for how much progress you've made in terms of expanded distribution so far and how distribution expansion plays out going forward over the next few quarters.","Indra K. Nooyi","So the Tingyi deal was closed in the early part of second quarter. And through June, July and August, we went through the integration process. And starting sort of June, July, we started seeing the volumes pick up because the integration activities were completed. And in September, we actually saw the CSD volumes grow 15%. Now September is the first month in Q4, so it's not in the Q3 numbers. We haven't yet started to reap the benefits of the increased Tingyi manufacturing footprint because we haven't yet pulled the [indiscernible] lines in the new Tingyi plant. So the benefit you're seeing now is just the benefits from our own brand equity and our focus back on the business now that the integration activities are over. On the reported number, you saw volumes in AMEA up significantly, that's because some of the juice volume that we have transitioned to Tingyi and everything got rebranded as Tropicana, so you'll start seeing an acceleration of our noncarbonated beverage business starting Q4 and going into 2013. As we've mentioned before, the alliance between PepsiCo and Tingyi creates the largest beverage company in China with a 1.5 to 1.6 relative market share of -- versus the next largest competitor. Between us, we will basically cover the entire country and have over 70 plants between the 2 of us in China. So I think us going into 2013 and forward, this business is going to look very, very good.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Faucher with JPMorgan.","John A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Wanted -- just want to ask about Frito. So as we look at this, you're getting a little bit of volume growth, a little bit of positive price mix. From what we can tell from the scanner data, you're losing a little bit of share within the category. So can you talk about sort of what you're willing to do in terms of going after the higher end and in terms of getting the shares up? And how much do you view Frito as look, we'll take the top line and the share growth is less important, or do you feel like you need to fight back a little bit more aggressively to stem some of the share declines? And can you also comment on shares in C&G relative to shares in large format?","Indra K. Nooyi","John, I'm just going to give you some overall comments and then toss it to Brian Cornell who's here. Frito-Lay, as we mentioned in the script, we're seeing sequential improvement in shares Q2, Q3, and in Q4 we're actually in the positive territory. So we feel very, very good about it. Second, we talked about the premium business, the value business and the mainstream business. The good news is in premium, we are now gaining share; mainstream, the share is stabilized and now getting into positive territory. And we want to make sure we crack the code on the value business in a responsible way without diluting anything we're doing in the mainstream business. We are focused on share. We do not intend to lose share on a consistent basis. We are the category, so we are looking at ways that we can keep the share progression and remain in the positive territory. So let me turn it to Brian to give you a little bit more color on Frito-Lay and also talk about the convenience trend.","Brian C. Cornell","Sure. Well, John, as Indra mentioned, we really felt like Tom and the team delivered very strong results in the third quarter. That team is focused on balancing both profit volume and growing share. And I think some of the investments we've made in the first half of the year really started to pay dividends in the third quarter. Our investments in brand, in innovation, our continued focus and execution delivered 1% pound growth. We saw that translate to 3% in revenue. And despite a 41% increase in our advertising expenditures, we grow our [indiscernible] by 1%. So we're starting to see that deliver stability and share. And as I look at our share over the balance of the year, we expect to see sequential improvement continue. We were very pleased with our share performance at T10 [ph], both from a value standpoint, but importantly from a volume standpoint. And that increased pound growth is turning into an increase in our overall volume share. So we feel like we're on the right track. We've taken a very disciplined approach at Frito. We got our pricing in the first half of the year, but we're now seeing pound growth, revenues increase and stability and share improvement from a volume standpoint. So I really feel like we're on track at Frito and we expect to see sequential improvement in the fourth quarter. John, you also asked about some of the overall trends, and before I just jump into C&G, why don't I just give you a general sense for the food and beverage landscape in the third quarter. Overall, we did see food and beverage trend soften in Q3. And if you remember, the second quarter report, as we started talking about these new [indiscernible] results, the overall food and beverage growth was 3.9% in the second quarter. That softened to a growth rate of 2.4% in Q3. That was largely driven by soft trends in grocery, and we did see grocery soften to only a 50 basis point growth rate in the third quarter. That was down from growth of 1.4% in Q2. C-store continues to outperform the overall food and beverage trends. And again, in the third quarter, C&G was up 4%, so continuing to outperform the overall food and beverage trend. And as Indra mentioned, we continue to see big growth in that value segment and dollar continued to drive very strong growth. It was up 16.1% in the second quarter and actually increased its growth rate in Q3 to 18.3%. So overall at Frito, we feel like we're on the right track. We're looking to balance our focus between maintaining and growing our position in the mainstream. Indra mentioned we've been focused on accelerating our performance in premium. And in a category that grew 16%, our performance in premium was up 17%. So we're building share in those important categories and we're focused on our portfolio performance in the value segment. But overall for Frito, a very solid third quarter. We feel like we're building sequential performance as we go into Q4 and we're balancing that with the changing retail landscape.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kaumil Gajrawala with UBS.","Kaumil S. Gajrawala - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","If I can ask also about China and maybe a 2-part question. The first is if you'd like to give just some context on what you're seeing from a macro perspective. And then second, your results are quite different from what we're seeing with some other companies in the region. So can you talk maybe about the sustainability of the strength you're seeing in China. And then maybe, is there -- was there anything that was, short term, maybe incremental distribution or anything in 3Q that may not continue forward in the next year or so?","Indra K. Nooyi","So Kaumil, I'm going to start with the last question you asked and then work my way backwards. First, there was nothing in Q3 that was a result of increased distribution because we haven't even begun to reap the benefits of the increased distribution that, as I said earlier, will come in the first quarter of 2013 and forward. So what you're seeing is just the strength of the brand and our innovation in China. That's the first observation. Second, both our snacks and beverage businesses are growing very nicely. The snacks business was always growing well. The beverage business, for a quarter or 2, went through its transition pains, but we're through with that and the business is back to growth. And so we feel good about China business overall. Being in partnership with Tingyi has really strengthened our franchise massively and given us instant access to the whole country. And once we've put the right manufacturing lines in Tingyi's plant, remember, we only had about 20 plants in China. Tingyi has got over 50 plants, so the combination gives us complete coverage of China. And so the combination when once we've put the [indiscernible] lines in Tingyi plants is going to give us a real boost in the coverage in China. Let's talk about the macros in China. I've been there 3 times this year, Kaumil, and I'm back in China next week. If you are on the ground in China, you don't really sense the slowdown. If GDP slows down from 9% or 10% to 7% to 8%, from a country's perspective, when you're trying to get more and more people out of unemployment into employment and then trying to address underemployment, it matters a lot. But from a consumer product perspective, especially on small ticket items, which are very basic food and beverage products, you don't really see the impact in our categories. And in every city that I've been in China, and I've crisscrossed the country, there is buoyancy, there is a certain optimism in the country. Of course, everybody would like the growth to go back to 9% or 10% in China, but at 7% -- 7.8%, I still think China is performing at the peak of its game versus all of the other countries in the region or in the world today. So macro is a bit slow but certainly not impacting our categories at this point.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I just wanted to go back to the Frito question. And I understand the volume trend has improved sequentially this year, but pricing has also moderated. So when we hear you say you're on track with Frito, I'm just wondering what kind of organic revenue and profit growth that is really realistic for this business to kind of deliver in more normalized inflationary environment. Is it sort of 3% revenue, 5% kind of profit growth or can we get back to kind of mid-single digit, 6%, 8% kind of profit growth that we saw in prior years? And what is really needed to kind of get Frito to that position?","Indra K. Nooyi","Judy, Hugh is going to take this question and then, Brian, you can chip in with any additional comments you might have.","Hugh F. Johnston","Yes. Judy, why don't I start on the questions you're asking specifically about Frito's algorithm going forward. As we've talked about in the past, we don't share division-specific algorithms. We think we wind up getting into a level of conversation that, frankly, isn't productive for everyone as we get to quarter's end. That said, in general, I think you can expect to see, as commodities normalize, you can expect to see Frito go back to a more normal type of an algorithm. Obviously, it's been more price-driven as we've seen exceptional commodity inflation. As we see commodities normalize, as the business both does well in mainstream and continues to gain share in the premium segment, you can expect to see an algorithm that's a little bit closer to what we've traditionally delivered in the past in Frito-Lay. Brian, I don't know if you want to add any color to that?","Brian C. Cornell","I think you've captured -- I think as we go forward, you're going to continue to see us take a very balanced approach. We recognize the importance of growing pounds. We want to continue to make sure we're managing pricing appropriately. And we think that'll yield through our productivity initiatives, expansion of our [indiscernible] margins. So as we go forward, you'll continue to see our strategy focused on building our mainstream portfolio. Our investments in brand and innovation are going to continue to solidify that position. We believe we can accelerate our position in premium, you're seeing that take place today. And we're very pleased with the performance of brands like Stacy's as we move into the fourth quarter. And we'll continue to make sure that we participate appropriately in the value segment. So we're going to stay very focused on executing that agenda, continue to invest in our brands, in innovation, making sure that our execution continues to improve at the point-of-purchase and as a company that's very focused on its productivity initiatives. So a very consistent strategy as we go forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Can you just give us an outlook on Pepsi Americas Beverages, when you think volume growth is going to resume? I mean will it be as easy as when the pricing starts to lap, volumes should come back? Or has there been a change in some of the elasticity curves? And then if I could just sneak in one more. Can you just tell us what Gatorade grew in the quarter?","Indra K. Nooyi","Hugh?","Hugh F. Johnston","Yes. So, hey, Bill, why don't I start and then Al is here with me and he can add a bit as well. In terms of determining when volume growth is going to resume, again we're getting back to sort of decision -- division-specific guidance. It's a place that we really don't want to get into on a broad-scale basis. I do think that we look at the volumes, we look at our portfolio. As commodities normalize, we think the category is still overall LRB, probably has a little bit of growth in it. And in terms of our portfolio, there's no reason that we wouldn't be able to hold share in that environment. So a lot of the question of when is going to be driven by commodities and what happens there. But I do think that we think the category has got a little bit of volume growth in it and I think our portfolio positions us well to hold share within the category.","Indra K. Nooyi","But I should add another thing, Hugh, in that we've always said we want to grow this beverage business profitably. And this year was a big reinvestment year. We invested significantly and there was commodity inflation. But going into next year, we want to play this game in North American beverages very responsibly and make sure we're generating profit growth. So it's important we don't chase unprofitable businesses, unprofitable categories. For example, bottled water. There was hell of a price war going on in bottled water, so we chose not to play in the unprofitable segment of bottled water. We did a real portfolio scrub and we said, hey, terribly unprofitable businesses, which were chased many, many years ago for the sake of volume share, which everybody was maniacally focused on as opposed to responsible volume share, we got out of. Very painful decisions, but we got out of that. And Gatorade was down high-single digits in the quarter, but I would say a bulk of that was an inventory problem at a certain customer. As we go into Q4, we're already in the positive territory. And again, what we want to make sure in Gatorade is that we don't make the mistakes that we made in the 2004, '05, '06 time frame where we grew it as a general hydration product as opposed to a sports nutrition product. Because if we go back to that strategy of just selling it as a everyman's hydration and just another beverage, we're again renting volume. We've been there, done that. So we want to make sure we're going after the active thirst occasion, going after the athlete, sustaining our pricing and then flanking our core Gatorade product with innovation. So that's the strategy we're going to pursue in Gatorade. And we're going to focus on the overall beverage portfolio going into 2013 as opposed to looking at one category or the other. The good news is we started with carbonated soft drinks. It's going well. We are holding volume share and value share. So we're feeling good about that. And now we'll start working the other parts of the portfolio. Did you want to add anything?","Hugh F. Johnston","I'd just add this, just a quick thing. Our overall Pepsi-Cola business, our overall beverage business, and our bottling system, our company-owned as well as our franchise bottling system, was actually right in line with Q2. And our CSD trends are actually better with an improved share. Now, the Gatorade business was the big drag on our non-carb business in Q3. Some of that we knew was going to happen because we were lapping a time when we put DSD Gatorade out on our route trucks in the drug and the dollar channels, so we ended up having to lap that business and we knew that would probably happen. But we also chose to not participate in some deep discounts that we had on Gatorade from a year ago. And while it was painful, this is a year we're trying to clean up that portfolio where we're not renting share and getting into promotions that we really can't sustain the volume. So right after the summer was over with, our Gatorade business has moved back to a growth territory. And the way we think about Gatorade right now is it can grow through 3 steps: one is what I call solid, hybrid EDV [ph] pricing where we're competitive, but we're reasonable on the shelf every day. The second thing is advertising that's effective. And I think if you look at this RG3 advertising that's being played out on a lot of the NFL shows and also on the baseball playoffs, that's the kind of advertising that works for Gatorade. We're getting very good consumer response from it. And then finally, product news. And these new Chews are doing a terrific job, but they're small. We have plans next year for improved product news on the base Gatorade business that I think will add some growth. So all in all, it was a short-term blip for Gatorade and I expect that, that business will be solid for the balance of the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ali Dibadj with Bernstein.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","So one quick clarification on the core question, just a quick clarification in terms of the stuff you pulled out in terms of cleaning up the juice and not playing in water, why that's just a Q3 effect versus going forward. But the core question is if you take all of the explanation, that face value from a PAB volume perspective in this quarter, or even FLNA and how you're thinking about that and you translate that forward, do you think you're going to have to invest more in this category to get the results you're getting now? Or do you think you're at the right level of investment for the types of growth you're seeing in those categories, underlying, taking away all these outages on inventory and all that sort of stuff?","Indra K. Nooyi","Ali, I believe that we are investing at the right amount in this business. What we talked about is stepping up our advertising from 5.2% to 5.7% this year and then we said over the next 3 years we're going to increase that steadily, okay? And at this point, we feel good about where we are. The other thing we're doing is advertising money that sat with our bottling partners, our joint venture partners. We're making sure that's also being deployed the right way and that's not even included in the 5.7% numbers. So I think, taken together, all the marketplace investment that we have in the marketplace today, the fact that we're shifting more nonworking media to media -- working media and that we are focusing our portfolio down to 12 muscular brands, I think all of that is really driving results for the business and we feel good about the progress. Now all of this is for naught if we don't back it up with good innovation. So our global groups are focused on innovation and not just rifle-shot innovation, more platform innovation and focusing on refresh, reframe and breakthrough. And I think this sort of a deliberate focus on innovation, deliberate focus on execution and brand building is beginning to yield results. And what we have to make sure is that we don't chase or we don't try to chase volume growth at all costs. I think historically the strategy has been for many people in this industry to go after volume growth at all costs. So bottled water was fair game, going after value snacks without regard to responsible portfolio management was sort of the right thing to do for the segment -- for the category. I think going forward, especially large companies like us, branded companies like us, we have to think through carefully which parts of the portfolio we actually add value. And that's why I think we're playing a much more focused, deliberate and differential game going forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Swartzberg with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","To continue the conversation on Americas Beverage, could you give us the actual numbers for carb and noncarb in North America? And then more qualitative, perhaps for you, Al, still on track for your plans to decrease promotions around key holidays and using the fourth quarter to kind of lay the structural foundation for that for next year?","Hugh F. Johnston","Yes, Mark, this is Hugh. The numbers on sparkling and on noncarbs, sparkling was down 2, but as we talked about, we do have a timing difference in terms of the quarter. And in terms of the impact on that, when you work your way through that timing difference, the down 2 is closer to flat once you sort of take out that trading day piece. So we think on carbonated, we were basically in line with primary competition. Noncarbonated was down 7, which was obviously much -- a much deeper number. And the reasons were exactly the ones that Indra shared earlier: number one, we made some changes in terms of some unprofitable juice drink businesses that we had; number two was there were some pretty aggressive case-packed water deals out there that we chose not to participate in; and then number three was the Gatorade issue that we've been talking about. Going forward, the Gatorade issue is behind us. As Al has referenced, we're back to growth in the fourth quarter. In terms of the unprofitable juice, I think we're largely past that now at this point. That overlap is also largely behind us. Case-packed water, as Indra mentioned, our stance is going to be consistent on that. We're not interested in chasing unprofitable case-packed water deals. So given all of that, we'd certainly expect to see the noncarb numbers pick up on a go-forward basis and that's how we're thinking about it.","Albert P. Carey","Mark, the other part of your question was about the tremendous amount of volume done on promotion in the category. It's not just us, I think it's the overall category. And the answer is, we're moving to what I call a hybrid EDV [ph] pricing strategy. It's a tricky thing to implement, so you can't do it overnight. But I think towards the end of the fourth quarter, you'll see more of that and certainly in 2013.","Hugh F. Johnston","And that'll benefit, we believe, pricing flow-through within the PepsiCo P&L. We think it's the right strategy.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Caroline Levy with CLSA.","Caroline S. Levy - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Couple of questions. But I'm actually going to ask about your thinking in North America Beverages. First, I think you said that you'll examine all underperforming assets and you've done that with Mexico, done it with China very successfully. Can you update us, Indra, on your thinking on North American bottling ROIC, et cetera? And separately, energy drinks are taking market share in CSDs and they seem to be, to some degree, the drink of the youth today. What's your position on energy drinks?","Indra K. Nooyi","On energy drinks, I think the way we'd like to play the energy drinks is in a more responsible way, maybe I should use that word. We have some interesting launches that we have next year on the cards, which plays it in a way that is consistent with our product portfolio and consistent with where we think consumers want to go with energy. So I think that's the right strategy for energy and you'll see some of those launches coming to the marketplace next year. There's no question energy drinks took share from mainstream players. But I think that's not a strategy that any of the big companies could have deployed and been successful at. So we're going to take a more responsible and a disciplined approach in energy drinks going into next year. Let's talk about our thinking in North American beverages. What we told you earlier this year was that in North American beverages, we were going to execute -- improve our execution significantly. We would invest behind brand building. It was going to take a year or 18 months to start to see the results. And we are very steadily executing on the game plan that we outlined for you in the early part of February. Meanwhile, we also have seen some interesting results come out from our technology investments. And our hope is that by this time next year, we should start seeing the benefit of a lot of the technology bets we placed, whether it's natural sweeteners, enhancers, whatever that will allow us to go in and create real differentiation in our product portfolio, especially in carbonated soft drinks so that we can actually offer to the consumers in the 2014 and beyond a product portfolio that consumers love. They love bubbles, they love the caffeine, they love cola taste, but addresses any value that might exist in the areas of sugar in the portfolio or artificial sweeteners. So we are optimistic about the results of R&D investment and we are hopeful that towards the end of 2013, early 2014 and beyond, we can actually launch differentiated innovation in some of our core categories. So our North American beverage business, our reinvestment activities, our turnaround activities are all on track and we'll keep giving you updates every quarter. But believe me, we look at everything about this business and we look at improving the returns of the company on an ongoing basis.","Hugh F. Johnston","And Indra, if I can add one more comment to that. Just going back to the energy drink question, I want to take one thing off the table very explicitly. We do not have the strategy or an intention to deploy significant M&A capital into the energy drink category. So I want to make sure we're crystal clear on that so that it's well understood by all.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Feeney with Janney Capital.","Jonathan P. Feeney - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Indra, I thought it was interesting on the Asia, Middle East and Africa business not only the great volume performance, but really the margin performance. And I wonder if you take a step back and you talked about China, do you -- is there an opportunity over time to raise the margin of that business over -- through positive price mix over time? I think we're trained to thinking about emerging markets businesses as lower gross margin. I think that's true in most cases. But have we hit inflection point at China or other major emerging markets where either volumes are good enough, the consumer healthy enough that you can really start to up margin those markets over the next couple of years?","Indra K. Nooyi","I think, overall, AMEA, our Middle East business is very strong. Great volume growth, revenue growth, margin growth, margin expansion, profit growth, no issues. I think markets like South Asia, you get tremendous volume growth, you get revenue growth, but we're also investing heavily because the market is growing 15%, 20%, so we have to put in tremendous investment to keep the growth going. And the good news is once the growth starts moderating and I hope it takes many years before it moderates, the business starts to yield very, very attractive return. But on the short term, we have to keep growing the business through investments, both P&L and on the balance sheet. And in China, absolutely once the Tingyi deal is up and running, which we hope will be going into 2014 and beyond, you should start seeing margins in the beverage business improve. But again, we want to reinvest that back in the snacks business and keep growing the overall portfolio. So basically, what we are focused on is PepsiCo as an overall portfolio. AMEA will always be a big growth engine. We will always keep investing in AMEA, and then the slower growth markets will be the source of investment for areas like AMEA. And so taken together, this portfolio should be able to deliver for PepsiCo along the lines that we talked about.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Lauren Torres with HSBC.","Lauren Torres - HSBC, Research Division","It's been great to hear that you've been able to confirm, and I guess, reaffirm guidance for this year throughout the year. But as most of us are thinking about next year, Indra, I was curious to get your confidence level if you think we could return to your long-term growth goals in 2013?","Indra K. Nooyi","I'm going to have Hugh talk to that. Hugh?","Hugh F. Johnston","We'll talk about 2013 specifically in February. We've given long-term guidance to give you an indication as to how you should model out multiple years. But with the world as volatile as it is, we think just as a practice the right answer is to give guidance in February as we do our Q4 call. So no indications, positive, negative or otherwise, in terms of 2013. We'll get to that in the course of a couple of months.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Damian Witkowski with Gabelli & Company.","Damian Witkowski - Gabelli & Company, Inc.","As we're 6, I think, 8 months into the incremental advertising spend here in the U.S., just curious how do you measure its effectiveness and how -- is there a way of measuring shorter-term versus just looking at it from a long-term perspective? And then any media that's performing better than other, whether it's for beverages or snacks, that's sort of standing out?","Indra K. Nooyi","We did talk about the fact that we are going to be measuring brand equity, especially of the 12 big brands that we outlined in our February meeting. And we're doing 2 things: We're looking at what we're doing in process and then we're looking at sort of tailpipe metrics. In process, we're looking to make sure that we are shifting more nonworking media to media -- to working media. And then we're also making sure we're investing more in the 12 brands and slowly start to cull the tail. So we are making progress on that and we track it almost on a monthly basis. From a tailpipe metric, it's brand equity. Now typically, brand equity scores take 12, 18 months to really show improvement, sustained improvement. Interestingly, as we shared with you in our Q2 scorecard, and we're going to show you again the next scorecard in Q4 as part of our Q4 call, we are beginning to see improvement across most of the brand portfolio. So the programs we have in place, the additional investment and the fact that we're doing a 360-degree activation, not just spending money on television advertising, but in the digital world, executing better, doing the right promotion. All of that, we're seeing as beginning to drive the brand equity scores into positive territory. Now let me make sure we all understand. Our brand equity scores for these 12 brands is already pretty high. And we wanted to make sure that we continue to hold it or increase it in an advertising environment that was extremely cluttered. And I think the efforts that we're undertaking we're already beginning to see some results, which is very, very comforting to see. And I think as the quarters go on, you'll see even more benefit and that will then translate to higher value share. And so we're watching this virtuous circle very, very carefully and making adjustments as we go along and it's happening both in beverages and snacks and our nutrition products and it's across all 12 brands.","So with that, let me just say, in closing, Q3 marked good progress against a clear, focused plan. As we said earlier, our AMEA region had an excellent quarter across-the-board. Europe delivered solid results behind good pricing and marketplace execution. Americas Foods had good volume growth and net price realization. Share trends in Frito-Lay North America are encouraging. And North American beverages, we gained value share in carbonated beverages while executing a cleanup of unprofitable segments of our noncarbonated beverage portfolio. Our stepped up brand-building investments are beginning to pay off. Innovation performance is improving. We are executing in a disciplined way in the marketplace. We're on track to deliver our productivity commitment and on our cash returns to you, our shareholders. In short, we are executing with great focus to drive results and do what's right for the short-term, medium-term and long-term health of the business.","So with that, let me just say thank you to all of you for joining us and for the confidence you've placed in us with your investment. Have a good day.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's PepsiCo's Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. You may now disconnect."],"16869":["PepsiCo, Inc.

Your lines have been placed on listen-only until the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Today\u2019s call is being recorded and will be archived at www.pepsico.com.","It is now my pleasure to introduce Mr. Jamie Caulfield, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Caulfield, you may begin.","Jamie Caulfield","Thank you, Laurie. With me today are Indra Nooyi, PepsiCo\u2019s Chairman and CEO; and Hugh Johnston, PepsiCo\u2019s CFO. We\u2019ll lead off today\u2019s call with a review of our first quarter 2015 performance and full year outlook and then we will move on to Q&A. We recognize today is a busy earnings day with a number of other consumer and mega-cap companies reporting. So we\u2019ve kept our comments brief this morning and intend to conclude the call by 08:45.","Before we begin, please take note of our cautionary statement. This conference call includes forward-looking statements, including statements regarding 2015 guidance and our long-term targets based on currently available information. Forward-looking statements inherently involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those predicted in such forward-looking statements. Statements made on this conference call should be considered together with cautionary statements and other information contained in today\u2019s earnings release and in our most recent periodic reports filed with the SEC.","Unless otherwise indicated, all references to EPS and operating profit growth are on a core constant currency basis. All references to free cash flow exclude certain items. In addition, references to organic revenue results in this call exclude the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, structural changes and foreign exchange translation. To find disclosures and reconciliations of non-GAAP measures that we use when discussing PepsiCo\u2019s financial results, you should refer to the glossary and other attachments to this morning\u2019s earnings release and to the Investors section of PepsiCo\u2019s Web site under the Events & Presentations tab.","As we discuss today\u2019s results, please keep in mind that our first quarter comprises the 12 weeks ended March 21 for our North American operations and it is a short quarter for our international business reflecting the two months of January and February for most of our operations outside North America. ","And finally, our core Q1 2015 earnings results include a $39 million pre-tax gain related to the refranchise of a portion of our India bottling operations. We also reported a pre-tax impairment charge of $65 million associated with our dairy joint venture during the quarter. And as you may recall, our Q1 2014 core earnings results included a $31 million pre-tax gain from the sale of certain agricultural assets in Europe. ","And now, it\u2019s my pleasure to introduce Indra Nooyi.","Indra Nooyi","Thank you, Jamie and good morning everyone. I am pleased with our performance in the first quarter of 2015. Our focus on innovation, brand building and marketplace execution funded in part by productivity initiatives continued to drive fundamental business performance. ","In the first quarter, organic revenue grew 4.4% with Global Snacks up 7% and Global Beverages up 1.5%. And core gross margins improved by 150 basis points. Excluding the impairment charge and gains Jamie mentioned, core operating margin improved by 65 basis points. Core constant currency operating profit grew 11% and core constant currency EPS grew 16%. However foreign exchange headwinds persist. We have and will continue to take actions to manage through the current volatile macroeconomic environment by taking responsible pricing actions, tightly controlling costs and optimizing our global sourcing to minimize and mitigate the impacts of the current foreign exchange challenges. ","I am particularly pleased with the level of effective pricing we\u2019re achieving, especially in Global Beverages where we realized 3 points of effective net pricing. At the same time we will not let cyclical macroeconomic issues divert us from our focus to drive sustainable shareholder value creation. We intend to continue to invest across our markets and brands to generate organic revenue growth, drive greater efficiency and productivity, deliver attractive free cash flow and cash returns to shareholders and enhance our returns on invested capital. ","The power of our the portfolio of products and brands and the strength of our geographic footprint have enabled us to consistently meet or exceed our financial goals and more importantly give us confidence in the future prospects of our business. ","As you know, in June this year we celebrate the 50th anniversary of PepsiCo which is the coming together of PepsiCo and Frito-Lay. As we celebrate this milestone, we look back on our journey with price. In 1965, our annual revenue was $510 million. Today it stands over $66 billion. A $100 investment in PepsiCo stock in 1965 was worth nearly $43,000 at the end of 2014, a compound annual total shareholder return of over 13%, far outpacing the S&P 500. And the reason we performed so well is that throughout our history, we have delivered short term performance with a keen eye on the long term sustainability of our results. We\u2019ve done this because throughout the past half century, PepsiCo has made bold move to reshape our portfolio, build new capabilities and broaden our geographic footprint. ","So today our portfolio is positioned well. Our annual net revenue is nearly split evenly between the US and countries outside the US. And just over half of our global revenue is derived from snacks, with the remainder from beverages. In aggregate, carbonated soft drinks comprised less than 25% of our 2014 total global revenue. And while we are proud to have the Pepsi name on the door, coolers represented less than 15% of our total revenue mix, and this speaks exactly to how we\u2019ve transformed and will continue to transform our portfolio to address ever changing consumer needs and preferences. ","And as you know we\u2019ve also developed new capabilities to compete in a rapidly evolving global business environment. For example, we transformed our operating model to blend global scale leverage with locally focused execution and this has increased our ability to capture efficiencies, live and shift the best ideas and capabilities from PepsiCo teams around the world and win us a point of sale. ","We embrace design as a core building block of our new product pipeline with innovation representing over 9% of our net revenue in 2014. We\u2019re very proud to report that three PepsiCo products have received the 2015 Nielsen Breakthrough Innovation Award. This award recognizes the most successful and enduring new CPG products launched in the US in 2013 and PepsiCo is also the only company to receive multiple awards this year. ","Lastly, productivity is now part of our DNA with $1 billion in annual savings projected through 2019. These savings enable us to maintain or increase necessary investments in the business to drive strong organic revenue growth. And we\u2019re always looking to reconceptualize our business to unlock even more productivity. ","We are proud of the legacy results we are building this company on. So with that backdrop, let\u2019s take a look at how our business has performed. Starting with North America which again delivered strong results in an otherwise sluggish packaged food and beverage environment. In fact, in Q1 2015 PepsiCo was the largest contributor to US retail sales growth among all food and beverage manufacturers with over $300 million of retail sales growth in all major channels. This was nearly three times the next largest contributor to growth and represented more growth than the next 19 largest manufacturers combined. Notably, North American beverages was the key driver of US retail sales growth within PepsiCo and the largest contributor to US retail sales growth on a standalone basis. ","Turning now to PepsiCo Americas beverages. We delivered organic revenue and core constant currency operating profit growth while holding US LRB value share. Our strategy has not wavered as we continue to manage the business responsibly with consistent positive price realization across the portfolio. Within the US, we gained value share across important sub-categories, including sports drinks and ready to drink tea. And we grew retail sales in measured channels in the US for regular colas and Mountain Dew in CSDs and for Gatorade Lipton Tea and Naked Juice within our non-carbonated footprint. ","We were proud of PepsiCo\u2019s execution at this year\u2019s Super Bowl. We had over 60,000 integrated food and beverage displays merchandised at retail, up nearly 70% from the prior year. We also continue to invest in R&D to drive sustainable innovation. For example, we rolled out a newly designed Gatorade 20-ounce bottle which is a sleek contemporary design bottle that is built with improved ergonomics informed by athletes\u2019 insights. Early results are promising with this package of innovation contributing to double-digit retail sales growth in regions that have converted with the new packaging. ","We\u2019re also focused on health and wellness innovation. We recently introduced new Naked Juice flavors, including Chia Cherry Lime, Chia Sweet Peach and Bright Beat [ph] which offer delicious food and vegetables movies that pack a nutritional punch. And we launched Tropicana Farmstand Tropical Green, which is a great tasting green juice that has a full serving of fruits and vegetables in each 8-ounce glass with no added sugar. ","Additionally we recently launched Mountain Dew Dewshine, a craft premium soda inspired by the brand\u2019s roots in the backwoods of Tennessee. It is a clear citrus juice made with real cane sugar and packaged in clear glass bottles. We\u2019re also excited to report the new food service partnership with Umami Burger which was a Pepsi-Cola Mountain Dew and Sierra Mist, all made with real sugar at its 24 locations. ","In addition, we entered into a new multi-year deal with Live Nation. We are the music company\u2019s official carbonated soft drink and bottled water partner and have exclusive pouring rights at 75 of Live Nation\u2019s US event spaces. And we\u2019re also pleased about our new multi-year food and beverage partnership with the National Basketball Association, Women's National Basketball Association, NBA Development League and USA Basketball beginning next season. As part of this expansive food and beverage partnership with the League, PepsiCo will leverage its Mountain Dew, Aquafina, Brisk, Doritos & Ruffles brands to engage NBA fans through PepsiCo\u2019s world class sports marketing and high-profile activation. The partnership between the NBA and PepsiCo builds upon the League\u2019s relationship with Gatorade which is the NBA\u2019s longest standing partner. ","Turning now to Frito-Lay North America, delivered another quarter of very strong results. Organic revenue grew 4% and core constant currency operating profit rose 7%. The US salty snacks category continued to show solid growth and Frito market share again posted steady sequential improvement supported by both volume growth and price realization. Our key brands had revenue growth, including particularly good performance from Lays, Doritos and Cheetos. And we continue to innovate. ","We launched Cheetos Sweetos, the first ever sweet Cheetos in the US as well as Cheetos appetizers, Doritos Jacked 3D and [indiscernible]. Additionally our Lays Do Us A Flavor win in 2014, Lays Kettle Wasabi Ginger return to the shelves. We\u2019re also excited about the return of a highly successful Lays Do Us A Flavor consumer contest. Fans nationwide have submitted their ideas for the next great potato chip flavor for a chance to win $1 million grand prize and we will announce the four delicious finalist flavors this summer. ","Quaker Food North America delivered commendable results despite continued challenges across central store food categories. During the quarter we gained or held value share in the US in all three of our key categories, Hot, Ready-To-Eat Cereal and Snack Bars while expanding gross margin at the same time. These value share gains are driven by innovation which includes the launch of Quaker 3 minutes Steel Cut Oats in the quarter. This product has the same hottie texture and nutty flavor as traditional steel cut oats but caters to the consumers\u2019 needs for convenient products as the cook time is cut from 30 minutes to just 3 minutes. We also launched gluten free varieties of Quaker Popped Rice Crisps.","And then turning to developing and emerging markets. Our business has delivered 10% organic revenue growth in the quarter despite all of the ongoing volatility in many regions of the world. Looking across some of our key DNA [ph] markets, our business continued to proved resilient with double-digit organic revenue growth in China and Turkey and mid single digit organic revenue growth in Mexico, Egypt and India. ","So before I turn it over to Hugh, I want to highlight a few key points. As an operating company, we absolutely manage the things that are within our control: marketing, innovation, marketplace execution and productivity and we expect to continue to perform well in these areas. However we expect to face continued headwinds related to macros, in particular weak currencies in a number of our key markets and the impact of low oil prices in countries whose economies are highly dependent on energy. Obviously these are all products and sold but we adjust the business to weather through the challenges as best as we can by controlling costs, adjusting our raw material sourcing and executing pricing actions, and these steps contributed to our strong fundamental performance in Q1. ","So with that, let me turn the call over to Hugh. Hugh? ","Hugh Johnston ","Thank you, Indra and good morning everyone. Turning to guidance. For the full year 2015 we expect mid-single-digit organic revenue growth, core operating margin expansion as organic topline growth and productivity should offset negative geographic mix and commodity inflation, which incorporates the impact of higher than previously expected transaction related foreign-exchange headwinds and approximately $1 billion of productivity servings. ","Below the division operating profit line, we continue to expect corporate cost to be lower, a core tax rate of approximately 25% and to reduce share count. As a result, we continue to expect 7% core constant currency earnings-per-share growth in 2015. ","However given the continued strength in the US dollar, we now expect foreign-exchange translation to negatively impact net revenue and core earnings-per-share growth by approximately 10 and 11 percentage points respectively based on current consensus market rates. That compares to our initial outlook of 7 percentage points for each back in February. Keep in mind that while spot rates have shown improvement we use consensus rates in calculating our expected foreign-exchange impact and consensus rates have worsened for all of our key foreign currencies, including the Russian ruble, the Brazilian real, the Canadian dollar, the Mexican peso and the British pound. ","Our outlook for the year assumes continued translation of our Venezuela results at the SICAD rate of 12 Bolivars per US dollar. Should circumstances dictate use of a higher rate this would also negatively impact our US dollar results. ","Taking our 2014 core EPS of $4.63 and applying our guidance and current market consensus of foreign-exchange impact implies 2015 core EPS of approximately $4.44. As you model out the second quarter, I\u2019d ask you to consider the following: Foreign-exchange translation should have an approximate 11 point unfavorable impact on the second quarter net revenue and approximate 12 point unfavorable impact on second-quarter core EPS based on current market consensus rates and we expect a profit decline in Europe driven by the volatility associated with transaction and translation currency related headwinds. ","Below the division operating profit line, net interest expense is expected to increase in the second quarter versus last year, primarily reflecting increased debt balances. And our tax rate in the second quarter is expected to be sequentially higher than the first quarter of 2015. ","Finally, our stepped-up share repurchase activity will occur throughout the year but it\u2019s expected to have a more pronounced impact in the second half of 2015. ","From a cash flow perspective, we continue to expect full year free cash flow of more than $7 billion. I want to emphasize that despite the expected incremental foreign-exchange headwinds this year, our original $7 billion free cash flow target remains intact. This is the result of stringent working capital management and capital spending discipline. We\u2019ve shortened our cash conversion cycle by over 50% since Q1 2012 and continue to manage capital spending with great efficiency, holding capital spending below 5% of sales. ","We expect our capital allocation discipline to continue to drive core ROIC improvement. This is building on the steady progress we've made in ROIC over the past two years with core net ROIC up 220 basis points to 17.5% from 2012 to 2014. And we expect to return between approximately $8.5 billion and $9 billion to shareholders in 2015 through both dividends and share repurchases, again consistent with our original target. ","As a reminder, our previously announced 7% dividend per share increase will commence with the June payment. This represents the 43rd consecutive year of annual dividend increases and an approximate 60% payout ratio based on 2014 core EPS. And our annualized dividends per share grew at low double-digit compound annual growth rate over the past 10 years. ","To summarize, our core constant currency outlook for 2015 is unchanged from our last call and free cash flow, disciplined capital allocation and returning cash to our shareholders remain top priorities for the company. ","With that operator, we will take the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley.","Dara Mohsenian ","Can you discuss demand elasticity so far from the higher pricing you've taken? It looks like it's been pretty muted with the solid organic sales growth. So I am just wondering where demand elasticities are coming in versus your expectations particularly in Latin America and Russia given some of the macro difficulties there. And then as we look going forward as FX pressure continues to worsen do you plan to take incremental pricing internationally because I imagine at some point you don't want to push too far from a consumer standpoint? And then last just a detail question, the pricing number was very strong in Latin American foods and I suspect in the Latin piece of PAB how much of that was driven by Venezuela versus other geographies?","Indra Nooyi","Dara, overall I tell you demand elasticity in these times when you\u2019ve got high inflation and you\u2019ve got translation FX in countries which required us to take pricing. The challenge is to balance volume and revenue and what we do in most cases is that we try to push through as much of the inflation as we can, and raw material inflation as we can through pricing. In many cases we cannot cover all of it but we try to price through about 75% of the inflation and then we manage very judiciously the revenue output and make sure that our volume decline is not significant. For example, let me take Russia. In Russia, we have pushed through a lot of pricing and we\u2019ve managed it up with a lot of productivity also. And so our results in Russia and our business is doing very well. The real issue is yes, there is some volume drop-off but I think in these times we have to judiciously manage revenue and volume and then as the economies recover, go back to volume growth. If we don't push pricing through now, it will be very hard to push it all through later on to cover all of these costs. So at every point in time in each of these countries that\u2019s what we do. ","And in terms of ongoing FX, spots rates are slightly better than consensus. We have to watch and see how this thing evolves but in every country -- again every country is not moving exactly the same way but country by country as FX moves, especially transactional FX impacts country performance, we do take pricing at least to cover 75% of that and the rest of it we try to cover through productivity. And as far as Venezuela is concerned, I mean the footnotes in the Q will indicate exactly the impact of Venezuela and I think it will speak for itself. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane of Bank of America. ","Bryan Spillane ","First, just a comment, a lot of companies reporting this morning, you put out a pretty efficient press release that was easy to read. So thank you for that. I guess my question is and somewhat related to Dara\u2019s question is, if we kind of look out over the balance of the year, there\u2019s certainly some volatility still, I guess, we could expect in Russia and potentially Venezuela. And so if you could just talk to \u2013 you\u2019ve maintained your currency neutral guidance and you\u2019ve also maintained your free cash flow guidance in the context still of having that type of volatility. So could you talk just about what some of the factors that you\u2019re watching for that might drive some variances to those forecasts and even specifically on free cash flow, what other actions can you take if you still have \u2013 you\u2019re still compromised on foreign exchange moving against you?","Indra Nooyi","Yes, I am going to let Hugh talk about cash flow but I will just make an overall comment. Russia, the business is doing very well, Bryan. Retail, dairy products, juice products, basic snacks, the business is doing very well. We have an excellent team in Russia, great productivity programs, putting the pricing through in very judicious ways, doing very good revenue management. I am very proud of the Russia team. And so they are managing through this volatility very well. And Venezuela, the business is doing exceedingly well in Venezuela. The issue is the currency. So let\u2019s hear Huge now talk about what he is doing on the free cash flow to make sure that as a company we deliver on our commitment on free cash flow. Go ahead, Hugh.","Hugh Johnston","Yes, happy to. Morning Bryan. Real a couple things. Number one, we do continue to localize this even more aggressively than we have in the past and obviously that helps us manage from a currency perspective which helps us manage from a free cash flow perspective. Number two, we are managing CapEx very tightly. You\u2019ve seen us over the last few years come down from the mid-fives in terms of CapEx a percent of revenue to we\u2019ve been operating in the low fours. And then third, we\u2019ve managed working capital from what had previously been about 21 days down to about three days. In all condor, I still think we have more opportunity in that regard particularly on inventory and we\u2019re going to continue to work that as quickly as we can in order to mitigate if there are further downsides. Right now we\u2019ve given you market consensus, it\u2019s our best guess. So definitionally that's 50:50 as to which way it\u2019s going to do. But I do think we can continue to do more from an inventory perspective in order to continue to cover if we have further downsides from an FX perspective.","Indra Nooyi","And our new operating model is also allowing us to come up with more productivity ideas across the company. That we will be working as the company against. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bill Schmitz of Deutsche Bank.","Bill Schmitz ","Hey I know it\u2019s something like a random question but are you guys going to close down Muller as far as big impairment charge in the quarter? So is that just a write-down at the fair value now and is that still going to be in the midst that they\u2019re going to work through?","Indra Nooyi","We\u2019re not closing down Muller. The business is still running and doing well but I think it just didn\u2019t meet our expectations and we have to go through some retooling. I know that business is alive and kicking. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.","Judy Hong ","So I guess my question is more on the PAB margin performance in the quarter, Hugh. I guess it\u2019s the first quarter in the last few quarters that margin did decline year-over-year. I know in the press release you did cite lapping some of the one-time items. So can you just walk through the margin performance in PAB and how much is timing versus just really some of the spending that you\u2019re doing to drive the business to grow up from a top line perspective?","Hugh Johnston","Yes, couple of elements there, Judy. First of all, the pricing environment is quite healthy. We felt terrific about pricing in the quarter and we expect that to continue going forward. Two other drivers, obviously advertising and marketing was up a bit in that for the quarter and that\u2019s timing of the curve. That's one of the elements. The other elements are some of the timing on spending with our Latin American bottlers that drove that number. So \u2013 but we certainly expect PAB margins to continue to grow over time as they have been.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Caroline Levy of CLSA.","Caroline Levy ","Just one quick one. Why did you leave the charge in the Quaker operating income? Is there a good reason for that? And then it would be great if you could just tell us what it's like on the ground in Russia and Brazil right now, possibly even Mexico because there is a sense that things are deteriorating in Brazil for example. So it\u2019d just be great to hear from you. ","Indra Nooyi","We left the charge in the Quaker operating income because it\u2019s managed as Quaker Muller. ","Hugh Johnston","Yes, that\u2019s the accounting on the line of business. ","Indra Nooyi","On the ground in Russia, as Hugh just mentioned, we were localizing costs and we have a very, very good team that\u2019s doing all the right things, productivity, taking pricing, adjusting the product lines to make sure it\u2019s suited for Russian consumer, they\u2019re shopping differently now. And so I\u2019d say that on the ground in Russia, the business is doing well. And I think it\u2019s also giving an opportunity for all companies operating in Russia to look and see how to tighten their belts and work with each other to lower each other\u2019s cost. So except for the overall macro geopolitical issues in Russia on the ground the business in Russia looks okay.","In terms of Mexico again, we\u2019ve operated in Mexico for decades and we\u2019ve operated through massive volatility. At this point we\u2019re not seeing the kind of volatility at all in Mexico, we have pockets of security issues but overall Mexico is just fine. Brazil did see a slowdown, coming off the real weakening and then on top of that the graft issues happening in Brazil. Yes, we did see some turmoil in Brazil, and our business is still holding, Caroline but I\u2019d say of the three countries that you mentioned probably in the last quarter, Brazil is where we saw some on the ground action that we\u2019re watching very carefully at this point.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ali Dibadj of Bernstein.","Ali Dibadj","I actually had two questions. One is just assuming on cost a little bit, please. I want to understand a little bit more what\u2019s driving on the commodity inflation being higher for the year, why for FLNA and PAB, you had an operating cost inflation. Is that wages? And then importantly also just continue to cut the billion dollars of cost a few years of that, but what happens after that? So that\u2019s the cost question. And the other one is, I know it\u2019s early days but you\u2019re seeing Coca-Cola refranchise more and more of its US bottling operations. Are you seeing anything that shows the change in pattern of their activity in the marketplace?","Indra Nooyi","I am going to answer two parts and I am going to turn it to Hugh on commodity inflation. And as I mentioned in my script, Ali, we talked about the billion-dollar per year for the next five years. But when we announced the billion-dollar a year for the next five years, we started working on the next round of ideas to think about even more productivity opportunities. And we will come back and talk to you about it when we are ready to talk about it but believe me once we change the operating model of the company to really look across the company as opposed to allowing each country and regions just operate independently. There are more opportunities for efficiency. So that\u2019s what we are working on. ","And in terms of the Coke refranchising its bottling operations, let\u2019s not forget why we bought back the bottling access. We bought it back because we wanted to improve efficiency in the system and most importantly we wanted to serve our customers in a seamless way and be able to put in a lot of innovation through a bottling system which had to move from huge monolithic products to a highly segmented set of products. That original proposition has not changed. What we are seeing today is disciplined pricing in the market and from our perspective the integrated operating system is very valuable and we intend to continue to operate that way. So on commodity inflation, Hugh, quickly.","Hugh Johnston","Yes, very briefly, it\u2019s almost entirely driven by foreign-exchange, ex foreign exchange their commodity inflation is almost flattish.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Marshall of Barclays.","Bill Marshall ","I actually have a high level kind of strategic question for you. Indra, in your prepared remarks you mentioned the challenges in center of the store food recently. And I think a couple of years ago you labeled these businesses as not necessarily core to the mission, even though nice cash flow generating assets. I am kind of wondering how you are thinking about those businesses in the current environment, especially with everything we\u2019ve seen going on with food and the interest rate environment that we are seeing now.","Indra Nooyi ","I think there's two kinds of businesses, I said, were not core to the mission. Quaker is very core to the mission. What we were talking about is sort of the peripheral businesses we got as part of the Quaker Oaks acquisition, the Golden Grain and the Aunt Jemima. Those businesses are center of the store. They are not core to our portfolio, but today they are doing fine. They are holding their ground, sometimes even gaining share. They are generating very valuable US cash flow and these are businesses with fantastic margins. So at this point it\u2019s more dilutive to get rid of them than to keep them. And so, what we are going to do is just manage those businesses steadily as long as they don't distract us from our core mission of growing the rest of the portfolio. That\u2019s what we are focused on.","And lastly, they also provide scale to our warehouse sales operation. So at this point just steady management of those businesses, don't distract ourselves from the core, enjoy the US cash, the good margins and that\u2019s all we are doing.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Faucher of JPMorgan.","John Faucher ","Indra, I wanted to talk about sort of your old sort of buckets that the business has had in terms of Fun for You, Better for You and Good for You. It seems as though we are seeing a change in the consumer dynamic particularly in the Better for You bucket, if you look at something like diet soft drinks, what have you. So I guess as we look at this what do you think has changed in terms of those buckets and what are you doing differently to respond as the consumers maybe seem less interested in what you guys had traditionally discussed is Better for You?","Indra Nooyi ","That\u2019s a wonderful question, John, and I tell you something. We\u2019ve never seen the consumer as confused as they are today. And I use the word confused in a neutral way, not a negative way. If you had asked me a few years ago people were moving to diet sodas. Now they view real sugar as Good for You. They are willing to go to organic non-GMO products even if it has high salt, high sugar, high-fat. So I think we have a challenge these days to really think about what is the definition of Good for You from a consumer perspective. And this is unprecedented and the old definition of Good for You is being challenged right now. So I think the best way to think about this is to think about the fruit and vegetable corridor, a protein corridor, a grains corridor and then sort of a predominantly carb corridor.","And then within that just vary our strategy based on what the consumer is thinking about. Because especially millennials today have got very different definitions of Good for You versus Fun for You. They don't really make the definition in the difference, that they\u2019re looking much more to ingredients. So we are also going through a little change in our thinking. The good news is whatever the segmentation is our portfolio is still balanced and we can actually flex to either definition. So, we are managing the business by watching both.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Swartzberg of Stifel Financial.","Mark Swartzberg ","Indra, Hugh, a question about FX from a transactional standpoint. Obviously you have some major productivity programs underway and we are a couple of years into this. But when you look at specifically the countries of Mexico and China, are these higher transactional costs that are dollar-related -- are they impacting you to the scope or the phasing of some of your productivity programs in those particular countries?","Hugh Johnston ","Mark, I would say no. It really doesn't affect us a great deal. We obviously have got to be cognizant of what\u2019s happening with transactional ForEx. To the degree that we are experiencing that in a particular market, as Indra mentioned earlier, we are tending to price through about 75% of it. But in terms of if transactional ForEx is affecting capital that we would put in to drive productivity, it really isn't impacting us a great deal. It's not slowing down the rate because the returns on those initiatives tend to be pretty solid and we can overcome the FX impact.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Amit Sharma of BMO Capital Markets.","Amit Sharma ","Just a quick clarification first. The 75% rule that you're talking about, is that just to cover underlying inflation or should we expect that to cover the transactional FX as well?","Indra Nooyi ","I mean, transactional FX is what drives some of the inflation. And so they are all related. I have given you 75% of what we're doing today, it varies around that number. Sometimes we can do more, sometimes we can do less, but as a basket it's around 75%. The thing, Amit, is that globally we have been through in some country of the world hyperinflation, inflation, extraordinary inflation, geopolitical crises, we have been through that. And across PepsiCo exists a lot of playbooks on how to manage through these sorts of issues. So when we have a problem like this in a country we bring the experts in, we use one of these playbooks and then we use our extraordinary teams in these countries, then we judiciously manage through pricing, productivity, revenue management to see how best to insulate the portfolio.","And I think the good news about the portfolio is that the portfolio serves as a good hedge when you have a mix of countries, mix of businesses. That\u2019s what allows us to deliver the 7% constant currency growth, reiterate that guidance and the free cash flow guidance.","Hugh Johnston ","To be clear on that, I would think of the 75% as a rough modeling guideline, not an internal principle as to how we execute market by market. We vary market by market based on the opportunities in front of us.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Steve Powers of UBS.","Steve Powers ","Maybe just a couple of final clarifications. First on pricing specifically in Europe. Clearly it\u2019s difficult to realize in Western Europe, but the 6% price this quarter is falling well short of sort of the currency headwinds. So was there additional pricing that maybe you took after the quarter in Eastern Europe and Russia or do you still expect to take to catch up with currency? And if so what type of elasticity should we kind of think about around that incremental pricing? That's first. And then second, maybe, Hugh, just some clarification and sensitivities around that updated FX guidance, understanding you use consensus rates. If we benchmark to today's spot rates can you give us some sense of what that outlook would look like at spot rates and how it might improve? And then conversely, if you did move to the latest rates in Venezuela, some sensitivities around the magnitude of that impact in the other direction? ","Hugh Johnston ","Okay, Steve. That\u2019s multiple questions, but let me try to address it efficiently. Number one, you will see more pricing in Eastern Europe that will come through. To date the elasticities in Russia have been less than one. So as we put incremental pricing we will see how it looks going forward. But to date the elasticity has been less than one. So obviously that's been favorable to us.","Number two, in terms of the overall FX, spot numbers are moving around so much, I actually don't pay as much attention to spot as I do to market consensus. So not clear to me, it might be a little bit favorable at this point. But I would just stay focused on the guidance that we have given you rather than trying to anticipate it, it\u2019s awfully complex. And then the last question was around \u2013 I think that was it. Anyway, Steve, if you have another question you can give Jamie and the team a call.","End of Q&A","Indra Nooyi ","Yes. Thank you all for your questions. And in closing I just want to say that we have taken the necessary steps to position ourselves for sustainable long-term growth. I believe we are off to a good start in 2015, and we are navigating well through an uncertain and volatile environment. And I believe the first quarter of 2015 is a good example of how a well constructed portfolio, appropriate investment and disciplined execution can drive strong constant currency top- and bottom-line results. Our first quarter results give me confidence that our plans are working and that we are on track to deliver on our financial goals in 2015.","I thank you for your time this very busy morning and for the confidence you have placed in us with your investments.

Because this is our year-end call, I intend to provide a broader context today on PepsiCo's journey, our progress to date and our expectations for the coming year. As we entered 2012, I shared with you that we needed to use the year to reinvest in PepsiCo. Our business strengthened during the course of the year, with the fourth quarter looking particularly good. And we are well positioned to compete and create value as we enter 2013.Let me look back on the year and I think we made good progress on several fronts. First, we delivered on all of our financial commitments. Our 2012 organic revenue growth was squarely in the middle of our long term target range of mid-single digits, with growth of 5%, both in the quarter and for the full year, reflecting a good balance between volume growth and net pricing.We grew organic revenue growth across each of our businesses, both for the quarter and the full year, with particularly strong growth in emerging and developing markets. And we also had very solid growth in a number of our large developed markets businesses like Frito-Lay North America where organic revenue was up 5% in the quarter, driven by strong volume growth and was up 4% for the year. We stepped up investment in our brand by increasing our advertising and marketing support by 50 basis points of net revenue, exactly on target.We delivered our earnings per share directly on target. We exercised very disciplined cash management. Our capital spending was 4% of net revenue for the year, below our target of 4.5%, a 20% reduction from our 2011 CapEx investment level. We also saw improvement across each our key working capital metrics, particularly a decrease in inventory days and increase in payables days. All of these contributed to extremely healthy cash flow for the year.Our management operating cash flow increased 3%, even with the $1 billion after tax discretionary pension contribution and cash payments related to the major restructuring actions we implemented in 2012. Excluding the pension and restructuring cash outflows, our management operating cash flow increased 20% or by more than $1.2 billion compared to 2011. This cash flow performance enabled us to return $6.5 billion to PepsiCo shareholders through a combination of share repurchase and dividends, a 16% increase from 2011.Just as importantly, we leveraged our 2012 investments to strengthen the competitiveness of our businesses across a number of key dimensions that will drive long term value creation. First, we enhanced the equity of our global brand. We increased our spending across geographies and across both the food and beverage businesses. Importantly, these increased investments made across the spectrum of our brand from expanding our media spend in Good-For-You product platforms like Quaker to ensuring the competitiveness of our large, Fun-For-You brands like Pepsi and Doritos.And we not only stepped up the level of investment in A&M, but we also took steps to improve its efficiency and effectiveness by better leveraging our global scale and driving consistent brand positioning and coordinating advertising, creative and production activities. By doing this, we made our investment dollars work harder, allocating a greater percentage of the investment to what we refer to as working A&M, that is media and other consumer facing activities that drive greater awareness and regard for our brand. We\u2019re seeing positive results already from our increased investments, both in higher brand equity scores and in market share results that are beginning to improve nicely.Second, we stepped up our game-in innovation by bringing to market more balanced offerings, from line extensions that bring additional locations to our existing products and to new product platforms that are truly transformational. I am particularly pleased at both the number and rate of our new product platform as these typically have higher greater staying power and also the opportunity for consistent growth over a number of years. For example, just in the last year or so we\u2019ve introduced Quaker Real Medleys, a high quality oatmeal with real fruits and nuts which was just named breakfast product of the year for 2012.Pepsi Next which delivers real cola taste with 60 percent less sugar and achieved more than $100 million in retail sales in its first year. Starbucks Refreshers, our 60 calories sparkling beverage that provides a delicious boost of natural energy from green coffee extracts and real fruit juice and Gatorade Energy Chews, a convenient form of carb energy to fuel athletes prior to athletic competitions.In snacks, Doritos Locos Tacos sold more than 325 million shelves, contributing to the most successful product launch in Taco Bell\u2019s 50 year history, and expanded our presence in the food service channel. We are gearing up for year-two of our Doritos partnership with Taco Bell, with even more exciting products. And Quaker Yogurt Bars, originally launched in Canada, were a great example of our lift and shift model, as we successfully introduced them in the United States, driving recent U.S. share gain in bars.And we believe we are still in the early stages of reaping the benefits of our investments in R&D over the past several years. During 2012, we continued to invest in the R&D platform that will drive us future innovation and we will continue to do so in 2013. Now our R&D investments are highly focused. We are investing in technologies and capabilities that will enable us to deliver differentiated taste, functionality, packaging, and other benefits to consumers over the next five years and beyond. All of which we believe, will enable us to create differentiated product platforms that resulted in incrementality both at the top and bottom line.Third, we delivered on our productivity commitment. We executed a comprehensive restructuring program and accelerated our productivity efforts across the value chain. How we make, move and sell our products. We de-layered the organization and improved its efficiency. We reduced our headcounts and we rationalized our supply chains to reduce cost and investment in fixed asset. As a result of these efforts, we delivered in excess of $1 billion in productivity in 2012. And we are continuing to drive productivity across the entire value chain and across all of our businesses.We have a robust pipeline of projects, from leveraging best in class supply chain activities around the world, to increasing automation across the value chain from raw materials handling through to the route truck, to implementing new processing technologies that enable us to both increase asset utilization and reduce input cost. Now much of this is enabled by the IT investments we have made over the past several years, giving us greater visibility into our performance metrics across the globe. Some of these changes, from small actions repeated millions of times to utilizing new technology that changes the overall cost of key processes. Both of these give us high confidence that we will achieve a three-year, $3 billion productivity target through 2014. And even more importantly, we have already begun the work on our next big tranche of productivity.Fourth, we stepped up our execution game in 2012. In North America, we continued to drive cross-category in-store programming to increase the frequency with which our snacks and beverage products are purchased in the same basket, resulting in increasing in our share of our cross-category co-purchases in the United States. So while we have a great deal of opportunity to sharpen our capabilities of brand building, innovation, productivity realization, market place execution, I believe that 2012 marked a turning point for PepsiCo. We truly stepped up our game and created a foundation for continued improvement and competitive advantage.Now let me turn to our businesses and comment briefly about them in five buckets. I am going to talk to Frito-Lay North America, North American beverages, other developed markets in the group, developing in emerging markets as a group, and our Good-for-You nutrition businesses. Let me start with Frito-Lay North America.Frito obviously plays a critical role in the PepsiCo portfolio. It still enjoys terrific leadership in the growing savory snack category with lots of room to grow in the overall macro snacking market share in the United States and North America as a whole. Specifically, Frito's focus on generating steady, predictable growth and value creation by sourcing occasions from other macro snacks category, growing into the premium segment of snacks, and selectively competing in the value tier of the category. And doing all of this in a sensible, margin accretive, competitively advantaged manner.As you saw in the fourth quarter and for the full year, Frito-Lay North America generated very healthy organic top line growth, which is an encouraging sign that our strategy and execution are both working. As we look to 2013, we expect continued steady top line growth. And because we have returned to a more normal commodities environment with lower inflation, we expect the top line to have more balance between volume and pricing. Our goal is to gain value share in a sustainable way over the long-term through iconic brands, differentiated targeted innovation and flawless execution from farm to shelf. This is what the teams are focused on and I\u2019m pleased with their progress.Let me now turn to beverages North America and let me start by giving you my perspective on the CSD category. To begin, there is still growth potential in Carbonated Soft Drinks outside of Colas. Evidence the fact that Mountain Dew, our second largest CSD trademark, grew volume in North America in 2012 and we continued to innovate behind you as you saw with the launch of Mountain Dew Kickstart earlier this week.However, Colas have been under pressure for some time now. Colas have declined as consumers have increasingly sought greater variety in their repertoire of beverages. For this reason, we diversified our portfolio in North America actually that begun in the early 1990s when we embarked on a strategy to be a total beverage company and as a result of multiple steps in the diversification, today we have the leading position in liquid refreshment beverages in measured channels in North America. Almost 40% of our North American beverage volume is non-carbonated and only a fifth of our North American beverage volume is full sugar Cola.Our non-carbonated portfolio is very strong, with great brands in isotonics, juice and juice drinks, ready-to-drink teas, ready to drink coffee and waters, all of which have good growth prospects and we continue to innovate in every one of these categories. So what\u2019s our approach in Colas? Simply put, we\u2019d like to lead disruptive innovation. The industry has not had truly meaningful innovation in Colas since the introduction of Diet in 1960s. Our research indicates that consumers still love bubbles. They love the Cola taste, but would like to lower their caloric intake without the taste of artificial sweeteners.So as we shared with you over a year ago, we\u2019ve been developing new natural sweeteners and flavoring aimed at producing calories with no compromise on taste. We have some promising projects that are currently going through the FDA review process that once commercialized could potentially alter the trajectory of our Cola business in a meaningful way. And in the meantime, we\u2019re just going to continue to appropriately invest behind trademark Pepsi with marketing and innovation in order to maintain consumer excitement in the brand.Now besides our work on disruptive innovation, across the entire North American beverage business, we\u2019ve continued to optimize our supply chain to reduce costs. We\u2019re implementing price pack strategies to maximize revenue realization and we\u2019re exploring a variety of potential structural alternatives to improve profitability and returns and to drive further value creation. Early next year, we\u2019ll report our progress on these initiatives which will allow us to further unlock value from the PepsiCo North American beverage portfolio.Other developed markets. These businesses are relatively well positioned. We have very strong leadership positions in salty snacks in many of these markets and our beverage portfolio is strategically well positioned with a highly developed zero calorie carbonated soft drink and non-carbonated beverage portfolio. Even in a relatively difficult macro environment, our major west European markets as a group grew snack and beverage volume in 2012.Moving on. We continue to see very good growth in our developing and emerging markets, with organic revenue growth of 9% in the fourth quarter and for the full year 2012. Over the past five years, we\u2019ve deliberately invested to increase the significance of our emerging and developing markets within our total portfolio so that we could provide a more attractive growth profile for PepsiCo overall. We are growing in these important markets by driving greater penetration, frequency of consumption through tailored distribution models and by offering locally relevant innovation and a broad spectrum of value oriented offerings. These markets still have relatively low per capita consumption and therefore provide sizeable runways for future growth.Moving to major developing markets. Let me speak to a couple of key countries. We have a terrific position in Russia where we are the number one food and beverage business by a factor of two. And in the fourth quarter, our organic revenue growth in Russia was 10%, demonstrating our ability to leverage our brand, scale and product spread to drive growth in this important market. A second developing market, Mexico. We have a powerful snacks business with clear leadership in both salty snacks and biscuits. We have combined our salty and biscuit businesses into one unit, driving greater synergies and growth. And just over a year ago, we strengthened our Mexican beverage business, through the consolidation of our bottling system under a new joint venture that increased our scale and stepped up our operating capability. And our snacks and beverage businesses in Mexico continue to find new ways to work together on joint promotion and creative channel development initiatives.The strength of our operations in Mexico was evident in the fourth quarter with organic revenue growth of 7%. Moving on to our emerging market businesses which are largely centered in our EMEA sector because EMEA is predominantly an emerging market business because we have relatively small presence in countries like Japan. Within the Asian emerging markets we have strong salty snack leadership. Our China beverage business was recently strengthened by a formation of a partnership with Tingyi, giving us a [system] relative market share advantage of 1.5 times.And in India, we recently further consolidated our bottling network, which will drive greater scale and advantage in that market. In the Middle East, we enjoy a five times relative market share in snacks and a three times relative market share in beverage. Reflecting the strength of our business across EMEA, we enjoyed, double-digit organic revenue in 2012 with especially strong organic revenue growth in Saudi Arabia, India and Pakistan.Let me now turn to our nutrition business. Over the years, we have built a strong Good-for-Your portfolio across the key platforms of food and vegetables, grains, and sports nutrition. We have strong well-positioned brands like Tropicana, Quaker, Gatorade, Sabra and Stacy's. We are innovating with differentiated products that are worth paying more for. We are increasingly leveraging these brands and product portfolios globally and we are intelligently addressing gaps in our portfolio, as we did with protein through the value-added dairy platform with Wimm-Bill-Dann in Russia, and through our capital efficient Muller and Almarai joint venture that leverage both PepsiCo and our partners unique capability.Now these Good-for-You products are an attractive category with strong growth tailwinds and good margins, and offer the potential for continued value creation for many years to come as consumers migrate more of their beverage and snacking habits to include more protein, food and vegetable and grain, and value-added dairy products. Because consumers are both very loyal and willing to pay price premium for products in these categories, we have continued to see the opportunity to create a great deal of value through investing behind Good-for-You innovation, and expect that we will continue to accelerate our efforts in this attractive space.Overall, we feel good about the state of the company, our execution capabilities, and the caliber of our associates. Now, on to our outlook for 2013. I don\u2019t have to remind you that there are still considerable unresolved economic and political issues in the United States and Europe, and there are number of emerging and developing markets that are also subject to economic and political volatility. So it's against this uncertain macro backdrop that we are providing our outlook. Now, Hugh, will provide a lot more color on the financial outlook in a moment, but in summary for 2013 we expect mid-single digit organic revenue growth with contributions from each of our division, driven by continued relatively strong growth in developing and emerging markets. And we expect 7% core, constant currency EPS growth reflecting the earnings associated with solid organic revenue growth and our continued focus on productivity and strategic investments.Well, let me wrap up my comments before I turn it over Hugh. We believe we have a stronger business as a result of investments we made and the actions we took in 2012. And we are well positioned as we head into 2013 with lots of runway for growth in the future. We have strong presence and attractive and highly complementary growth categories. Our product portfolio has broad appeal across dayparts, need states, cohorts, and occasions from indulgent products to nutritious Good-For-You offerings.Our global footprint is balanced with well-established positions in virtually every emerging, developing and developed market in the world, with strategies and business models tailored to maximize our performance in each market. We have an enviable portfolio of well-defined brands that consumers know and love. Our advantage supply chains enable us to achieve superior reach with greater efficiency. And we have deep offering capability in every aspect of our business. Most importantly, we\u2019re not content with the status quo. We\u2019ll continue to work hard to strengthen our brand, accelerate innovation and drive relentlessly productivity and excellence in every aspect of our business.So with that, let me turn the call over to Hugh Johnston.Hugh JohnstonThanks Indra and good morning everyone. I\u2019ll spend just a minute covering the 2013 outlook in a bit more detail and then we\u2019ll open the lines to your questions. For 2013, we expect core constant currency EPS growth of 7% off our core 2012 base of $4.10.We expect organic revenue of mid-single-digits, core constant currency operating profit growth of approximately 6% and approximately 1 point of leverage below the operating profit line, driven by share repurchases, offset somewhat by higher net interest expense of approximately $90 million from higher debt balances.And we expect our core effective tax rate to be approximately 27% for the full year. Within these expectations we assume positive price mix, low single digit commodity inflation, productivity of $900 million and A&M growing at least in line with our net revenue growth.We continue to manage our commodities using a systematic hedging program and at this point we have more than half of our commodity exposures covered for the year with more coverage in the clos-in quarters and the level of coverage will ramp up as we move further into the year.We expect the rate of inflation to be fairly consistent across the quarters in total and that rate of inflation will be more pronounced in foods than in beverages. Our productivity assumption is completely in line with the three year, $3 billion program that we launched last year and the savings will be used to help offset inflation as well as provide funding for investment back into the business.One of our key investment areas was supporting our brands with advertising and marketing, where we\u2019ll grow our A&M investment at least in line with net sales, meaning you should expect A&M spending of at least 5.7% of sales which was our 2012 base line investment. In addition, we\u2019re also accelerating our investment in research and development and innovation.We anticipate foreign exchange translation to have up to a 1 point negative impact on our net revenue, operating profit and EPS for the full year and this includes the impact of last week\u2019s Venezuela devaluation. We also expect an approximate $100 million non-core charge related to the devaluation of our monetary assets in Venezuela in Q1. And we anticipate structural changes primarily bottler re-franchisings will have a negative impact on our full year net revenue growth of approximately 1 point.As you model out the first quarter, we expect foreign exchange translation to have a negative 2 point impact on EPS. Revenue in the first quarter will have an estimated 3 point negative impact from structural changes and a negative 1 point impact from foreign exchange translation.From a cash flow perspective, we except management operating cash flow excluding certain items of more than $7 billion. We\u2019ll continue to drive cash flow through even more efficient working capital management and continued tight controls over capital spending.For 2013, we expect to see continued improvement in our key working capital metrics and to manage net capital spending to $3 billion which is well within our long term target of less than or equal to 5% of net revenue.From an M&A perspective, consistent with our past comments, we believe the portfolio was largely where it needs to be and consequently we do not see the need for any large scale M&A. As a result, we will continue to return strong cash flow to our shareholders. We just approved a new three-year $10 billion share repurchase program to succeed the current program that expires in June of this year, and our board has approved a 5.6% quarterly dividend increase beginning with or June payment.In total, we expect to return approximately $6.4 billion to shareholders in 2013. $3.4 billion in dividends and $3 billion in share repurchases. Next, our outlook for 2013 is consistent with our long-term targets for net revenue, operating profit and EPS. We expect to drive improved margins and improved net ROIC, and we expect to generate and return cash flow to our shareholders and that remains a top priority for the company. With that I will wrap it up and operator we will take the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","","(Operator Instructions) Our first question is coming from John Faucher with JPMorgan.John Faucher - JPMorganA question on Frito. If we look at the track data, whether it's the absolute level of sales or even the market shares, the results today are better than I think we would have expected. So can you talk a little bit about what's your scene and maybe in the non-track channel there. And then if you think about the market share issue, how should we be thinking about Frito's share within salty snacks and the how that\u2019s going to work in the broader context of the whole Frito-Lay business. Thanks.Indra NooyiJohn, good morning. Brian Cornell is right here. So let me have Brian talk about the Frito-Lay business.Brian CornellI think we saw a very balanced result in the quarter. I think the overall investments we have made in brand building, in innovation, our focus on productivity and execution, really played out well in the fourth quarter. And I think you saw that equate to growth in our value share or volume share and also improvement in unit share. So we are very pleased with the execution in the quarter. We would expect that to continue as we go into next year.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.Bryan Spillane - Bank of America Merrill LynchCould you talk a little bit about the progress you have made on the integration of Wimm-Bill-Dann in Russia and just sort of where you see that business today versus what you were expecting at the beginning of the year? And just some more color in terms of the underlying performance and trends there.Indra NooyiYeah. You know the integration has gone exceedingly well, Brian, and the business is performing at CapEx levels. You know I have here, Zein, who was the architect of the Russia business. Wayne, why don\u2019t you answer this question?Zein AbdallaYeah, as Indra said, Bryan, the integration has gone exceptionally well. As we did the due diligence on the whole Wimm-Bill-Dann acquisition we realized that we are buying a business with very strong brands and a very strong management team. And obviously those two things really do support your ability to integrate. I think the other thing that we would really call out is that as we have merged these businesses, it's given us the opportunity to really strengthen our go-to-market systems across our total businesses. And again as I have told you about many times, when you think about Russia with its multiple time zones, the immense geography, that the strength that you have in reach across that country as a result of the scale of your operation is critical. And Wimm-Bill-Dann has given us a real step up in that.And I guess the final thing we would call out is that the innovation opportunity that it brings to really strengthen our snack and beverage approach by getting us into that morning day part and our ability to leverage our assets into a whole new day part, has really proven out as well. So we are just immensely pleased with both the top and the bottom line performance, the synergy that it's brought into the business but also the growth potential that has opened up for us in Russia.Indra NooyiAnd Wimm-Bill-Dann is a great team. The team is excellent.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Ali Dibadj with Bernstein.Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. BernsteinJust want to get a better sense of, I guess your thought process on the returns of the investments you made this year and as manifested in your 2013 EPS guidance. Because the 7% core numbers sounds a lot like other CPG companies; but most other CPG companies didn't go through a big reinvestment year and a negative 7 EPS type number. So I totally get the macro challenges here, but could that growth trajectory suggest that they\u2019re not just macro challenges, but there may be structural challenges in the business versus other CPG companies? How do you gain confidence that that is not the case?Hugh JohnstonWhy don\u2019t I take that one? Morning Alex. When we set up the launch from guidance that we shared last year, we set that out within the context of making those investments. So what we were doing with the investments in 2012 was certainly known to us when we said mid-single digit on revenue we said high single digit on EPS. I don\u2019t think that should come as a particular surprise. In addition to that, as we talked about, the investments we were making were in brand building, they were in innovation, and they were in execution. And obviously the returns on those things are not an immediate one year flip the switch type of return. What they\u2019re really geared towards is strengthening the franchise and extending the duration of performance of the company.So as we put our numbers together and it all really goes back to the fact that we broadened our product portfolio, we expanded our geographic portfolio and then we felt like at that moment we had a good opportunity to so called fuel up the race car to basically deliver an extended period of mid-single digit revenue and high single digit earnings per share by virtue of strengthening our innovation, our brand building and our execution capabilities. And I think from those moves that we\u2019ve made in 2012, even in an uncertain environment you\u2019re seeing us come forward with guidance that\u2019s in line with what we projected for the long term and we feel good about that guidance.Indra NooyiIf I could just add something to what Hugh said. If you go back to 2012, the big reinvestment we made in the company and the down earnings is because we had extraordinary commodity inflation. All of it was not reinvestment. Commodity inflation was extremely high. Going into 2013, we don\u2019t see massive commodity deflation. We\u2019re still seeing inflation that\u2019s just headed to the lower level and we have a very uncertain macroeconomic environment. So I think it\u2019s critically important we take all of that into account while we manage this very large company and not try to get ahead of our teeth and that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to do.","OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.Dara Mohsenian \u2013 Morgan StanleyGood morning. So Hugh, there is not much gap between your 2013 mid-single digit organic top-line growth guidance and 6% profit growth. So can you discuss your expectations in a little more granularity around margin performance in 2013, and why you wouldn't see greater margin expansion with both the strong productivity as well as fairly benign commodity costs and flat ad spend as a percent of sales?","Hugh JohnstonSure. Happy to, Dara. Obviously there\u2019s a lot of variables that go into a $66 billion P&L. we talk about productivity. We talked about the low single digit commodities. We talked about A&M being at least 5.7% and we also talked about making investments in R&D and innovation. All of those are factors. In addition to that, as you certainly know and is common across CPG companies, the faster growth comes from developing and emerging markets and there is a bit of a margin drag out of the faster growth in those markets. Obviously over time the margins will increase in those markets, but it takes a bit of time for that to happen. So as we put all of the numbers together, risk access the plan, we felt like going from 5 revenue to 6 up profit to 7 EPS was the right guidance for 2013.Dara Mohsenian \u2013 Morgan StanleyOkay. And then just following up on the R&D comment, Indra, you touched on innovation that could eventually impact your beverage business in a meaningful way. We\u2019ve heard similar comments in the past. It sounded a little stronger to me today. Are you closer to commercialization on the beverage side of the business? Can we expect something there in the short to medium term?Indra NooyiWe\u2019re just waiting for the FDA approval Dara and that\u2019s not in our hands. It\u2019s in the government\u2019s hands. Once we get the FDA approval we\u2019ll be launching _.","OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank.Bill Schmitz \u2013 Deutsche BankGood morning. Hey, can you talk about the update on the US DSD system? I think you said at the Analyst Day it was 12 to 18 months to decide how it was progressing. So can you just give us an update on, relative to the plan you put in place last February, how you think things are progressing there and if anything has changed down the strategic alternatives front.Indra NooyiWell, as we talked about on the script, we are doing a lot of things with our North American beverage business. We are investing in brand, all the brand equity scores are trending up nicely. We are optimizing the supply chain to reduce cost, doing a lot of work in price-pack strategy and while doing all that, we are looking at structural alternatives. Sensible structural alternatives to improve profitability and returns. Bill, early next year we will report our progress on these initiatives. And we want to make sure that as our disruptive technology all comes to the marketplace, we don\u2019t do something in the short-term to really lose out on big value creating opportunities in the long-term. So stay tuned, we will be back to you early next year.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs.Judy Hong - Goldman SachsI guess I just wanted to get your perspective on pricing outlook in North America across both snack and beverages. And in the context of just the CSD category as a whole being a little bit sluggish, consumer a little bit still challenged. And in snacks with more benign commodity environment, can you just give us your confidence level in achieving some type of price realization in 2013 to kind of be part of that 5% or mid-single revenue growth algorithm.Hugh JohnstonYeah, Judy, this is Hugh, why don\u2019t I take that one. From the standpoint of the foods businesses, I think what you are going to expect to see for the year is modest pricing. Obviously the numbers that you are seeing right now don\u2019t reflect that, but as we get towards the end of the first quarter, I think you will start to see modest pricing come into place inside of the food businesses. In the beverage business, we have got our North American pricing in place. We are satisfying with the pricing that we have been able to get out into the market place. And we think it's consistent with the algorithm we provided and we are comfortable with that in the context of the commoditized environment that we are facing in 2013.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Caroline Levy with CLSA.Caroline Levy - CLSAI would love you to just bring us up-to-date with what's going on in China. How your volume looked in the quarter and what your strategy is in terms of the portfolio of CSD versus non-carbs. I think you are starting to get a little bigger in juices, sports drinks are growing there. If you could just talk a little bit about that.Indra NooyiEver since the refranchising of our beverage business at Tingyi, the business has strengthened quarter after quarter. And our business in China, especially as we are going to the Chinese New Year as we speak, is looking very strong. Remember the refranchising to Tingyi was done from a position of strength. They brought to the market, teas, some juice and juice drinks. We brought to the market some juice and juice drinks, and we brought a very strong CSD portfolio. So the combination created a business that\u2019s 1.5 times the size of the next player. As I look at the business today, February second week and year-to-date, and looking back over the last couple of quarters since the refranchising, the business is strengthening. And usually in the December period, in anticipation of Chinese New Year, you start seeing some weird volume numbers, but the best way to look at it is through Chinese New Year. And we are in the middle of the Chinese New Year as we speak and I would say that through this Chinese New Year, our volumes are looking extremely attractive at this point. The market is robust and I think we have ourselves a good business in China.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Jonathan Feeney with Janney Capital Markets.Jonathan Feeney - Janney Montgomery ScottI wanted to follow-up on the impact of the U.S. macro environment on both the snacks and beverage business. Because it occurs to me that -- it seems like for most of the past couple of years you've had a depressed environment for those key channels and some of your higher margin channels. And now there's counter currents going on. You have a little bit, it seems better consumer confidence, but at the same time you are getting hit with this payroll tax. Would you say the fourth quarter was a better sequentially from the third quarter as far as your takeaway on performance in those macro-sensitive channels? And looking into 2013, do you see sustained improvement in those channels for your products? Thanks.Indra NooyiJonathan, you are asking the question of the impact of the economic environment on the retail channels. In a quarter that\u2019s usually the most difficult quarter to read because Q1 is full of storms in the East Coast, storms in the Midwest, and retail activity is influenced by all of these weather-related activities which have nothing to do with the underlying performance. All I would tell you is, as we came out of Q4 going into Q1, notwithstanding the fact that we've had all these weather-related issues and we are overlapping a very warm winter from last year, retail trends are okay, by and large holding up. Week-to-week there are some changes, but overall they are holding up and our business is holding up too.This year it's more about volume. Last year it was more about price. We\u2019re still seeing foot traffic and gas prices haven't gone up too much. So on balance our retail activity still seems to be holding up and our business is holding up, because again as I said, Q1 is probably the most difficult quarter to extrapolate from, especially January and February because weather plays havoc on traffic, business and overall performance. So we plan accordingly.","OperatorYour final question comes from the line of Ann Gurkin with Davenport.Ann Gurkin \u2013 DavenportGood morning. One of the great prospects for me for Pepsi was always a potential for increasing snack sales and penetration outside of the U.S. so I was wondering if you could update us on the potential for that strategy. And then returning to the U.S. the CSD categories are getting a lot of pressure on sugar drinks, obesity and I was wondering how Pepsi plans on attacking those claims and is there a need for increased spending?Indra NooyiThank you for asking the question. Internationally as we said in our script our snack business is doing very, very well, Mexico, Latin America all over Western Europe, East Europe, Middle East, you name it, Asia Pacific. There is not a country in the world that our snack business is not doing well. More importantly many, many countries of the world, the snack business, piggybacks off of our beverage business very nicely. We take talent from our beverage business, put them into the snack business and in many cases they even share a common distribution system. So our snack business is looking good. Low per caps in many countries so we have lots of room to grow going into the future. So good prospects. Turning to sugared beverages in North America as we said in our script, a couple of decades ago we started to diversify the portfolio. We are the number one liquid profession beverage company in measured channels in North America and we have a very diversified portfolio where 40% of our volume in North America comes from non-CSDs. And so we feel good about the portfolio.Yes there is a lot of talk about sugared beverages and sort of negative conversation going on about it. Diversification of the portfolio is one thing. Investing in disruptive technology as we talked about is the second thing. And we started to do both several years ago. Diversification a couple of decades ago, investment in disruptive technology about three to four year ago and we've been very consistent in talking about it for the last three to four years because we anticipated this market trend a couple \u2013 three years ago. And I think we are in a good position. The challenge is not to do anything stupid in the short term in terms of chasing share just in order to maintain some sort of a volume share. That\u2019s not the way to play this game I think we\u2019re playing it in a very sensible way. I feel good about our North American beverage business.OperatorThat was our final question I'll now turn the floor back over to management for closing remarks.Indra NooyiLet me just close out our call this morning. Again we made great progress in 2012 and delivered on our commitments. We are entering 2013 a stronger business as a result of the investments we have made and the actions we have taken. Third we have a great business, with so much to be proud of and upon which we can continue to build and grow. And finally we remained unwavering in our focus to deliver results, create value and doing what's right for the short, medium and long term health of the business. Thank you all for joining us and for the confidence you\u2019ve placed in us with your investment. Have a good day.OperatorThank you. This concludes today's Conference Call.

Your lines have been placed on listen-only until the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Today\u2019s call is being recorded and will be archived at www.pepsico.com.","It is now my pleasure to introduce Mr. Jamie Caulfield, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Caulfield, you may begin.","","Jamie Caulfield","Thanks, Jacky. With me today are Indra Nooyi, PepsiCo\u2019s Chairman and CEO and Hugh Johnston, PepsiCo\u2019s CFO. We\u2019ll lead off today\u2019s call with a review of our third quarter performance and 2013 outlook and then we\u2019ll move on to Q&A. In an effort to get to as many analyst questions as possible within the hour, we have kept our prepared remarks relatively short this morning, and we are going to have a one question limit, so we should be able to get through the full queue of analysts when we get to the Q&A.","Before we begin, please take note of our cautionary statement. This conference call includes forward-looking statements, including statements regarding 2013 guidance and our long-term targets based on currently available information. Forward-looking statements inherently involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those predicted in such forward-looking statements. Statements made on this conference call should be considered together with cautionary statements and other information contained in today\u2019s earnings release and in our most recent periodic reports filed with the SEC.","Unless otherwise indicated all references to EPS and total operating profit growth are on a core basis. In addition, references to organic revenue results in this call exclude the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, structural changes and foreign exchange translation.

As we discuss our results today, please keep in mind that our Q3 reporting period reflects the 12 weeks ended September 7 for our North America businesses and the months of June, July and August for the vast majority of our businesses outside North America.","Now, it\u2019s my pleasure to introduce Indra Nooyi.","","Indra Nooyi","Thank you, Jamie and good morning everyone. I am pleased to report good results for the third quarter despite significant volatility experienced in a couple of our AMEA region markets. From a top line perspective, our business largely maintained the top line momentum we saw in the first half and our year-to-date and expected full year organic revenue growth is right in line with our long-term mid-single-digit growth target.","Our organic revenue growth reflected each of the four business units achieving positive net price realization in the quarter and we had particularly good organic revenue growth at Frito-Lay North America, which was up mid-single-digits and Latin America foods, which was up double-digits. And this was both in the quarter and year-to-date as well as in key developing and emerging markets such as China, where we had strong double-digit organic revenue growth both in the quarter and year-to-date; Brazil, where we had 9% organic revenue growth both in the quarter and year-to-date and Turkey, where we had 7% organic revenue growth in the quarter and 9% organic revenue growth year-to-date. Snacks volume grew 3% and our beverage volume grew 1% on an organic basis globally both in the quarter and year-to-date.","Our international beverage volume growth was strong, up 4% on an organic basis in the quarter and 5% year-to-date. Operating performance was solid. We had good gross profit flow through with core gross margins improving 70 basis points in the quarter. We improved core operating margin even as we continued to invest in A&M with A&M as a percent of sales up 40 basis points and we made incremental marketplace investments of almost $30 million as part of the incremental investment program we announced last quarter. In addition our three year productivity program remains on track; we project delivering $900 million of productivity in 2013 and expect to deliver the full 3 billion three year target by year end 2014.","Our productivity is funding our growth initiative and is contributing to our operating margin improvement. We\u2019re reaping productivity from across the value chain through the acceleration of global procurement initiatives and coordination of our global supply chain which in turn is enabled by the investments we have made over the past decade in our SAP platform.","Year-to-date in 2013 PepsiCo, organic revenue grew approximately 4%, core gross margins improved by 1.5 basis points, A&M as a percent of sales increased 50 basis points and operating margins expanded by 65 basis points. Core constant currency EPS is up low double digits year-to-date and we continue manage cash flow exceedingly well. Year-to-date management operating cash flow excluding certain items was $5.5 billion, a 12% increase of the comparable 2012 period.","We have returned $4.6 billion to shareholders to the first three quarters in the form of dividends and share repurchases and we\u2019re on-track to return $6.4 billion by the end of this year right in line with the target we set at the beginning of the year.","As you all know the macro environment continues to be challenging. Developed markets remain sluggish and emerging markets are volatile particularly those experiencing political and civil unrest. In challenging times such as these it's especially important to stay focused on execution and that\u2019s really what we\u2019re doing, focusing on the fundamentals to drive good, sustainable performance. Additionally, we have performed well because our portfolio of brands are extensive and strong, our products are on trend and relatedly diverse. And we have a broad geographic footprint, let me talk to each. Our brand portfolio as you know has been well architected. We have a great line-up of iconic brands that cover everything from treat to healthy eats. Our brands worldwide stands for safety, quality, taste and affordability. We\u2019re investing appropriately behind our brands and our increased investments have resulted in even stronger brand equity scores.","More importantly the strength of our innovation, design capabilities and revenue management skills which are all foundational building blocks are applied across our categories to sustain top-line growth and profitability. Just to give you some examples, in innovation we had six of the top 25 new food and beverage product introductions across all measured U.S. retail channels year-to-date and we have seven new products this year that are on pace to achieve $100 million each in annual retail sales in the United States, Mountain Dew KickStart, Tostitos Cantina, Quaker Medleys platform which has been expanded to ready-to-eat cereals and bars, Starbucks Iced Coffee, Lipton Pure Leaf Tea, Muller Quaker Yogurt and Gatorade Frost Glacier Cherry. We continue to see positive results from my investments in innovation. Innovation as a percentage of net revenue is more than 8% year-to-date, a 100% basis point improvement year-over-year. We have recently opened our innovation design center and they are looking to increase the pace and incrementality of innovation with more reframed and breakthrough innovation as we move forward.","In addition our geographic footprint allows us to fully capitalize in the diversity of our portfolio including the solid top-line performance, high margins, high returns and healthy cash flows of our developed market with a high top-line growth and future marginal return expansion potential of emerging and developing markets as we drive greater scale by fully capitalizing on the related diversity of the portfolio.","In many markets including the U.S., Russia, Mexico, we\u2019re either the largest or the number two food and beverage supplier and this scale is so important in today\u2019s environment where retailers competition for share of the shoppers basket and manufacturers competition for share of retail sales is intensifying. The scale, ubiquity and related velocity of our categories make us an essential partner for retailers and consequently we relied upon to drive a large share of our retail partner\u2019s growth. And our retail partners increasingly seek us out for joint business planning activities to explore mutual creative ways to drive our respective businesses. So all the benefits of our scale and product and geographic portfolios enable us to deal with headwinds and capitalize on the tailwinds within categories and across geographies.","So with that as a background, overall our business is on track and we are pleased with the progress we have made strengthening our competitive position across our key developed, developing and emerging markets. We have managed the business as a portfolio and we have remained highly disciplined in our approach leveraging our combined scale and capabilities to build sustainable value rather than overreacting to short-term pricing pressures or local value brand initiatives. As a result over the past six quarters in both salty snacks and beverages, we have seen increases in aggregate market share for our top strategic international markets that account for approximately 80% of our total international business. And year-to-date in the United States, we have grown value share at Frito-Lay and sequentially improve the value share in beverages even as we have outpaced the industry in net price realization at retail.","Let me comment now on our individual operating segments. Each of our businesses performed well financially and the marketplace in Q3. Just to give you some highlights. At Frito-Lay North America, we generated 3% volume growth and mid-single-digit organic revenue growth with 2 points of net price realizations and the performance was very balanced with volume and revenue performance positive across each major U.S. channels. We gained value, volume and unit share in salty snacks in the quarter and year-to-date. We expanded core operating margins by about 25 basis points in the quarter and 35 basis points year-to-date even as we increased advertising and marketing expense.","Our advertising initiative was focused on our core brands, for example, Doritos\u2019 For the Bold integrated marketing campaign was executed across TV, digital and social media and was supported by new Doritos logo and updated packaging. And our Lays 75 and Sunny campaign sort of celebrated 75 summers of Lays and we continued to capitalize on a highly successful consumer driven Do Us a Flavor campaign with a winner Cheesy Garlic Bread launched at retail in Q3. And our innovation continues to perform well led by Tostitos Cantina, Doritos Jacked Ranch Dipped Hot Wings, Cheetos Mix-Ups, as I mentioned Lays Do Us a Flavor. So that\u2019s Frito-Lay North America.","Now, before I go into the Pepsi America\u2019s beverage performance let me give you some perspective in the North American beverage industry, which is much watched and much talked about. First, the beverage category in North America remains the largest category in food and beverages here in the United States at over $90 billion at retail and it is very profitable. It\u2019s very relevant to retailers and is one of the first categories retailers look to when overall growth slows. As many of you know, the LRB category has slowed and the shift from the CSDs to non-carbonated beverages has accelerated. CSD is now comprised approximately 40% of the U.S. LRB category volume versus approximately more than 50% a decade ago. We have a competitive position in CSDs and we have a very strong leadership position in the faster growing non-carbonated beverages. This advantage enables us to hold or grow overall measured channel LRB value share as we manage the challenges of the CSD category in a responsible and sustainable way. Our strategy is to compete on the basis of innovation and marketing and to manage the business responsibly and profitably. We are convinced this is the right strategy to increase shareholder value given category realities. And as we have said in the past, we continued to explore the potential for structural changes in our North American beverage business to create further value. So we continued to achieve attractive net price realization as we simultaneously invest in brands and R&D.","So with this as the backdrop, let me now talk about our performance at Pepsi America\u2019s beverages in the quarter with the focus on North America. We achieved another quarter of solid net price realization with net price realization up 3 points. In the U.S. our LRB value share slightly out performed our primary competitor and measured channels lead by our advantage non-carb portfolio with value share gains and ready to drink sports drink and chilled juice. Our retail pricing in LRB and in CSDs led overall pricing in those categories and our key new product launches are performing very well. Mountain Dew KickStart, a product targeting morning energy needs of Millennials is expected to significantly exceed a $100 million in the first year retail sales. Capitalizing and momentum of the morning platform, we will be expanding Kickstart as an evening energy occasion in early 2014. Lipton Pure Leaf Premium Tea continues to perform well and has reached a 9% value share and ready to drink tea and is also on track to exceed a $100 million in retail sales in its first year. Tropicana Farmstand is a delicious chilled 100% juice of one serving of fruit plus one serving of vegetables in every glass and that\u2019s doing well and Starbucks Iced Coffee is performing ahead of expectations, it has reached a 7.5% value share position ready to drink coffee and is on pace to achieve approximately a $100 million in retail sales in it's first year.","And of course our businesses, we continue to sharpen how we leverage our scale and capabilities to drive incremental value. As a focus and integrated food and beverage company we are able to better serve our consumers and retail customers by providing unique value to them through powerful properties like the NFL. Our partnership with the NFL continues to be among PepsiCo\u2019s most successful sports sponsorship. This year we\u2019re taking our partnership to the NFL to a new level with NFL activations that include Pepsi, Gatorade, Tostitos, Quaker, Tropicana, Aquafina and Sabra brands.","Let me now move on to developing and emerging markets, organic revenue grew 9% in the quarter. Most of our developing and emerging market continue to perform well. As we build our business by driving greater penetration. Organic snacks volume increased 4% in developing and emerging markets in the quarter led by particularly strong growth in China which is our 15%, Pakistan of 23%, and Turkey which grew 11% just to name a few. Year-to-date organic snacks volume in developing and emerging markets also grew 4% led by double digit growth in China and Pakistan and high single digit growth in Egypt, Turkey, South Africa and India. And again we\u2019re managing the business in a sustainable and responsible way by focusing on profitable growth in segments where brands and quality matter.","Organic beverage volume grew 4.5% in developing and emerging markets led by double digit growth in China, Philippines, Pakistan, Poland and South Africa. Year-to-date organic beverage volume in developing and emerging markets grew 5.5% led by double digit growth in China, Philippines, Pakistan and Poland to name a few. We\u2019re encouraged by our performance in these important markets and excited by the long term growth prospects they present. We have built extremely strong businesses across every important developing and emerging market, in large part by leverage the presence of the beverage businesses we established decades ago. So for example today we have an integrated food and beverage business in Ukraine with sales approaching $0.5 billion. We\u2019re the number one food and beverage business in the Middle-East and along with our partner Tingyi has the number one beverage business in China. As we continue to drive greater consumer penetration frequency in these markets we build scale which makes us more efficient. This allows us to continue to invest in these markets and at the same time increase our operating margins. However as we mentioned in our earnings release there was a meaningful slowdown in the third quarter in our businesses in Egypt and India which accounts for the deceleration of organic revenue in AMEA from the double digit rate of growth we saw in the first half of the year.","Egypt\u2019s performance was impacted by the political turmoil and India reflected unusually aggressive industry pricing. In each case we\u2019re pleased to note early trends in Q4 have improved. The potential for volatility especially in developing and emerging markets is in part why we provide annual but not quarterly targets. The important thing to remember is that we fully expect to achieve a mid-single digit organic revenue growth goal for full year 2013 and as we look beyond 2013 we believe we\u2019re positioned well to deliver our long-term financial goals, which we believe will translate to top tier total shareholder return on a sustainable basis.","With that, let me turn the call over to Hugh. Hugh?","","Hugh Johnston","Great, thanks Indra. I will spend just a minute covering the financial results and guidance in a little more detail and then we will open up the lines to your questions. For Q3, organic volume grew 3% in snacks and 1% in beverages. Organic revenue grew 3.3%. Commodity inflation was up low single-digits. Our core gross margins improved by about 70 basis points and we increased A&M expense by 8%. Core constant currency operating profit grew 3%. Incremental investments totaled $28 million pre-tax in the quarter. Excluding the impact of incremental investments, core constant currency operating profit grew 4%.","Our core effective tax rate was 25.5%, approximately 80 basis points below Q3 2012. And core constant currency EPS grew 5% and 6% excluding the incremental investment. So between core constant currency division operating profit growth of 3% and core constant currency EPS growth of 5%, we got about 1.5 points of leverage including nearly a point of de-leverage from higher net interest expense, 1 point of leverage from a lower tax rate which will reverse in the fourth quarter as we are forecasting the full year core effective tax rate to come in at approximately 27% and 1 point from weighted average share count, which was down 1% year-on-year. Overall, the quarter came in largely as expected with pricing actions, commodity inflation and productivity all in line with our expectations.","On a reported basis, net revenue was up 1.5% reflecting over a 1 point drag from foreign exchange and about a 0.5 point negative impact from the Vietnam refranchising. We generated over $6.6 billion in cash flow from operations year-to-date, an improvement of $1.5 billion versus last year. This was driven by lower pension contributions and strong working capital improvements. Year-to-date management operating cash flow excluding certain items was approximately $5.5 billion, an increase of approximately 12% year-over-year reflecting the growth in earnings, disciplined capital expenditure investment and continued improvement in working capital management. And we returned $4.6 billion to shareholders year-to-date in the form of dividends and share repurchases.","Now, turning to guidance, consistent with what we have said throughout this year, for the full year 2013, we expect core constant currency EPS growth of 7% off of a core 2012 base of $4.10. And consistent with our previous guidance, we expect mid-single-digit organic revenue growth, core constant currency operating profit growth of approximately 6%, approximately 1 point of leverage below the operating profit line driven by share repurchases and we expect our core effective tax rate to be approximately 27% for the full year. Within these expectations, we assume positive price mix, low single-digit commodity inflation and productivity of $900 million. Our productivity assumption is completely in line with the three-year $3 billion program that we launched last year and the savings will be used to help offset inflation as well as provide funding for investment back into the business.","And as we mentioned on the last conference call, you should also take into account that we intend to incrementally invest the balance of the Vietnam gain in the balance of year, which will impact operating profit growth and margins. Regarding foreign exchange based on current market consensus, we anticipate foreign exchange translation to have approximately a 2 point negative impact on our net revenue and at least a 2 point negative impact on operating profit and EPS for the full year including the impact of the Venezuela devaluation. As we anticipate structural changes driven by China and Vietnam, we\u2019ll have a negative impact of approximately 1 point on our full year net revenue growth. As a reminder the world remains a volatile place as evidenced in our AMEA region this quarter. Despite the volatility we continue to expect investments in long term value building initiatives such as advertising, innovation, and in emerging markets growth capacity. As you model out the fourth quarter these are our expectations, foreign exchange translation should have an appropriate three point unfavorable impact on fourth quarter revenue and upto a four point unfavorable impact on fourth quarter EPS based on current market consensus rates. Revenue in the fourth quarter will have an estimated 1.5 of a percentage point negative impact from structural changes due to the Vietnam we\u2019re franchising. Division operating profit will be impacted by higher sequential commodity cost inflation as we had expected, incremental investments funded by the Q2 Vietnam gain increasing A&M expense and negative foreign exchange. Below the division operating profit line corporate cost in Q4 will be above prior year levels based on the timing of investments primarily in R&D.","Net interest expense will increase versus last year primary reflecting higher rates. And our tax rate will be significantly higher in Q4 as we approach our full year estimated rate of approximately 27%. From a cash flow perspective we expect full year core management operating cash flow excluding certain items of more than $7 billion. We will continue to drive cash flow through an even more efficient working capital management and continued tight controls over capital spending. And for the full year 2013 we expect to see continued improvement in our key working capital metrics and to manage net capital spending to approximately $3 billion which is well within our long term target of less than or equal to 5% of net revenue.","As a result we will continue to return strong cash flow to our shareholders. In total we expect to return approximately $6.4 billion to shareholders in 2013, $3.4 billion in dividends and 3 billion in share repurchases. Net our outlook for 2013 is unchanged from our last call and it's consistent with our long term targets for net revenue, operating profit and core constant currency EPS. We expect to drive improved full year margins and net ROIC and disciplined capital allocation coupled with returning cash to our shareholders remained a top priority for the company. With that operator we will take the first question.","","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","(Operator Instructions). Our first question is coming from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","","Bryan Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So question about America\u2019s beverages you know if you look at the profitability in the quarter the margins held up you know pretty consistent with last year even despite the volume declines and understanding that there is some price that help that, could you talk a little bit more about the nature of the productivity that\u2019s flowing through, try to get a sense for how much productivity is actually helping most margins and maybe connected to that the types of initiatives you\u2019re taking and how that might change the structure of that business as we all begin thinking about you know whether you refranchise or do something structurally different with the business going forward, just trying to understand I guess what types of changes you\u2019re actually making to that business today that might be different than what we would have known before you put it together?","","Indra Nooyi","Okay. Bryan I\u2019m going to answer the second part of the question and then Hugh is going to answer the first part of the question. So you know when we talked to you about structural options way back in February of 2012 we said we would look at range of structural options, JVs, collaborations, any sort of structural separation we look at every option and at the end of the day we will do something that makes sense for PepsiCo for the beverage business globally and for North American beverage business. So we want to approach this in a very sensible way because buying, spinning, buying, spinning is lot of sustainable way to run any business especially one that has terrific possibility and generates extraordinary U.S. cash flow and more importantly houses some of our most important global beverage brands. So we are approaching this in a very, very sensible way and we are looking at every structural option possible that will allow us to manage the global beverage business in a sensible way, not jeopardized PepsiCo overall by any sort of loss of the U.S. cash flow and in a way that\u2019s long-term shareholder value creating. So we are looking at fundamental operational improvements in the North American beverage business also.","And our strategy has been very simple focus on innovation, focus on R&D investments to create disruptive innovation so that we can get incrementally and think about how to price very, very sensibly in a segment that\u2019s going through a lot of volatility. It\u2019s still a very big market, very profitable, very important to retailers, but in 2012 second half and 2013, it did go through a slowdown and was very important that we don\u2019t start competing strictly on price. This category has been competing on price for years. And last couple of years, we have been trying our best to become a lot more disciplined and inch the pricing up and play a very, very disciplined game and that\u2019s really what we have been doing. So with that here, let me turn it to Hugh to talk about the mix between pricing and productivity and everything else in between.","","Hugh Johnston","Yes, sure, happy to do that, Indra. Good morning, Bryan. If you look at the margin performance, you really do have to look at it from three perspectives. First is from kind of net pricing in the marketplace and from that perspective, as we look at a category that doesn\u2019t have a lot of growth in it, we do believe the right and responsible way to manage this category is for us to be very consistent in taking that price. We have been consistently articulate about that over the couple of years. And I think if you look back at our performance, we have consistently led the industry in ensuring that we do take that net price and we have taken in an appropriate and responsible way. So that\u2019s driver number one.","Driver number two is net revenue management. We have gotten more sophisticated on that over the course of the last couple of years. I think that\u2019s been a product of the reintroduction of the bottling businesses back into PepsiCo. And I would look at it from two perspectives. One is package management, where the array of packages that we have and the opportunity to extract incremental margin from those packages has actually increased substantially compared to where we were three or four years ago, where we were much more heavily focused on just 2-liters and 12-packs. And then second from a channel management perspective, I think we have gotten much more granular using technology and much more specific in the way that we price cross channels in a manner that allows us to also drive margin.","The third area as you mentioned is productivity. There is little question that the productivity has ramped up in the business and I\u2019d explain it this way if you think about the way that we historically looked at productivity, it was a very manufacturing centric point of view in terms of consistent year-over-year productivity and then episodically there would be productivity coming out of G&A, primarily through restructurings. Obviously, we haven\u2019t stopped doing any of that, but I think what we have added to it are a couple of components. Number one, value engineering, we have gotten much more sophisticated in terms of our use of materials. And as a result of that, we have really doubled the impact of value engineering, which is essentially two things. Number one, using less of a commodity or number two substituting commodities to enable us to get better productivity out of the prettier [ph] goods that we get. So our value engineering capability has stepped up substantially. Number two is the distribution system. I think typically in the past we hadn\u2019t gotten a lot of productivity out of the distribution system. We have clearly gotten a lot sharper on that both from the standpoint of labor management and in addition to that using technology in the warehouse. That\u2019s enables us to lower cost across that. And then the last piece of course is tight G&A cost controls and it\u2019s something that as PepsiCo we are quite good at. So if you put all of those pieces together, that\u2019s really what\u2019s driving the solid margin improvement in the phase of what are obviously a not growing category right now.","","Indra Nooyi","And Bryan, I\u2019d just add one last thing for you to keep in mind. As we said in the script, the North American beverage business is big. It\u2019s an $85 billion category. The velocity of this business is somewhere between 40 and 80 turns a year. So it is the retailer who generates an enormous amount of cash, because they pay us net 30. It\u2019s a huge traffic driver. So it\u2019s a very important category. It\u2019s very profitable across the industry to margins range from low to mid-teens. So it\u2019s a very profitable business. It generates a ton of U.S. cash. And in today\u2019s volatile global environment, we are in the North American beverage business, which actually is a pretty damn good business today in terms of generating U.S. cash and profitability. So I would frame that with that context.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Faucher with JPMorgan.","","John Faucher - JPMorgan","You highlighted the $30 million of I believe it's $30 million of extra spending in Q3 related to the gain, can you give us a little bit more of an indication in terms of where those investments are going, you know are you still planning on spending the full gain back as we look into the fourth quarter and you know what\u2019s the time frame in terms of seeing pay back on that incremental spending kind of given the investments you\u2019re making? Thanks.","","Hugh Johnston","Yeah I\u2019m happy to handle that, John I really the money is being spent in two areas, number one is where we see a good ROI we\u2019re spending on incremental advertising and marketing, you\u2019re going to see that more in the AMEA region then you will anywhere else so some of it clearly plays back into the developed markets as well. The secondary where we have chosen to make investments is in the growth markets and it's largely going to be in opportunities to expand distribution, leveraging cooler, leveraging racks again to enable us to further accelerate our growth and to create further advantage in those markets which obviously still have lots of growth potential left in them. Regarding your question about doing tend to fully spend back the gain the answer is absolutely yes. We intend to fully spend back again. So the investments are really going fundamentally to what we believe are the volume and growth and ultimately shareholder value creating drivers for the business. We think they are good investments for shareholders for the long run and we feel quite comfortable in making them and assuring that we\u2019re going to get a good return on them. In terms of timing typically those types of investments have about a 1 to 2 year payback.","","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ali Dibadj with Bernstein.","","Ali Dibadj - Bernstein","I did want to focus a little bit more on PB so just mid-single digits decline okay you can there are a lot of reasons for that potential one can argue but the non-carb area declining low single digits to, I\u2019m trying to figure out that is really your internal plan giving some of the industry dynamics you\u2019ve described as substitution into non-carbs. And in particular where there any bright spots in non-carbs given the portfolio that you\u2019ve and last part if you step back can you say okay look going forward sounds like pricing aggressiveness is behind us competitively on the safety front what should we think about both the non-carb and the CSD business growing going forward for you?","","Hugh Johnston","Regarding non-carbs I actually think they were quite a number of bright spots, we have seen year-to-date the Gatorade business continued to perform very well. It's been gaining share, we certainly feel good about where Gatorade is and even more importantly feel good about the fact that we have repositioned the business very strongly for within consumers\u2019 minds in terms of the brand being really the sports nutrition brand so that\u2019s number one. Number two the ready to drink tea business is certainly doing quite well in particular Lipton Pure Leaf, the innovation that we have had there both in terms of the smaller and the larger packages is performing extremely well and that business is now back on track in terms of market share.","The chilled juice business as well both in terms of Tropicana as well as the innovation that we\u2019ve with Tropicana Farmstand and Trop50 all continued to perform well. Now you\u2019re right as you look at the aggregate non-carb number the volume as we mentioned was a low single digit decline, the real challenge therefore is in the packaged water business, we look at that business as something that is scale enabler but we also look at it as a business where we\u2019re not willing to invest to lose money in order to just hold volume. We just don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good use of shareholders of money we don\u2019t think it creates value overtime, we\u2019re obviously going to be in the space with our distribution system, we will continue to sell packaged water but it's not a priority for us from an investment perspective. So as you see the balance of the market at various times choose to invest in bottled water often times to change volume and to chase share you\u2019re going to see our numbers swing in overall non-carbs because the water category is so big. What it will do though is significantly impact our profitability. So I think we certainly feel good about non-carbs from that perspective. On the CSD front I think the biggest thing that we feel very good about right now is Mountain Dew. The Mountain Dew franchise is performing terrifically well in the United States. We feel good about the base Dew business, the Diet Dew business has been performing extremely well. And I think one of the things we are most heartened by is Mountain Dew really travels well to international markets, whether you look at India, whether you look at China, the Dew franchise is clearly a global franchise and we feel terrific about that.","Regarding your question on what the future of CSD growth is, very hard to estimate, obviously, we have taken a perspective that by virtue of investing in R&D around package and around products specifically sweetener, we think that will benefit the category. The important thing I think from our perspective is we have got an LRB portfolio that works really well. We think we have an advantage set of brands. So regardless of where the overall LRB market goes, we do feel like we will be competitively well positioned by virtue of the portfolio that we built over the course of 10 or so years.","","Indra Nooyi","But there is no question that there has been an industry dynamic which has seen a shift away from CSDs to non-carbs and we have talked about that many times. It\u2019s now at 50:50 or 60:40 the other way and it could potentially settle at that number.","","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.","","Dara Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley","Good morning.","","Indra Nooyi","Good morning Dara.","","Dara Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley","So looking at the U.S. beverage business, how concerned are you about the volume pressures specifically on the diet CSD side of the business with the health and wellness concerns and what are the strategies to combat those issues going forward? You sounded optimistic that innovation could help earlier this year, but we haven\u2019t heard much since. So I just want to get an update on the innovation side. And then on the pricing side, appreciating the focus on disciplined pricing, but you did see a mid-single-digit volume decline on the CSD side in North America in the quarter. So do you think that pricing balance has gotten out of whack at all versus competitors might you need to make some adjustments going forward? And also can you give us an update on promotional levels in the industry post the Labor Day discounting and if you are seeing any improvement?","","Indra Nooyi","Let me speak to the first part of the question Dara. Couple of years ago, we started to see the decline in full sugar CSDs, no question about that, especially in colas, we started to see the decline in full sugar colas and diets were holding up. Recently especially in the last, I would say, six months to nine months, there has been an accelerated decline in diet drinks as people say they don\u2019t even want artificial sweeteners, they want more natural sweeteners, they don\u2019t mind some calories, but they want natural sweeteners, they want to go back to sugar in some cases. So we are seeing a fundamental shift in consumer habits and behaviors. We anticipated some of these the diet slowdown has been a little more rapid than we expected. The good news is that our overall portfolio as Hugh mentioned is very balanced. And our diet \u2013 I am sorry our Dew consumer likes regular Dew, likes Diet Dew, likes Kickstart. So our Dew consumer is very different than the consumer for colas and consumer for lemon lime. We are staying on the path of innovating along natural sweeteners and thinking about flavoring agents to make sugar taste more sugary and so that\u2019s all we are focused on. We talked about our products coming to market in 2014. That\u2019s really the track we are on and we are not talking about it now, because we haven\u2019t yet got a launch date. Once we have a launch date, you will hear a lot more about it. And our goal is to bring to the market a product that tastes great. We don\u2019t want to rush a product to the market and then have to wonder why we launched something that wasn\u2019t that great tasting. So that\u2019s our focus.","Regarding pricing and let me add to that I have mentioned this I think at one of the conferences maybe Barclays or something or Bernstein, the category has been declining about 3% a year, CSD category, especially in the last couple of years. And it\u2019s important that in the next two to three years, we come up with significant disruptive innovation if you want to hold people in the CSD category and that\u2019s what we are focused on. The best news of course is that our portfolio is so diverse not just within beverages, but also between beverages, snacks and good-for-you products that we feel incredibly well insulated against any sort of headwinds in this category.","Let me now turn to pricing. Dara, I\u2019ll tell you we have \u2013 the industry not just PepsiCo, the industry has seen years and years of ridiculous pricing where for the last 10th of a share you know there would be a pricing war which has impacted the whole category and this has been on for almost a decade and that is not the right way to create shareholder value in this category. It cannot be that one company has you know almost 8 or 9 years of problems because of you know destructive pricing habits and then they take a big reset and then they start coming up and then the other company has to take a reset this kind of back and forth (inaudible) does not work in shareholder value creating mixture [ph]. So what we\u2019re trying to do is to say given the category dynamics we have to behave in a value creating way in this category and that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing. We\u2019re going to keep doing that and hope that at some point in the overall category there is sensible behavior and all of us are focused on sustainable long term shareholder value creation that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to focus on.","","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Caroline Levy with CLSA.","","Caroline Levy \u2013 CLSA","Couple of questions, internationally I was just wondering if you could talk to us introduce us a little bit to the new head of international after your sad loss, and tell us about how the moves have been. I believe that he came out of India and you know just to give us some confidence in that important market that you know your team is strong and I know that [indiscernible] also came out of Russia so your two big important markets have probably new leadership and then just secondly in your U.S. CSD business, do you think the innovation you\u2019re working on is such that it could actually stops declines or do you think it just sort of slows declines is this something you think will come with some premium pricing, will it be truly differentiated, is really the question.","","Indra Nooyi","So let me start with our Head of AMEA it's not international it's just Head of Asia, Middle-East, Africa. You know Saad was an amazing leader and we truly miss him but as you know the strength of PepsiCo is that we have very good succession plans, literally every position in the company. Sanjeev Chadha has been in PepsiCo forever almost 20 years if I recall and started his career in PepsiCo India then went on to Asia-Pacific was a Commercial Director there. From there he came to our Middle-East business and was running the Middle-East business. So essentially he has run every aspect of Asia, Middle-East, Africa, knows the region very well and is a great successor to Saad and so feel very good about Sanjeev\u2019s appointment into the Head of the Asia, Middle-East, Africa. He knows snacks, he knows beverages, he knows franchise, he knows company owned operations because he has done both in India in ASPAC and the Middle-East which is a big franchise market for beverages as well as company owned operations in Jordan and Egypt and we have a big company owned snacks business. So Sanjeev is a very seasoned executive, has done turnarounds, has done big growth, so I think as all of you get introduced to him we will certainly bring him around. I think he is going to be very pleased how well the succession has worked. He knows everybody in the region, the bottlers, the employees, they all know him too and so I don\u2019t think there is going to be any issue in the AMEA region. Quite a seamless transition. In terms of Europe, Zein was the Sector Head for Europe. The good news is Russia we have a phenomenal talent base of Russian managers, you know Silviu Popovich who came to us from Wimm-Bill-Dann, [indiscernible] who came to us from bottling business who was with PepsiCo before all of these are terrific leaders running our Russian business and they in turn report to Ramon Laguarta who has been in PepsiCo for decades and Ramon is running the developing markets in Europe he has got all of Russia, the FSUs, all the way to Turkey doing very well and replacing Zein in Europe is Enderson Guimaraes who came to us out of Electrolux, again an executive who ran a big piece of Electrolux comes to us with a very different perspective and has managed businesses with enormous volatility as you know hard goods, the white goods rather go through bigger volatility and economic downturn than any of our staples businesses.","So Enderson is a seasoned executive in that dimension and is adding a lot to our overall management team and don\u2019t forget Zein hasn\u2019t gone anywhere. He is right here down the corridor, so he is always there looking at all of these businesses. The good news is that we have a great team in PepsiCo and we take a lot of pain to make sure our succession planning is done well."," ","Turning to CSD innovation, especially in North America, because that\u2019s really what we are talking about. In most of the international markets, especially in Asia, there is still lots of room for growth. Will our innovations stop the decline? That\u2019s anybody\u2019s guess Caroline, I think in today\u2019s world we have to keep betting on innovation both for creating breakthrough products and also innovation to reduce costs through creative ingredients. And I think in today\u2019s world, overall volatility in consumer shopping habits and the way they are spending the money, retail dynamics, etcetera, etcetera, the best insulation is to have a diversified portfolio, relatively diverse, not too diverse, but relatively diverse have a great brand portfolio that covers all eating and drinking occasions and not be overly dependent on a category like CSDs. And that\u2019s really why we feel very, very good about PepsiCo today. And as we mentioned earlier in the notes in our script, our brand portfolio is diverse, geographic portfolio is diverse, but most importantly, our product portfolio is diverse and CSDs per se in North America is not a gigantic driver of our profits. So we feel pretty good about where we stand today."," ","Operator"," ","Your next question comes from the line of Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs."," ","Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs"," ","Thanks. Good morning."," ","Indra Nooyi"," ","Judy, good morning."," ","Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs"," ","So first on the emerging markets Indra, so obviously many companies have talked about the slowdown that they are seeing in the emerging markets and you have talked about the AMEA markets a little bit, but as you think about the next 6 to 12 months some of the markets like Russia, China, Brazil, can you just give us your assessment of how you see those markets playing out and whether the differences that you are seeing in snacks versus beverages is something to really call out here?"," ","And then secondly I just wanted to clarify the comment you have made about the North American market and how you think about the structural solutions to that market. It sounded to me like on this call, given some of volatility that you are seeing in markets outside the U.S. and the increased scale that\u2019s really needed in North America with a lot of the retailers, perhaps the sense of urgency in terms of making some of the structural solutions may not be there as it was a year or so ago when you made that announcement. So I wanted to just clarify if that assessment is appropriate or we should still be thinking about sometime early next year you are coming up with a decision on that issue?"," ","Indra Nooyi"," ","Well, Judy, let me speak to the second one very quickly. As we said we will tell you in early next year what we are going to do. And we have told you all the structural solutions we are looking at. And that\u2019s what we are doing. We are looking at structural solutions, but I want to underline sensible, value creating structural solutions. So keep that in mind."," ","Let me now come to emerging markets. Emerging markets, emerging and developing markets by definition are going to be volatile. In today\u2019s world where you have got turmoil in the developed markets, I think that tends to hail on to emerging markets and that creates more sort of variance around the mean if you want to call it that. Very quick walkthrough, I think because we are on the staples business, the swings in our business are probably going to be less than swings you might see in hard goods or, white goods or durables. The thing to be very, very careful about, if you just focus on market share, especially against local competitors, B brands in those markets and start doing crazy things with pricing, what you lose, exacerbate the volatility into your business."," ","So again what we have told, so I have told all of the sector heads is to make sure that you manage share across the narrow corridor. Don\u2019t try to chase pricing down with B brands, local brands, don\u2019t try to hit the pricing so much just to drive volume, because in these volatile times, buying volume is like renting volume. So we have been directing our people to manage the business sensibly, balanced volume, pricing, revenue, profitability and build frequency and penetration deliberately and carefully. Do not rent volume, build it carefully, build the brand equity, build the consumption occasion very, very carefully and that\u2019s what we have told everybody to do. Is there volatility? Yes. But I think for companies like PepsiCo, given our broad geographic and product portfolio and brand portfolio that company becomes a natural hedge against all of these variabilities. So again we feel pretty good.","","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of Amit Sharma with BMO Capital Markets.","","Amit Sharma - BMO Capital Markets","I just wanted to focus on Frito-Lay I mean the business is positioned to post the strongest volume growth that you have seen in at least the last five years and you have talked about some of the innovation coming through. Can you provide us a little bit more color of sustainability of the current volume trend and what should we expect in the next 6 to 12 months?","","Indra Nooyi","You know Frito-Lay North America is a terrific franchise. The business is well run and I think the incredible way that our snacks business and beverage business works together to really bring solutions to customers is what makes that business so successful. And the virtuous circle of driving top line growth, focusing on productivity, taking the benefit from that investing some back into the company to keep the virtuous circle going, putting the rest to the bottom line is what has kept Frito-Lay business going.","What Frito-Lay has been known for is every 3 or 5 years looking at breakthrough productivity to drive another 3 to 5 years of profit growth. And that thinking continues at Frito-Lay. But Amit I tell you, the most important thing is we have segmented the Frito-Lay business in a very interesting way, where we look more at demand spaces rather than just cohorts or day-parts. And looking at demand spaces now, we can see how we can expand the Frito-Lay eating occasions.","So, as you look at the overall macro-snack environment, we know how to push salty snacks into taking away cookie occasions, cracker occasions, chocolate occasions by looking at various demand spaces and looking to see what consumers consume for each of those demand spaces. So we look at macro-snacks as our feeding ground. Salty snacks is just a sub-segment of that. And as long as there is lot of space with all macro-snacks and we have a very strong distribution and great innovation capabilities, we feel good about the fact that we can go after some of those occasions and that's the growth story of Frito-Lay.","Thank you all for your questions and in closing our performance to-date in 2013 is a good indicator of how a well-constructed and developed portfolio coupled with disciplined execution and reinvestment can drive high quality top and bottom line results on a sustainable long term basis and this is the purpose of PepsiCo. I thank you for your time this morning and for the confidence you have placed in us with your investment. Have a great day.","","Operator","This concludes today's conference call.

Today's call is being recorded and will be archived at www.pepsico.com.","It is now my pleasure to introduce Mr. Jamie Caulfield, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Caulfield, you may begin.","Jamie Caulfield - Senior Vice President Investor Relations","Thank you, operator. With me today are Indra Nooyi, PepsiCo's Chairman and CEO, and Hugh Johnston, PepsiCo's CFO. We'll lead off today's call with a review of our first quarter 2016 performance and full year outlook, and then we'll move on to Q&A. We've kept comments brief this morning and intend to conclude the call by 8:45.","Before we begin, please take note of our cautionary statement. This conference call includes forward-looking statements including statements regarding 2016 guidance based on currently available information. Forward-looking statements inherently involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those predicted in such forward-looking statements. Statements made on this conference call should be considered together with cautionary statements and other information contained in today's earnings release and in our most recent periodic reports filed with the SEC.","Unless otherwise indicated, all references to EPS and operating profit growth are on a core constant-currency basis. All references to free cash flow exclude certain items. In addition, references to organic revenue results in this call exclude the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, structural changes and foreign exchange translation.","To find disclosures and reconciliations of non-GAAP measures that we use when discussing PepsiCo's financial results, you should refer to the glossary and other attachments to this morning's earnings release and to the Investors section of PepsiCo's website under the Events and Presentations tab.","As we discuss today's results keep in mind that our first quarter comprises the 12 weeks ended March 19, our North American operations and it is a short quarter for international businesses, reflecting the two months of January and February for most of our operations outside of North America.","Also, please take note that we've reclassified certain functional support costs from SG&A to cost of sales, prior period amounts have also been reclassified and the details are footnoted on Pages A1 of the Q1 earnings release. These changes do not impact PepsiCo's overall revenue, operating profit, net income or earnings per share.","Now it's my pleasure to introduce Indra Nooyi.","Indra K. Nooyi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Jamie.","I'm pleased to report that 2016 is off to a good start with very strong operating results in the first quarter. Global Snacks organic volume increased by 1.5%; and Global Beverage organic volume increased 3%, the highest rate of quarterly beverage volume growth in three years.","We delivered 3.5% organic revenue growth, led by high-single digit growth in Latin America and AMENA and 4% growth at Frito-Lay North America. Our five largest segments, Frito-Lay North America, North American Beverages, Latin America, ESSA and AMENA, each had both positive organic volume growth and positive net pricing.","Core gross margins expanded by 130 basis points and core operating margins expanded by 165 basis points, driven by the positive net pricing and continued execution of our productivity agenda, including the implementation of our Smart Spending program. Core constant currency operating profit grew 12% and core constant currency EPS grew 11%.","It is noteworthy that we delivered these results in a volatile and uncertain macroeconomic environment. Most of the developed world outside the United States is grappling with slow growth. GDP growth in developing and emerging markets is also challenged with many D&E markets experiencing significant political unrest and high unemployment.","Key energy-producing countries are dealing with significant budgetary gaps; and high levels of local inflation in many of these markets are eroding disposable income and dampening consumer spending. It's a difficult environment indeed. Despite these macro challenges, we performed well. Our developing and emerging markets businesses grew organic revenue 7%, with double-digit growth in China, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Turkey.","In the developed markets, we grew organic revenue by 2%, led by performance in the United States where we grew revenue 2.5%. In fact, in the first quarter, PepsiCo was once again the largest contributor to food and beverage retail growth in the United States, accounting for more growth than the next 17 largest manufacturers combined.","We've performed well because our approach to operating in this environment is and has been to execute well against what we can control and to retool our business models and operating system to cope with what we believe could be sustained volatility and uncertainty; and this is really what we're doing.","First, we've accelerated our innovation agenda, utilizing our proprietary Demand spaces framework. This has led to our new products being more incremental and has contributed significantly to our overall organic revenue growth. We've increased the efficiency and effectiveness of new product launches by leveraging our global scale. We're more quickly and effectively lifting and adapting successful product launches from one market to another, driving more rapid expansion of our largest brands, as well as our future billion-dollar brands.","For example, in the first quarter outside of North America, Lipton Ready to Drink tea grew 10%, Mountain Dew grew volume 9%, Gatorade grew 9%, Naked Juice grew 60%, Sunbites grew 42% and Cheetos grew 9%. We've continued to generate strong net price realization even in a sluggish consumer environment through enhanced revenue management capabilities and data analytics.","We've introduced new price pack combinations tailored to much more targeted shopper and consumer occasions. For example, in North America over the past five years, we've shifted approximately 6% of our carbonated soft drink volume mix from traditional two-liter and 12-ounce multi-pack packages to higher margin, more profitable single-serve and alternative multi-serve packages. These efforts have been driving higher net price realization for us and our retail partners.","We've also been future-proofing our product portfolio, reshaping it to capitalize on consumers' increasing interest in health and wellness. Just to give you an idea, we track two sets of numbers. First, what we view as everyday nutrition, which includes products that provide positive nutrients, like grains, fruit and vegetables, and protein, plus those products that are naturally nutritious, like water and unsweetened tea. Now these products account for almost 25% of our portfolio by revenue.","Second, what we view as guilt-free products, these include the everyday nutrition products plus diet beverages and other beverages that are below 70 calories per 12 ounces, and snacks with low levels of sodium and saturated fat. Guilt-free products account for approximately 45% of our portfolio by revenue. The growth of our everyday nutrition products, which accounts for a quarter of our global net revenue, is outpacing the growth of the balance of the portfolio. And we've had a significant amount of activity underway to transform our portfolio.","Just to give you a few examples, we've broadened our beverage portfolio to lessen our reliance on colas, and today we have the leading non-carbonated beverage portfolio in the United States. In fact, globally, just 12% of our revenues come from trademark Pepsi and less than 25% comes from carbonated soft drinks on a global basis.","We've invested in R&D to create advantaged sweetener solutions and lower-calorie products, and we're aggressively moving our portfolio to package and product combinations with fewer calories. Mountain Dew Kickstart, with just 40 calories per eight ounces, is a great example of our execution in this area. Now in its third year, Kickstart generated more than $300 million in estimated retail sales in 2015 and posted 34% volume growth in the first quarter of 2016.","We've also been shifting more of our beverage A&M to lower-calorie products in order to accelerate growth in strategically advantaged subcategories. And we are increasing the nutritional profile of our snacks and foods through the introduction of products like: Smartfood Delight, which grew volume over 75% in the first quarter; reduced fat Doritos, the top-selling Frito-Lay snack brand in schools, which grew volume 30% in the first quarter; and gluten-free Quaker Oats, just to name a few. Net-net, we feel pretty good about our portfolio transformation efforts.","Next, we are building and investing in new capabilities to win in high-growth channels. To capitalize on increased out-of-home food and beverage consumption, we have consolidated our food service resources into one team, enabling us to creatively leverage the breadth of our product portfolio with our customers and consumers.","In the United States, foodservice now represents approximately 14% of our total revenue, and the first quarter outpaced the growth of the balance of other channels combined.","This year, we will be increasing the out-of-home availability of our everyday nutrition products, both snacks and beverages, through the targeted placement of approximately 20,000 Hello Goodness vending machines across North America.","Our advertising and marketing has also become more impactful. First, we have stepped up our level of investment from 5.2% of sales in 2011 to 6.3% of sales in 2015. In the first quarter of 2016, our A&M expense increased by a further 65 basis points as a percentage of sales versus the prior-year quarter. At the same time, we've increased the effectiveness of our A&M investment by shifting more dollars into consumer-facing working A&M and by more effectively integrating social and digital media in our marketing campaigns.","We've also accelerated our productivity programs, contributing to consistent core margin expansion and providing investment funding for growth initiatives. Since 2012, we have generated $1 billion of annual productivity savings, and we are on pace to do so again this year.","In addition, we have fully implemented our zero-based Smart Spending program across the enterprise. We're already seeing significant expense reductions in the areas targeted. And our organization is fully mobilized to identify opportunities to drive even greater levels of productivity.","And then we have stepped up our market-based execution by working in creative new ways with our retail partners, like: unique joint execution of sports and entertainment properties; development of new and innovative merchandising and fountain equipment; execution of coordinated consumer promotions; and leveraging the combined power of the PepsiCo product portfolio.","For example, with 7-Eleven, Doritos and Super Bowl all turning 50 this year, in the first quarter we teamed up to offer consumers NFL experiences and prizes, including a trip to Super Bowl 50. When consumers purchase a golden combo of any size Doritos, Pepsi, Slurpee or grill item, they could scan their 7-Eleven app to receive a code to unlock prices from teamupforgold.com.","And at Albertsons, we executed a joint promotion across PepsiCo's entire product portfolio in the All for Super Bowl sweepstake. It was a massive blitz of in-store displays in secular advertising and online promotions. When consumers purchase two or more participating products in one transaction, they qualify to enter to win $50,000; one of 50 NFLShop.com gift cards every week during the promotion period.","These examples are by no means exception to the rule. They're just a couple of demonstrations of how we're working creatively and collaboratively to deliver value to the consumer and be an indispensable growth partner for our retailers.","The actions we've taken and the investments we've made to strengthen our capabilities, our innovation, revenue management, portfolio transformation, customer service initiatives in particular, is what helped us deliver impressive operating results in the first quarter. We continue to achieve healthy net revenue realization and new products continue to be an important contributor to our sales growth.","Next, in the context of an interesting macro backdrop, we feel good about the state of our business and we're off to a good start in 2016. We believe we have the right plans in place. We have great people. We're executing well, we're investing in capabilities that will propel our future growth. We will continue to leverage our considerable advantages, our scale, geographic presence, product portfolio and Power of One synergies to succeed in this environment. And we're well-positioned to achieve our 2016 financial targets.","Many of our investors have commented me that they value PepsiCo because of our sustained reliable performance. As the stewards of this remarkable 50 plus year-old enterprise, we're managing and investing in the business to extend the duration of performance while achieving returns above our cost of capital; and we're committed to ensuring that our best years are ahead of us.","With that, let me turn the call over to Hugh Johnston. Hugh?","Hugh F. Johnston - Vice Chairman, Chief Financial Officer & EVP","Thank you, Indra, and good morning everyone. As Indra mentioned, we're pleased with the financial results for the first quarter; and having a good start to the year with one quarter behind us gives us added confidence in achieving the financial targets we shared with you in February.","And so, as you saw in this morning's release, we reaffirm those targets. Specifically, we expect approximately 4% organic revenue growth, excluding the impact of the 53rd week. And we expect 8% core constant currency EPS growth, excluding the impact of deconsolidating our Venezuela operations; and 6% when including the Venezuela impact.","Notwithstanding our strong Q1 results, the macro outlook remains highly volatile and uncertain; and for this reason, we are maintaining a cautious stance on the external factors that influence our business. So balancing a positive view of our execution against a more negative view of the macros, we arrive at the conclusion to keep our revenue and earnings guidance unchanged.","We expect foreign exchange translation to negatively impact both revenue and EPS by approximately 4 percentage points, which is also unchanged from the full-year estimate we provided to you last quarter. As a reminder, we base our foreign exchange translation forecast on consensus rates. I know a number of you use spot rates, which currently leads you to a less significant impact. Clearly, as the year progresses, this gap will resolve itself, but we're holding to our outlook at a negative impact of 4% for the year for both revenue and EPS. As a result, we continue to expect 2016 core EPS of $4.66.","Our outlooks on the other metrics we provide remain unchanged and are set out in this morning's release. For the analysts on the call, as you update your models, I'd ask that you consider the following factors. We have a more difficult core constant currency operating profit growth comparisons in the upcoming quarters at both Frito-Lay North America and North America Beverages. We anticipate a slower rate of gross margin expansion versus Q1 as we expect raw material inflation, which includes the impact of transaction related foreign exchange for the balance of the year compared to modest deflation in Q1.","We will continue to invest in our business to drive sustainable long-term growth, including a planned increase in advertising and marketing expense as a percentage of sales for the full year. While we expect lower corporate expenses for the full year, primarily driven by lower pension cost, there will be quarterly volatility in this line item due to timing; and you should not expect to see the rate of decline that we had in Q1 for the full year.","The reinvestment of the 53rd week benefit will occur over the balance of the year. And, finally, we will be lapping Venezuela earnings of approximately $0.03 per share in Q2 and $0.06 per share in Q3. Taken together, we expect balance of year EPS growth to be disproportionately weighted toward the fourth quarter.","With that, operator we'll take the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley.","Indra K. Nooyi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Dara.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi, good morning. So obviously a tough macro environment, as you mentioned, Indra, and org sales in the quarter were slightly below your full-year guidance. So I was just hoping for an update on your level of visibility you can hit 4% organic sales growth for the year, particularly as pricing moderates internationally with less FX pressure and you lap over some of the pricing changes in potato chips and A-beverages theoretically moderates a bit.","And then also, if you could, just comment specifically on the North American carbonated soft drink pricing environment, the 1% NAB result is below what we saw last year. So has anything changed from a competitive standpoint? Thanks.","Indra K. Nooyi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. In terms of visibility for balance of the year, again, Dara, we can talk about what we control. Our innovation pipeline is looking good. Remember, the first quarter is not really the season for international, because it's only two months; and so we're really entering the season now. And based on the innovation pipeline, based on the execution capability of our businesses, and knowing what we've sold into customers around the world both on retail and foodservice, at this point we feel optimistic about our revenue guidance for the year. Again, this is based on everything that we can control and based on our assessment of the tough macroeconomic environment as we see it today. So I'd say, as the year progresses, we'll know more, but we feel reasonably optimistic about our 4% earnings guidance for the year.","Hugh F. Johnston - Vice Chairman, Chief Financial Officer & EVP","Revenue.","Indra K. Nooyi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Revenue \u2013 sorry, revenue. Pardon me. Let me now turn to North American pricing. Again, when we look at 1% pricing here, it's really rounded down. It was closer to 1.5%. And again, we're just now entering the season. So based on what we've seen in the marketplace, we actually see quite a lot of discipline in pricing. And our hope is that given the dynamics of the CSD category in particular that there will be continued discipline based mostly on revenue management and careful mix management. And that's what really what we're focused on. And our goal is to make sure that we don't do anything crazy on pricing, because pricing actions don't really drive volume growth. So we're just making sure that we focus on mix management and revenue management to keep getting the positive price utilization going through the year.","Hugh F. Johnston - Vice Chairman, Chief Financial Officer & EVP","Dara, to be also specific on CSD pricing, IRI showed 2.5% CSD pricing for the quarter. LRB was about 1.8%, which is consistent with what we've been seeing. So I think we continue to view the pricing environment as quite rational.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Faucher of JPMorgan.","Indra K. Nooyi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, John.","John A. Faucher - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Good morning, Indra. It was interesting. I realize that corporate expense was a little more favorable, which you mentioned in the call, but you guys \u2013 we saw a little bit less of an investment in SG&A this quarter versus what we've been seeing, let's say, over the past year and a half and really since the rebates back in 2012. So can you talk a little bit about where you think your investment levels are versus where you need to be and the balance between reinvestment and margin expansion as we look out over the next couple of years? Thanks.","Hugh F. Johnston - Vice Chairman, Chief Financial Officer & EVP","Hey, John. This is Hugh. I'm not sure exactly how you're measuring less investment in SG&A, so it's probably worth a conversation offline on that. What I can say is, number one, A&M was up 65 basis points year over year, so we continue to see a strong push into A&M. Number two, we do continue to invest in capabilities that enable globalization of best practices. And that's having a profoundly positive effect on both the innovation as well as the productivity of the company.","What I suspect you may be seeing is the impacts of Smart Spending, which is off to a very successful start as of late last year and into this year. Certain of the big buckets that we're focused on in Smart Spending, whether it be travel or facilities, are actually down by meaningful percentages. So I think what you may be seeing is the net of that reflects less margin invested in SG&A than you've perhaps seen in previous quarters. But I don't want you to think that we're not investing in the brands and we're not investing in capabilities that drive performance. We absolutely are.","Indra K. Nooyi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We're committed to increasing A&M. We're investing in R&D, investing in e-commerce, the capabilities on supply chain so that we can start thinking about the future, data analytics. We've got increased investment in every bucket right now.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane of Bank of America.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey. Good morning, everyone.","Indra K. Nooyi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, so just a question about I guess the mix in organic sales growth between volume and price\/mix, and really just in North America and more a question going forward. Right now, we're seeing more of a contribution through revenue management I guess of price\/mix, and you've supported that with product, with advertising. Just how sustainable do you think that is going forward over the next couple years? And I guess my question is just at some point will we need to begin to see maybe more volume growth in order to sustain that kind of organic sales growth, or are we comfortable that we can continue to have mix be a big component of the organic growth? Thanks.","Indra K. Nooyi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Brian, I don't think there's a clear answer to that because it's like an accordion, we go back and forth. A couple of years you get volume growth and then a couple of years you get more revenue growth because you have more opportunity to do mix management. When we premiumize the portfolio, for example, we get more revenue than we do volume because you get very good price realization on premium products. And right now with the launch of lots of premium beverages and launch of premium products coming out of Frito-Lay, we're getting good price realization on that score.","And clearly when you do revenue management, even shifting to smaller packages, mini-cans, you don't get much volume lift but you get revenue lift. And I think as I look into the future, I think you're going to see some volume growth. You're going to see effective mix management, both from a revenue management perspective and the product portfolio itself, giving us robust revenue growth. A couple of years from now let's come back and revisit it, but right now that's the strategy going forward. And then we are very judicious in where we add capacity to make sure that we look at the realities of the volume growth in the marketplace.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Will Marshall of Barclays.","William Marshall - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Good morning, thank you very much.","Indra K. Nooyi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Will.","William Marshall - Barclays Capital, Inc.","I was just curious. You alluded to the tough macro backdrop on a couple of occasions here. Two markets in particular that jump out, Brazil and Russia, and you've got fairly sizable businesses in both of those markets. I was just curious if you could give us a sense of what you're seeing on the ground, and how your business has been operating maybe compared to the broader challenges that we've seen from a macro perspective. Thank you.","Indra K. Nooyi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Brazil is a tough, tough, tough market. It's fundamentally a good market. The population \u2013 the demographics are pretty good. And when the country performs well, things are good. But recently in the last I'd say 12 to 18 months, there have been a lot of self-induced problems in Brazil. And then the slowdown in China clearly has had an impact on Brazil because Brazil was the commodities supplier to the robust growth in China. And so it's going to take some time for Brazil to get through its issues, its own political problems, and then of course, the global commodity price slump right now. So we are cautious in our approach to Brazil, focused more on value products. And where we can get some premium pricing in, we try to get it in. But Brazil has been \u2013 I'd say globally, Brazil is one of the toughest economic situations today.","In the case of Russia, our core business is doing quite well because it's one of those markets where we have a spectacular portfolio, very balanced between all day parts, between good-for-you products, fun-for-you, better-for-you. It's a wonderful balance of products we have in Russia. And the Russian consumer is a good consumer, and we have a scaled business covering all of Russia.","I think two issues are impacting Russia. One is the ruble and where it stands because when you have dollar-denominated costs coming into Russia, clearly it squeezes the middle of the P&L. and you can't price enough to cover all of it because the Russian consumer, which brings me to the second point, Russian consumer wages are not going up as much as the cost of living bucket suggests it should go up. So there's a bit of a squeeze going on.","But all things considered, our team in Russia is mostly Russian, doing a very, very good job navigating through these issues in Russia. And I must say, but for these global macro conditions, especially the strength of the dollar squeezing the cost structure, we have a good business in Russia; and the team is doing a good job running it right now.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Caroline Levy of CLSA.","Indra K. Nooyi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Caroline.","Caroline S. Levy - CLSA Americas LLC","Good morning, Indra and Hugh. A question on the charge you took in China. If you could, just elaborate what's going on with Tingyi-Asahi Beverages and what you think for the outlook. So what drove the charge? What's the environment like in China, and what do you think the outlook is for your business there?","Indra K. Nooyi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So let me start off by saying, Caroline, that Tingyi is still the leader in the beverage market in China; still has the most phenomenal infrastructure; widely covers China with all manufacturing technologies, cold fill, hot fill, aseptic, water lines, you name it. They are an amazing scale player and they remain a valuable partner to PepsiCo. I think Tingyi has been impacted by a couple or three issues. They're a public company. You've seen all their disclosures and announcements. I'm not going to share with you anything that you don't know.","But basically the slowdown in the Chinese market for beverages overall driven by the macros; and some of the operational issues that Tingyi has had to cope with because of the changes they were making to make their system more efficient has taken a short-term hit in performance. And I think the read-through has been that we too took a bit of a marginal hit in beverages in our performance as we've talked about openly in our earnings calls.","But having said that, within China we have a very good business in foods and nutrition and our beverage business sequentially is beginning to do better. So we remain cautiously optimistic. As far as our partnership with Tingyi is concerned, look, our ownership was based on a price that we recorded when we first did the transaction. Since that time the overall Chinese market has come down a lot.","And secondly because of Tingyi's own performance, their stock has come down quite a bit. And so we felt it was prudent to mark down the value of our investments. Having said that, we remain very committed to the Tingyi partnership. And once they get through their issues, which they have to get through, we can help them, but they're a public company, we'll be back to a partnership that continues to sing.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Schmitz of Deutsche Bank.","Indra K. Nooyi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Bill.","William G. Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning. Is it safe to assume that the pricing in emerging markets is going to lap in the back half of the year? And just curious for you and the industry kind of what happens when those laps take place? And then maybe if you could just sort of disaggregate the mix benefit versus the price benefit?","Hugh F. Johnston - Vice Chairman, Chief Financial Officer & EVP","Bill, this is Hugh. I think it's safe to assume that we'll continue to get good solid pricing in those markets. I understand what you're pointing out is as dollar-based commodities become less inflationary in local terms, will we continue to get the same level of commodity-driven pricing. It remains to be seen. Part of our pricing is obviously driven by commodities, part of it is driven by what else is happening in the local economy. To the degree that pricing is less, I do expect that we'll see some volume bounce back. Because in those markets when you have emerging consumers that are entering the categories, obviously as we take less price we tend to increase adoption more rapidly.","So I think we probably will see a bit more volume and a bit less price in developing and emerging markets in the back half of the year, but that remains to be seen. The outlook, as we've talked about earlier, is not just overly positive; it's also quite uncertain.","Regarding mix versus rate, I assume that's a North America beverage question because that's a tough one to answer globally. About two-thirds of the pricing benefit that we saw in the first quarter was rate, and about a third was mix. So we continue to see good balance. In fact, if anything, we've probably got a little bit more rate than we have been getting in the previous quarters.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.","Indra K. Nooyi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Judy.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. Good morning. So I guess on margin, if I look at the Q1 performance and then the outlook for the balance of the year, it seems like Q1 certainly benefited from very strong margin performance and then maybe the balance of the year you're really looking for very little margin expansion. So, Hugh, I know you went through some of the drivers, but if you could elaborate a little bit more just in terms of the Q1 bead. And particularly I think Frito had very strong margins and then how sort of that phasing works out for the balance of the year?","Hugh F. Johnston - Vice Chairman, Chief Financial Officer & EVP","Judy, happy to try to add a bit more on that. As I mentioned during the prepared remarks portion of the script, commodities were a little bit deflationary in Q1 because of the overlaps, particularly overlaps around the energy prices. Commodities will turn to a bit inflationary in the balance of the year. So obviously that's a drag on margins.","Number two, there were certainly some timing of expenses, particularly as it related to corporate expenses as I've mentioned. That gave us a big tailwind. Corporate expenses overall will be down in 2016, but they won't be down at the same rate that you saw in Q1. So for the balance of the year, it will spread itself out a bit more evenly. The net of all of that is I would expect less margin improvement in Q2 and Q3; and then you'll see stronger margin improvement again in Q4.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Powers of UBS.","Indra K. Nooyi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Steve.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Good morning, thanks. I guess two, if I could. Hugh, you mentioned the worsening macro assumptions in your outlook versus a few months ago. Could you just talk maybe about where those incremental concerns are most focused? And then, Indra, picking up on your comments on new product innovations, could you update us on how much of your revenue is driven by new product innovation and whether that differs materially across divisions? And I guess also if there's a measure you look at to assess the longevity of new product contributions; in other words, differentiating between sort of short-term flavor extensions and more lasting successes like Kickstart has come to represent. Thanks.","Indra K. Nooyi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Go ahead, Hugh.","Hugh F. Johnston - Vice Chairman, Chief Financial Officer & EVP","So I think the two places where we're probably incrementally less optimistic, number one is South America, not Mexico. Mexico, I think, we're quite positive on, but the balance of South America obviously is a challenge. And then number two is Eastern Europe. Eastern Europe is obviously continuing to be challenged from a GDP perspective and that flows through to disposable income and therefore to consumer spending on our products. The balance I think were probably roughly in line with where we've been.","Indra K. Nooyi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And in terms of new products, Steve, typically what we look for is 9% of our revenue growth to come from new products and innovation. That's really what we targeted for ourselves this year, and we're running close to that number. Again, one quarter in innovation for the year does not make. So what I'm going to give you is what we expect the year to come in at. And last year, we came very close to that 9% number. And typically, what we look for within that is a 75% line extensions, what we call, refresh innovation, because news drives growth in this category. And then 25% we'd like it to be reframe and breakthrough, which is new platforms or substantially new packaging that can take the business to a whole new level. And again, across the world this number varies, but roughly speaking that's what we shoot for.","And the thing to be careful was about Kickstart was a new platform, but after a couple of years it becomes part of the base of the company, and then we have to rely on flavor extensions to continue to drive it. And so something that's reframe or breakthrough the first year after a couple or three years starts to go back into the base and starts getting counted in refresh. So really how we count innovation is really stuff that's been launched and is in the market for at least two years. And we look at the performance of that business on a rolling basis. So right now we're running at about 9%; and it's 75:25 refresh versus reframe and breakthrough.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ali Dibadj of Bernstein.","Indra K. Nooyi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Ali.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hey, guys, so three quick things, if I may. One is, if you could, just tell us about the impact of the deconsolidation of Venezuela on your organic top line growth and maybe even on your margins, if any. So as you're pulling it out, what was the impact on the organics?","Two is, if you could, give us some more \u2013 particularly for investors who remain concerned about price irrationality coming back in the U.S. Clearly it's just a little bit of Nielsen data, one quarter of what you said rounded down. But can you give us more to those investors about why you think you need to continue being price rational in the North American market? I field those questions all day, so I'd love to hear from you.","And then third is just Tingyi as a jumping off point. If you can, characterize the problems there that you described earlier. How much of it was macro stock market broad issues versus the PepsiCo-Tingyi partnership, that 3P, third-party type partnership, and if that means anything differently in the way you guys view the way you want to distribute on a global basis with third parties. And I think specifically, for example, about Brazil beverages woes historically and ABI-SAB obviously coming together, but just broadly as well. Thank you for those.","Indra K. Nooyi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hugh, do you want to talk about the impact on Venezuela or Venezuela?","Hugh F. Johnston - Vice Chairman, Chief Financial Officer & EVP","I'm happy to. Ali, revenue on Venezuela was a point, not meaningful on margins.","Indra K. Nooyi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Let me talk about pricing. Ali, I can only talk about what we're going to do. Our belief is that it's very important that you really execute price rationally in the market because when you drop the price too much, it doesn't drive that much consumption growth, volume growth. I think we're at a point in the market in many of our categories where you can grow the business through premiumization, real innovation. But just playing a price game does not drive volume growth and it actually destroys value. So that's our strategy and that's the playbook that we're going to execute.","Let me turn to Tingyi. I think I gave you a pretty complete answer when Caroline asked the question, but let me just add to it. You've seen the Tingyi results, you've heard their call, you've heard all of the news that comes out of Tingyi, so I'm not going to talk about a public company that announces its results on its own. I'll just tell you that from my perspective or our perspective, clearly macroeconomics has played a role. I think Tingyi itself is trying to retool itself to become more efficient. And whenever you're going to do a transformation or retooling, there is going to be disruption in the business.","And finally, the PepsiCo-Tingyi partnership started off very well and I think it will come right back to where it was intended to be. The transition where we consolidate distribution systems, where we sort our products between PepsiCo-oriented distribution system or premium products oriented distribution system versus a value-oriented product distribution system, that transition is taking a little bit longer and it's a little bit more painful. I wish it could happen faster, but that's the reality of what we're living with because the slowdown in the macros has not helped either. So from a Tingyi perspective, as I said, we remain optimistic, and we just need to power through this and provide the help in terms of capabilities and knowledge transfer to them so they can get through the difficult period.","And I don't think Tingyi is indicative of any problems on a global basis. I'll tell you something. We have hundreds of partners globally in the beverage business. At any point, some percentage of those bottlers go through issues. That's the same for any company in this beverage business. And the strength of the franchise company is how do you help that bottling entity recover from its issues given that we operate COBOs [Company Operated Beverage Operations] and we have a reservoir of capabilities. That's really what we're doing it, taking people from our established COBOs, sending them into these bottler businesses to help them improve their performance. So I don't see any major red flags here, Ali.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Ottenstein of Evercore ISI.","Indra K. Nooyi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Robert.","Robert E. Ottenstein - Evercore ISI","Hey, thank you. Thank you very much. Good morning. A couple of questions. You noted in most of the segments that you're starting to face now some operating cost inflation. Is that primarily wage inflation? Can you give us any more details on that please?","Hugh F. Johnston - Vice Chairman, Chief Financial Officer & EVP","The biggest factor in that is wage inflation. Recall, when we've talked about in the past, we have about $28 billion in operating expense. Roughly half of that is labor; and outside the U.S. labor is obviously inflationary, it's just based on local inflation rates.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Grundy of Jefferies.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","Good morning.","Indra K. Nooyi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","A question for Hugh on North American profitability and margins there in your line of sight for improvement. So this is kind of a broader question for you, but I was hoping you could kind of briefly touch on what's the margin ambition in Frito? Can that be a 35% operating margin business over time? Quaker would seem like there's a significant opportunity there now without the Muller JV weighing on it. Can that return to a 30% operating margin business? And that would seem like that could happen over a much quicker period of time without that weighing it down. And then if you could briefly touch on NAB as well, which is a bit more difficult given the vertical integration there with bottler ownership. So any commentary there? I'm sorry that's a bit broad-based, but would be helpful. Thank you.","Hugh F. Johnston - Vice Chairman, Chief Financial Officer & EVP","I'm happy to do that. As you all know, we don't give division-specific margin guidance. It just gets into a level of granularity and detail that's probably more confusing than helpful. That said, I would broadly say all of our North American businesses have the potential to continue to see improved margins. How are they going to do that? Number one, it will be through our broad-based supply chain productivity programs. We continue to take cost out. Particularly moving from the plant to the store, we're getting more and more efficient at operating that distribution network.","Number two, Smart Spending continues to present an opportunity to enhance margins; and again that occurs across all of our businesses. And number three, as Indra pointed out earlier, we continue to see a lot of opportunities to premiumize our products. With those premium products come good price points. And once the products are in the marketplace and the A&M has normalized on those new products, you can expect to see those earn premium margins over time.","So, again, I don't want to get into specific division level margin guidance, but I do believe that all of our North American businesses will continue to see margin improvement over time.","Indra K. Nooyi - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So with that, thank you all for your questions. And in closing, let me just say we're off to a good start. We're confident that we have the right plans in place and we will continue to execute to the best of our abilities. We look forward to updating you on our progress as the year advances.

Your lines have been placed on listen-only until the question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded and will be archived at www.PepsiCo.com.","It is now my pleasure to introduce Mr. Jamie Caulfield, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Caulfield, you may begin.","Jamie Caulfield - PepsiCo, Inc.","Thank you, Operator. With me today are Indra Nooyi, PepsiCo's Chairman and CEO; and Hugh Johnston, PepsiCo's CFO. We'll lead off today's call with a review of our first quarter performance and full-year 2018 outlook and then we'll move on to Q&A.","Before we begin, please take note of our cautionary statement. This conference call includes forward-looking statements, including statements regarding 2018 guidance based on currently available information. Forward-looking statements inherently involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those predicted.

You should refer to the Glossary and other attachments to this morning's earnings release and to the Investors section of PepsiCo's website under the Events and Presentations tab to find full explanations and reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures.","And now, it's my pleasure to introduce Indra Nooyi.","Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.","Thank you, Jamie, and good morning, everyone. Thank you all for joining us this morning. We will start off with an overview of the first quarter and a discussion of each of the operating sectors performance in a little more detail. And then Hugh will cover the full year outlook.","For the quarter, we delivered $12.6 billion of net revenue and core earnings of $0.96 per share. Within the P&L, gross margin was impacted by input cost inflation. Operating margin was further impacted by the front-line bonus we announced earlier this year. Foreign exchange translation had a positive impact of approximately 2 percentage points to both net revenue and reported EPS. And below the operating profit line, we benefited from a lower core effective tax rate.","The majority of our businesses performed very well in the quarter, excluding our North American Beverage division. In fact, excluding NAB, the company generated 4.6% organic revenue growth and 7% core operating profit growth, when excluding the one-time front-line bonus. However, our North American Beverages sector continues to work through some challenges.","So let's start with a discussion of NAB, separating long-term strategy from short-term executional issues. As you know, we've been transforming the business over many years, to build a product portfolio that meets consumers' desires through a repertoire of great-tasting beverages, especially beverages with fewer or zero calories, and in an assortment of packages that satisfies a broad range of occasions, from immediate personal refreshment, to family meal accompaniment, to social gatherings.","And our focused and sustained transformation initiatives at NAB have been very successful on multiple dimensions. We have shifted our product mix to faster-growing subcategories and provided more lower and zero sugar options, including recent innovations under the Mountain Dew, Gatorade, Propel, Lipton Tea House and Starbucks trademarks. Since 2010, we have increased our volume mix of non-carbonated beverages by 7 percentage points.","We have established and maintained strong leadership positions in many of the most attractive non-carbonated beverage categories, including ready-to-drink tea, ready-to-drink coffee and sports hydration and in the most recent quarter, grew value share in a number of the fastest growing categories, including tea, enhanced water and sparkling water.","We have increased our CSD package variety, so that our mix of non-traditional packages, that is, everything other than 2-liter and 20-ounce PET and 12-ounce cans, has increased from 14% in 2011 to 21% today.","We have reconfigured our supply chain to handle increased complexity and greater product assortment. For example, we have substantially increased flexible can line capacity. We expanded our co-pack (5:01) network to give us greater packaging flexibility in an asset-light model. And we're approaching having 60% of our route network converted to delivery via our GeoBox trailers, (5:11) and we have equipped many of our trucks with chillers to expand our chilled DSD network.","We have brought equipment innovation to market, providing product customization and convenience with our Spire fountain device and made nutritious options more broadly available with our Hello Goodness vending machines. And we have ramped up our R&D and innovation efforts to launch products that are on-trend with consumers.","For example, this February, we introduced bubly, a new flavored sparkling water with no artificial flavors, sweeteners or calories, and a brand and packaging that convey a playful and upbeat sense of humor.","And we recently launched Drinkfinity, now available online in the United States. This unique beverage system addresses growing consumer demand for customizable nutritious beverages in the most sustainable packaging.","We believe our strategy is sound and is positioning us well for the future; however, we are focused on the past three quarters, where our financial results have not lived up to our expectations for the North American Beverage business. So what is the issue? Simply put, while most parts of the business are performing well, recent losses in cola market share in North America have led to subpar top-line and bottom-line performance over the past three quarters. We have studied in detail the causes for the share loss across every dimension.","The overwhelming driver is that, despite moderately increasing our media on trademark Pepsi over the past three years, our share of voice has fallen dramatically relative to our key competitor, who has substantially stepped up their media spending on colas over the past two years.","To address this, we have allocated increased media to trademark Pepsi. And we have tightened and elevated our brand communication, beginning with the launch of our new Pepsi Generations campaign.","The campaign supports all the brands under the trademark Pepsi umbrella, and this will enable us to more effectively leverage the media investment across our full Pepsi portfolio.","Importantly, we plan to substantially and sustainably support the campaign throughout the year, while remaining disciplined on pricing. We are already seeing positive results from the campaign, with research telling us that the campaign is driving higher advertising recall, higher brand recall and higher brand regard with consumers. And our share performance has also begun to improve. These are important first steps. As we sustain the campaign, we anticipate it will translate to further improving sales and market share results.","Encouragingly, beyond trademark Pepsi, North America Beverages is performing reasonably well in the context of a highly competitive environment. Our tea portfolio under Lipton and Pure Leaf has over the past 17 quarters grown retail sales in the range of mid-single digits to as high as 21%.","Our enhanced water portfolio is performing well, with our premium LIFEWTR continuing to grow nicely as it enters the second year since its initial launch. And bubly's early results following its 2018 launch are exceeding our expectations. KeVita, our line of premium organic live probiotic beverages, grew retail sales 50% in Q1, following 66% growth for the full year 2017. And Starbucks ready-to-drink coffee grew retail sales 3% in the first quarter, following 4% growth in 2017, despite a number of new competitive entrants in the category.","Furthermore, we are pleased with both the improved trajectories and the outlook for both Mountain Dew and Gatorade. Both brands posted improved retail sales performance in the quarter versus the second half of last year. And our positive outlook for these trademarks are underpinned by robust 2018 innovation.","In January, we launched MTN DEW ICE, a clear lemon-lime flavored DEW made with a splash of real juice with just 100 calories per 12-ounce serving, and it is off to a strong start. Additionally, we expect our Summer 2018 limited-time offering of MTN DEW BAJA BLAST to perform well, especially relative to our DEW Summer 2017 LTO, which fell short of our expectations.","Also, this summer, we will launch Gatorade Zero. Gatorade Zero will address the large and growing demand by athletes for additional hydration options. We are introducing a Gatorade that provides all the hydration and electrolyte solutions of base Gatorade without the carbohydrates. Gatorade Zero will give our athletes more flexibility in combining hydration with other fuel sources to meet their overall sports hydration and nutritional needs. Taken together, we believe our plans will drive continued improved performance in the business.","Finally, beyond the strategic and execution actions I just mentioned, we continue to consider all available options to drive greater shareholder value from NAB.","Now moving on to Frito-Lay North America. We had solid performance, with balanced volume growth and net price utilization and continued strong market share results, driven by great marketplace execution, innovation and creative brand marketing. For example, building on the success of our 2017 launch of Lay's Poppables, an entirely new growth platform for Frito, we extended the Poppables product line-up with the introduction of new Lay's Poppables Honey Barbecue and a new 12-count multipack of Poppables Sea Salt.","We continue to drive net revenue growth through increased trial and household penetration, which, when combined with increased purchase frequency from the expanded product line-up and year long media support, should continue to scale up this promising new brand extension.","We have also extended success of our Simply sub-line by introducing new package varieties with the Simply variety pack and a three-flavor lineup of single-serve packages for Simply Lay's, Cheetos and Doritos offerings. The expanded package variety is enabling us to more fully capitalize on consumers' growing desire for organic non-GMO snacks with no artificial ingredients.","Demonstrating our focus on lifting and shifting successful ideas around the globe, we recently introduced Red Rock Deli to select markets in the U.S. Red Rock Deli has been a breakout success in Australia that addresses millennials' desire for high-quality food offerings, with credentials like Non-GMO Project Certification and no artificial flavors or colors.","Another example of lift and shift is our launch of the innovative Lay's Smile campaign, a concept that has its roots in a similar campaign we initially ran in China. This year, we are harnessing the power of sharing a smile and having a positive impact along the way.","With Lay's Smiles, we put more than 40 unique smiles on Lay's bags. And with each purchase of a Lay's Smile bag, donated a portion to Operation Smile. The photogenic and humorous elements of the campaign, combined with a compelling purpose-driven element, have driven terrific exposure for the brand through social media.","At Quaker Foods North America, our portfolio of Quaker branded products had mid-single-digit retail sales growth, boosted by the continued success of overnight oats and supported by a new ad campaign highlighting the functional benefits of oatmeal.","Let me now turn to our sectors outside of North America. We are pleased with the 8% organic revenue growth we saw in our developing and emerging markets as a group, which is an acceleration from the 6.5% growth we had in the fourth quarter of 2017. Stable to improving macro conditions, combined with strong market execution, have led to very strong growth across many of our key international markets. Within Latin America, organic revenue grew 10% in Mexico, high teens in Brazil and 20% in Argentina.","In AMENA, we had strong double-digit organic revenue growth in China, India, Egypt and Pakistan. The growth in the sector continues to be diluted somewhat by beverage tax-related declines in Saudi Arabia.","In our Europe Sub-Saharan Africa sector, Turkey and Poland organic revenue grew high teens, while Russia and South Africa grew mid-single digits. Even within the developed markets of Europe, we saw solid low single-digit growth in the UK and Spain, mid-single-digit growth in France and high single-digit growth in Germany.","Importantly, the strong top-line performance translated to impressive bottom-line results, with core constant currency operating profit up 9% in ESSA, 10% in AMENA and 17% in Latin America. The strong international results are, in part, a reflection of our initiatives to leverage our scale by increasingly coordinating commercial activities across markets and sectors. Example, with the increased global focus on zero-calorie beverages, we have continued to strengthen and scale our distinctive Pepsi Black under the MAX or Zero Sugar brands, depending on the market, which drove double-digit organic volume growth globally and the United States in 2017.","We have almost tripled our global footprint from 28 markets at the beginning of 2015 to 77 markets this year. We are leveraging our Pepsi Generations campaign internationally, airing our This is the Pepsi ad across 55 markets and the soccer-themed copy under the Generations campaign across more than 60 markets. And we have expanded Lay's Oven Baked to 14 markets, with plans to nearly triple that number in the next two years. And the Lay's Smiles campaign mentioned earlier has now been launched across markets in each of our sectors and grew retail sales mid-teens in the first quarter.","Net-net, we're encouraged by the momentum we're seeing across many of our key international markets and solid financial performance by Frito-Lay North America. And although North American Beverages is in the process of a turnaround, we have plans in place that we expect will lead to improving performance.","With that, let me turn it over to Hugh.","Hugh F. Johnston - PepsiCo, Inc.","Thank you, Indra, and good morning, everyone. I'll just provide a quick update on the outlook, and then we'll move to your questions. From a macro perspective, we remain pretty positive. We see continued broad-based GDP growth, with developed markets stable and developing and emerging markets accelerating. And in most of our key markets, including the U.S., the picture is relatively positive, with strong employment, consumer spending and consumer sentiment data.","However, within this broadly positive picture, there remains a risk of geopolitical volatility in certain markets. From an industry standpoint, we continue to see pretty challenging conditions, including: dynamic retail and consumer landscapes; a very competitive environment; some currency volatility, most recently, in the Mexican peso, Russian ruble, Turkish lira and Brazilian real, and commodity inflation.","As Indra mentioned, within our businesses, the majority of our divisions are performing well, and we expect NAB's results to improve as the year progresses. So putting this all together, our guidance for 2018 remains unchanged. Specifically, we expect organic revenue growth at least in line with our 2017 growth rate, or 2.3%.","As we move through the year, our expectation is that we will continue to see some level of gross margin compression from inflationary input costs. Normally, you would see the gross margin contraction offset with SG&A productivity. But, as we shared with you in February, with the benefit of a lower effective tax rate in 2018, we are making investments to fortify the business, as well as fund the front-line bonus. And these investments will largely offset the productivity-driven margin improvement.","We expect our core effective tax rate to be in the low 20s. And we expect core earnings per share of $5.70 or a 9% increase compared to 2017 core earnings per share of $5.23.","We continue to expect and we continue to generate strong cash flow and to exercise disciplined capital allocation, with prudent reinvestment in the business. For 2018, we continue to expect free cash flow of approximately $6 billion, which includes approximately $9 billion in cash flow from operations, including a $1.4 billion discretionary pension contribution made in the first quarter, and net capital spending of approximately $3.6 billion.","We continue to expect to return approximately $7 billion to shareholders in 2018, with cash dividends of approximately $5 billion, reflecting a 15% increase in the annualized dividend per share starting with the June payment, and share repurchases of approximately $2 billion. And, as we mentioned on the last conference call, we still see the prospect for even higher cash returns as we begin to fully realize the benefits of greater global cash mobility beyond 2018.","Finally, as you update your models, I'd like to highlight the following. We continue to expect our core constant currency EPS growth to be higher in the second half than in the first half, as we will lap NAB's softer performance and natural disaster-related business disruptions in the second half. And we expect variability in the timing of productivity savings, investments, which includes the accrual of the front-line bonus, and net commodity inflation, to contribute to relatively better performance in the second half of 2018.","With that, we're ready to take the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Your first question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley.","Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.","Morning, Dara.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey. Good morning. So, Indra, on the Beverage business, obviously a disappointing few quarters, I'd also argue if you go back longer-term, you could argue it's somewhat disappointing a performance, even including the solid results from back in 2015, 2016. And we continue to see this wide dichotomy between the snacks business performance and Beverages. You articulated that with the corporate ex Beverage numbers earlier.","So with all that as context, you mentioned all available options on the call earlier. And, as you think about that, is that more a sort of options and structure maybe that we've seen in the past, perhaps tweaked a bit for today's environment or is that seriously considering more radical changes? And I'm trying to get a sense for the level of sort of discontent within the organization around these Beverage results.","Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.","So, Dara, that's a good question. So let me start off by saying, we are talking just about North American Beverages. As I look around the world, given some of the actions in many countries on beverage categories, selected beverage categories, we have actually performed quite well internationally in beverages, not just as PepsiCo, but the PepsiCo system, because our bottlers have their own beverage businesses, too. So if you look at the total, the beverage system of PepsiCo has actually performed extremely competitively.","The issue is in North America, and the issue is really the last three quarters. We look at the performance of the business constantly. If I look at it post the reinvestment we made in 2012, the business has actually performed quite well, very competitive, but performed quite well. And 2014 coming into 2015, 2016 and even the first half of 2017 was good. The last three quarters have been worrisome for us.","And let me talk a little bit about this, and I am reflecting back in the last 15 years of looking at North American Beverages, in particular. Whenever we have a competitive situation where somebody is going through a financial transaction with beverages, clearly, that creates room for reinvestment, which starts to perturb the competitive balance. And that's what we are seeing in the last three quarters, because of stepped up investment resulting from business model changes. The question is should we allow this to pass or should we step up and invest along with our competitor and that's a big question we asked ourself.","For three quarters, we said let it pass, because all of these have a timeframe. And once that temporary investment phase is over, the business comes back to a competitive equilibrium. But we don't want to be a net share donor, especially in CSDs, especially in colas. And so we'll go toe-to-toe and increase our spending in colas, in particular, but we're going to remain very responsible on pricing.","The key thing is this is a business that's highly competitive in North America. There's no question about it. It's a big business. It's a profitable business. Is it the same profile as salty snacks? No, but it generates a lot of U.S. cash, in the mid-teens profitability. I think that's a very, very attractive business in the staples space. And it gives you enormous clout with retailers because the velocity on this categories are phenomenal.","And I will tell you one thing. Anybody who is in the beverage business always wants to be in the salty snack business. And anybody who's in the salty snack business always wishes they had a beverage partner because you can't have a salty snack without a beverage.","So we have the combination together. We just have to keep making sure that our portfolio works. And that's what we are doing. We like (24:19) the fact that we have to go through these short-term issues with performance, but believe me, our team is maniacally focused on getting this business back to track in the second half of this year. And we will, sequentially improving every quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman of Barclays.","Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.","Morning, Lauren.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to talk a little bit about productivity. The profitability outside the U.S. really accelerated, and productivity was highlighted kind of ranked first in the description of each businesses in the release. So could you talk a little bit about the balance of kind of productivity savings outside the U.S. versus within the U.S.? And as we go forward, should we expect more savings to come out of international and perhaps to start to see some margin build or are you still more prioritizing reinvesting, maybe pricing a bit below the rate of inflation to continue consolidating market share internationally? Thanks.","Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.","You know, our goal is not to price below inflation. That's not our goal. What we're trying to do is build frequency and penetration. That's all we focus on in every market. And market-by-market is a function of what the nature of the competition is. Because in many of these markets, we have local competitors, too, and we have to think about our pricing architecture versus local competition.","So at every point in time, Lauren, we are looking across geographies to really figure out how best to grow the businesses. Is it frequency, is it penetration? Do we want to actually create a price umbrella for other local competitors to come in or do we want to remain with a price premium that's reasonable and allows us to build a business?","So while doing this, sometimes, we let productivity flow through. Other times, we reinvest it back in the business. So it's, again, literally a case-by-case basis. The net-net result of all of this is, as a company, overall, we are focused on productivity like you won't believe it.","We think all the digital technologies that are coming, all the new ways we can work to improve agility, improve flexibility, de-layer the company, there's so much we are looking at, is actually going to increase the productivity of our company. It's just that we have to make sure we have enough beta tests done with all the new technologies in the company, that when we roll it out across the company, they actually yield results, as opposed to flopping.","So we're in the process of doing all the beta tests now to make sure that they actually yield the kind of results that we're looking for. Rest assured, you might see short-term international productivity, but overall, we're looking at global productivity initiatives. Hugh, did you want to add anything?","Hugh F. Johnston - PepsiCo, Inc.","No. I was just going to comment on that as well. The productivity balance won't change. It will be consistent across the globe.","Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.","Yeah.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane of Bank of America.","Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.","Morning, Bryan.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, good morning, everyone. So I guess I want to follow-up on Dara's question, just about NAB. And I guess as you think about all the available options to drive greater shareholder value, would that actually include separating or selling NAB? Is the international business still important to have the scale benefits and you'd keep one and not the other or is that really not kind of what you're implying when you talk about all available options?","Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.","That's not what we are talking about when we talk about all available options. The beverage business is still a global business. It's very linked, the North America business to the international business. And it's very linked to our snacks business. It provides very important scale in many important international markets and provides us a seat at the table with customers here in the U. S. So I think the beverage business is very important.","The real question we are asking ourselves is how best do we handle the operating aspects of bottling? We've gone back and forth between a separate company, part of PepsiCo. Is it best as a stand-alone public entity or is it best in the hands of multiple franchisees? The evidence is not clear. And we want to make sure we just don't engage in financial transactions for the sake of financial transactions, but whatever we do is really setting the company on a sustainable path.","So we're looking at what models exist out there. We're looking at what we did in the past. And we are trying to see how best to operate this very attractive, but very competitive beverage business that creates shareholder value and also does not detract from the overall performance of the rest of PepsiCo.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer of Cowen.","Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.","Good morning, Vivien.","Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC","So, Indra, I was hoping we could touch on Frito-Lay, please. Another solid print from the top line, but I was hoping you could touch on price realization. You did cycle quite a tough compare. But it does also look like in the scanner data, that there might be a slight softening in pricing, driven by competitive promotional activity. So if you just offer any color on that, that would be helpful. Thank you.","Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.","So Hugh?","Hugh F. Johnston - PepsiCo, Inc.","Yeah, I'm happy to answer that. Good morning, Vivien. No, I would take the pricing as more temporary in nature. I think when we get to the end of 2018, you're going to see Frito-Lay pricing that's very much in line with what you've seen in the past. I wouldn't expect any dramatic dislocation in that regard. Quarter-to-quarter, price can wiggle a bit, but by the end of the year, you're going to see the same consistent Frito, both from a pricing perspective, as well as from a profit perspective, that you've seen in the past.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Caroline Levy of Macquarie.","Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.","Morning, Caroline.","Caroline Levy - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Good morning. Thanks very much. Good morning, Indra. I'm wondering if I got this right, but it looks like your spending on A&M was down in the first quarter North American Beverages. If I did get that right, can you just help us, regardless, understand sort of the pacing of the spend behind this business? And which brands in particular, is it really very cola-focused? Are you going to be spending heavily on all your brands? And what the strategy is, just a little more to get us some confidence in a back half recovery.","Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.","Hugh, why don't you take it and then I'll follow up.","Hugh F. Johnston - PepsiCo, Inc.","Yeah, happy to. Hey, Caroline. A couple things on that, number one, we kind of have to separate the accounting from the actual spending in the marketplace. From an accounting perspective, as, of course you know, A&M gets spread out on a curve. As the volume was a little bit softer in the first quarter relative to our expectations for the year, less of the spend would have been booked in the first quarter. And so you're seeing a timing difference in what appears in the books.","In terms of media spend in the marketplace, we were actually up strong double digits and strong double digits across the big brands. So I wouldn't over-focus on what the A&M showed up in the financial books. That's a product of GAAP convention. In terms of actual advertising in the marketplace behind the big brands, it was up significantly.","Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.","And in terms of going forward, Caroline, which is the second part of your question, in most of the brands that we have, we're spending at very competitive levels, and they're all yielding the right results. The only place where we're outspent in the marketplace is in colas. And we were surprised by the extent to which media spending was taken up in colas by competition.","So we're going to step up our advertising behind trademark Pepsi, with a little bit of a focus on Zero Sugar and Diet Pepsi. And at the end of the day, we don't want to be a share donor. We want to be responsible in pricing. We want to be responsible in portfolio management, to go where the consumer is going. At the same time, being a share donor is not our cup of tea.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ali Dibadj of Bernstein.","Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.","Morning, Ali.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hey, guys. So I wanted to go back to pricing in North America Beverages for a moment. You may remember, we were quite vocal in pushing that price rationality is the best for shareholders in CSDs, at least. And, look, to your credit, you were early adopters of the sustainable price\/mix that we've been seeing in CSDs in North America. But actually, now there's a little bit more controversy about it. I think I'd argued it's the biggest investment controversy we are hearing right now, certainly since Coca-Cola reported a couple days ago. And the controversy is whether price\/mix will become more competitive or not.","Now to be clear, you reported pricing up in NAB. DPS reported pricing up in NAB, or their equivalent. KO had pricing down. I don't know if you listened to the call or not, but they excused it away with Easter compares and freight cost, oddly, and (33:26) price, et cetera. But investors are trying to figure out that controversy in particular. What will price\/mix look like in North America Beverages for you, for your competitors, in the context of KO's, hopefully, confusion in terms of their pricing and your talk of reinvestment? I get that you're being clear in terms of being responsible on pricing; want to get a better sense of what that is, and how we should think about price\/mix in North America Beverages going forward.","Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.","Again, mix is very important, because based on the mix, you'll see what the price realization is going to be. But, Ali, I'll tell you something. We've said this for several years now, and I'll repeat it. The message that all our NAB chaps (34:14) have is make sure that we never return to what happened in 2011, 2012 when there were $5 cubes. That's not going to happen. We want to make sure that, especially with inflation creeping into the business, we price to cover inflation. I think it's very important with the category growth of about 2%, that we play this market in a very responsible way, so that we don't further depress the category.","Now, here's a challenge. Single-serve clearly has better price realization. And as the mix of single-serve versus groceries shifts, clearly, you'll see some pricing perturbation. But from our perspective, we are watching grocery pricing very, very carefully. And we want to make sure we don't destroy the pricing architecture across the industry. And that's really the game we are playing. But we're not going to lose the game because of media spending, because at the end of the day, pricing discipline is one thing. But if it's a question of media spending to make sure that the consumer understands that Pepsi is still a strong, vibrant brand, we're going to spend on media.","And we are maniacally focused on making sure we use every opportunity with mini cans, with other packaging formats, to cover inflation to the extent we can, although that's difficult, but inch the pricing up. That's what we're focused on right now.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Amit Sharma of BMO Capital Markets.","Amit Sharma - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hi. Good morning, everyone.","Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.","Morning.","Amit Sharma - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Indra, just a clarification for you and one for Hugh. When you talk about increasing spending on the colas in North America, are we talking about taking spending from other segments and putting it behind colas or are you thinking about just raising the overall bucket? And then for Hugh, Hugh, you talked about maybe potentially bringing more cash back. And when you talk about returning it to shareholders, are you thinking more of buyback or raising dividend maybe higher as well? Thanks.","Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.","To your question, the first part, I mean, it's a little bit of both. Some of it will be reallocation, but some of it will be additional spending we'll put in. We are working through the details now, but the fact of the matter is, we are going to increase spending behind colas. Hugh, on the increased cash?","Hugh F. Johnston - PepsiCo, Inc.","Yeah. So, Amit, we're still working through plans to bring cash back to the U.S. No change in 2018 guidance, either from a dividend or share repurchase perspective and as regards 2019, obviously, it's too early to talk about that. We'll talk about specifics of that as we get closer to next year.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mark Swartzberg of Stifel.","Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.","Morning, Mark.","Mark David Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Good morning, Indra. Hi, Hugh. Also NAB; I know we're spending a lot of time on that, but it's important. Firstly, a clarification response to your response to Bryan's question, are you also saying refranchising is not on the table when you say you're not interested in hiving off beverage? And then also, Hugh, you mentioned strong double-digit increases on the big brands. Why do you think the volume didn't respond better to those increases?","Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.","On refranchising or any other option, Mark, I didn't say no to anything. I didn't say yes to anything. All that I said was we're studying all of the options, because we have gone back and forth with the bottling business over the last decade or two.","And I don't believe just doing a financial transaction for the sake of short-term financial results is the optimal way to create shareholder value. What we are trying to see is, given the dynamics of this business going forward, given that the mix of products is likely to change, with more hot fill, more non-carbonated, more nutritious beverages coming on to the marketplace, how best do we manage the concentrate business versus the bottling business, so that we don't have to engage in a financial transaction every five or 10 years. That's what we are trying to do.","We are looking at structures that exists today to see whether they are operationally easy to execute or do they sound good in the short term, but they're very, very, complex and operationally a nightmare to operate. We're studying that. We're also looking at other structures, because I've always told you, the bottling business is a utility, low earnings growth, lots of cash. How do you operate the bottling business like a utility? What's the best structure to do that? That's what we are thinking through, stay tuned.","Hugh F. Johnston - PepsiCo, Inc.","And, Mark, as regards to the increase in media spending, certain marketing levers work very quickly, distribution and price being the chief among them. Advertising and marketing, there is a building effect over the course of several quarters. So I think you actually did see some responsiveness in Dew, and even Pepsi improved a bit, but it's going to take a few quarters for the Pepsi business to fully respond to the increased advertising in the marketplace.","Operator","Your next question comes from Andrea Teixeira of JPMorgan.","Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.","Morning, Andrea.","Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning. Could you please comment on the cadence, I guess, I want to move back to the numbers, if we can, the cadence of the impacts of the commodities and transportation, and also, obviously the employee bonus, which I understand is a one-time effect and probably behind us. So and correct me if I'm wrong. So if you can help us reconcile as we go through the year against the $1 billion productivity per year, so if you can share some of what you're tracking year-to-date against that objective? Thank you.","Hugh F. Johnston - PepsiCo, Inc.","Yeah, happy, Andrea, to talk a little bit to that, and certainly, you can follow up with Investor Relations to get into more of the details. Specific to your question, number one, the front-line bonus was entirely booked in Q1, so you see that in the numbers already. Number two, in terms of the commodity inflation, that'll be pretty consistent over the course of the year. And the productivity will equally be consistent relative to prior year over the course of the year. Of course, productivity always builds during the year, but prior year productivity also built. So that shouldn't be a dramatic difference.","Operator","Your next question comes from Robert Ottenstein of Evercore ISI.","Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.","Morning, Robert.","Robert Ottenstein - Evercore ISI","Great. Good morning. I was just wondering if you could give us a little bit of help, and sorry to go back on North American beverages. But is it really as easy as just spending more money and driving share of voice or is it quality of the share of voice? And I'm just wondering if you can just kind of give us some metrics or some evidence of the work that you've done that it's purely a question of share of voice, that you have the right message. You just need to get it out more, and that the brands are essentially healthy. It's just you're being outspent.","Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.","Robert, we look at this all the time. Clearly, the quality of voice is important. You cannot just spend with a poor message. The message that we had the last two years, I don't think resonated as much. But the new Pepsi Generations campaign is resonating exceedingly well. It's scoring very high. The recall, the regard numbers are all extremely high. And as we go through the summer, you'll see more advertising for Pepsi Zero Sugar, Diet Pepsi as new products come in. You will see a trademark campaign, augmented with some specific additional messaging on Pepsi Zero Sugar and Diet Pepsi. And believe me, we are maniacally focused on the quality of the message to see if it's resonating with the traditional users, which tend to be more the boomers, and then recruiting the new people, which is the millennials.","And we are watching all of these cohort groups to make sure that the message is getting through, that Pepsi is a refreshing drink. It's great for fun times together, and it's great with food. And the recent campaign with Aaron Judge is gaining a lot of attention. And we feel good about the messaging. But at the end of the day, having a great message, but not conveying that regularly, especially with a competitor who is on air all the time, is not the right approach. And so we are going to step up the advertising, and we will constantly look at how it's resonating with consumers. And if we have to make a little tweak here and there, we'll do it.","Operator","Your next question comes from Pablo Zuanic of SIG.","Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.","Morning, Pablo.","Pablo Zuanic - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Good morning. Hello, Indra. Look, just to follow-up on this North American Beverage commentary you've made, I mean, obviously, investment bankers listening on this call will be knocking on your door and giving you plenty of ideas and suggestions. But I want to make two questions. One, why do you really think that beverages, whether the concentrate, with or without bottling, gives you greater strength in terms of having a seat at the table? I could argue the opposite, right? That the poor performance in beverages maybe dilutes that seat when you're having discussions about Frito and all the great innovation you are putting through there. So maybe just remind us and convince us, why really having beverages, whether concentrate, with or without bottling, really helps.","And the second question, which is related to that, in the hypothetical scenario that you did not have beverages, tell us what do you think you could do better? I mean, I could argue that the relationship with Tingyi could be expanded. I could argue that you could be a lot more aggressive overseas in expanding your snacks footprint. And I could maybe argue in that you could do a lot more without beverages, but if you can comment on that. I mean, you have opened the door to these questions, of course, with the commentary that you made today. Thanks.","Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.","Pablo, first of all, the investment bankers have been knocking on our door forever. They have lots of great ideas. But at the end of the day, as I said, the ideas have got to make sense. They've got to make business sense and shareholder value sense. And we've been thinking through all of this a lot. Hugh, why don't you take the first part of the question and I'll come back and add to it?","Hugh F. Johnston - PepsiCo, Inc.","Yeah, happy to. Good morning, Pablo. I would respectfully disagree with you on the notion that not having beverages would increase our sway or our influence with retailers. The fact is we're the number one food and beverage company in North America. We're the number two food and beverage company globally. We have impulse categories and expandable consumption. And we've consistently driven growth for our retailers because of the fact that we have impulse categories and strong brands, and they've been well marketed over time. So as our retailers are looking for growth, they inevitably come first to PepsiCo because of the size of the two businesses. It's not to say either one of them isn't a terrific business alone. We just think the two of them are better together, and I have a lot of evidence to support that. So I do think that the retailers value what we bring to the table in their entirety.","Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.","Again, Hugh, adding to your comment, in North America, if you take the biggest retailers, they do top-to-top meetings and a joint business plan session, maybe with three companies. And PepsiCo is a company that is a must do a top-to-top with because we are such a big part of the store, such a big part of the growth. And most large retailers will say, if PepsiCo doesn't grow, we can't grow because it's such a big part of the high velocity categories.","So our joint business plan, top-to-top meetings, may be one of the few where the senior-most leaders of the big retailers attend these meetings. Second, I go over to Europe, and individually, our businesses may be 37th or 50th in importance to a retailer. But together, we are in the top 10, but not just in the top 10, we are the fastest growing. And very often, we end up with top-to-top meetings with European retailers, and I attend many of them. And the reason that they ask for the top-to-top is because together, we drive a lot of the sales growth of the retailer, and we are high-velocity categories and bring the traffic in. And we are very innovative across both categories.","So I think that what we are looking at right now is a short-term performance issue with North American Beverages. We know exactly what needs to get done and we are off doing it. And we have come off three, four years of terrific performance. So we've got three quarters of performance miss and we are going to fix it, period.","Operator","Your next question comes from Nik Modi of RBC Capital Markets.","Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.","Morning, Nik.","Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yeah, good morning, everyone. Hi, good morning, Indra. I guess a lot of your commentary on the Beverage business has been around just stepping up marketing. But we haven't really talked about much on execution. And I'm just wondering, because if you're in the marketplace and you look at a refranchised Coke territory versus a Pepsi territory, you can see a very stark difference in terms of pre and post a refranchising for Coke. And so I'm just wondering. How can you compete in that type of situation where you have these independent franchisees just spending a lot more of their own capital in improving execution at retail versus a company-owned bottling operation? So I just was hoping you can give me some context around that as we think about some of the options you might have in the future.","Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.","You're right, Nik. You know what? And this is just our observation, because we've studied all these in great detail. In the first couple of years of refranchising, when the parent company gives you a bit of a break, you're spending the parent company's money. After the first 18 months, it's your money that you have to spend. And right now, those independent bottlers are operating on very, very low margins. So the real challenge is going to be after the first 18 months after refranchising, are they going to be spending their own money off of lower margins already to do what they've been doing in the first 18 months post-refranchising where they got some breaks from the parent company.","I don't know. The jury is out. All that I tell you is, the evidence in a couple of cases where we've seen the first 12 months pass after refranchising, we are already seeing execution drop off significantly. Again, I'm not passing any judgment, I'm just giving you an observation. Believe me, what we are doing is studying their model in great detail. And if we believe their model makes sense, and if we believe that it's a model that can be executed without having to buy back the bottlers again in a few years down the road, the advantage is we can follow it easily. We are in studying mode at this point, along with all other options.","Operator","Your next question comes from Bonnie Herzog of Wells Fargo.","Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.","Morning, Bonnie.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you. Good morning. Hi. I have a follow-on to an earlier question on price\/mix, specifically on channel mix. Could you guys drill down a little on what you're seeing in terms of your businesses in the different channels in the quarter and then, your outlook for the rest of the year, and how that may positively or negatively impact your mix? And then, just to clarify, you do expect your price\/mix to be positive this year, correct?","Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.","Go ahead, Hugh.","Hugh F. Johnston - PepsiCo, Inc.","Yeah, good morning, Bonnie. First, we're seeing pretty consistent positive pricing across all of the channels. So nothing that you see in the IRI or Nielsen data is different than what we're seeing overall. Second, as regards the year, yeah, we absolutely expect pricing that's consistent with what we've seen in the past couple of years. The business pricing performance has been kind of in the 1% to 2% range; price\/mix, it's typically been around 2%. I think that's probably a reasonable assumption for us. Again, all subject to what happens in the marketplace, but that's, I think, what you can reasonably expect.","Operator","Your next question comes from Steve Powers of Deutsche Bank.","Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.","Morning, Steve.","Stephen Robert Powers - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good mornings, Indra. Thank you. Building further on the discussion of snacks and beverages belonging together, as you think about the path to improvement in NAB, I'm just wondering what the role, the relationship with Frito-Lay is expected to play in that improvement. Because as I listened earlier to the plans for NAB improvement, there definitely seem to be many NAB-specific initiatives underway. But in the context of a broader better together Power of One strategy, I guess I continue to be somewhat surprised there aren't more joint snacks and beverages efforts being prioritized, such that Frito's enduring strength can theoretically lift Beverages. Is that just a misconception on my part, that there aren't more or there isn't more explicit cooperation between the two businesses or is there evidence that joint beverages versus snacks execution still remains elusive? Thanks.","Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.","Oh, great question, Steve. I'd say that there's stuff that happens together behind the scenes and stuff that happens that's visible to all the consumers. For the big holidays, you do see joint promotions. The idea of Power of One is not to force joint activity, even if it doesn't (51:58) make sense, because, sometimes, just based on the marketing calendar with various retailers, Frito and Pepsi may be on deal at different times. So we have to be very, very careful that we don't force deal activity when it doesn't make sense. But Super Bowl was an example where the two came together in a significant way.","But let me speak behind the scenes. We talked about the joint business planning. We talked about technology transfer. Frito-Lay had GES. NAB had GeoBox. (52:26) They're all the same technology. So we negotiate with suppliers in one place. We have the same chassis for both Beverages and Frito-Lay. The go-to-market system shares all the best practices between the two entities.","When we think about customer management, customer databases, how you think about managing the whole customer relationship, we have Power of One customer teams. Our Walmart team is one team. And so behind the scenes, in dealing with the customers, we are one company. From a execution and a shelf perspective, we do displays and joint activity when it makes sense. Foodservice, we go together as much as possible. We do have joint programs between beverages and snacks. That gives us a much better seat at the table for many foodservice negotiations.","Then our Hello Goodness vending machine, which we're now rolling out pretty fast, that's got both beverage and snack better-for-you, good-for-you options in the machine. And that's what's allowing us to win university accounts because they love the fact that we're putting in good-for-you, better-for-you products in machines. And there's both snacks and beverages, and we take care of fulfilling it.","And so I think there's lots going on behind the scenes. Your question sounds like music to my ears because I'd like to do more and more and more. But you've got to be a little bit careful that you don't do Power of One for the sake of Power of One. You do it because it makes sense, in terms of driving sales or lowering costs.","Then talent, one thing I shouldn't forget. The great thing with NAB is, because it's so competitive, if you take a Frito-Lay person, put them in North American Beverages and send them back to Frito-Lay, they're much better executives because they now really learned what it is to be in a dogfight. And so from a talent development, we actually like NAB as a wonderful talent development area where you really earn your stripes for playing in a highly competitive sort of not just large competitors, but a whole bunch of small competitors, and how you navigate that whole minefield.","Operator","Your next question comes from Kevin Grundy of Jefferies.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","Thanks. Good morning, Indra. Good morning, Hugh.","Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.","Morning.","Hugh F. Johnston - PepsiCo, Inc.","Morning.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","Quick points of clarification and then a broader question on sports drinks, but the clarification is on NAB and the strategic considerations. So, Indra, is there a timeline here that will govern the process? In other words, will investors know next quarter, by year-end, et cetera? So if you could just build on that, I think that would be helpful for people.","The broader question I have, though, is on the Gatorade business and your view for the sports drink category. Trends have slowed there, seemingly on health and wellness concerns. Gatorade's lost some market share, despite higher levels of investment. Can you discuss, Indra, your outlook for the Gatorade business now, how that possibly may have changed over the past year or two, and your level of confidence that new product innovation can improve your trends? Thank you.","Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.","The first question \u2013 and, Hugh, I'll make some comments. If you want to add something, please do. Look, looking at the best way to operate North American Beverages is not something new. We've been talking about it for the last two years on the call. So we always look at it and say, hey, what's the best way to create value. And that's something we're maniacally focused on. And we've studied other companies' activities. We've looked at creative options on our side.","But, again, we have to make sure whatever we do does not take us back to the old system of having problems between the bottling company and the concentrate company, because this is a big, attractive category. And so there is no timeframe, Kevin. When we get to a place where we think it makes sense to do something, we'll share it with you. But at this point, we're not going to give you any date because we don't know. We haven't come up with the solutions yet. We're still studying.","In terms of Gatorade, the business is still very, very strong. This is like the ready-to-drink coffee business. When some new competitor comes in and decides to drop the pricing substantially and take some share from distribution, the leader, especially the leader like Gatorade, has to be very judicious in not trying to compete on pricing. And so what happens is, we allow some distribution build to happen. Then we watch to see what happens to velocities of that product. And right now, what we are seeing is, there is some competition in sports drinks.","But after the first distribution build, velocities are dropping off. And if some of these companies are actually preparing for sale, you do see them taking on some actions that are not sustainable in the long term. In those cases, Gatorade just has to be very responsible and very careful in its response. It's got to be surgical, and that's what we are doing. We are watching Gatorade shares like a hawk. And whenever we have a competitor that's trying to build distribution through pricing, there's a point or two that we might lose, but we always gain it back. It's still the strongest franchise in sports nutrition, bar none.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brett Cooper of Consumer Edge Research.","Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.","Morning, Brett.","Brett Cooper - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Good morning. A quick question for you, I mean, as the retail environment changes, consumer evolve, is there greater room for collaboration on distribution, both from an efficiency standpoint and potential environmental benefits? I'm thinking specifically within the U.S. or North America? Thanks.","Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.","Go ahead, Hugh.","Hugh F. Johnston - PepsiCo, Inc.","Yeah, Brett, this is Hugh. I think there is always opportunities to do that within the boundaries of competitiveness. So if nothing else, hopefully, this management team has convinced you that we're always looking for avenues for growth that provides good returns. And to the degree that those opportunities present themself or to the degree that we're able to turn over rocks and ferret them out, rest assured, we'll take advantage of them as quickly as we can.","Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.","Thank you all for your questions. And let me summarize. We are hyper-focused on improving the financial performance of North American Beverages, but in a responsible and sustainable way. We are very pleased with the very strong performance we are seeing across the balance of the business. And we are on track to deliver our full year financial targets.

Your lines have been placed on listen-only until the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Today\u2019s call is being recorded and will be archived at www.pepsico.com. It is now my pleasure to introduce Mr. Jamie Caulfield, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Caulfield, you may begin.","Jamie Caulfield","Thank you, operator. With me today are Indra Nooyi, PepsiCo\u2019s Chairman and CEO and Hugh Johnston, PepsiCo\u2019s CFO. We will lead off today\u2019s call with a review of our second quarter performance and full year 2018 outlook and then we will move on to Q&A.","Before we begin, please take note of our cautionary statement. This conference call includes forward-looking statements, including statements regarding 2018 guidance based on currently available information. Forward-looking statements inherently involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those predicted. Statements made on this conference call should be considered together with cautionary statements and other information contained in today\u2019s earnings release and in our most recent periodic reports filed with the SEC.","When discussing our financial results on today\u2019s call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP measures, which exclude certain items, such as the impact of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and other tax related items, foreign exchange translation and acquisitions, divestitures, structural and other changes from our reported results. You should refer to the Glossary and other attachments to this morning\u2019s earnings release and to the Investors section of PepsiCo\u2019s website under the Events and Presentations tab to find full explanations and reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures.","Now, it\u2019s my pleasure to introduce Indra Nooyi.","Indra Nooyi","Thank you, Jamie and good morning everyone and thank you all for joining us. We will start off with an overview of second quarter performance and a discussion of each of the operating sectors in a little more detail and then Hugh will cover the full year outlook.","For the quarter, we delivered $16.1 billion of net revenue driven by 2.6% organic revenue growth and core earnings of $1.61 per share, a 7% increase on a core constant currency basis. Overall, we are pleased with our operating and financial performance in the quarter especially given continued commodity inflation and other headwinds in the quarter such as the Brazil transportation strike. In the quarter, organic revenue growth accelerated sequentially from the first quarter. The majority of our businesses performed very well, with particularly strong performances by Frito-Lay North America and each of the international sectors and NAB, North American Beverages posted another quarter of sequential improvement in both organic revenue and operating profit performance.","Frito-Lay North America delivered balanced volume growth and net price realization driven by great marketplace execution, innovation and creative brand marketing. For example to address consumers\u2019 desire for greater flavor and product variety in single-serve multi-packs, we launched a 20-count Family Fun mix that includes an array of products from Lay\u2019s to Cheetos to Ruffles with an expanded mix of flavors and this clearly help drive 10% net revenue growth in our overall variety pack business. We launched Ruffles Mozzarella 'n Marinara, our latest bar food inspired flavor to meet the expectations of existing fans and capture the attention of new consumers seeking a unique and fun flavor experience. And this contributed to Ruffles 10% net revenue growth in the quarter. And Doritos Blaze launched earlier this year with the most talked about Super Bowl ad continues to perform well above our initial expectations and contributed to 6% net revenue growth in trademark Doritos in Q2. So overall, we are feeling very good about Frito-Lay North America\u2019s performance and momentum.","Turning to North American Beverages, the marketplace remains highly dynamic, but generally rational. With this as a backdrop, we are encouraged by the trending improvement in both net revenue and operating profit performance. After a slow start in the earlier part of the second quarter both for the category and North American Beverages, we saw momentum improve and a return to net revenue growth in the back half of Q2. Within the business, trademark Pepsi continued to make progress towards more stable performance. As we mentioned last quarter, we have stepped up media support on trademark Pepsi under the Pepsi generation\u2019s campaign. As a result in the second quarter, we began to see improvement in a number of key brand health metrics that is leading to better net revenue performance as the year progresses. So, we intend to stay the course increasing investment behind brand support in the second half of the year with the aim of driving further top line improvement. At the same time, we remain laser focused on higher growth categories with appropriate brand investment and robust innovation. For example, bubly, a cleverly marketed new entrant in the fast growing sparkling water segment launched earlier this year and it continues to perform exceedingly well.","Gatorade Zero, our latest hydration innovation with zero sugar and all the electrolytes of Gatorade just launched and is off to a great start. More importantly, trends on overall Gatorade performance have also recently accelerated and we are excited by the return of Mountain Dew Baja Blast, our summer limited time offer that just hit the shelves. So overall, we have seen sequential quarterly improvement at NAB and we expect to see continued acceleration in top line performance in the third quarter.","At Quaker Foods North America, our hot cereal business posted its fourth consecutive quarter of market share gains and delivered mid single-digit retail sales growth supported by our new ad campaign highlighting the functional benefits of oatmeal. In addition, Quaker light snacks had double-digit retail sales growth in our Aunt Jemima pancake business, grew both retail sales and market share for the seventh consecutive quarter.","Turning now to our sectors outside of North America, we are pleased with more than 6% organic revenue growth we saw in our developing and emerging market as a group. Strong marketplace execution combined with stable macro conditions have led to continued solid growth across many of our key international markets though growth was negatively impacted by the 11-day transportation strike that broadly disrupted commerce in Brazil. Within Latin America, organic revenue grew 3.5% driven by mid single-digit digit growth in Mexico and double-digit growth in Argentina and Colombia. We estimate the Brazil strike depressed overall net revenue growth for Latin America by approximately 2 percentage points.","In our Europe sub-Saharan Africa sector, Russia, Poland and South Africa each grew organic revenue high single-digits and Turkey had double-digit organic revenue growth. Even within the developed markets of Europe, we saw mid single-digit organic revenue growth in the UK and high single-digit growth in France. And in AMENA, we had strong double-digit organic revenue growth in China and Egypt, high single-digit organic revenue growth in Pakistan and Australia, and solid mid single-digit organic revenue growth in India. This strong top line performance translated into impressive bottom line results with core constant currency operating profit up 12% in our international divisions as a group fueled by fundamental operating performance and the gain this year from the Thailand refranchising partially offset by lapping the gain from our sale of Britvic shares in 2017.","The international results are in part a reflection of our efforts to increasingly lift and shift successful initiatives from one market to many and innovating on our big global brands in locally relevant ways. For instance, in Latin America, we are innovating with Quaker Super Foods, a new premium platform with differentiated ingredients such as oats with rye, amaranth, flaxseed and quinoa. In ESSA, we have lifted and shifted Off the Eaten Path, a premium range of plant-based snacks from the U.S. to the United Kingdom. And in AMENA, we have taken our successful Sunbites platform from the U.S. to Australia by launching Sunbites Grain Waves Plus with the goodness of Australian whole grain corn, wheat and oats for beetroot and sweet potato. At the same time, they have also launched in the U.S., Red Rock Deli, one of our most successful brands in Australia. Net, we are encouraged by the momentum we are seeing across many of our key international markets. NAB is making steady improvement and Frito-Lay North America is performing well. Importantly, as we have managed the business for strong performance today, we are also taking steps to enable to continue to perform well in the decades ahead. We are pleased to report that in the coming days we will publish our most recent sustainability report discussing our progress against and commitments to our sustainability goals.","We encourage you to read the full report, but I\u2019d like to take just a few minutes this morning to provide you with the highlights. We are in millions of pantries and refrigerators worldwide. So we know we have a tremendous opportunity and responsibility to use our scale to make a positive impact on the world. Our customers, employees and partners feel good knowing that there is a shared journey of sustainable transformation making our products more nutritious and more resource efficient, dialing up the taste while reducing our environmental footprint. Our investors can feel good knowing this makes us a stronger business over the long-term, that we can also do well by also doing good. 12 years ago, we embarked on a journey of PepsiCo, as we call, Performance with Purpose. Since then, much has changed at PepsiCo and around the world, but the underlying principles behind Performance with Purpose remain. Much of our early work on Performance with Purpose requires us to think differently about our business and make the kinds of long-term investments from researching and developing new more nutritious products to finding ways to reduce water and energy use across plants and farms that will help us deliver on the vision of making our growth, our operations and our impact more sustainable. Sustainability has been defined as meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. Over the last dozen years, we have tried to meet the needs of the present, while strengthening the ability of future generations to meet this integrating that aspiration into our goals for products, planet and people.","Let me briefly comment on each. When it comes to products, we have built on our legacy as the first company to voluntarily remove trans-fats from our snacks by reducing added sugars, sodium and saturated fat in many of our products launching a revolutionary nutrition-focused vending option, Hello Goodness and growing our portfolio of what we define as Good for You and Better for You options from about 38% of revenue in 2006 to roughly 50% last year. We also teamed up with others in our industry to form The Healthy Weight Commitment Foundation removing 6.4 trillion calories from our food and beverage products surpassing our collective pledge by more than 400%. And through Food for Good, we have provided 18 million nutritious servings to low income U.S. families since 2009.","Regarding planet, we have raised the bar for what it means to be a responsible corporate water steward earning the prestigious Stockholm Industry Water Award. We have invested more than $40 million since 2006 to provide safe water access around the world benefiting nearly 16 million people in some of the planet\u2019s most water stress regions. We have also made our delivery fleet more energy efficient eliminating the need for over 1 million gallons of diesel fuel since our electric vehicle initiative began in 2010. The equivalent of keeping more than 2,000 passenger cars off the road for the year, while also making our beverage coolers and vending machines 60% more energy-efficient and we are one of the world\u2019s largest purchasers of recycled PET. In fact if more recycled PET were available we would buy it. We have also launched the first 100% compostable chip bag in test markets, while diverting more and more of our waste from landfill, approximately 95% as of 2017. And for people, we have re-imagined what it means to support our associates from ushering onsite and near-site childcare campuses around the world to expanding PepsiCo University\u2019s online course offerings to help associates upgrade their skills to navigate our rapidly changing world. We have also helped lift up the communities we serve playing a critical role in disaster relief efforts from Texas to Florida and Puerto Rico, Mexico to Ecuador and China to the Philippines.","While we still have work to do in certain areas, we are incredibly proud of the progress we have made. Our aspiration of being a good company, good ethically and good commercially continues to come to fruition using a broader, more lasting impact than we ever imagined and setting a standard that companies across our industry and beyond aspire to meet. Looking ahead, we will continue viewing our work through both the microscope and a telescope, focusing on the most granular details, grams of saturated fats, parts per billion of greenhouse gas, the number of women in management roles as well as the larger ambition of building a business that acts in accordance with our values, each of us striving to do what\u2019s right for the company and what is right for our communities, because at the end of the day, there is no separating the two.","With that, let me turn it over to Hugh.","Hugh Johnston","Thank you, Indra and good morning everyone. I will just provide a quick update on the outlook and then we will move to your questions. From a macro perspective, we maintain a fairly positive view overall. However within this broadly positive picture, there remains risk of volatility both in geographic markets as we saw in Brazil in the most recent quarter and in currencies as witnessed by the recent sharp rise in the strength of the U.S. dollar. From an industry standpoint, we continue to see pretty challenging conditions, including a dynamic retail and consumer landscape, a very competitive environment and ongoing commodity inflation. So putting this all together in considering our year-to-date performance, our guidance for 2018 remains unchanged. Specifically, we expect organic revenue growth at least in line with our 2017 growth rate or 2.3%.","As we move through the year, our expectation is that we will continue to see some levels of gross margin compression from inflationary input costs. Normally, you would expect to see the gross margin contraction offset with SG&A productivity, but as we have stated previously with the benefit of a lower effective tax rate in 2018, we are making investments to fortify the business as well as having funded the U.S. frontline bonus and these investments will largely offset productivity driven margin improvement. We expect our core effective tax rate to be in the low 20s and we expect core earnings per share of $5.70 or a 9% increase compared to 2017 core earnings per share of $5.23.","We expect to continue to generate strong cash flow and to exercise disciplined capital allocation with prudent reinvestment into the business. For 2018, we continue to expect free cash flow of approximately $6 billion, which includes approximately $9 billion in cash flow from operations, including a $1.4 billion discretionary pension contribution made in the first quarter and net capital spending of approximately $3.6 billion. We continue to expect to return approximately $7 billion to shareholders in 2018 with cash dividends of approximately $5 billion, reflecting a 15% increase in the annualized dividend per share that began with the June payment and share repurchases of approximately $2 billion.","Finally, as you update your models I\u2019d like to highlight the following. We expect our rate of earnings growth to be substantially higher in the fourth than in the third quarter. This is due to the timing of investments and the lapse associated with last year\u2019s natural disasters. In addition, we expect the previously announced refranchising of our Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovakia business operations to benefit our fourth quarter earnings, and finally based on market consensus forecast, we expect foreign exchange translation to negatively impact both net revenue and operating profit in the second half of the year reversing the ForEx benefits that we had in the first half.","With that operator, we are ready to take the first question. Operator?","Indra Nooyi","Hello. Operator?","Jamie Caulfield","Hi, it\u2019s Jamie Caulfield. We appear to be experiencing some technical difficulties in having your questions fed to us. So if I could ask you just to remain patient for a minute while we sort this out. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley.","Indra Nooyi","Good morning, Dara.","Dara Mohsenian","Hey, good morning. So, Indra, clearly, there has been a lot of investor focus around the number of pressure points in the CPG industry in terms of pricing power brand demand fragmentation etcetera, etcetera and basically that some of the traditional advantages of larger CPG companies are breaking down. In that context, I was hoping you could give us some perspective on if there are areas of significant investment or operational changes at Pepsi going forward beyond what you have already done to help position the company versus some of those industry challenge is and how realistic a long-term high single-digit earnings growth algorithm beyond 2018 is if you need to reinvest it again some of those pressure points? And within that answer I was hoping specifically you could touch on price mix, you have obviously had strong pricing realization in the last few years with the inflationary commodities in the trade and tariff risk, I\u2019d love some updated thoughts on price mix also within that? Thanks.","Indra Nooyi","Thanks, Dara. And first of all, I think you asked me about 10 questions within one question, but given that we had this technical difficulty, I guess you are entitled to ask these 10 questions. I think you asked a sort of very, very interesting questions, I think the changes we are seeing in the industry are quite interesting and I think the changes that we are seeing benefit companies that have already invested to build scale, building international footprint and have the right partnerships around the world. I think now it\u2019s not the time for companies to go and plant flags in new countries and try to startup businesses. So, I\u2019d actually observe that the advantage CPG companies are small, niche single country companies with small brands who grow it to a certain level and then flip it or very large established scale companies who build businesses in multiple geographies. And I don\u2019t mean just planting the flag actually built scale. And I think PepsiCo is one of those few companies that have actually over the years invested to build scale, put the right partnerships in place, built a diversified portfolio and actually solidified our presence and we made all the investments over the years.","So that part of the investment is behind us. This next tranche of investments relate to digitalization thinking through more automation in our plants, in our go-to-market systems figuring out how we can unleash more productivity, but more efficiency and effectiveness not just efficiency, if efficiency and effectiveness so that we can serve the changing retail world in more efficient and productive base, because retailers are going to go through their own changes and they are going to look at a few players to be the anchor suppliers to them while they handle with all kinds of changes with a large portion of the CPG world. And I think PepsiCo with its DSD systems and with its high velocity categories, its brand portfolio, and most importantly, innovation becomes a very valuable partner across the world. I mean I have often said this to you, when we had just snacks and beverages going to large European retailers, we were like 37 in a number of 50 on the list now with our combined approach and the Power of One approach, we are in the top 5 or top 7 suppliers driving a lot of the growth. They look at us and say there are these large companies the drive a lot of growth in our anchor suppliers that we should just have great relationships with, leave them aside, while we focus on all of the other players that we need to either prune the portfolio or figure out how to make them more efficient. So we are making investments in digitalization, more automation in plants, rethinking our innovation process and making sure that we fragment or segment our innovation between premium, mid and value and deal with each country and each marketplace with that sort of an architecture. And then we are getting better and better lifting and shifting across the world. So, there I don\u2019t think that a big burst of innovation required. All that we are doing is investing as we go along. And I think Hugh talked about the fact that we have been making investments in the business. We have been doing that deliberately and carefully over the years. And we are going to continue to do that. We are going to look for ways to unleash productivity and every time we have productivity we are going to see how we judiciously reinvest in the business that we can keep this engine going. And in terms of price mix, innovation is a big driver of price mix as is revenue management and we are improving our revenue management skills all the time applying more digital tools. When it comes to innovation, we are thinking more and more about segmenting on innovation and we are also thinking about how to incubate a niche company within our big company and that\u2019s what we are focused on in every big region of the world. So overall, we feel very comfortable with our overall strategy.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira of JPMorgan.","Andrea Teixeira","Hi, thank you and good morning. So I appreciate your answer to that, but I was hoping if you can update us on your outlook for NAB since the last call as you are considering strategic alternatives? And in light of this combined approach with technology I just mentioned using the European example I would appreciate if you can elaborate? Thank you.","Indra Nooyi","I will provide some opening comments, Andrea and then pass it to Hugh to give more color. What we told you in the last call is that you should expect to see sequential improvement in North American Beverage performance. That\u2019s exactly what we are focused on and that\u2019s what we are delivering. Every part of the business in North American Beverages is showing sequential improvement. In the second part of Q2, we saw significant improvement in performance and as we go into Q3, we feel good about the trend rate. We are playing a very responsible game in terms of advertising and pricing. And with commodity inflation, we will continue to play a responsible \u2013 take a responsible position in this marketplace by pushing through pricing. So at the end of the day, our North American Beverage business, which participates in a highly competitive category needs to be managed very, very carefully especially at a time when there are changes in the marketplace from lots of competitive activity. And look there is always going to be short-term preservations when our competitors go through major changes in their business models, our challenge is to maintain a very steady hand and make the PepsiCo portfolio work for us and that\u2019s what we have been doing. I don\u2019t know Hugh if you want to add anything to this?","Hugh Johnston","The only thing I would add, Indra, is hopefully you all have seen that this management team is always focused on creating value both in the short-term and in the long-term and achieving the right balance between the two. And as we look at all of the businesses that, that is our most significant focus and I think we will continue to do that just as we have.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Pablo Zuanic of SIG.","Indra Nooyi","Good morning Pablo.","Pablo Zuanic","Thank you. Good morning, Indra. Good morning, everyone. Two quick questions. One, I understand that you are reinvesting in the tax benefits, but can you clarify whether that\u2019s more heavily geared to reinvesting in beverages or is it pretty much evenly across the business? And the second question which is related to that when you see a success that Coca-Cola has had with the Diet Coke new products and with Coca-Cola Zero Sugar, any thoughts in terms of how things would be done different on the Pepsi side of things? And the reason I asked that is that if the brands themselves having been improved in terms of innovation, how much is reinvestment and more marketing going to help? Thanks.","Indra Nooyi","Pablo, we reinvested tax benefits on additional media for NAB and wherever the businesses needed investment, we put it in. The idea is not just to invest, it\u2019s to reinvest judiciously, so that we get return from the investments. And we also reinvested some of the tax benefits in our frontline bonus, so that especially people in the United States where the tax benefits of really accrued can benefit from the upside. Now, when it comes to our North American Beverage business, we are investing in CSDs, especially trademark Pepsi. And we are investing more in trademark Pepsi, because we saw stepped up investment in media from our competition. So we are doing that. When it comes to the Zero Sugar portfolio both between Diet Pepsi and Pepsi Zero Sugar, Pepsi Zero Sugar is growing extremely well. I mean, it\u2019s \u2013 I hate to use the word flying off the shelves but is doing exceedingly well. When it comes to Diet Pepsi, Diet Pepsi is also back to good performance. And I have to tell you the flavor portfolio on Diet Pepsi and whatever competition launched, you might want to look at the numbers in a little bit more detail, because I think it\u2019s a mixed bag. We have to be careful not to throw too much innovation to this marketplace and sort of obfuscate the numbers from our perspective, Zero Sugar portfolio between Diet and Zero Sugar is doing well and is doing well on the sustained consistent basis and we are playing the long game, Pablo, in terms of overall liquid refreshment beverages. And we think that, that\u2019s the right way to play this beverage game and we feel good about where we are headed.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane of Bank of America.","Bryan Spillane","Hey, good morning everyone.","Indra Nooyi","Good morning, Bryan.","Bryan Spillane","Hugh, I just wanted to pickup on you made a comment in terms of the forward guidance about gross margins still being under pressure in the second half. So, I guess couple of questions. I guess that implies we should expect that gross margins might be down in the second half? And then maybe what some of the pressure points are what\u2019s sort of inflation and I guess also maybe transactional FX, if you could just kind of walk us through what\u2019s going to drive that pressure in gross margins in the second half and maybe what mitigation you might have as we look forward into \u201819?","Hugh Johnston","Yes, Bryan, happy to do that. So, a couple of comments. When I say gross margins under pressure, I am talking about relatively nominal pressures we have seen over the last several quarters. A combination of a couple of factors on gross margin, number one, obviously commodity inflation has picked up a bit. Certainly, we have seen a bit more in oil and in addition to that in aluminum; second, transport costs have also been under some pressure with the driver shortage in the United States; and then third, in international markets, as you know where we have seen some inflation, we do tend to price a bit behind inflation and try to drive productivity in order to offset that and then obviously we are reinvesting the tax benefit in the form of new capabilities. So, you don\u2019t see the productivity flow through as you normally might in SG&A. So, those are the several factors that are driving it. Overall as I said, we expect full year to be on the 9% that we originally committed to and we are balancing the internal workings of the P&L to make that happen.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ali Dibadj of Bernstein.","Indra Nooyi","Good morning, Ali.","Ali Dibadj","Hey, guys. So just wanted to ask a little bit more about the sustainability of your results going forward along three dimensions. First, is the sustainability of one-timers like Thailand and Britvic and coming up on Czech Republic here in your core results, should we continue to expect things like that to be a consistent part of your algorithm going forward? How much more of those types of things you have to sell? Second, in terms of pricing, it continues to be a big driver obviously for Latin America and you are willing to continue to sacrifice a little bit of volume there again, how much longer you think that sustainable? And then third on NAB improvements very pleased that they are on track both you and I, can you give us more about whether you believe that was actually driven by advertising increases, was there an advertising increase in particular in NAB overall as opposed to just Pepsi, could you call that Pepsi, because you called out Pepsi, but I don\u2019t see it in the release for the segment, NAB or is there something else that drove that improvement and so will that improvement you guys believe continue not just going to this quarter, but going forward?","Indra Nooyi","I am going to take the third one and then Hugh, I am going to toss it to you to talk about the first two, okay. NAB improvement, again, Ali as I mentioned, we are playing the LRB game. We are looking to improve our position in the liquid refreshment beverage category, because we play in pretty much every category in LRB most of them with very, very strong brands. And in terms of A&M spending, we increased A&M spending on trademark Pepsi as we mentioned we were going to do and because the A&M gets curved in, you will see the benefits flowing through in Q3 and Q4 more as we go through and we are seeing the improvement in brand health metrics and we are seeing a sequential improvement in the performance of the business. So believe me, we have focused maniacally on tracking the performance and the result of all of our increased spending. And what we are seeing in the results, that gives us confidence to tell you what we told you on the call today. So on balance, we are feeling good about the NAB performance trends. Now, let me turn it to Hugh to talk about the one-timers and pricing, especially in countries like \u2013 regions like Latin America.","Hugh Johnston","Yes, happy to, Ali. In terms of one-timers, if you look at our record over the last 4 or 5 years, we have always had some one-timers whether it\u2019s refranchising the businesses or sales of businesses or assets. So that\u2019s going to continue to be a factor as it has been. In terms of Latin America, without a doubt, where you have high inflation environments, we have tended to price through the vast majority of that inflation. And as a result, it\u2019s improved our revenue results sometimes at the expense of volume. As you see the inflation rates come down in those countries, obviously our pricing will diminish, but we do expect that our volume will pickup as a result of that and we expect to continue to see strong results out of Latin America and other places that have historically had high inflation where the numbers have come down a bit.","Indra Nooyi","But I think the most important thing on one-timers, we don\u2019t do one-timers to deliver earnings, we do one-timers because we think it\u2019s the right business model for those countries and what we are trying to do is to strengthen the core business, so that they have the right partner to boost the performance of that beverage business in certain markets we will franchise it to them and if think we have better off operating it, we will do that. So I think we use one-timers in a very judicious strategic way to improve the overall performance of the company.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.","Judy Hong","Good morning. So, Indra, I guess I just wanted to get a little bit more color on the Gatorade performance, trends have gotten a little better recently the comps are getting easier, so maybe that\u2019s also helping. But just wanted to also get a better sense of maybe some of the brand health metrics that you talked about is really to maybe that was I think more of a Pepsi trademark comment, but on Gatorade specifically? And then as you think about Gatorade Zero, a little bit more color just in terms of the positioning of that particular line and how much marketing investments that you are making on that line? Thanks.","Indra Nooyi","Gatorade is actually doing very well and this weather is helping for sure, but the underlying Gatorade trademark is very, very strong and Gatorade always attracts new players into the marketplace and they come in with either lower prices or they try to come in and build distribution and they might take a few share points in any quarter or two, but then over time if you look at it over a period of 5 or 7 years, the Gatorade franchise has been extremely resilient and is basically held on to its leadership position. We have innovated to build shoulders with the Gatorade recovery drinks, the Gatorade Chews before you start exercising and then we have segmented along flavors and then across different sports. Many of our consumers wanted a Gatorade Zero for the light exercise who didn\u2019t want the carbohydrates that real athletes needed and so we launched Gatorade Zero. Even though there is Propel also, they wanted to be seen with the Gatorade. So, we launched Gatorade Zero and we keep advertising along the entire trademark and we have never wavered from advertising to athletes and to active exercises and that\u2019s going to be the continued focus of Gatorade. It\u2019s a very strong resilient franchise and we feel good about where it is and where it\u2019s headed.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman of Barclays.","Indra Nooyi","Good morning, Lauren.","Lauren Lieberman","Good morning. Thanks. I was curious you had mentioned sort of two different types of comments around brands and innovations. So one bucket was sort of the discussion of lift and shift continuing to support and build your biggest franchises and then Indra you also mentioned the idea of incubating niche brands or companies within market? So, I was curious if you could kind of put those two together and in particular what I have been most curious about is how PepsiCo is thinking about a small brand strategy if you want or need to have one in the beverage business, because when I look at some of the work you have done in the last 2 years, LIFEWTR, bubly, it\u2019s very much a strategy of drive a blockbuster win, not build something slowly and patiently through single serve and discovery. So, I was curious your thoughts around the viability of a small brand strategy within PepsiCo and if that was something you are were focusing on? Thanks.","Indra Nooyi","Actually, it\u2019s a great question, Lauren. Actually, if I look back especially the last 5 years of beverages, we have had some spectacular new products which for any small startup company would have been a blockbuster, but for PepsiCo because we have put it through DSD system unless it reaches the scale of a LIFEWTR or bubly in the first 12 to 18 months, we can\u2019t support it, because many times the space has to come out of the core cooler or the core isle and so we look at differential velocity and then the DSD system tends to kill it. And if I look at products like Lemon Lemon from last year, it was rated the best new product launch of last year. It reached a pretty impressive level of sales yet on the DSD system I didn\u2019t do that well, because it was cannibalizing space from a core CSD category. So what we have created now is this new entity within PepsiCo called The Hive. It\u2019s a separate group just like we did with e-commerce we have taken it out of the core headquarters. It\u2019s going to be an entrepreneurial group that\u2019s going to take some of the best new products that we launched and reached a certain size, but we never really allowed it to thrive in the DSD system we were nurtured and incubated in whatever distribution system they think is the best for it and when it reaches a certain size, we can decide whether it should come into the DSD system or not. And this group is also going to look at other venturing brands they can bring in and we want to create an environment where we have a business within a business, a small entrepreneurial sort of agile group that\u2019s thinking about the new age consumer that loves discovery brands, while allowing the big brands to thrive in the overall mothership. And this is not new to PepsiCo North America we are doing something like this in Europe. It\u2019s a very local business. So we have to be careful not to make it global. It\u2019s a very local business and we are going to play with these businesses, because there is a consumer that is willing to pay for discovery brands and they can reach a decent level of growth and so we are going to go off and see how to make it happen. We are feeling excited about what we have just launched. Let\u2019s see what happens in the next few months and years.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Powers of Deutsche Bank.","Steve Powers","Hey, good morning. Thanks. So going back to North America Beverages for a minute, it does indeed look like we are on track for a return to growth in the second half, which is great. I just love a little bit more context about what you might feel that the top success factors in that path, whether it\u2019s key launch like Gatorade Zero better realize price mix as inflation builds more of an inflection in core Pepsi or just are there one or two priorities on your scorecard that you could call out for us that will be great? And then secondly as you have been open about your ongoing assessment of strategic options for the bottling utility as you called it whether that\u2019s constituting a standalone entity you are putting in the hands of multiple franchisees or keeping it as part of PepsiCo. I am just curious as to whether or not you have narrowed in on any subset of those options or what the timeframe might be for you be in a position to communicate your path forward to market? Thanks.","Indra Nooyi","Hugh?","Hugh Johnston","Yes, Steve, happy to answer those questions. First, in terms of the priorities, if nothing else what we saw last year and we have certainly seen in this year we need to be able to both make sure the big businesses are on track in North America Beverages, those big businesses obviously are Pepsi, Mountain Dew and Gatorade. What we have seen over the last couple of quarters is certainly a strengthening in the Mountain Dew business both the core green bottle business as well as the innovation with Ice and now the return of Baja Blast, which has always been a Mountain Dew fan favorite. Second, obviously is Gatorade. Gatorade certainly is a business that\u2019s now back on track and we are very excited about the innovation. Gatorade Zero really meets, I think a very unmet need for the lapse Gatorade user, because as Indra pointed out earlier, they just don\u2019t want the calories, but they want the Gatorade brand. And then Pepsi, where we knew we needed to increase the advertising, we knew we needed to have a good campaign this year that obviously takes longer to do. The quantity is easier to turn on, but just getting it into consumer\u2019s minds takes a period of time. So first sort of big priority is making sure the big businesses are doing well. Second is continue to execute against the innovations in the newer categories whether it\u2019s bubly or continuing to execute LIFEWTR or continuing to make sure newer brands like KeVita do well. That\u2019s the additive that sort of creates the growth in the business. The core brands grow at a certain rate and all of those new innovations create the incremental growth. So, I think we need to be able to do both North America Beverages obviously a big nuance complex business and we need to do more than one or two things well. We need to do most things well for that business to perform and that\u2019s what you see happening. Regarding strategic options nothing new to report on that, we will continue to look at options to create value not only in that business, but across all of our businesses.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog of Wells Fargo.","Indra Nooyi","Hey, Bonnie. Good morning.","Bonnie Herzog","Thank you. Hi, good morning. So I just wanted to talk about Frito-Lay North America, your growth really has been impressive both on the top and bottom line. So, how sustainable is this from a long-term perspective? And then could you guys walk through for us any productivity initiatives that you have specifically implemented in Frito-Lay that you possibly could implement across the rest of your businesses? Thanks.","Indra Nooyi","On the Frito-Lay, the reason the growth is impressive is because Frito-Play plays in salty snacks and the entire macro snacks space is there for the taking. And so Frito-Lay focuses on the core and then inches out of the core by taking occasions from the rest of macro snacks and the innovation engine is very geared to going out and building both frequency and penetration and picking up more and more snacking occasions. And as long as they keep doing that, they should be able to deliver the group. The DSD apparatus is an extremely impressive machine and that actually helps sustain Frito-Lay\u2019s growth. In terms of productivity initiatives, we have talked about GES, Bonnie. GES is now rolling out to multiple locations. It\u2019s doing two things. One is delivering more productivity, but more importantly, it\u2019s de-bottlenecking the system because it\u2019s allowing us to put more SKUs and be more customer-specific in our picking. And so GES has actually been a big benefit for us and then deploying more digital technologies across Frito-Lay is actually delivering more productivity. The good news is as North America \u2013 tools that North American Beverages develops goes to Frito-Lay and what Frito-Lay develops, comes to North America. And so we have a wonderful transfer of knowledge and tests that\u2019s happening between the two businesses and so we can take the customer base both traditional trade up and down the street and big organized accounts and figure out how to serve them better, whether you call it geo box at our beverage business or GES in Frito-Lay, there is a lot of information exchange going on. And overall, I think both businesses are high velocity businesses and they are able to unleash productivity to reinvest to keep this growth engine going. Do you want to add anything, Hugh?","Hugh Johnston","No, I think you captured it very well.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Amit Sharma of BMO Capital Markets.","Amit Sharma","Hi, good morning everyone. Hugh, a quick clarification, you did say you expect to take pricing in NAB CSGs, can you talk about how quickly we should expect you to rollout pricing and to what extent? And then another one, gas prices are now multiyear high, are you seeing any change in consumer behavior, especially in the C-Store channel?","Hugh Johnston","Yes, to answer your first question first, I think you will see incremental pricing benefit in the third quarter and then you will see more in the fourth quarter. Regarding gas prices, convenience channel was up about 3% I believe overall for the second quarter. So I think given the healthiness of the overall economy that\u2019s more than offsetting the gas price increases.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Swartzberg of Stifel.","Mark Swartzberg","Yes, thanks. Good morning. Hugh, just for you on CapEx, could you remind us why the $3.6 billion is higher than it\u2019s been historically and how representative you think that is of future CapEx either in absolute terms or relative to sales?","Hugh Johnston","Yes. So, our previously discussed long-term guidance is equal to or less than 5% of net revenue, no update on that right now, bigger investments in a couple of places. Latin America, we have seen capital spending go up as we have implemented some of the GES solutions that Indra has mentioned on the previous question. Number two, we are investing more in Frito-Lay, because we are identifying projects to drive continued growth in productivity. And number three, North America Beverage as the single-serve strategy has continued to be successful we are adding capacity in certain places.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Ottenstein of Evercore.","Robert Ottenstein","Great. Thank you very much. And Indra in the past you have given us a little bit more color in terms of market share gains and value share gains and clearly you are doing very well outside of the U.S. Can you perhaps give us a little bit of sense of where you are gaining share and importantly international markets and where things are more challenging? And then secondly, bubly off to a great start, perhaps if you could maybe stand back a little bit and give us a sense of where you see yourselves take your water strategy and what percentage of the business it is right now? Thank you.","Indra Nooyi","In terms of share gains internationally, I think overall salty snacks globally, I think in 75% of the markets we are holding or gaining share. Remember internationally, we also have a lot of local low cost competitors. In spite of that, I think 70% 75% of markets we hold or gain share, I think in 60% of markets we are gaining share and about 75% we either hold or gain, I am giving you rough numbers, Robert. In terms of beverages again in many of the markets that we participate as PepsiCo about 50% or 60% of markets we are actually holding or gaining share and then the other markets we go in and out, well, one quarter we may gain share, one quarter local competitor or a global competitor may gain share. So we trade shares on a quarterly basis based on what we are lapping or what specific, a blockbuster marketing initiative is being implemented at that time, but overall what we are focused is on an annual basis how do we make sure that we don\u2019t do anything crazy just to gain share. We participate in a very responsible way and somewhere between 60% and 75% of our markets if we can hold or gain share that\u2019s a very sustainable deliberate strategy. And that\u2019s really what we are focused on globally both the snacks and beverages and now more and more in our nutrition businesses, which we are trying to figure out what the relevant marketplaces and how do we calculate a fair market share number. So that\u2019s roughly speaking where we are on share.","Hugh Johnston","On water, Indra just I will finish Robert\u2019s question. It\u2019s about 12% of our volume, Robert, round numbers and in terms of water strategy obviously we have a case pack water business that provides baseload volume and then we are increasingly segmenting that business whether it be with flavored still waters, whether it be with flavored sparkling waters in the form of bubly, whether it be in the form of LIFEWTR, which obviously appeals to a large consumer segment, one, that continues to grow well for us. So I think you will continue to see us segment the water category into profitable niches to go along with the large scale case pack water business.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nik Modi of RBC Capital Markets.","Nik Modi","Yes, good morning everyone. Good morning. So Indra I was hoping you could provide some of the logic behind the various refranchising initiatives PepsiCo has undertaken in the international markets and how any early learnings could inform the beverage strategy in the U.S.? And I guess the main question is, is it even translatable? That would be really helpful to understand.","Indra Nooyi","Nik, I tell you that\u2019s a good question and let me just offer some points. When we re-franchise, it\u2019s usually just to somebody who already has a portfolio of beverages, because Pepsi internationally in many markets, we don\u2019t have a full lineup of beverages, we participate only in a small lineup, we partner with somebody who has their own LRB products and together we cover the entire line. An example would be something like a Postobon in Colombia that has their own line of non-carbs and then we come in with our portfolio and together, we have a fantastic leadership position in Colombia. What we are looking at and Hugh talked about our Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovakia beverage operations, we are refranchising into a partner who already has the lineup of LRB and we complete the portfolio. So our system actually is much more robust than people realize, because as a system we are much stronger than just PepsiCo in the international beverage business and that\u2019s why we feel good about the beverage business. And the early learnings are make sure if you are going to re-franchise, re-franchise to somebody who knows how to run the beverage business and they have a portfolio that together the one plus one is a three not detracting from our own performance. So that\u2019s all we are going to focus on going forward and those are the learnings from our beverage refranchising.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell of SunTrust.","Bill Chappell","Thanks. Good morning. Question on just the momentum on NAB that you talked about is it kind of started slow and had good momentum at the end, I mean, that tracks with kind of what we saw in North America weather in terms of cold and wet late March, April early May and then came back roaring and then very hot? So trying to understand what you see that makes you feel that it\u2019s beyond weather, I mean, the whole \u2013 lifting the whole category, are you seeing kind of market share especially in CSDs, are you seeing some things stabilize or what gives you so much confidence that carries through as we get to kind of normal weather and albeit easier comps in the back half?","Indra Nooyi","Weather is clearly a factor. I mean, I would be lying if I didn\u2019t tell you that hot weather helps the beverage business, but I think on top of that, our brand health metrics are all trending the right way. The business is trending the right way. And pretty much all of our franchises we are seeing sequential improvement in performance. And so even businesses that have difficult lapse we are seeing sequential improvement in performance. So I think if this continues, this bodes well for NAB.","Indra Nooyi","So thank you all for your questions. Let me summarize, the business overall is performing well in a highly dynamic environment and we remain on-track to deliver our financial goals for the year. We remain highly focused on driving better operating performance from North American Beverages and we are encouraged by the sequential improvement we have seen in NAB. Just as important even if you remain highly focused on performing well in the current and coming quarters, we remain committed to continuing to transform the business to strengthen its sustainability and durability to perform well far into the future.

It is now my pleasure to introduce Mr. Jamie Caulfield, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Caulfield, you may begin.","Jamie Caulfield","Thank you, operator. With me today are Indra Nooyi, PepsiCo\u2019s Chairman and CEO and Hugh Johnston, PepsiCo\u2019s CFO. We\u2019ll lead off today\u2019s call with a review of our second quarter 2016 performance and full-year outlook and then we\u2019ll move on to Q&A. We\u2019ve kept our comments brief this morning and intend to conclude the call by 8:45.","Before we begin, please take note of our cautionary statement. This conference call includes forward-looking statements including statements regarding 2016 guidance based on currently available information. Forward-looking statements inherently involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those predicted in such forward-looking statements. Statements made on this conference call should be considered together with cautionary statements and other information contained in today's earnings release and in our most recent periodic reports filed with the SEC.","References to organic revenue results exclude the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, structural changes, foreign exchange translation and, for full-year 2016, the impact of a 53rd week.","To find disclosures and reconciliations of non-GAAP measures that we use when discussing PepsiCo's financial results, you should refer to the glossary and other attachments to this morning's earnings release and to the Investors section of PepsiCo\u2019s Web site under the Events and Presentations tab.","As we discuss today's results, please keep in mind that our second quarter comprises the 12 weeks ended June 11 for our North American operations and the three months of March through May for most of our operations outside of North America.","And now, it\u2019s my pleasure to introduce Indra Nooyi.","Indra Nooyi","Thanks, Jamie. I'm pleased to report that our businesses continued to perform well in the second quarter. We had more than 2% organic volume growth in both global snacks and global beverages. While foreign exchange translations continued to pressure our reported revenue results, we delivered more than 3% organic revenue growth led by Frito-Lay North America, AMENA, and Latin America.","ESSA delivered operating margin expansion together with increased A&M investment. North American beverages delivered solid net price realization and margin expansion. And Quaker Foods North America had very strong net revenue and operating profit growth.","And positive net pricing and continued execution of our productivity agenda, including the implementation of our smart spending program, drove 80 basis points of core operating margin expansion. At the same time, we continued to invest in advertising and marketing, which increased 50 basis points as a percentage of sales in the second quarter. ","And our performance was well balanced by market type. Our developing and emerging markets businesses grew organic revenue almost 7% for the quarter, with double-digit organic revenue growth in China, Mexico, [indiscernible], and Egypt.","And our developed markets growth was led by the United States where we grew revenue more than 2%. In fact, on a standalone basis, Frito-Lay was the largest contributor to growth at retail and gained value share in both salty and macro snacks. North American beverages maintained its value share leadership and possesses five of the ten top beverage trademarks based on dollar sales \u2013 Pepsi, Mountain Dew, Gatorade, Lipton, and Starbucks. And Quaker gained almost 1.5 value share points in hot cereal, while accounting for 100% of category retail sales growth.","Year-to-date, our results are equally strong. Organic revenue grew 3.4%. Core constant currency operating profit grew 7% and up 9% excluding the impact of de-consolidating Venezuela. And core constant currency EPS grew 8%, but up 10% excluding the Venezuela impact.","On the strength of our year-to-date results and our outlook for the balance of the year, we have increased our full-year core EPS target to $4.71 from our previous target of $4.66 driven by the expectations and factors set out in this morning\u2019s press release.","Specifically, there are five things we\u2019ve focused on to deliver in what continues to be a challenging macro-environment. First, consumer-centric relentless innovation; second, connecting with digital age consumers in new ways; third, being a true growth partner to our customers; fourth, flawless end-to-end execution; and fifth, a maniacal focus on productivity.","Let me touch on each briefly. First, innovation and portfolio transformation are enabling us to provide consumers the delicious and convenient products they want and to satisfy their constantly-evolving demands across a broad spectrum of occasions in each stage. We have ramped up our innovation engine.","And as a result, new products comprise approximately 9% of sales or over $5 billion. We\u2019ve achieved this by leveraging our global scale, while simultaneously tailoring products to appeal to local tastes, addressing consumers\u2019 evolving demands for convenient taste and variety from the occasional treat to nutrition by transforming our product portfolio.","So, today, what we refer to as guilt-free products generates approximately 45% of our net revenue, and we\u2019re now recognizing consumers\u2019 interest in craft, niche, and premium products. So, for example, in beverages, Gatorade continues to innovate in the new areas of sports hydration with the introduction of the G Frost flavor lineup, while Propel by the makers of Gatorade drove more than 40% of the enhanced water category volume growth year-to-date.","Following on the success of Mountain Dew Kickstart, we\u2019ve introduced Mountain Dew Black Label, a deeper, darker dew, made with real sugar and crafted with dark berry flavor and herbal bitters. Mountain Dew Black Label is for those times the DEW Nation wants to live it up with a touch of class.","Dew Black Label is initially released exclusively at approximately 600 colleges and universities, giving students the first taste of the unique beverage and demand for the product built as word quickly spread across social media.","Along with the nationwide release of Mountain Dew Black Label, the brand is extending its boldly refined campaign. It started with activation during the South by Southwest Music Conference and festival in Austin, which included the Mountain Dew Black Label parlor, a South by Southwest takeover concept, and product seating at local bars and venues. The campaign continued with the release of a new digital spot called Gentlemen of the Jacket. The content showcases different gentlemen skaters including Dew athlete and pro skateboarder, Theotis Beasley, mixologist and gamers, all crossing over to the classer side of Dew with the help of putting on a unique jacket, transforming world therein to become a more refined version of itself, yet still getting at the heart of all things Dew.","In the second quarter, we also launched Aquafina Sparkling, a new line of flavored sparkling water that provides a light and naturally sweetened hydration option. Aquafina Sparkling is offered in three delicious fruit flavors, Black Cherry Dragonfruit, Lemon Lime, and Orange Grapefruit. Each sleek single-serve, 12-ounce can contains just 10 calories and the tiniest pinch of fair trade certified sugar for a smooth, crisp finish. Aquafina Sparkling would also be available in multipacks containing two flavors.","We\u2019re also appealing to consumers\u2019 desire for discovery and more premium experiences. Naked Juice launched a line of cold-pressed juices branded Naked Pressed. It provides a new take on fresh taste and the line comes in five varieties. It\u2019s sourced from cold-pressed whole foods and vegetables and is non-GMO project verified.","And Pepsi has introduced 1893 from the Makers of Pepsi-Cola. It capitalizes on the cultural food revolution and is inspired by consumer interest in bold and interesting taste combinations. 1893 is packaged in sleek and premium 12-ounce cans and brings together premium ingredients and more than 100 years of cola making expertise to present a great tasting, unexpectedly bold experience. 1893 is a blend of premium kola nut extract, real sugar, and sparkling water available in two delicious flavors, Original and Ginger Cola. 1893 can be enjoyed as a delicious standalone beverage and is also the perfect complement for cocktails.","In the Quaker business, because consumers are increasingly seeking greater convenience, portability and nutrition in their breakfast, we've introduced Quaker breakfast Flats, crispy baked snack bars that contain delicious ingredients that you can see, like oats, real pieces of food, crunchy nut, flakes and sunflower seeds. Each serving contains 18 grams of whole grains, with less than 200 calories and no artificial flavors or added colors. Quaker Breakfast Flats comes in three delicious flavors, including Cranberry Almond, Banana Honey Nut, and Golden Raisin Cinnamon.","Turning to Frito-Lay, we continue to expand our portfolio with a particular focus on premium offerings and healthy snacking options. So, for example, we\u2019ve expanded our Simply line with the introduction of Simply TOSTITOS Black Bean Chips made from real black beans. It's non-GMO project verified. And Simply TOSTITOS Black Bean Chips offer consumers an excellent source of fiber with 5 grams per 1 ounce serving.","And this Simply line has also introduced Simply TOSTITOS Organic Chunky Medium Salsa and Simply TOSTITOS Organic Black Bean and Corn Mild Salsa. And both salsa varieties are USDA-certified organic.","Sunchips has introduced Veggie Harvest Farmhouse Ranch Flavored Veggie and Wholegrain and Veggie Harvest Tomato, Basil and Cheese Flavored Veggie and Wholegrain. And both are made with real veggies and whole grains.","And Smartfood has introduced Smartfood Delight sea-salted caramel flavored popcorn which offers 50% less fat than compared to regular Smartfood white cheddar popcorn. It offers 100% whole grains and 35 calories per cup.","So as a result of initiatives like this, year-to-date, our Frito-Lay US premium portfolio growth is outpacing the growth in the balance of the portfolio by a factor of more than four times. And we\u2019re extending our value share leadership position in premium salty snacks. So that\u2019s innovation.","The second capability I mentioned is connecting with consumers in the age of social and digital media and the purpose-driven consumer. So this summer, Gatorade is running For the Love of Sports, a national campaign that encourages athletes to think about and hold on to that moment when they were younger and further in love with sport. The multifaceted campaign features a national retail promotion, TV commercials, and a unique cause initiative that encourages consumers to vote for deserving sports-focused organizations to which Gatorade will donate on their behalf.","The retail component includes limited-time-only bottles featuring athletes such as Usain Bolt, Serena Williams, Paul George and April Ross with a special callout of the For the Love of Sports cause initiative. Gatorade has partnered with a 19 sports-focused non-profit organizations, five of which was selected by a roster of athletes featured on the limited time offer bottles. For the remaining 14 organizations, consumers will have the opportunity to vote for their favorite online to receive donations that will help athletes pursue their love of sport.","We\u2019re also driving greater consumption of Quaker Oats in the warmer shoulder season by promoting the concept of overnight oats. We have collaborated with influential foodies to bring consumers quick and easy online tutorials on how to make delicious and nutritious jars of chilled overnight oats perfect for days when you just need a simple, no-cook recipe.","And earlier this year, we kick off Quaker\u2019s very first Bring Your Best Bowl contest, a nationwide search for the next Quaker oatmeal flavor. The Bring Your Best Bowl contest highlights the endless ways to enjoy oatmeal and invited fans across the country to submit their oatmeal creation using two to five ingredients, along with their inspiration, for a chance to win $250,000 and have their combination brought to life as Quaker\u2019s newest oatmeal flavor.","Millions of consumers submitted creations using two to five ingredients, along with their inspiration behind their idea. Three finest flavors are now being developed by Quaker and will be revealed on around National Oatmeal Day, which is October 29. The selected flavors will then be made available in stores across the country for consumers to taste. Then it\u2019s up to America to vote online before the winning flavor is revealed in February of 2017. The grand prize winner will take home the cash price, along with a chance to have his or her oatmeal combination debut on shelves nationwide.","At the same time, Frito-Lay drove greater consumer engagement with the Lay\u2019s brand, by asking Americans to help decide which Lay\u2019s flavor stays and which ones go. Lay\u2019s Flavor Swap campaign asked Americans to unleash the power of their pallets and allowed their voices and their taste buds to be heard. Consumers were invited to visit flavorswap.com to vote for their favorite flavor in each of the four flavor swap matchups. We received millions of customer votes, drove tremendous social media buzz and consumer engagement and strengthened Lay\u2019s brand awareness in regard.","To support trademark Pepsi, this summer, we\u2019re taking the world\u2019s global language, emojis, we\u2019re taking it offline in a visually striking and socially shareable campaign, inviting consumers to Say it with Pepsi from a smirk to a kiss to a wink. This initiative connects cola lovers around the world through a common language that is uniquely and definably Pepsi.","The PepsiCo design and innovation center created more than 600 PepsiMoji designs, all incorporating the essence of Pepsi, including the brand's iconic globe shape and the colors of blue, red and white. Both globally relevant and locally significant PepsiMojis designs come to life across the full Pepsi portfolio and also beyond packaging in unexpected ways such as a fashion collaboration with designer Jeremy Scott.","The limited edition Pepsi with Jeremy Scott Capsule Collection includes six styles of emoji-inspired sunglasses featuring PepsiMoji designs. We have partnerships with famed photographer, Ben Watts, as well as Daniel Arnold, a street photographer with one of today's most enviable Instagram followings. Their work shares the story of #PepsiMoji in the same non-verbal vein as emojis themselves with a quirky, candid and playful tone.","We also have localized experiential content from vending machines in India that dispense Pepsi product adorned with the PepsiMoji design that matches users\u2019 current state of mind to online engagement in Argentina where consumers can create a personalized PepsiMoji design or use PepsiMoji accessories to fashion their selfies. And we also have a free PepsiMoji keyboard app that can be downloaded at the Apple App or Google Play Stores.","Global television and original digital creative also showcase how communicating through PepsiMoji icons can lead to unpredictable and memorable adventures and experiences. And consumers around the world have already begun to experience #PepsiMoji in the US, Australia, Canada, India, Mexico, Russia and Thailand. The global campaign is being featured in more than 100 markets around the world in 2016.","We\u2019re also capitalizing on our partnership with the UEFA Champions League with Global Activation. Every year, the UEFA Champions League brings together the best teams across Europe to compete in the game\u2019s biggest club competition. Fans of the tournament extends far and wide around the world.","That\u2019s why more than 100 markets around the globe, PepsiCo executed programs to realize the benefits of our official sponsorship of the UEFA Champions League. From Argentina to Zambia, we had football fans covered with exciting media-to-shelf campaigns tailored to the local market. For example, in South Africa, Lay\u2019s and Pepsi launched a national #PerfectMatch campaign, reinforcing Lay\u2019s and Pepsi as a snack and beverage combination of choice. In Mexico, we ran a Power of One campaign promoting the concept, Pepsi and Sabritas take you to the UEFA Champions League final. And in Chile, we leveraged the UEFA Champions League partnership with unique packaging and promotions across our Gatorade, Pepsi and Lay\u2019s brand. And we delivered a phenomenal experience of the UEFA Champions League final opening ceremony presented by Pepsi where Alicia Keys gave an incredible performance, ushering a live entertainment era at the soccer final.","The third capability is being a valued growth partner with retailers. And we\u2019ve done this by continuing to drive traffic and basket size through investing and leveraging consumer and shopper insights, constantly finding new ways to become more efficient and coordinated with our retail partner supply chain, and integrating our marketing initiatives with our retailer strategies, including tailored execution of sports, music and other properties.","As a consequence, we tend to be among the top drivers of our customers\u2019 growth. In fact, in the United States, which is our largest market, in the second quarter, we were once again the largest contributor to food and beverage retail growth in the United States, accounting for more growth at retail than all other $5-billion-plus food and beverage manufacturers combined.","The next capability is dialing up end-to-end execution from seed to shelf, making sure our products are fresh and ubiquitously available. We\u2019re doing this by using advanced data and analytics to capture more precise demand signals to inform our supply chain and retooling our supply chain and go-to-market systems to improve service, eliminate out-of-stock and reduce the cycle time from raw material to product on the shelf.","Our initiatives in this area now include expanding our successful GES program from Frito-Lay North America to our beverage businesses.","And the fifth and final focus is fueling margin expansion and capability investments with productivity. Year-to-date, core gross margins expanded 100 basis points and core operating margin expanded 115 basis points even as we continue to invest in A&M, which is up 55 basis points as a percentage of sales.","In addition to marketing, we\u2019ve also continued to invest in critical capabilities like R&D, the establishment of our global design center and the creation of our global e-commerce group. To capture productivity, we are increasingly leveraging automation and advanced technology, as well as the development and deployment of global best practices, all to make our supply chain more efficient.","Let me just give you a few examples from the hundreds of supply chain productivity projects that are currently in flight. We\u2019re implementing automated high-speed packaging lines across the globe, increasing packaging line speeds by up to 50%, while at the same time eliminating the bottleneck to total production lines and significantly reducing labor costs.","To improve our water use efficiency, we have developed and are implementing technology and processes that capture sugar and starch from wastewater streams. The waste sugars and starches are then sold as byproduct. The resulting water stream can then be repurposed for secondary manufacturing uses such as sanitation. This not only generates incremental cash flow and saves money, it also reduces our water usage to advance our sustainability agenda.","Our global operations group is identifying and then lifting and shifting best practices developed by our manufacturing teams around the world. For example, our manufacturing team in Romania developed a refinement to our potato cutting process that can reduce raw potato waste by up to 2%. We\u2019re now implementing this process improvement in other plants around the globe.","We\u2019re capturing significant savings by using advanced logistics planning processes and tools, which enable us to optimize both the mode and routing of material transport. These tools initially developed and deployed in North America have been expanded to nine more countries and are generating 3% to 4% savings in transportation costs.","And in key markets, we\u2019ve also advanced our third-party transportation procurement process by consolidating all transport-origin destination pairs across our food and beverage businesses to present to the market for competitive bids. And we have the opportunity to expand this process to many more markets.","Productivity is also being captured through the implementation of our smart spending program, which is driving meaningful reductions in key discretionary spending areas like travel, facilities and consulting. We\u2019re attacking spending on both rate and volume dimensions.","So, for example, in travel, we\u2019ve adopted much more stringent policies governing mode and class of travel, hotel rate and per diem meal limits, all of which have reduced the rate element of the cost. But we\u2019ve also mandated and encouraged working in ways to reduce the volume element of costs. So, for example, we\u2019ve reduced meeting-related travel by insisting on the use of teleconferencing in place of physical meetings in many instances. And as a result of all of our productivity efforts, we\u2019re capturing significant savings that are delivering meaningful margin improvement and also providing the funding necessary to invest in the long-term health of the business.","Taken together, our top-line-driving commercial activities and our robust productivity agenda are helping us to deliver our financial targets despite continuing macro challenges. We\u2019re aggressively driving innovation, marketing, marketplace execution, productivity to deliver balanced and sustainable performance. We are confident we have the right plans in place and believe we are well-positioned to achieve our 2016 targets, including our increased core constant currency EPS outlook, which we announced this morning.","Just as important, we continue to invest in capabilities and to transform our portfolio to succeed in the dynamic customer and consumer landscapes, with a singular goal of generating sustainable shareholder value for the long term.","With that, let me turn the call over to Hugh Johnston. Hugh?","Hugh Johnston","Thank you, Indra. And good morning, everyone. As Indra mentioned, we\u2019re pleased with the financial results for the first half and we have a positive outlook for our performance for the balance of year. And so, as you saw in this morning's release, we raised our full-year core EPS target to $4.71, which incorporates the following: Underlying core constant currency growth of 9% excluding the impact of de-consolidating Venezuela, a negative 2 percentage point impact of the Venezuela deconsolidation, and a negative 4 percentage point impact from foreign exchange translation based on current market consensus. Our outlooks on the other metrics we provide remain unchanged and are set out in this morning's release.","Our efforts to improve working capital continue to yield positive results. Over the past year, we've improved our working capital cash conversion cycle by more than 10 days. ","For analysts on the call, as you update your models, I ask that you consider the following factors. Foreign exchange translation continues to be a headwind, more heavily skewed to Q3 than Q4. We have more difficult core constant currency operating profit growth comparisons in the second half at Frito-Lay North America. North America Beverages has particularly difficult revenue and operating profit lapse in Q3. We expect low single-digit raw material inflation including the impacts of foreign exchange translation in the second half compared to modest deflation in the first half. We will continue to invest in our business to drive sustainable long-term growth, including an expected increase in advertising and marketing expense as a percentage of sales for the full year. And finally, we will be lapping Venezuela core earnings of approximately $0.06 per share in Q3. ","Taken together, we expect the balance-of-year core EPS growth to be generated entirely in the fourth quarter.","And with that, operator, we\u2019ll take the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Bill Schmitz of Deutsche Bank.","Bill Schmitz","Hi. Good morning.","Indra Nooyi","Morning, Bill.","Bill Schmitz","Hey, can you guys just talk about the sustainability of the great organic growth at Frito and then also the margins which are pretty close to peak? Maybe I\u2019m wrong on this assumption, but I think Frito disproportionately benefited from GES. And I just wondered like kind of what inning we are in baseball terminology on that front and if you still think there\u2019s room for margins to go up there.","Indra Nooyi","Let's talk about the organic growth first, Bill, and then, Hugh, maybe you can chip in on the margin expansion. Look, the macro snack category is a big category. And we\u2019re only playing in the salty snack category expanding into savory snacks. And our goal, if you go back maybe 15 years ago, and we've been consistent in this strategy, we\u2019ve always said, grow the core, add more inch out of the core. We\u2019ve used these words. And that\u2019s what Frito-Lay has been doing, solidify our position in salty snacks and start to step out of the core into other savory snacks and then start to take on other occasions from the overall macro snack category. So all the work we\u2019ve done in demand spaces says that there\u2019s huge opportunity as the world starts to swing more and more towards a liking for savory products. So savory is in and we see amazing opportunities ahead for Frito-Lay to grow its business.","Secondly, Frito-Lay has been a mainstream competitor. We haven't played as much in the premium part of the portfolio. And now, we've gotten our game together in the premium side and we\u2019re seeing growth. As I mentioned in the script, the premium part of the portfolio grew four times faster and we\u2019re just getting started. So we see tremendous opportunities for Frito-Lay to grow in the premium side.","And I\u2019ll make one final comment, Bill, before Hugh to talk about productivity. The great thing about Frito-Lay is that we\u2019ve got great brands. We\u2019ve got a great innovation capability, but we\u2019ve got an amazing pipeline to the customer and consumer. Our DSE system is a well-oiled machine and we can keep expanding the diameter of that pipeline and it\u2019s really our imagination in terms of what products we can innovate with to put through that pipeline.","So with that, Hugh [indiscernible] talk about the margins at Frito.","Hugh Johnston","Yeah, happy to. Good morning, Bill. A couple of comments on margins. And the short answer is, I think Frito-Lay still has lots of margin expansion left in it and can do so in a very defendable, sustainable way.","Why do I say that? Number one, it's to build on the commentary that Indra just made. While we are the market leaders in premium, we are relatively underpenetrated compared to where we are in mainstream, and premium does offer very, very attractive margins, particularly as you scale it over time. So I think there's a significant margin uplift there.","Number two is in the area of GES, the initiative that we've been working on for a number of years where we shorten the supply chain, deliver product to the customer and ultimately to the consumer much more quickly by going essentially direct from plant to store or going from plant to cross-dock to store. The benefit of that is we, obviously, eliminate a lot of excess cost in the system, and as we take that excess cost out, we are reinvesting some back in premium and we\u2019re delivering some to the bottom line. To use the baseball metaphor that you used earlier, we\u2019re really only in about the fourth or fifth inning on GES. GES has a number of years to run. And in fact, I think the GES impact on the financials are likely to be more profound in the future than they have in the past.","And then, the third element to this is this whole area of smart spending. Frito-Lay has absolutely taken the ball and run with smart spending as they always do, but we\u2019re really only right now exploiting four out of what could potentially be about 30 categories in smart spending. So I think smart spending also offers us years of runway to deliver additional productivity.","So if you put all of that together, premium, plus GES plus smart spending and combine that with the fact that Frito-Lay\u2019s strong market position gives it the ability to scale things in ways that none of its competitors can, I think we have many years of margin improvement to come and, frankly, significant margin improvement to come in Frito.","Indra Nooyi","I think we should add that the way we\u2019ve executed smart spending makes sure that we create the breathing room, but reinvest back in capabilities to keep this virtuous circle going. And that\u2019s what\u2019s important with our productivity programs.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley.","Indra Nooyi","Dara, good morning.","Dara Mohsenian","Hi. Good morning. So maybe building on that Frito-Lay margin commentary there, you've seen very strong SG&A leverage if you exclude the increases in A&M spending over the last couple of quarters here, Hugh. As we think about that going forward, is that sustainable going forward? And what's driving that because it is different than what we've generally seen over the past few years? ","Hugh Johnston","Yeah. Happy to answer that, Dara. To me, number one, it is absolutely sustainable. We\u2019re able to continue to drive that. Why are we able to continue to drive it? We have invested significantly in streamlining our supply chains. And remember, with PepsiCo, the supply chain doesn't just have cost in cost of goods. There's also a significant piece of it in the selling systems, which fall into SG&A. That's primarily the DSD system. We\u2019ve got lots of room to be more efficient on that. We\u2019re really very much in the early innings on that.","Number two, we do continue to streamline the organization. And number three, smart spending is having a significant impact on our SG&A spending. So put together, the combination of making DSD more efficient, making the organization more efficient, and leveraging smart pending, you\u2019re seeing improvements in the non-A&M portion of SG&A that are likely to continue to deliver for number of years.","Indra Nooyi","I want to add something to what Hugh said. Dara, we spend a lot of effort, time, and money on putting in an ERP system when we invested in SAP and we started that way back in 2000 and we've been doing that for the last 10 or 15 years. And putting in an ERP system takes time, takes money, and now we\u2019re beginning to see some of the benefits from that ERP implementation. And as we complete a lot of those implementations, we\u2019re able to take out the costs from those implementations and start to realize the benefits. So it\u2019s streamlining the supply chain, the organization, smart spending, and now the increased leverage from the SAP investment.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ali Dibadj of Bernstein.","Indra Nooyi","Good morning, Ali.","Ali Dibadj","Hey, how are you?","Indra Nooyi","Good, thank you.","Ali Dibadj","Good. Hey, I have two questions. One is just trying to get a little bit of a better handle on your earnings guidance raise today. I know, last quarter, a lot of people were kind of thinking about it going up. But this quarter you raise it from 8% to 9%. The top line isn't any different. Productivity is roughly the same. Commodity looks the same. Taxes look unchanged versus last guidance. So you are assuming an acceleration of about 2 points for the back half of the year. Just trying to get a better sense of what gives you that confidence that it's going to go up to 10% for H2. It\u2019s clearly not macros. You knew the Q4 compare. So trying to get a sense there. That\u2019s question one.","Question two, and, Indra, don't take this the wrong way at all. In fact, take it very positively. But there continues to be a real thoughtful set of questions from important investors about your future at Pepsi versus, for example, any future presidential administration. And these are real questions. People are really thinking about it. So can you in any way give us some help in clarifying your future interest between business and politics? You\u2019ve done such an incredible job at Pepsi. People are really kind of asking themselves this question. So anyway you can help clarify that debate, whether you know it or not is out there, would be helpful. Thanks.","Indra Nooyi","So, Hugh, go ahead and answer the first question.","Hugh Johnston","Yeah, happy to, Ali. Thank you for the question. We always start the year with a perspective on the macros and on the world that tends to be conservative. When we give guidance, our intention is always to hit it and perhaps beat it. Now that we\u2019re halfway through the year, I think we\u2019ve seen two things. One, the macros are operating in a consistent steady way, so there has not been a deterioration, which, obviously, is to our benefit relative to our expectations. And number two, we do see significant innovation launching in the back half of the year that we\u2019re quite optimistic about. Some of the things you\u2019ve seen more recently that Indra mentioned, whether it's Mountain Dew Black Label, Aquafina Sparkling, 1893, the Simply line at TOSTITOS down at Frito, or Quaker Breakfast Flats, which are doing terrifically well, and INIT coming out of Quaker as well, when you put together all of that innovation, it will have a disproportionate impact in the back half of the year, which is really our cause for optimism in the balance of year. So that's the driver behind the raise at this point.","Indra Nooyi","Ali, on question number two, in the foreseeable future, next several years, I see myself running PepsiCo.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Swartzberg of Stifel.","Mark Swartzberg","Hello, thanks. Good morning, everyone. Two questions on Latin America, if I could, Indra or Hugh. One is, in the quarter, advertising and marketing in the region was up. I believe for the half, it's flat or maybe even down a bit just by the omission of the reference to being up for the first half. So question one is, do you intend for it to be up for the full year?","And then question two is, if you take these two large markets of Brazil and Mexico, could you give us a bit of an update on your outlook for each of those two regions because, of course, the conditions and your performance there are quite diverged. I'm just looking for how you are looking at your future performance in those two markets.","Indra Nooyi","Yeah. I\u2019ll just talk about the second and Hugh can talk about the A&M issue. Brazil, all of us have the read the news on Brazil. Brazil is going through a difficult time politically and socially. So they have to work through their issues. Mexico is actually doing well. The strength of the dollar, the increased remittances into Mexico doing well, the country actually is one of the brighter stars in the whole Latin American economy. So we feel good about our business in Mexico. Our teams are performing very well in Brazil in a very difficult environment. And I think what we\u2019re focused on right now is stepped-up execution, making sure we have the right value equation and trying to gain share in a difficult environment and that's really what we\u2019re focused on right now. So a tale of two cities.","Hugh Johnston","Yeah. Happy to jump in on your question regarding A&M, Mark. We\u2019re actually up 80 basis points on A&M year-to-date. So happy to close the loop with you one how you\u2019re calculating the number that you came up with. But the number is actually up 80 basis points year-to-date. We\u2019re not going to get into A&M guidance for the full year. But given that we\u2019re up 80 basis points year-to-date, I\u2019d certainly expect it to be up for the year. And I think that's a reasonable expectation for you and all the investors to run with as well.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.","Judy Hong","Thank you. Good morning.","Indra Nooyi","Morning, Judy.","Judy Hong","So I have two questions. One is, obviously, you guys have been very disciplined on the capital allocation front and particularly on the M&A side. And I know that your business is, obviously, performing pretty well right now. But kind of how you are assessing that as it relates to maybe even kind of volatile macro-environment, change in consumer environment and given some of the robust multiples that some of these assets are getting fetched for, do you have any views on looking at divesting some of your assets in this kind of environment?","And then completely unrelated, so you are bringing back Diet Pepsi with aspartame, so just wanted to get your perspective on kind of lessons learned and then as you think about your diet portfolio, the risk of maybe fragmenting the portfolio even further with different kind of offerings and how you manage that. ","Indra Nooyi","I\u2019m going to talk about the second one. And I can also talk about the first. But I'd like Hugh to talk about this because Hugh is my right hand and left hand when it comes to disciplined capital allocation, and so I\u2019d Hugh to talk about that.","Let me talk about Diet Pepsi, Judy. You know what\u2019s interesting? If you go and poll consumers today and read all the social media reports, there\u2019s still trepidation about aspartame. There\u2019s no scientific reason for that, but people are somehow worried about aspartame. And when we launched Diet Pepsi aspartame-free, it\u2019s because there was a huge consumer need for that product. What we did not anticipate is that there is a group of consumers that absolutely loved the original Diet Pepsi. And in the cola category, in particular, because it's been optimized over years, people get incredibly fastidious about their products and don't want to have any changes. So rather than remove the aspartame-free, which is still loved by a lot of people \u2013 in fact, I tell you, when we announced that we\u2019re bringing back the old Diet Pepsi, the few people who thought aspartame-free was going away wrote me some pretty tough emails. And so, there is a very loyal group that is thrilled that we have an aspartame-free following. So we brought back the original Diet Pepsi in addition to keeping the aspartame-free product, so we could serve all consumers with the products that they love. I think that's going to be net positive for us.","Now, let me just say, the marketplace is fragmenting. Forget Pepsi or Diet Pepsi or the cola category, any new category that\u2019s expanding is becoming niche, more fragmented. And that\u2019s why it was important for us to own the distribution system because once you have control over the distribution system, you can pump a lot of niche products through it, all our craft products, all of those are low-volume products. So we have to learn how to handle complexity, not walk away from it.","So, Hugh, talk about capital allocation and the portfolio.","Hugh Johnston","Yeah, sure. Happy to, Judy. Let me just start with a bit of historical perspective on this because, obviously, there's lots of activity in terms of people trying to reshape their portfolios right now. Again, as a reminder, we have about a little over a quarter of our portfolio in nutrition. And then if you add in the better-for-you products, it's really \u2013 it gets upwards to almost half of our portfolio in terms of the balance that we have right now. We\u2019re also, from a developing and emerging markets perspective, about a third exposed to developing and emerging markets. All of that as a result of transactions that we've executed really over the last decade or even more, whether it's Quaker, Gatorade, Tropicana, Naked Juice, Wimm-Bill-Dann, Izze, we've executed a variety of transactions over the last ten-plus years in order to get the portfolio into a place where it could consistently deliver performance. And frankly, that's what you've seen, is this portfolio now, regardless of economic cycle, regardless of consumer sentiment, regardless of consumer trends in chips, seems to be capable and has been capable delivering good, strong performance throughout all of those shifts.","As we look at things going forward, what we\u2019ve said is, we intend to expend something on the order of $500 million a year in tuck-in acquisitions. As those good opportunities emerge, we look at them and we look at them through two lenses. One is a strategic lens around, does it make sense relative to where we think the consumer is going, and second is, obviously, a financial lens, is this good for our shareholders. And you can count on us to continue to do that because we think that's the right way to think about M&A on a go-forward basis.","I will also tell you that we look at everything. We\u2019ve looked at everything that has transacted and probably every company that hasn't transacted. And if something transacts and we\u2019re not a part of it, you can very reasonably assume it's because we didn't want to be.","So the result of that is, we feel like we\u2019re operating from a position of strength. We feel like we\u2019re in a position right now where we\u2019ll continue to look at things, we\u2019ll do things if they make sense, but the guidance that we\u2019ve given right now is the guidance that makes sense and that's the way we\u2019re thinking about it going forward.","Some investors talk about the notion of, sell when everyone's buying and buy when everyone\u2019s selling, we tend to be good stewards of capital and we follow that maxim fairly closely.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Caroline Levy of CLSA.","Indra Nooyi","Caroline, good morning.","Caroline Levy","Good morning, Indra and Hugh. Thank you. Actually just to follow up on what you said, Hugh, for clarification, I guess Judy's question had been around a willingness to sell anything and I think you said that when prices are high you are a potential seller. Is that right?","Indra Nooyi","Only if it makes sense to the portfolio, Judy \u2013 or Caroline, I\u2019m sorry. Only if it makes sense to the portfolio.","Caroline Levy","Okay. So then my question was around Diet Pepsi and the Pepsi franchise overall because, Indra, you gave this stunning number that you drive more growth for retailers than the next five companies, large companies combined. In the case of Pepsi and Diet Pepsi, that has not been the case from what I can see. And so, how do you maintain your shelf space, how do you think about strategically moving those in a different direction? Is it through fragmentation or is there something else you need to do because that seems to be one area where you are really losing share?","Indra Nooyi","Okay. I think, Caroline, and we talked about it in the Q1 earnings call, it is critically important that all of you change your frame of reference in the beverage market from cola to CSDs to LRBs. 30 years ago, it was colas. 25 years ago, it was CSDs. 15 years ago, it was CSDs. It's been LRB for the last decade or so. And I think the sooner we can shift our frame of reference, the better it is because just beating a category that is in secular decline, just beating that all the time is not a game to play, that's not a game that is going to guarantee good results. If we play this rich LRB game, multi-category, placing the bets where the growth is and where the consumer is going, I think we\u2019re better off. So my request to you and all of you who are tracking the company in this category, expand your aperture. LRB is the game to play. That\u2019s the game we\u2019re playing and we watch LRB share very, very carefully. That\u2019s the right strategy for any company.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rob Ottenstein of Evercore.","Indra Nooyi","Morning, Rob.","Rob Ottenstein","Good morning. And thank you very much. Could you give us a little bit more sense on the North American beverage business? It looks like you've got about 2% price mix. Can you give us a little sense about how much of that is headline pricing, how much is channel mix, category mix just so we have a better idea of what's going on there?","Hugh Johnston","Yeah. A couple of things on that, Rob. This is Hugh. Number one, there was more pricing in CSDs than there was in non-carbs. Not a surprise on that. Number two, about half-and-half split between rate and mix. So very comfortable from that perspective. Obviously, our single strategy has been working particularly well and it's giving us what we think is sustainable mix lift [ph] benefit, with lots of runway left to go on it. So, really, the pricing environment right now, is very good. It's very healthy. We feel terrific about where pricing is in North America.","Indra Nooyi","So thank you all for your questions. And in closing, I just want to say to you that we\u2019re pleased with our results for the first half of the year. We believe we have the plans in place to deliver our targets for 2016. We appreciate the trust you\u2019ve placed in us with your investment. We\u2019re absolutely committed to increasing the value of your investment. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you.

Your lines have been placed on listen-only until the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Today's call is being recorded and will be archived at www.pepsico.com.","It is now my pleasure to introduce Mr. Jamie Caulfield, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Caulfield, you may begin.","Jamie Caulfield","Thank you. Joining me on the call today are Indra Nooyi, PepsiCo's Chairman and CEO; and Hugh Johnston, PepsiCo's CFO. We'll lead off with prepared comments and then turn to Q&A.","As we begin the call, it's important to note the following. We will make forward-looking statements on this call. Any forward-looking statement inherently involves risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from current predictions and expectations. Information on such risks can be found in today's earnings release and our most recent Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings. In addition, we will discuss results using non-GAAP measures and you can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations on our website under the Investors section under Events and Presentations tab.","As a reminder, beginning this quarter, PepsiCo reported its realigned segments. We provided retrospectively revised summary segment results, reflecting the company\u2019s new organization structure in early August. As we covered in this morning\u2019s release, we have changed the accounting for Venezuela operations and consequently will no longer consolidate their operating results beginning in the fourth quarter. Further details on this can be found in today\u2019s earnings release and the soon to be released third quarter Form 10-Q filing. ","And now it is my pleasure to introduce Indra Nooyi.","Indra Nooyi","Thank you, Jamie, and good morning everyone. Despite a continued choppy global macro environment, we are happy to report another great quarter at PepsiCo. ","In the third quarter, organic revenue grew 7.4%, with Global Snacks up 10% and Global Beverages up 5%. Core gross margin improved by 120 basis points. Core constant currency operating profit increased 12% and core constant currency EPS increased 14%.","Based on our year-to-date performance and our outlook for the balance of the year, we are increasing our full year 2015 core constant currency EPS growth outlook to 9%. Also, we now plan to return approximately $9 billion to shareholders through dividends and buybacks with share buybacks at the high-end of the range we had guided to. Hugh will go into additional details of our guidance later. ","But let me now comment briefly on our results. We again had very strong results in North America, and this comprises over 60% of our net revenue and approximately two-thirds of our core division operating profit year-to-date. ","North America Beverage had a terrific quarter in which we grew our organic volume by 3%, organic revenue by 5%, and core constant currency operating profit by 10%. During the quarter, we held value shares in liquid refreshment beverages and gained value share across important sub-categories including ready-to-drink tea and water. ","Frito-Lay North America delivered another quarter of solid results with organic revenue growth of 2% and core constant currency operating profit growth of 7%. Core operating margins increased by 155 basis points, reflecting execution of price-pack architecture management and ongoing productivity initiatives across the value chain. ","In Quaker Foods North America, organic revenue increased 2% and core constant currency operating profit increased 1.5%, and operating profit performance is noteworthy given the fact that they are lapping a divestiture gain in the prior year. Quaker has gained value share in both hot and read-to-eat cereal, both in the quarter and year-to-date. ","And we are proud to report that during the third quarter, PepsiCo was the largest contributor to US retail sales growth among all food and beverage manufacturers with over $400 million of retail sales growth in all major channels. This was double the next largest contributor to growth. Notably, North American beverages was the key driver of US retail sales growth within PepsiCo and the largest contributor to US retail sales growth on a standalone basis. ","On a year-to-date basis, PepsiCo has contributed over $1.1 billion of retail sales growth in all major channels, which again was the largest contributor to US retail sales growth among all food and beverage manufacturers, and this is really 2.5 times the next largest contributor to growth. ","Now turning to our international market. In our developing and emerging markets, although we continue to face volatile and challenging macros in a number of these markets, we\u2019re managing what we can control to stay competitive in this market \u2013 in this marketplace, and we continue to see good growth in a number of these markets. For example, our business in Turkey achieved double-digit organic revenue growth, Mexico achieved high-single-digit organic revenue growth, and Egypt achieved mid-single-digit organic revenue growth. ","And as we mentioned last quarter, in each of our earnings calls, we will provide an update on our big initiatives to drive our operating and financial performance, brand building innovation, execution, productivity, and cash returns to shareholders. ","On our Q2 earnings call, we talked about innovation. Today, we are focused on productivity, which is critical to succeed in today\u2019s challenging environment. With volatile macros globally and increasingly competitive landscape with digital technologies disrupting many aspects of our business, productivity has never been more important. And as all of you know well, productivity enables current financial performance and provides investment funding to sustain growth into the future. When we think of productivity, we think both in terms of efficiency, which is getting the same result using fewer resources and effectiveness getting a greater result using the same resources. Our productivity initiatives to-date have been largely focused on efficiency and we have had pretty good results. We delivered $3 billion in productivity between 2012 and 2014, and we\u2019re on track to deliver the first year of our current five-year, $5 billion program that we started in 2015, and this productivity has been supported in large part by investments we made in technology, starting with our implementation of SAP in the early 2000s, and this allowed us to establish a common operating language and to standardize operating metrics across the globe. ","We also adopted an operating model that has reduced plans and layers in the organization and has promoted the sharing of best practices around the world. We also established truly global functions in operations, procurement, IT, HR, and finance as well as very lean category horizontals that are driving greater capability building, harmonization and efficiency in new product development and global brand management. ","Together, our technology investments and operating model are allowing us to leverage our global scale to a much greater extent. With these foundational elements in place, we have made progress in multiple areas. ","First, increased automation. We have installed packaging automation across approximately a third of our snacks plant worldwide enabling us to reduce packaging label costs in these facilities by at least 50%. In Frito-Lay North America, for example, approximately 65% of all production utilizes fully automated packaging. In Mexico, we updated the majority of our packaging tubes with high speed equipment over the last few years, enabling us to increase throughput by approximately 40%. Across the Middle East, we installed automated palletizing and warehousing technologies in many key markets, resulting in improvement in labor productivities since 2013. ","Second, we are restructuring our go-to-market systems. Since the success of our Perry, Georgia pilots in 2009, we have expanded our geographic enterprise solutions or GES as we call them at Frito-Lay North America to a total of 11 projects, which are now at various stages of deployment across locations in both the US and Canada. The consolidation of these plants and distribution networks will result in scale that enables economic implementation of automated order picking, the reduction of distribution centers, and a highly efficient direct-to-store delivery system directly from our plant. This model is also being applied to the North American beverages business, where they are combining large format and small format routes on the same trucks. The plan is to eliminate geographic overlap resulting in 15% fewer routes. ","Third, we are optimizing our global manufacturing footprint. Since 2010, we have reduced the number of company-owned beverage plants in North America by 23%. At the same time, we\u2019ve increased our capacity utilization by 20%. In Europe, in the past three years, we closed six plants across our beverage and dairy businesses, decreasing our footprint by 7% and generating more than $20 million of annual savings and further increasing our capacity utilization.","Finally, in shared services. We\u2019re increasingly leveraging share service centers and selectively outsourcing financial transaction processing, accounting, reporting and other back office tasks. To-date the program has been executed in 18 countries, reducing costs, while improving analytical capabilities and service levels and streamlining IT infrastructure. ","Our efficiency journey is in no way done. In addition to the major supply chain productivity initiatives, we have also embarked on our version of zero-based budgeting, something we call smart spending. You know, we studied ZBB in great detail and we realized that implementing it as currently designed, ran the risk of starting resources to drive topline growth initiatives. Our version of ZBB or smart spending as we call it focuses on rightsizing our operating expenses, now that we are beginning to see benefits from our technology investments and global coordination, while ring-fencing top line driving resources to focus more on deriving additional effectiveness from them. And this is a balanced approach, one that focuses both on a relentless drive for efficiency but preserves investments to drive top line growth, which brings me to our focus on increasing the effectiveness of our spent.","We have expanded our view of productivity to ensure greater effectiveness across every element of spending. Just to give you a few examples, we\u2019re sharpening our capabilities in revenue management to drive greater effectiveness of promotion and other trade spending. We\u2019re building the required tools and training to realize a greater return on our advertising and marketing investments. And we are developing new product platforms that can scale across multiple countries rapidly. And all of this is being enabled and accelerated by our lean global category structures. We believe our approach is working and driving meaningful tangible results. Over the past three years ending in 2014, we have realized an average of $1 billion of annual productivity savings. Net revenue per employee is up 10%, operating profit per employee is up 9%. This quarter marks our 13th consecutive quarter of gross margin expansion.","And from year-end 2011, Capex as a percent of net revenues went down from 4.9% to 4.1% on a rolling four quarter basis. Importantly, these achievements have contributed to strong free cash productivity and core net ROIC improvement. Since the beginning of 2013 to the third quarter of 2015, we have generated cumulative core free cash flow excluding certain items of more than $22 billion which represents 115% of core net income over the same time period. And core net ROIC has increased by 380 basis points to 19.1% at the end of the third quarter 2015 compared to 15.3% at end year 2012. Ultimately, we believe our approach creates a virtual cycle with productivity fueling the reinvestment and transformation necessary for sustainable top and bottom line growth and shareholder value creation.","With this, let me turn the call over to Hugh Johnston. Hugh?","Hugh Johnston","Thank you Indra and good morning everyone. First, let\u2019s discuss guidance. As Indra mentioned based on the strength of our year-to-date performance and our outlook for the remainder of the year, we\u2019ve increased our full-year core constant currency EPS growth target to 9% from 8% previously, which includes the expected fourth quarter impact of the Venezuela accounting change. Additional details regarding the change in accounting for Venezuela can be found in our third quarter earnings release and in the soon to be released 10-Q. Our other targets remain unchanged. For the full-year 2015, we continue to expect mid-single digit organic revenue growth, core operating margin expansion as organic top line growth and productivity should offset negative geographic mix and commodity inflation which incorporates the impact of transaction-related foreign exchange headwinds, and approximately $1 billion in productivity savings.","Below the division operating line, we continue to expect corporate cost to be lower, a core tax rate of approximately 25% and a reduced share count. We now expect foreign exchange translation to negatively impact net revenue and core earnings per share growth by approximately 10 and 11 percentage points respectively based on current market consensus rates. Taking our 2014 core EPS of $4.63 and applying our guidance and current market consensus of foreign exchange impact implies 2015 core EPS of approximately $4.54. As you model out the fourth quarter, I\u2019d ask you to consider the following. First we expect foreign exchange translation to have an approximate 8 point unfavorable impact on fourth quarter net revenue growth and an approximate 8 point unfavorable impact on fourth quarter core EPS growth based on current market consensus rates. Venezuelan operations contributed $0.03 to core EPS in the prior year quarter. Second, the North American beverages business will face a difficult core constant currency operating profit growth comparison.","Below the division operating profit line, net interest expense is expected to increase in the fourth quarter versus last year, driven by higher interest rates and higher debt balances. From a cash flow perspective, we continue to expect full-year free cash flow excluding certain items of more than $7 billion. We expect our capital allocation discipline to continue to drive core ROIC improvement. This is building on the steady progress we\u2019ve made in ROIC with core net ROIC up 380 basis points from 2012 to 19.1% through the third quarter of 2015 on rolling a four quarter basis. We expect shareholder cash returns to be very strong. We now expect to return approximately $9 billion to shareholders in 2015, approximately $4 billon in dividends and $5 billion in share repurchases. Our current repurchase outlook is at the high end of the range we provided last quarter. Our annualized dividend is now $2.81 and approximate 60% payout ratio based on 2014 core EPS. This represents the 43rd consecutive year of annual dividend increases and our annualized dividends per share have grown at a 10% compound annual rate over the past ten years.","So to summarize, our core constant currency earnings per share outlook for 2015 has improved from our last call and free cash flow, disciplined capital allocation and returning cash to our shareholders remain top priorities for the Company. With that operator we\u2019ll take the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of John Faucher of JP Morgan.","Indra Nooyi","Good morning John","John Faucher","Good morning Indra. You talked about some of the markets that are doing well and you know I think the more -- where the street is really concerned here is in terms of some of the markets where you know Russia, Brazil, where we think there is potentially a little more macro impact and given the fact that you guys are about four weeks into the quarter, can you talk about whether or not you\u2019ve seen some of these macro shifts have an impact on the consumer and how should we think about those markets going forward?","And then a quick question for Hugh, which is, if we look at this, it seems as though Venezuela is about 3% this year on a run rate basis of earnings, you\u2019re covering about 50 basis points in Q4, so should we think about the balance coming out through the first three quarters of next year? Thanks.","Indra Nooyi","John, global macros are volatile as I mentioned in my prepared comments. And whenever there is volatility in the marketplace, the consumer behavior does reflect some of this volatility. The good news is that, we\u2019re not luxury items or high ticket items; we are basic food and beverage items. So, we see a slowdown but not significant. Having said that, I think the most important thing is we have a portfolio that we can play between developed, and developing, and emerging markets, and somehow we balance the portfolio to deliver the results, but the macro volatility is here to stay.","Hugh Johnston","And then, John to answer your question regarding Venezuela, as you mentioned, it\u2019s worth $0.03 in that we\u2019re lapping right now going into the fourth quarter, and we are covering that as a part of our 9% guidance. For 2016, we will get to guidance in February; we won\u2019t discuss that on this call. What I will share with investors is, in 2015, Venezuela is worth about $0.10, so that\u2019s what we will be lapping as we get into 2016, but rather than get into one-off guidance in 2016, we\u2019ll provide comprehensive guidance on the February call.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley.","Dara Mohsenian","So, first just a detailed question for Hugh, do you guys have an extra week in 2016? And if you do, how much will that add to EPS? And then, the real question is hoping for an update on the potato chip revenue management program at FLNA. How is it trending so far versus expectations, how is it being received by consumers and your retail partners? And going forward from here, should we expect volume growth to improve sequentially or will it really take another couple of quarters before we cycle the program to see sustained volume improvement? Thanks.","Hugh Johnston","So Dara on the 53rd week, the answer is yes. We do have a 53rd week ever fifth or sixth year depending on how the days fall. And 2016 will be a 53-week year. As I mentioned on John\u2019s question as well, in terms of guidance and impact on that, we\u2019ll get to that on the February call, it\u2019s not time to handle that right now.","Indra Nooyi","And on the PC revenue management, Dara, we\u2019re beginning to see all of the work we did on that revenue management program beginning to take root. It\u2019s clearly helped the profitability because it\u2019s really price pack architecture to manage the SKUs on the shelves which were really getting much too complex. And we\u2019re beginning to see the positive impact of all of the work we did over the last three quarters. Volume growth is beginning to come back, and clearly profitability has been helped by the whole revenue management program.","Hugh Johnston","In addition to that there -- one of the goals of the program was to increase the number of households that are buying Lays by virtue of recognizing the smaller households in the United States and in fact that impact is happening. So we feel good about the strategy as well as the revenue management implications.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane of Bank of America. ","Bryan Spillane","Hey, good morning, everyone.","Indra Nooyi","Hey, Bryan. ","Bryan Spillane","I guess just two questions related to the comments on productivity. I think, first, if I look at currency or constant currency operating profit growth, it\u2019s about $700 million of profit this year. So could you just give us some context in terms of how much of that profit growth has come from productivity dropping, how much of it is just the natural leverage in the business and maybe some context in terms of rate of reinvestment this year?","Hugh Johnston","Yeah, Bryan, as always, this is a challenging question to answer, because in a company with PepsiCo\u2019s complexity both geographically and from a channel and product perspective, isolating one of the variables is a little bit tricky. What I would say is this, the combination of the higher productivity in addition to that, the benefits that we are relatively getting on commodities and then comparing that to the natural rate of inflation for PepsiCo\u2019s portfolio of 4% and comparing that to the level of fixed cost leverage we get through P&L, 60 basis points for the quarter we think is a good number for the year. We\u2019ve been delivering good leverage and the balancing act of much are we reinvesting back in R&D and reinvesting back in A&M, again it\u2019s a bit difficult to isolate the variable. Suffice it to say, we are investing meaningful amounts in R&D and A&M in order to drive the top line growth that you are seeing.","Indra Nooyi","And we have new tools and technologies as we get more digital tools that are disrupting many parts of our business. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Caroline Levy of CLSA.","Caroline Levy","Thanks so much. Good morning. I wonder if you could just take us through the US beverage environment in a little bit more detail, talking about how carbonated soft drinks are doing, particularly diets versus specifics, you mentioned how strong tea is, but -- and how that shift in categories affect margins going forward?","Indra Nooyi","Good morning, Caroline. The US beverage environment is pretty good actually. There is good portfolio management happening in the industry and I would say that the CSD market continues to be under pressure from a volume perspective. From a value perspective, because of good revenue management and good pricing in the industry, the value numbers are way better than the volume numbers. But clearly the big story here is non-carbs and the non-carbs are really what\u2019s driving all of the growth in the whole industry. And again, in non-carbs, profitability varies. I mean, it ranges all the way from bottled water to other products that have higher profitability. So I think the challenge at every point in the North American beverage business is really two-fold if you want to think about it. How do you play the game across the portfolio between CSDs and non-carbs and within CSDs how do you alternate between a Mountain Dew versus a Pepsi versus a Kickstart, so that\u2019s one balancing game that we have to go through.","But the second part is also channel-wise, how much emphasis you play on single serves and driving single-serve sales which have got a different profit profile than large pack or multi-serve products. So the challenge in this industry, it\u2019s a very complex, very big industry. It\u2019s, how do you play this whole game intelligently. Now, I will tell you one thing, the fact that we own the bulk of our bottling systems and the fact that most of our bottlers are very aligned, we have very good set of bottling partners, actually allows us to be a lot more nimble and effect in the market, the right pricing strategies, revenue management strategies and get the right innovation into the marketplace. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.","Judy Hong","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Indra Nooyi","Good morning, Judy.","Judy Hong","So, Indra, you talked about the focus on increasing the promotion of spending effectiveness as part of the productivity indicatives. I was hoping to get a little bit more color just in terms of where do you think PepsiCo is in the context of what the industry is doing. We\u2019ve been hearing this trade spend effectiveness programs for a while, so how is it different this time? Is it more evolutionary versus revolutionary and then some of the categories that you think are kind of life for this to continue within your portfolio. And then, Hugh, just a follow up on Venezuela. So it seems like Venezuela probably added about 1 to 2 points to revenue growth, so can you just clarify or quantify the revenue impact and then in the fourth quarter as you deconsolidate Venezuela, how much of the organic revenue growth is that risk in terms of taking that out of your P&L.","Indra Nooyi","Yeah, Judy, again, I don\u2019t want to get into too much details, because now you are asking us to get into what really drives PepsiCo, but I will just roughly tell you that, you have to look at trade spending management and revenue management together, because in a way the two of them are how we manage the shelf. And as the digital tools get better and better and more tools are available to get more visibility into consumer interaction of different packages, the way we do revenue management improves. So if we look at Frito-Lay\u2019s recent program on Project Drive, that was a trade spending and revenue management program because in a way, the way we manage the packaging there improves the profitability of the retailers in addition to improving the whole spending effectiveness.","So I think the pace at which we move in this area is a function of the tools available for us to have more visibility into consumer buying decisions and how we do self-assortment. It\u2019s a journey. We are investing more and more in tools, training, capabilities and we are making sure everybody gets trained in these tools, developing market tools, emerging market tools, developed market tools, what we do with modern trade, what do we do with traditional trade, it is all about the training. It\u2019s a journey, Judy, and it\u2019s going to take a few years before we are fully done. But as these tools roll out, we\u2019ll start to see the benefits roll into the P&L and that\u2019s what you saw in Frito-Lay. The Project Drive was a great example of it. And even our North American beverage profitability in a way is a function of how they are intelligently managing both their product portfolio and trade spending. So with that, let me turn to Hugh to talk about your second question about Venezuela.","Hugh Johnston","Yeah, Judy, in terms of year-to-date, Venezuela is worth about 2 points in our numbers. And in terms of going forward into the fourth quarter, when we talk about organic revenue growth, we are treating the deconsolidation as a structural change, so we will basically talk organic ex-Venezuela. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer of Cowen & Company.","Vivien Azer","Hi, good morning.","Indra Nooyi","Good morning, Vivian.","Vivien Azer","My question has to do with your European segment and specifically your beverage volumes. I recognize that you are lapping a slightly easier compare. But it does look like your volumes inflected nicely, so I was hoping you could offer some color on the drivers of that. Thank you.","Indra Nooyi","We have a largely zero-calorie portfolio in Europe and parts of the country, parts of the region did well and there were parts where places like Russia we focused more on value than we did on volume, because in those markets we\u2019ve got extraordinary inflation and we\u2019ve got to make sure your price through to get the value up. In France, Germany, Turkey, we had very good beverage strength. And in countries like Russia, because of inflation, the market was tough. But those are all again, I come back to this notion of the portfolio management. In today\u2019s volatile environment, the biggest capability we, as a company, have to develop and we have is how we manage the portfolio intelligently to deliver a set of numbers for the company overall. And again managing the company for value share within a volume corridor and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been doing globally at this point.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line Ali Dibadj of Bernstein.","Ali Dibadj","Hey, guys.","A - Indra Nooyi","Good morning, Ali.","Ali Dibadj","Hi. So I have two basic questions for you. One is when you look at your organic sales numbers there seems to be two things that are a little unexpected or weird. One is obviously that 33% Latin America pricing number and the second is the strong 3% volumes in NAB. So, on the former, can you just give us a little bit more detail about where that comes from? Was that really all Venezuela, how much was Argentina and when you deconsolidate Venezuela what does that pricing specifically number look like if Venezuela isn't in there? On the NAB, good volume numbers, it sounds like a lot of that was stills. Can you give us a breakdown on volume growth between stills and CSDs, so that's question one?","The second question is --","Indra Nooyi","Let's get the question one answered. Go ahead.","Hugh Johnston","So Ali, two things on that. Ex-Venezuela, Latin America was up 9% and number two, regarding your question on breakdown on volumes, the 3% of overall volume growth, CSDs were down 1.9, non-carbs or stills as you call them were up almost 10%. And then within CSDs, regulars were down 1 and diets were down 6.5.","Ali Dibadj","Okay. So super helpful on that one. In terms of the second question, love to hear how you guys are thinking about the potential implications of ABI\/SAB to the PepsiCo business. So PepsiCo obviously including the Brazil bottling, what might happen there, how are you guys thinking about that, because you\u2019re joint purchasing with ABI. This is no longer kind of rumors or speculations. You guys have clearly done, you usually do good analytics, good math on thinking through the implications here for you guys?","Indra Nooyi","Great question, but we don't comment or speculate on these matters, as it relates to specific bottlers, customers and suppliers.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Schmitz from Deutsche Bank.","Bill Schmitz","A couple of questions on the US, just to sort of drill a little deeper on some previous questions. So do you still think the US bottling assets are strategic long-term assets and how far are you from having them fully optimized?","Indra Nooyi","Bill, as I mentioned earlier on my comments regarding North American beverages, today more than ever, the portfolio is shifting to non-carbs. Innovation is becoming more fragmented and the life cycle of innovation is being shorter and the trade becoming more and more complex. Having control of the manufacturing and distribution systems becomes critical. ","And when we have independent bottlers, having them aligned is even more critical and I'll tell you based on our recent North American bottling meeting, Al Carey and the team did a brilliant job and the system is more aligned than I've ever seen before. So I think these bottling assets are strategic and as I said earlier, this is a journey.","As the marketplace evolves, we have to keep evolving and optimizing our bottling assets. We've done a lot with the manufacturing assets. As we mentioned, the capacity \u2013 we\u2019ve taken out 23% of the capacity, utilization is up. We\u2019re looking at consolidating large format and small format routes and reducing the number of routes by 15%.","As equivalent of GES or Geo Box as our beverage guys call it, get implemented. We too start thinking about different ways to leverage the distribution system. So it\u2019s a journey and it\u2019s a very, very good team and they are doing the right things to focus on revenue management, trade spending segments, marketing, innovation, training the portfolio, intelligent pricing. So I think we are in a good place in North American beverages.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Grundy of Jefferies.","Kevin Grundy","Indra, so my question to come back to North American beverages, specifically carbonated soft drinks. So profit growth in NAB has been outstanding this year. From a market share perspective, Indra, you\u2019ve often spoken in the past about managing that market share within a corridor. And as I look at the Nielsen data, it looks like you guys have been losing share within CSDs, not just on a four-week, 12-week, but over the past year and I'm just curious, number one, if you're comfortable with the share position now or if at some point, more investment is needed here whether that's innovation, whether this is trade spend, et cetera. So any comments there with respect to your carbonated soft drink trends here will be helpful? Thank you.","Indra Nooyi","We're happy with where we are right now and the portfolio is working Kevin. That's the most important thing. When the marketplace starts shifting more towards non-carbs, we\u2019ve got to make sure that we step up our investment in non-carbs, our innovation in non-carbs, which is really what we've been doing. ","And in case of CSDs, there has been a small share loss, but if you look across the portfolio, margin is doing exceedingly well. We are doing very well in small format. Anyway to the question, I think that we've really been working the portfolio to make sure that talent management, price back management, trade management, innovation management and overall portfolio management work to deliver overall LRB share increase.","And that's really what we are focused on. I think focusing just on CSDs is actually a thing of the past and I would strongly suggest everybody looks at total LRB, because that's the right way to look at the market going forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Marshall of Barclays.","Bill Marshall","Now, your last comment notwithstanding, I do have a question on carbonated soft drinks, just from a qualitative perspective, obviously you\u2019ve made the switch to aspartame-free on diet Pepsi. So I\u2019m just curious what the consumer reaction has been to the move?","And then broadening that out into other sweetener technology and you\u2019ve used Stevia in some cases, just where we should look at how this is developing and how the consumer is reacting to these new products? Thank you","Indra Nooyi","Bill, it's too early to tell you exactly how the consumer is reacting, because our belief is that you\u2019ve got to wait a few cycles to see what the purchase repeat adoption cycle is. So at the end of Q4, when we go into next year, we might be able to give you some more information, but at this point, it's way too early to talk about how aspartame-free is performing in the marketplace.","And in terms of new sweetness, all the information is out there in the marketplace. We've been talking about it. I don't see a zero calorie naturally sweetened CSD on the horizon in the next few years, but if you want to talk about low-calorie naturally sweetener beverages, I think combination of sweeteners, tools, techniques, we have probably the best portfolio of development tools to enable that to happen. ","It may not always be in CSDs, but it will be a part of it in non-carbs, part in CSDs and you\u2019ll start seeing these innovations roll out as we speak. I mean, we\u2019ve rolled out a couple of products this year in Manzanita Sol and Mug with somebody\u2019s tools. You\u2019ll start seeing more of that as next year rolls by.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Powers of UBS.","Steve Powers","So Frito-Lay volumes were a bit better and I think some investors fear they might be just based on the standard data trends. So is there any light you can shine on that related to maybe sell-in versus sellout timing or strength in outside the track channels for example, foodservice, that's my first question.","And then, Indra, longer term, picking up on your commentary surrounding productivity, as you look forward over the next four years of your current program, how do you see that balance between efficiency and effectiveness contributing to the next 4 billion? Is it split, is it skewed one way or another and then within the efficiency bucket, do the drivers remains supply chain restructuring and smart spending or are there other initiatives on the horizon that we should be thinking about? Thanks.","Indra Nooyi","In fact, I'm going to take the productivity question. I am going to have Hugh talk about the Frito-Lay volume issue. I think on productivity going forward, the next four years, again year-by-year, it varies. As all of these programs, you can measure the efficiency program more directly on productivity and the effectiveness you see it more on the top line and you see it in pricing. That's how you get the pricing is a function of how we implement all of the effectiveness programs. ","So it\u2019s much harder to isolate the effectiveness part of productivity, but I will tell you the way we measure it is in top line growth and the kind of pricing we get, so that's where it should manifest itself and now the algorithm is talking about mid-single-digit revenue growth and given today\u2019s extremely turbulent environment, I think effectiveness oriented productivity program is what\u2019s going to allow us to deliver that mid-single digit growth. Let's talk about Frito-Lay volumes. Hugh, if you want to take that one?","Hugh Johnston","Yes. Steve, happy to. Absolutely, we did see volumes in Frito-Lay a little bit stronger than I think what analysts were generally expecting and what they were interpreting based off of the scan data. I think the reason for that is convenient source. We\u2019re particularly strong in Frito-Lay. We saw volume growth in C stores for the quarter of 4.5% and that channel tends to be tracked a little bit less closely. It's about 20% of Frito\u2019s business. So I think that probably accounts for the data difference. ","More broadly, I think the important point here is project drive, which has obviously suppressed volumes to some degree is going on very successfully. As Indra mentioned earlier, from a revenue management perspective, it's yielding the results we expected and in addition to that and strategically more importantly, the household penetration on Lays is going up and frankly that was the goal of project drive and it is working for us quite successfully. Obviously, we've got a couple of more quarters of overlaps to work through in terms of the volume impacts, but we feel very, very good about project drive right now.","Indra Nooyi","So with that, thank you all for your questions. In closing, let me reiterate that we are pleased with our year-to-date results. We are confident that our plans are working and that we will deliver on our financial targets for 2015. I want to thank you all for your time and questions this morning and more importantly for the confidence you\u2019ve placed in us. Have a great day.","Operator","Thank you.

Your lines have been placed on listen-only until the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Today\u2019s call is being recorded and will be archived at www.pepsico.com.","It is now my pleasure to introduce Mr. Jamie Caulfield, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Caulfield, you may begin.","Jamie Caulfield","Thank you, operator. With me today are Indra Nooyi, PepsiCo\u2019s Chairman and CEO and Hugh Johnston, PepsiCo\u2019s CFO. We'll lead off today\u2019s call with a review of our third quarter performance and full year 2018 outlook and then we'll move on to Q&A.","Before we begin, please take note of our cautionary statement. This conference call includes forward-looking statements, including statements regarding 2018 guidance based on currently available information.","Forward-looking statements inherently involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those predicted. Statements made on this conference call should be considered together with cautionary statements and other information contained in today\u2019s earnings release and in our most recent periodic reports filed with the SEC.","When discussing our financial results on today\u2019s call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP measures, which exclude certain items, such as the impact of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and other tax related items, foreign exchange translation and acquisitions, divestitures, structural and other changes from our reported results. You should refer to the Glossary and other attachments to this morning\u2019s earnings release and to the Investors section of PepsiCo\u2019s website under the Events and Presentations tab to find full explanations and reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures.","Now, it\u2019s my pleasure to introduce Indra Nooyi.","Indra Nooyi","Thank you, Jamie and good morning everyone. Thank you all for joining us. As most of you know, we announced in August that I'm stepping down as CEO of PepsiCo after 12 years in the role effective tomorrow. And so today will be my final conference call with you. Actually my 75th and final, if you also include the calls I've participated in as CFO.","After we complete the primary business at hand, reviewing the results and outlook and taking your questions. I'd like to ask for your patience and allow me to make a few concluding remarks at the end of the call.","So, moving on to business; for the quarter we generated $16.5 billion of net revenue driven by 4.9% organic revenue growth and delivered core earnings per share of $1.59, a 9% increase on a core constant currency basis. Overall, we are pleased with our operating and financial performance in the quarter.","The organic revenue growth represents another quarter of sequential acceleration and the highest rate of organic revenue growth in 12 quarters. The majority of our businesses again perform well, but particularly strong performances by our international sectors and solid performance by Frito-Lay in North America.","And while North American beverages profit performance was impacted by inflation and a double-digit increase in advertising expense, the sector posted 2.5% organic revenue growth with a good balance between volume growth and net price realization.","Frito-Lay North America delivered balanced volume growth and net price realization driving by strong innovation and brand marketing. For example, in June we launched Stacy's Cheese Petites inspired by French Cheese Puff, these bite-sized cheese snacks have real cheese baked inside creating a sophisticated snacking experience.","In fact cheese is the primary ingredient. Petites are a good source of calcium and have six grams of protein per serving, and they come in a resealable pouch making them great for a convenient on-the-go experience.","Over the summer, Doritos and Mountain Dew partnered on our Worlds Collide program to appeal to our Gen Z consumers who thrive on accelerating experiences. The program highlighted the brands recent innovations, Doritos Blaze and Dew Ice and rewarded consumers to purchase both products with merchandise and experiences.","The eight-week media campaigns supporting the program span social media channels that are also featured on Pandora to reach our consumers' distinctive music. Tostitos' growth was fueled by new products such as Roasted Red Pepper and Black Bean and Garlic.","To support the product launches we created the program to drive trial during the summer get-togethers. Our Buy, Ride, Get Together already program allowed consumers to scan a code of specially marked bags to redeem a $5 lift credit making it even easier for our consumers to get safety to and from summer parties. And Cheetos benefited from the launch of Cheetos Flaming Hot Chipotle Ranch earlier this year, appealing to consumers growing desire for intense flavors.","Cheetos further benefited from our Cheetos Museum Win What You See campaign, with our first-ever Cheetos promotion supported by TV commercials directing consumers to winwhatyousee.com where we invited our fans to find and submit unique Cheetos shapes to have a chance to win what they see. We garnered more than 80,000 submissions and the program is now been localized and rolled across seven additional countries and counting.","Turning to North American beverages, while the marketplace remains highly competitive, we are encouraged by improving overall category growth trends and a generally rational pricing environment.","We had another quarter of sequential organic revenue performance and improvement. Organic revenue growth of 2.5% is the best you've seen in NAB in eight quarters and was driven by retail sales growth in Starbucks ready-to-drink coffee, Lipton ready-to-drink tea, Gatorade, our water portfolio, Pepsi and Mountain Dew.","Certainly strong innovation across the portfolio is contributing to the improving performance. For example, LIFEWTR continues its journey advancing and showcasing sources of creativity with the launch of our Series 6 Bottle themed diversity and design.","LIFEWTR achieved more than $150 million in measured retail sales in 2017 which was its introductory year. And is on pace to achieve more $200 million in measured retail sales in 2018.","Bubly, a new flavored sparkling water where there's no artificial flavors, colors or calories which we launched in February of this year continues to perform exceeding well and has projected to exceed a $100 million in measured retail sales in this first year.","Mountain Dew's performance is benefiting from the launch of Mountain Dev Ice, another launch which should surpass a $100 million of retail in its first year from launch, and from the return of Mountain Dew Baja Blast as our summer limited time offering.","And in June, we launched Gatorade Zero. With zero sugar and all the electrolytes of Gatorade Thirst Quencher, Gatorade Zero is providing hydration options for more athletes in more occasions and is off to a strong start.","And we believe our stepped-up advertising and marketing, particularly on trademarks Pepsi and Mountain Dew, are also starting to contribute to improve performance as we saw sequential net revenue accelerations in both trademarks in the third quarter.","Commodity inflation, operating cost inflation particularly in transportation cost, product mix and stepped-up advertising expense each pressured our profit performance in the quarter. However, we expect that our recently implemented pricing actions will improve profit performance in the coming quarters.","At Quaker Foods North America, our hot cereal business posted its fifth consecutive quarter of market share gains supported by our marketing campaigns highlighting the functional benefits of oatmeal and innovation like Simple and Wholesome Organic Hot Cereal, a Multigrain Hot Cereal with no artificial colors or preservatives.","In addition, Quaker light snacks gains market share with high singe digit retail sales growth. In our Aunt Jemima pancake business, grew retail sales for the eighth consecutive quarter.","And to close out our conversation in North America, we are pleased to report that in the third quarter PepsiCo was the largest contributor to food and beverage growth at retail in the United States.","Turning to our sectors outside of North America, we are extremely pleased with the 10% organic revenue growth we saw in our developing and emerging market as a group, which is the continuation of the strength and experience across many of these markets in the first half.","Strong marketplace execution led to continued solid growth across many of our key international markets. Within Latin America organic revenue grew 10% driven by high single digit growth in Mexico and double-digit growth in Argentina, Brazil and Colombia.","The LatAm team is doing an excellent job, building our business and growing our market share in key countries in the region. In our Europe sub-Saharan Africa sector, Russia and South Africa each grew organic revenue high single-digit, while Turkey and Poland had double-digit organic revenue growth. Even within the developed markets of Europe, we saw mid single-digit organic revenue growth in the UK and France. Again, continued good performance from this team.","And in AMENA, we had strong double-digit organic revenue growth in China, Saudi Arabia, India and Egypt, and high single-digit organic revenue growth in Australia. Excellent results from our AMENA team. This strong top line performance translated into impressive bottom line results with core constant currency operating profit up 12% in our international divisions as a group.","The international results reflect our initiatives to continue to expand distribution of our big global brand and to innovate in locally relevant ways. For example, we continue to drive international growth of our zero sugar Pepsi Black and Pepsi Max trademarks with introductions of lime and cherry flavors across Easter Europe, lime in the Nordics, and lime and vanilla flavors in the Philippines.","We are driving growth in Doritos internationally, whether through expansion to new markets like China where the brand just celebrated its first anniversary since launch, to innovation in existing markets like India, where we launched Doritos Heat Wave.","And the Quaker's trademark continues its global expansion. From the launch of Quaker's super food in Mexico, to our launches of Quaker Kids and Quaker multigrain instant oatmeal platforms in China.","Finally, during the quarter we reach an agreement to acquire SodaStream. As we said on the day of the initial announcement, we believe PepsiCo and SodaStream are an inspired match.","Daniel Birnbaum and the rest of the SodaSteam team have built an extraordinary company that is offering consumers the ability to make great tasting beverages while reducing the amount of waste generated.","That focus is well aligned with performance with Purpose, our philosophy of making more nutritious products while limiting our environmental footprint. Together, we can advance our shared vision of a healthier, more sustainable planet. SodaStream will also add to our growing water portfolio while accelerating our ability to offer personalized in-home beverage solutions around the world.","From breakthrough innovations like Drinkfinity to beverage dispensers like Spire for foodservice and Aquafina water stations for colleges and universities. We are finding new ways to reach consumers beyond the bottle and the SodaStream is fully in line with that strategy.","As we previously announced the acquisition was unanimously approved by the boards of both companies. The transaction is subject to a SodaStream shareholder vote, certain regulatory approvals and other customary conditions and consummation of the transaction is expected by January of 2019.","Net, we are encouraged by the momentum we are seeing across many of our international markets. In North America, Frito-Lay continues to perform well, North American beverages is making steady improvement, and our recently implemented pricing actions will help improve profit performance in North America. And finally, we are excited about the new opportunities that the pending SodaStream acquisition represents.","With that, let me turn it over to Hugh Johnston.","Hugh Johnston","Thank you, Indra and good morning everyone. I'll jut provide a quick update on the outlook and then we'll move to your questions. After considering our year to-date performance and other factors we've updated our guidance for 2018.","Specifically, we now expect at least 3% organic revenue growth for the full year. We now expect our core effective tax rate to be between 19% and 20%. We continue to expect core constant currency EPS growth of 9%.","However, we now expect core earnings per share in U.S. dollar terms of $5.65, which reflects a one-point headwind from foreign exchange translation based on current market consensus rates due to the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar. This is an 8% increase compared to 2017 core earnings per share of $5.23.","We continue to expect strong cash flow and to exercise disciplined capital allocation with prudent reinvestment into the business. For 2018 we continue to expect free cash flow of approximately $6 billion which includes approximately $9 billion in cash flow from operations, including a $1.4 billion discretionary pension contribution made in the first quarter. And we now expect net capital spending of approximately $3.3 billion.","We continue to expect to return approximately $7 billion to shareholders in 2018 with cash dividends of approximately $5 billion reflecting a 15% increase in the annualized dividend per share that began with the June payment and share repurchases of approximately $2 billion.","Finally, as you update your models, I'd like to highlight the following items to consider for the fourth quarter. Frito-Lay North America is lapping 5% organic revenue growth from the fourth quarter of 2017.","We expect operating profit to decline in our AMENA division as we lap strong results and a refranchising gain in Jordan from the fourth quarter of 2017. We expect the previously announced refranchising of our Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovakia business operations to benefit ESSA operating profit in the fourth quarter.","And finally based on market consensus forecast, we expect foreign exchange translation to negatively impact both net revenue and operating profit by approximately three percentage points in the fourth quarter.","With that, operator, we are ready to take the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley.","Indra Nooyi","Good morning, Dara.","Dara Mohsenian","Hey, good morning. Congratulations Indra, on an illustrious career of Pepsi and best wishes for you in the future.","Indra Nooyi","Thank you.","Dara Mohsenian","So, the quarter itself clearly saw a large acceleration of the organic sales in emerging and developing markets that's in contrast to some of the fears out there over slowing macro. So, I was just hoping you could give us some more detail there on what drove the sequential improvement? Do you think it's more category growth accelerating or Pepsi market share picking up, maybe some of the key countries behind that. And then most importantly, just are those drivers sustainable as you look going forward beyond Q3 as you think about the strength in the business in the quarter?","Indra Nooyi","Hugh.","Hugh Johnston","Yes. So from an international perspective, I think we saw remarkably broad-based results. The list of countries that had a strong quarter is probably too long to enumerate on the call. We'll use up our entire time doing that. Maybe most notably I think if we saw a strong volume growth both in snacks and in beverages. Snacks were somewhere between 4% and 5% volume growth, beverages between 3% and 4%. And I think it really does sort of demonstrate that both the power of the portfolio and then in addition to that the relatively broad-based strength of economic performance around the world.","So, I think we do expect international to continue to perform very well. I think the portfolio was sturdy and well insulated. Look, at any given time as countries are disrupted, we always have some exposure to those disruptions. But by and large I think we have a remarkably powerful international business.","Indra Nooyi","And our execution also picked up quite a bit.","Hugh Johnston","Yes, absolutely.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Grundy of Jefferies.","Indra Nooyi","Good morning, Kevin.","Kevin Grundy","Good morning, Indra. And I want to extend my congratulations as well. Can we start on the North American beverage business? Results improving. So congratulations on that. But coming at costs when we look at the margin pressure year-over-year and understanding the freight and commodities are playing apart, but you're also picking up your advertising and marketing spending. So maybe you could touch on the ROI on the spent if you're satisfied at this point?","And then two, maybe touch on the necessity to maintain higher levels here into Q4 and even next year particularly behind CSDs and sports drinks as we look at the some of the market share trends we see in the Nielsen data in order to maintain this level of growth? Thank you.","Hugh Johnston","Hey Kevin, it's Hugh Johnston. Couple of things on that. You're right. The P&L was negatively impacted by two things. Number one was cost pressure both transport cost and aluminum were up. Number two, it was the increased in advertising and marketing spend across a number of our businesses. Maybe just we'll step back a little bit in terms of the way that we think about advertising and spending levels. Our intention generally speaking is to be competitive on advertising and spending levels, but not to accelerate beyond competition.","Our goal is to win based on the quality of our advertising and the execution that follows that advertising rather than that the level itself. So I think we will maintain levels of spending that are competitive, but not beyond competitive. Regarding the input cost inflation whether it's transport or whether it's aluminum, our history is always been to price through inflation in our developed markets. We'll look to do that here. We did that post Q3. It's fairly unusual to take pricing in the middle of the summer. So despite the fact that we felt some of that pressure in the summer, we didn't take pricing until September. I think you'll see the profit picture improve in Q4 as a result of that pricing.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane of Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch.","Bryan Spillane","Hey, good morning everyone, and Indra, really just want to wish you the best going forward. It's been a pleasure the last 20 years covering you.","Indra Nooyi","Thank you. Thank you very much.","Bryan Spillane","I guess the bigger question I would have is just -- you're looking at the business today in this year, right? We've seen some an increase in investment for advertising and marketing. We've also seen SodaStream as a relative to some the acquisitions you've done in the past a little bit bigger, which Soda suggests that there's just more of a need to sort of invest to continue to drive the top line.","So I [Indiscernible] yes, Indra, if you could if you could just sort of address this. We are at a point now where there is just a need to spend more whether it's operating expense or M&A to sort of drive the top line or was this year sort of more of an anomaly?","Hugh Johnston","Hey, Bryan, it's Hugh. Those are too fairly points, so let me address them separately. In terms of capital allocation broadly no change in policy here. We talked about $500 million here in tuck-ins that continues to be our stated policy. SodaStream in a lot of ways is a unique asset in that it gets into a completely different market that we really weren\u2019t touching at all, which are consumers who preferred to prepare beverages at home, whether they be just sparkling water, whether they be flavored beverages. So I would view [Indiscernible] to increase in advertising and marketing in the beverage business as anything more than a response to competitive increase and that\u2019s a competitive increase that remains to be seen as to where it goes in the future. I think our expectation as we said before is we want to compete on execution, we want to compete on the quality of innovation that we want to compete on the quality of our marketing and we think we are well positioned to do that particularly whether integrated system.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ali Dibadj of Bernstein.","Ali Dibadj","Hey guys, first Indra very start -- if you go, you\u2019ve really transformed the company and frankly the whole industry, so we feel very good about that, so would love to hear what made you decide to go after 12 great years and maybe that will be in the closing remarks but would love to hear that at or now or later. And then more specifically about the quarter, clearly the topline has been very good, the margins have seen little bit of pressure and we understand about the advertising increases as well as some of the commodity and other costs that are in there, but historically you\u2019ve been able to insulate a lot of that through the $1billion or year of cost savings plan that we\u2019ve seen here, where do you think you are on that, are you towards the end of that and that\u2019s why we are seeing a little more pressure on the margins or do you think that has led to continue for many more years and to insulate you guys from what we are seeing from this quarter and most recent quarters on margin pressure? Thanks.","Hugh Johnston","Ali, well I\u2019ll handle your second question first. In terms of productivity going forward, the bucket which we drive productivity, we call operating expenses about $28 billion bucket. It\u2019s got a natural rate of inflation of about 3% to 4% partly because the bucket is more tilted internationally where inflation rates are higher. So I do think we\u2019ve got years and years of productivity to come into the future. I\u2019m not here to announce a specific new program right now beyond what we\u2019ve announced, but I do think we have lots of opportunity out there for further productivity.","Regarding your question on whether we can continue to drive growth through the P&L funded by productivity. I think broadly the answer to that is yes, in a lot of ways I think that the third quarter was reflective of the timing of our pricing decisions where we decided to take those post Q3 rather than during the quarter which obviously pressured margins a little bit, and it was also reflective of continued investments that we are making in top line growth initiatives, whether it\u2019s advertising and marketing which was up about 6% in the quarter, R&D spending was up about 22% in the quarter, e-commerce spending was roughly double in the quarter.","So I think in many ways what you saw was a timing issue in terms of the timing of commodity increases versus the pricing increase and continued investment in the business while delivering the short-term performance that frankly in many ways has been emblematic [ph] of interest entire 12 years in running the company or posture in doing so over the last 20 or more years with the company.","Indra Nooyi","Ali and I\u2019ll answer your first question in my closing comments for sure.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.","Judy Hong","Thank you, good morning and congratulations Indra and best wishes from me as well. So I guess first on the guidance used so the FX [ph] obviously came down by about a percent, the core EPS didn\u2019t change, the revenue went up, the tax rate came down so maybe there\u2019s a little bit of additional pressure kind of between those lines, so maybe a little bit color there. And then just follow up on NAV pricing, so Q3, post Q3 the price increase, can you just give us a little bit color just the magnitude of the price increases and the category that you have announced the price increases and where you think the elasticity might be in terms of the pricing impact? Thanks.","Hugh Johnston","Yes, so in terms of the \u2013 the point that you made regarding the P&L. We\u2019ve said all along to the degree that we have upsides from tax and things like that we intend to deliver our guidance and invest back in the business. You just heard me articulate a few of the areas that we\u2019ve been investing in. Regarding pricing in the market place what we said broadly is the pricing will be somewhere in the low to mid single digits and that pricing is basically in right now in the beverage business.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman of Barclays","Indra Nooyi","Good morning, Lauren.","Lauren Lieberman","Good morning, thank you. Indra, I was hoping to just take this opportunity to ask you kind of as you look forward and you think about what are the biggest opportunity do you think that are still ahead for PepsiCo what do think some of the biggest challenges are and into the loss that has been built under your watch to continue development for example of DST in the U.S. and that we\u2019ve got this dramatic changes in retail. So if you could just give us some thoughts on kind of opportunities but then also some of the challenges and adjustments that might need to be made in the business model going forward as you set to your retirements in the company? Thanks.","Indra Nooyi","Thanks, Lauren. And I think PepsiCo has the scale and scope to remain one of the most successful food and beverage companies well into the future. I think over the years we\u2019ve assembled the portfolio that is very synergistic, has tremendous growth potential and more importantly we\u2019ve built out a geographic footprint which is quite impressive.","Going forward, I think there\u2019s still tremendous amount of growth available in emerging markets. I think there\u2019s growth available and re-thinking some of our businesses as platforms rather than just products. For example, we still haven\u2019t fully exploited how snacks can be mini meals and what we can do with the combination of our snacks and dips [ph] and that\u2019s something our teams are looking at very seriously. How do we look at sports beverages more as holistic sports nutrition on a sports field platform and our teams are looking at that? And so our growth prospects whether it\u2019s a development markets or the developing markets and emerging markets is actually what we imagine it to be, not necessarily what the reported numbers are, so that\u2019s the first topline opportunity.","I think the wonderful thing about PepsiCo is that we reinvent ourselves constantly, whether it\u2019s rethinking innovation and top line new capabilities we need to invest behind, or if its re-thinking the cost structure. As I\u2019ve said to many of you I think there\u2019s lot of technology driven disruptions that are coming down the pie that are going to force us to rethink many many parts of our cost structure, but we started that work several years ago and I think over the next year or so you will start seeing a lot of these taking root, and how we implement these in the company and reshape our cost structure for the new realities is really going to separate the great companies from the not so great companies and I\u2019m confident PepsiCo is among the great companies and we will re-shape our cost structure using technology as a big driver and I think will also use data analytics and insights to think about innovation a whole lot differently.","So I feel good about where we are. We have made a lot of investments, the trick now is to keep investing in the company judiciously so that we deliver a good balance of short term results and make investments to keep this engine going into the future.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog of Wells Fargo.","Indra Nooyi","Good morning, Bonnie.","Bonnie Herzog","Good morning and congratulations to Hugh and Indra, we all wish you really the very best in the future. And I had a quick question on your guidance. Your outlook for organic sales is now slightly higher for the year, but it implies a sequential deceleration in Q4, so could you guys first reconcile that for us and then whether you are being conservative or is there something else going on and then I was also hoping to hear an update on your current thinking on the strategic options you are exploring for your beverage business in North America, guess I\u2019m wondering if you guys have made any more progress and you know determining the right path for this business and really what your latest thoughts are on potential benefits of refranchising? Thanks.","Hugh Johnston","Yes, happy to jump in on that. Number one, I would remind you that the Q4 lap on revenue is more difficult that Q3 was so while the guidance does imply a sequential slowdown in Q4 some of our thinking is driven by that. And frankly the guidance we\u2019ve laid out there is at least 3%, so we\u2019ll see how the quarter comes. And regarding North America beverage and refranchising nothing new to report on that. We\u2019ve said we look at it as we always do, the one thing that I would say generally is we do think the integrated system does make us more innovative, it does make us faster to respond to customer needs and it does make us more cost competitive. So those are the hurdles that we have to overcome if we were to see some benefit to refranchising in the future.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Caroline Levy of Macquarie.","Caroline Levy","Good morning and \u2013 and hi Indra congratulations and really can\u2019t wait to see what you are up to next, and you\u2019ve been a great role model for many women, so congratulations. I just \u2013 my question is on Frito North America where the margin growth hasn\u2019t been as robust this year as it has historically and I\u2019m wondering how you are thinking about the fourth quarter which has a very difficult lap. I know you had some one-time payments in the first quarter on bonuses, but as Frito has always been such a great driver of growth for the total company Frito, North America is there a point at which the margin expansion story thinking longer term maybe needs to slow as you invest in new opportunities?","Hugh Johnston","Hey Caroline, it\u2019s Hugh. I think the answer to your question is no, because we think that, that business is so strong in its ability to leverage new ideas and new technology and to scale them relatively quickly to provide increased margin overtime. In terms of the short term numbers that you are speaking to, what are the factors affecting Frito-Lay this year is transport cost. Now transport in Frito was more heavily internal relative to beverages which uses more common carriers. So beverages has been more exposed to the driver shortage and the impact in terms of transport cost, but Frito-Lay is not immune to that it does use some common carrier and there is some wage inflation and the driver pool is well up. One of the things you will see Frito-Lay do is take some pricing in the fourth quarter particularly in single served which I think will mitigate the impact of the inflation and you will see their margin performance return to a more normal, a more normal margin improvement.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira of JPMorgan.","Andrea Teixeira","Hi, thank you and Indra thank you for making history and best wishes for you and Ramon as well.","Indra Nooyi","Thank you.","Andrea Teixeira","Thank you. My question is related to NAB, why are we encouraged to see the volumes return to positive, but the trends continue to decelerate on a two-year stag, so how should we think about volume performance on a sequential basis as you move through the fourth quarter, I\u2019m assuming that you are going to have some of the results of your increased investments and also execution that strayed? Thank you.","Hugh Johnston","Yes, Andrea, I\u2019m not going to \u2013 I don\u2019t want to get into guidance on a division specific perspective and on a division specific quarterly perspective particularly not. I would view it as the business is both improving but it\u2019s improving in a broad based way. So watching volume alone may not be as meaningful as watching the combination of volume and revenue particularly in light of the fact that where we\u2019re seeing the best growth is often times in non-carbs and premium products which are obviously they moved the needle less on volume but they moved the needle on revenue in a substantive way. So, again I think the message here in terms of North America beverage is continued sequential improvement in the overall business. The pricing will obviously help in Q4 as well and we think we are getting that business back on track with the investments behind the advertising and the innovation that we have.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Powers of Deutsche Bank.","Indra Nooyi","Good morning, Steve.","Hugh Johnston","Hey, good morning.","Steve Powers","Good morning and congrats and thank you from me as well Indra.","Indra Nooyi","Thank you, Steve.","Steve Powers","I guess \u2013 I had a question on I guess the question that Brian asked earlier on sort of a different perspective. If we step back and look at what\u2019s happened over the course of the summer with the official creation of KBP [ph] with the alliance between Nestle and Starbucks with Coke purchasing body armor and then cost to coffee and your own action with SodaStream it just- it feels like there is a tremendous amount of activity and change all across beverages right now. I just \u2013 I\u2019ve loved your thoughts as to why there is so much activity right now and what does it say about the feature of the LRB category and PepsiCo\u2019s role in it amidst all this change? Thank you.","Indra Nooyi","Go ahead, Hugh.","Hugh Johnston","Yes. You know Steve I agree with you there is a large amount of activity right now and you just sighted a couple of competitors coming at it from a couple of different angles. I don\u2019t want to speculate on their strategies as those are questions probably best asked of them. I do think you have people using different approaches to reach for growth and to reconstruct their portfolios to some degrees.","From PepsiCo\u2019s perspective by and large we like the construction of our portfolio right now, it\u2019s been built over the better part of the last two decades and we think it\u2019s well positioned to compete, well positioned to innovate on as we build on the platforms that have existed here for a long time. SodaStream, I wouldn\u2019t compare to the other things that you have citied, I think it\u2019s an exception to the rule because it actually gets into a market that we weren\u2019t playing in at all up until now and frankly I don\u2019t think any of the other people that you mentioned are playing in a substantive way at all later, so I wouldn\u2019t compare our move in SodaStream with some of the other competitive moves because I think it\u2019s driven by a new opportunity for us as opposed to getting into categories that some of those folks already in that just weren\u2019t scaled up.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer of Cowen.","Indra Nooyi","Good morning, Vivian.","Vivien Azer","Good morning, Indra and congratulations. One of the things that I think is rung through through your tenure at Pepsi and certainly coming through a lot and here on this call is the focus on innovation and how that really helps differentiate the story. So with that in mind, I was wondering whether you could speak at all to how Pepsi is thinking about an opportunity in Canada\u2019s based products and specifically non-psyhcoactive cannabis as an additive to non-alcohol drinks. Thanks.","Indra Nooyi","I mean, really I don\u2019t have anything to say, but Hugh, I don\u2019t know if you want to add something there.","Hugh Johnston","Yes, I mean obviously we \u2013 I think it\u2019s fair to say we look at everything, but I think that the difficulties in investing in that category particularly in the U.S. were federally these things are still not legal or quite a considerable challenge. So, we look at everything but certainly no plans at this point to do anything.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Amit Sharma of BMO Capital Markets.","Indra Nooyi","Good morning, Amit.","Amit Sharma.","Hi, good morning everyone. Hi, good morning, Indra and very best wishes for you after the retirement here. Two questions if I may. One, Hugh to your response on the NAB franchising and perfectly [Indiscernible] answer, I just wanted to look at it from, when you look at your potential partners from a bowling side, if that also a consideration in your decision to keep the current structure imtact?And then second, as we look to the end of this year or next year, there is a ton of contribution from below the line in terms of EPS, as you look at next year how much room do you have in that below the line in terms of flexibility or should we expect operating profit to be generally in line with earnings throughout next year?","Hugh Johnston","Yes, Amit happy to answer both of those. In terms of the potential bottling partners we have a lot of high quality bottlers in our business, so that\u2019s not a factor in the decision. The factors are the ones that I mentioned earlier. Regarding your question on 2019, we are always quite disciplined around not talking of our guidance for 2019 or even things that potentially impact guidance until we get to that year, so we\u2019ll talk about that in February.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Pablo Zuanic of SIG.","Pablo Zuanic","Thank you, all the best Indra. All the best, two quick questions if I can. You know a bit forward think in terms of snacks, it seems to me that yes, Frito is very strong and salty, but a lot of innovation it\u2019s more on the savory side I would argue. We have seen a lot of the food companies coming into to snacks, so just help us frame how Pepsi fits in there, because from my perspective the company obviously protects it\u2019s very strong salty franchise and they have seen adjacencies very lightly maybe perhaps not to dilute the core, but the market seems to be moving and shifting away from salty into those other categories, so is that a concern how should we think about that?","And the second very, very brief is there room for a closer collaboration with Starbucks in the case of coffee. I mean, obviously Starbuck now is doing things with Nestle overseas and in the U.S. is there room for Pepsi to do something with Nescafe for example if you can comment on that, thank you.","Hugh Johnston","Yes, Pablo, it\u2019s Hugh. Regarding Frito-Lay I think we\u2019ve continued to inch out of salty into savory, really over the course of the past decade or more whether it\u2019s our Sabra joint venture or whether it\u2019s Stacy\u2019s, there is a lot of examples where we\u2019ve gotten beyond salty and into savory. I think the good news is the combination of our consumer insights which are broad-based around how people consume snacks, I think leads us into savory in a fairly effective way. The reality of it is consumers don't think in these industrial terms like salty or savory. They think about occasions and they think about what they feel like eating. Frito-Lay's insights I think are extremely well-positioned to pick the right areas to go and to develop the right products to take advantage of those consumer opportunities. And then in addition to that, the scale of the Frito-Lay operation, once a decision is made to enter a new subcategory, I think allows us to be very very successful very very quickly.","The scale being from the perspective of brands, from the production systems, from the distribution systems, so I think you'll see Frito-Lay continue to be very successful in the savory area. Regarding your second question around Starbucks, look, we've had the Starbucks partnership now for the better part of 20 years. It's been remarkably successful for both of us. I think you'll continue to see us expand and build on the relationship with Starbucks.","Indra Nooyi","The only thing we're not going to do again is the restaurant business with Starbucks.","Hugh Johnston","Correct.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robert Ottenstein of Evercore ISI.","Indra Nooyi","Good morning, Robert.","Robert Ottenstein","Good morning and congratulations. Two questions, Indra, a little bit more big picture. First, a few years ago you describe and I think you were talking more about the U.S. consumer is somewhat confused on health and wellness issues in terms of how they were viewing sugar and artificial sweeteners. I think there's probably three years ago. So I'd loved to get an update in terms of your thinking about U.S. consumers is looking at the health and wellness space and particularly with regards to sugar and artificial sweeteners?","And then the other question is perhaps maybe give us a little bit more insight into your successor. Obviously he has done a fantastic job on the international front, but maybe a little bit of thought of kind of the things that he's done in his past that could be very helpful with the rest of the organization? Thank you.","Indra Nooyi","Yes. So I'll just speak to the U.S. consumer. What we have been seeing over the past three years is that even though there's occasional confusion on artificial sweeteners good for you or not, why not real sugar. What's wrong with the high fructose corn syrup, those kinds of questions, there is a general trend towards health and wellness, whether its consumption of more zero calorie, flavored waters or drinking diet products or lower calorie products, there's definitely a trend towards whole grains, closer to nature. So that trend might vary in speed year-over-year, but the trend is there.","And as a millennials age, I think they are driving this trend more and more. And the availability of more healthy products whether its ready prepared meals or home delivery of anything that's healthy is actually taking away any barriers to buying a healthier products whether it's better for you or good for you products. So I think you're going to see an acceleration towards that trend as the years go by.","Now Ramon is an outstanding executive and you'll get a chance to get to know him over the next few weeks and months. The good thing is a lot of the trends we are seeing in the U.S. have already happened in Europe, whether its retail consolidation, whether its trends towards health and wellness, competition amongst all of the European food and beverage companies where warehouse delivered products are really have to negotiate to the retailers, all of those trends, Ramon is a veteran of. And he's going to bring all those skills to the United States.","Second as you know over the last year as President, Ramon has been leading the productivity program for the company, been leading innovation. So I think he's uniquely suited to bring a fresh pair of eyes to everything we do here in North America while preserving its knowledge of the international market. Finally, he's just a good guy. I think you'll find his mix of operating expertise, plus his ability to think about customers, consumers, and bring the two together, to be refreshing. So get to know him. I think you will be very happy with what you see.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Laurent Grandet of Guggenheim.","Indra Nooyi","Hello, Laurent.","Laurent Grandet","Hey, good morning, Indra, good morning, Hugh. Indra, so let me first congratulate you on for having been at the forefront of consumer goods company with performance [indiscernible] your vision that redefine, I think, the company role in society and embrace, I mean, the new reality of consumer mindset. So having seen this from the insight I can only relay your passion and commitment were second to none.","Indra Nooyi","Thank you.","Laurent Grandet","So, maybe something you will cover in your closing remarks, what will you have done differently should you have the opportunity to rewind time? And then more in the business, right now, your campaign, Pepsi generations and increased A&M behind the brand did probably enough to stabilize the brand Pepsi this year? Now, good thing that the campaign was probably pleasing to boomers with some nostalgia retro back, but not sure it's attracting the consumer into the franchise. So could you please share with us Pepsi specific, I mean, brand KPIs especially as -- in regards to millennial consumers, please?","Hugh Johnston","Yes. So as you might imagine that the KPIs on Pepsi are the ones that you would traditionally look at. First, the highest level market share performance and velocities in the stores from a consumer perspective we tend to look at purchase intent regard relevance to consumers. A lot of this stuff is done through survey work. And we have seen over time the metrics that we measure while it may not be immediately responsive. They do tend to prove out over time sales trends both positively and negatively.","And the good news is what we are starting to see are given the increases in advertising early green shoots of improvement in those performance metrics, that again do overtime tend to correlate with sales performance.","Indra Nooyi","Thank you all for your questions. Just, let me make some closing comments. After 12 years at the helm of the company, today is my final day as CEO. It ends my 24-year career as a PepsiCo Executive. I have been blessed to have had the opportunity to lead such a great company and work with such incredible people including our outstanding board, executives and other associates, our customers and other partners, our shareholders and all our other stakeholders.","You know 12 years is a long time as a CEO, and even though I have a lot of fuel still left in my tank. I wanted to do something different with my life. Spend more time with my family and give the next generation in PepsiCo a chance to lead this great company.","Throughout my tenure however, we've strived to achieve a difficult balance between attending to short term pressures while managing for the long-term. And I'll leave today proud of the work our team has done. We were pioneers in business sustainability and social responsibility and embedded the sense of purpose in everything PepsiCo does guided by our Performance with Purpose philosophy. We have transformed our product portfolio by growing our good for you and better for you option from about 38% of revenue in 2006 to roughly 50% in 2017. ","We more than doubled our investment in research and development to expand our more nutritious offerings and minimize our environmental impact. We became an even more valued partner to our retail customers. We were selected as a number one food and beverage supply in the United States in the most recent 2017 Advantage Report and named Best-in-Class Manufacturer by Kantar for the second year in a row.","We've made positive contributions to communities around the globe in which we operate through our support of access to clean drinking water, human rights, nutrition, agricultural programs and many more initiatives. And we invested significantly new capabilities in areas like design and e-commerce to better position our company for a successful future.","In the midst of managing the business for the long-term, we also delivered strong and consistent financial performance specifically during the period 2006 to 2017. Net revenue grew more than 80%. We added a new billion dollar brand almost every other year. We returned $79 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Our market capitalization increased by $68 billion. Dividends per share nearly tripled from $1.16 to $3.17, and we generated total shareholder return of 162%.","Finally and very importantly, we have been on Ethisphere's list of most ethical companies for the past 12 years. For all of this I am grateful to my outstanding PepsiCo associates who gave so much to PepsiCo and me over the past 12 years.","And now, I\u2019m handing the reins to Ramon Laguarta, who becomes PepsiCo\u2019s sixth CEO. Ramon is a terrific executive with a long and proven track record of growing businesses. He has a deep understanding of the changing preferences of consumers and other critical trends unfolding around the world, and he has demonstrated that he knows how to navigate them successfully. He has been a critical partner to me in running the company and I\u2019m confident he will lead PepsiCo to new and greater heights in the years to come. The potential for PepsiCo is enormous. Finally, I want to thank you, our investors and analysts.","During my time as CEO and CFO, I\u2019ve had a lot of spirited and fascinating conversations with many of you. I\u2019ve always valued your perspectives even in those instances when we may have disagreed. You often challenged me, offered your opinions and provided different perspectives. My interactions with you over the years helped make me a better executive and helped make PepsiCo a better company. Thank you all for your time today and your engagement through the years.

With me today are Indra Nooyi, PepsiCo's Chairman and CEO; and Hugh Johnston, PepsiCo's CFO. We'll lead off today's call with a review of our second quarter 2014 performance and outlook, and then we'll move on to Q&A.","We have kept our comments brief this morning and intend to conclude the call by 08:45, to be respectful of your time during a busy earnings week, and we\u2019ll do our best to get to as many of your questions as we can. Before we begin, please take note of our cautionary statement. ","This conference call includes forward-looking statements, including statements regarding 2014 guidance and our long-term targets based on currently available information. Forward-looking statements inherently involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those predicted in such forward-looking statements.

As we have mentioned in our earnings release this morning, core operating profit growth rates are impacted by lapping a $137 million gain from the re-franchising of our Vietnam beverage operations in the second quarter of 2013, partially offset by incremental investments of $46 million made in the prior year quarter","Now, it's my pleasure to introduce Indra Nooyi.","Indra Nooyi ","Thank you, Jamie, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us this morning. We are pleased with our second quarter and our first half results. Despite operating and what continues to be a challenging and volatile macro environment, we have been consistently meeting or exceeding our financial goals over the last two and half years. I believe our results reflect the hard work we have done over the last several years to position our business for sustainable success; specifically our investments to strengthen our brands, innovate more effectively, expand our geographic footprint with strategic acquisitions, drive better execution, and operate more efficiently by leveraging our global scale and complementary product portfolio. ","Today, these actions and investments are producing consistent tangible results. Based on the strength of our first half results, in our outlook for the remainder of the year, we are increasing our full year core constant currency 2014 EPS growth outlook to 8%. ","So let me share with you some of the performance highlights of the second quarter. Organic revenue grew approximately 4%, with global snacks up 5% and global beverages up 2%. We managed the business responsibly achieving three points of effective net pricing to effective price packed revenue management. Each of our four business units delivered organic revenue growth led by high single-digit growth in EMEA and mid-single digit growth in Europe and PepsiCo Americas Foods.","Developing and emerging markets posted solid 8% organic revenue growth led by low double-digit growth in China, high single-digit growth in Brazil and mid single-digit growth in Russia. Innovation continue to play an important role in our topline growth and accounted for 9% of our net revenue. ","Core gross margins improved by 60 basis points. Excluding the Vietnam gain, that is incremental investment from the second quarter of 2013, our core constant currency operating profit rose 6%, core operating margin improved by 65 basis points and core constant currency EPS grew 9%. On a rolling four-quarter basis, our core net ROIC improved by 30 basis points and now stands at 16.5%. In the first half of 2014, we returned $4 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases, a 46% increase versus last year. As we previously announced, we expect to return $8.7 billion to shareholders in 2014 in the form of dividends and share repurchases, a 35% increase over our 2013 cash return to shareholders.","Importantly, we achieved our targeted productivity savings in the quarter and remain on track to achieve our full-year target of $1 billion, which represents approximately 3.5% of our operating cost base excluding commodities and A&M expense.","This year we successfully complete the three-year $3 billion productivity program we launched in 2012 and we are now focused on our next generation\u2019s five-year 5 billion productivity programs for 2019 announced earlier this year which is really centered on four key areas.","First, embedding more automation in our operations replace labor with capital. Second, expanding shared services, including global financial shared services for the handling of routine back office transaction processing. Third, restructuring, manufacturing to optimize our global manufacturing footprint. And fourth, restructuring our go-to-market systems to optimize our distribution network.","As a result of these initiatives, we expect to see continued improvement in net revenue and core earnings before interest and tax as per employee, as well as margin expansion and returns on invested capital.","So with all this as a backdrop, let's take a look at how the business has performed, starting in North American. The North American consumer picture continues to be weak with retail sales among the top, the food and beverage manufactures roughly flat in the quarter, a slight deceleration from the first quarter.","In this challenging environment, PepsiCo grew sales at retail across each of its North American snacks and beverage businesses and was a largest contributed to retail sales growth among the top 30 manufactures.","Frito-Lay North America performed well with organic growth of 2% and core constant currency operating profit growth of 5%. Net price utilization was somewhat mutual in the quarter, as we benefitted from commodity cost deflation.","Core operating margins expanded 80 basis points despite an increase in advertising and marketing and affected savings from our productivity efforts. Our top-line growth is driven by strength across most of our largest trademarks, with Lays, Doritos and Cheetos each posting revenue growth in the low to high single digits.","Our broader macro-snack offering were also doing well with strong performance in shelf stable dips, crackers, our line of Smartfood snack and the Sabra line of refrigerated hummus, dips and spread. As we look to the second half, we are encouraged by the strength of our innovation and consumer engagement program leveraging some of our biggest brands.","In April, we launched Doritos Jack mystery flavors with nationwide distribution. Consumers voted for their favorite mystery flavor online. Earlier this month, we revealed the three flavors, Spicy Street Taco, Chocolate Chipotle Bacon and Caribbean Citrus Jerk. Spicy Street Taco was a consumer voted favorite and we launched it this fall as a permanent Jack flavor.","We also brought back the U.S. the highly successfully Lay\u2019s Doritos flavor campaign. We\u2019ve received more than 14 million consumer submissions, nearly four times a submissions we received for last year\u2019s campaign.","On July 17, we announced the four finalist among consumer submitted flavors, Cappuccino, Cheddar Bacon Mac & Cheese, Mango Salsa and Wasabi Ginger. And these products are now hitting store shelves. Our consumers will now have the opportunity to vote for their favorite new Lay\u2019s flavor. And we are especially excited about the progress we\u2019re making in food service innovation.","On July 2, we launched Doritos Loaded exclusively at more than 5500, 7-Eleven stores nationwide. Doritos Loaded is a delicious hot snack served with melted Nacho Cheese and encrusted with Doritos. Our launch of loaded created a great deal of tradition and social media buzz generating more than 750 million impressions to-date. And it has also featured on Jimmy Kimmel live.","Each of these programs has a strong demonstration of how we are leveraging our Culinary center to create unique great tasting new products and driving excitement in the vendors to create a consumer engagement.","Turning now to Quaker Foods North America, despite continued challenges across most central store food categories, we gained value share at retail in each of Quaker\u2019s key categories, hot cereals, ready-to-eat cereals and snack bars both in the quarter and year-to-date. Core constant currency operating profit growth rose 5% of the quarter with operating profit margins expanding 155 basis points.","We are pleased with the performance of our recent innovation in 2014. We launched Quaker Express Cups which provides Quaker Instant Oatmeal in the convenient on-the-go cup. We also introduced the first of its kind hot cereal; Quaker Warm & Crunchy Granola which delivers both the wholesale goodness of Quaker Oatmeal and the satisfying crunch of market grain granola.","And finally, we are continuing to build in the success of our Real Medleys platform this time in a ready to eat cereal form. In North American beverages, we\u2019re encouraged for the continued progress we\u2019re making. In the second quarter and in the first half, we gained U.S. LRB value share and achieved positive net price realization at retail.","Notably, PepsiCo has held or gained relative U.S. LRB value share in major channel versus our closest competitor in each of the last five quarter. In the quarter, we also achieved greater net price realization retail and our primary competitor and the category overall.","Within the LRB category, we held or gained value share across a number of important sub-categories including CSDs, sports drinks, ready to drink tea and chilled juice and we grew retail sales in major channels in the U.S. for regular CSDs led by trademark Mountain Dew just up mid-single digits and with our non-carb portfolio for Gatorade, Lipton Tea, Starbucks Coffee and Naked Juice.","In the quarter, PAB grew both organic revenue in core constant currency operating profit with core operating profit margin expanding by 25 basis points. We\u2019re also excited about the progress we\u2019re making on the innovation front. In the second quarter, we introduced PEPSI SPIRE, our state-of-the-art beverage dispensers which allows consumers to create more than 1,000 customized beverages with a touch of screen while providing our food service partners flexible, cost effective, reliable equipment that best fits their needs.","PEPSI SPIRE is currently available in select U.S. locations and will continue to roll out for the rest of the year. On May 5, we also brought Mountain Dew Baja Blast to the shelves for a limited time, leveraging on the success of the fountain brand ahead of Taco Bell. Mountain Dew Baja Blast is a second largest and fastest growing fountain beverage sold at Taco Bell and may now expand the reach of the fan favorite brand.","And concurrent with the launch of the Doritos Loaded, we introduced Solar Flare, our tropical punch take on Mountain Dew exclusively at 7-Eleven. We are leveraging of the high purchase coincidence of Dew and Doritos with joint advertising, point-of-sale communication and promotion. And we are pleased with the performance of our expanded package offerings with strong double-digit growth in mini cans as well as 12 ounce glass bottle from the second quarter."," ","These new packages have enabled us to realize new price packed revenue benefits while maintaining flexibility for price competitiveness. So that\u2019s another American story. Western Europe performed well with organic revenue 3% in the second quarter in a difficult retail and competitive environment. ","Turning now to developing and emerging markets. In Mexico, we continue to navigate for the new the new taxes on certain foods and beverages. And as a reminder, we've taken pricing in snacks and our bottler has taken pricing in beverages to pass the taxes through to the consumer.","In the quarter, in Mexico, our volume decline in snacks moderated sequentially while beverage volume returned to growth as consumers began to adjust to the higher prices and our systems drove beverage share gains through improved market sales execution. We\u2019d dealing with the tax driven price increase throughout the year and expect some quarterly volatility to continue, our results so far are in line with our expectations. ","In Venezuela, we are managing through high inflation, political unrest, supply chain disruptions and continued uncertainty regarding the applicable exchange rate. Despite all the challenges, our businesses in Venezuela performed very well in the quarter with revenue up strong double-digits across both snacks and beverages.","Brazil delivered high single-digit organic revenue growth, led by double-digit organic revenue growth in beverages and high-single-digit organic revenue growth in snacks. We did a particularly effective job leveraging our global soccer properties in this market during the time when soccer was very much top of mind. Our integrated campaign featured an impressive roster of the world\u2019s premium soccer players and included television advertising as well as digital, out-of-home, in-store and point-of-sale marketing."," In Russia, organic revenue rose mid-single digits with double-digit growth in snacks and low-single digit growth in beverages. And we saw strong organic revenue growth in a number of other East European markets, including high single-digit growth in Turkey and low double-digit growth in Poland.","Moving across EMEA. Organic revenue growth was led by Thailand, which pronged double-digit organic revenue growth, followed by Egypt and the Philippines, which also grew double-digits. ","China organic revenue grew low double-digits driven by strong growth in our snacks business. The productivity restructuring program initiated by our bottling partner in the first quarter has achieved solid progress. Our partner has taken a well-planned deliberate approach to execute the program to ensure that our entire system is positioned to capture its full long-term efficiency and effectiveness benefits.","We remain committed to the developing and emerging markets as we believe they have a long runway for growth driven by increasing demand for our convenient on trend affordable products supported by rapidly growing middle class.","We believe we are well positioned to capitalize on these opportunities. So to conclude, we are off to a terrific start in 2014 with the pieces of our complementary portfolio working together to generate healthy top line and bottom line performance as we also step up the terms on investments and cash returns to shareholders.","Clearly, there are number of challenges around the globe but the shape and resilience of our portfolio combined with strong execution and aggressive productivity should enable us to navigate successfully to the current environment. Let me now turn the call over to Hugh. Hugh?","Hugh Johnston","Thank you, Indra and good morning everyone. Let me spend a few minutes discussing the quarter and our upwardly revised core constant currency earnings per share outlook for 2014. First for Q2, organic revenue grew 3.6%. On a reported basis, net revenue was up 0.5 point versus a year ago, reflecting 3 points of unfavorable foreign exchange translation and a slight negative structural impact primarily from the refranchising of our Vietnam bottling operation. Commodity cost had low single-digit inflation. Our core gross margins improved about 60 basis points and core operating margins rose 10 basis points.","Core operating margin rose 65 basis points when excluding the gain from refranchising Vietnam net of incremental investments from last year. Core constant currency operating profit grew 3% and approximately 6% excluding the Vietnam gain and investments from last year. Our quarter effective tax rate was 26.3, 2 percentage points above Q2 2013.","Our fully diluted share count declined 2%, reflecting the benefits of our ongoing share repurchase program. And core constant currency EPS grew 3% and 9% when excluding the Vietnam gain and investments from last year. And we returned $4 billion to shareholders in the first half in the form of dividends and share repurchases which was 46% above year ago levels and reflective of our commitment to return cash for shareholders.","Now turning to guidance. As Indra mentioned, based on the strength of our first half results and our outlook for the balance of year, we\u2019ve increased our full year core constant currency EPS growth target to 8%, up from 7% previously. Our other targets remain unchanged. We expect mid single-digit organic revenue growth, low single-digit commodity inflation and productivity savings of approximately $1 billion. ","Below the division operating profit line, we expect corporate cost efficiency driven by our productivity initiatives, a core effective tax rate of approximately 25% and a reduced share count from our share repurchase program.","Foreign exchange is expected to negatively impact net revenue by 3 percentage points and core earnings per share by 4 percentage points for the full year 2014, based on current market consensus rates. Taking our 2013 core EPS of $4.37 and applying our guidance implies 2014 core EPS of approximately $4.54.","As many of you know, the foreign exchange picture in Venezuela is very dynamic at the moment with three different exchange rates and the possibility for a converged mechanism. Our second quarter results were translated to U.S. dollars at VEB6.3 to the U.S. dollar. Our current FX forecast, which is based on current market consensus rates, assumes a blended rate of approximately VEB9 to the U.S. dollar for the balance of the year.","As you model out for third quarter, I\u2019d ask you to consider the following. We expect foreign exchange translation to have an approximate 2 point unfavorable impact on both third quarter revenue and third quarter EPS based on current market consensus rates. We do expect to ramp up advertising and marketing expense in the quarter and below the division operating profit line, net interest expense is expected to increase in the third quarter versus last year, primarily reflecting higher debt balances and higher rates. ","From a cash flow perspective, we continue to expect full-year free cash flow excluding certain items of more than $7 billion. We will continue to drive cash flow through efficient working capital management and continued tight controls over capital spending. Net capital spending should approximate $3 billion, which is well within our long-term target of less than or equal to 5% of net revenue. We expect to return approximately $8.7 billion to shareholders in 2014, a 35% increase over 2013 through a combination of $3.7 billion in dividends and $5 billion in share repurchases. ","So to summarize, we\u2019ve increased our core constant currency EPS growth outlook for the full-year 2014 to 8% from 7%. We expect to drive improved full-year margins and net ROIC and discipline capital allocation and returning cash to our shareholders, remain top priorities for the company.","With that operator, we will take the first question. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions). John Faucher with JPMorgan.","John Faucher - JPMorgan","","Wanted to follow up on the Frito results. From an organic revenue standpoint it is the weakest quarter you guys have put up in a while. You had some promotional activity or give us the flavor in the year-ago period. So I guess can you talk a little bit about what you are seeing in the general environment out there? How much the weakness for the quarter was what you saw generally in FDM in Q2? And then as we look to the back half back half of the year, and you talked about maybe a little bit more new product activity, etc., what is the confidence level in terms of Frito volumes and\/or organic revenue improving in the back half of the year? And as part of that, is the promotional environment getting any worse given some of the weakness in volumes we have seen across the food industry? Thanks.","Indra Nooyi ","","Thank you, John and thank you for your question. We are not particularly considered about the Frito-Lay performance. Clearly the North American retail environment saw an abrupt slowdown in period five and we were very careful to manage this business responsibly and not hit the promotional lever in order to just drive revenue or volume growth. We also delayed one marketing activity from Q2 to Q3. We\u2019re already beginning to see a ramp up in performance. So at this point, based on all the trends we are seeing, the strength of the marketing calendar in the second half, our A&M spending that we\u2019re expecting in the second half, the productivity programs, we feel pretty good about Frito-Lay.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America.","","Bryan Spillane - Bank of America","","As we looked at the gross margins for the quarter, can you just parse out for us how much benefit you have gotten from gross margins from just pure pricing? And how much of it was maybe just from commodity cost inflation coming down? Just trying to get I guess an understanding as we are pacing forward if there is more momentum here on gross margins.","","Hugh Johnston","Yes, good morning Bryan. Obviously it was a combination of a couple of things, Bryan. Number one, the commodity inflation environment right now is relatively muted. It was in line with our expectations because of the previously discussed forward buying program that we have for commodities, and at this point in the year we\u2019re about 85% bought for 2014. So we are comfortable with what our outlook is on the front. ","Number two, without that particularly in more inflationary countries we are getting some pricing and we expect to continue to do that. In businesses where we don\u2019t see a lot of inflation, we\u2019re not taking a whole lot of pricing, we\u2019re taking a bit, but where we have commodity deflation we don\u2019t feel forced to do that. ","And number three, I\u2019d point out is, the fact that innovation continues to ramp up. It\u2019s about 9% of sales. Innovation does allow us to realize net effective pricing. So with that parsing all of the individual pieces, they\u2019re all contributors, and I think we expect them all to continue. So I think we\u2019re going to continue to see could gross margin improvement. ","Operator","","Our next question comes from the line of Ali Dibadj with Bernstein.","Ali Dibadj - Bernstein","I wanted to ask a little bit about the sustainability of these clearly good results that we have seen so far. And in particular, when you look at each of the segments, Europe is the only segment out of the six where you call out advertising and marketing being up. In fact a couple times you see lapping of incremental investments. So this is now the second quarter in a row where we see kind of a similar narrative. So I'm trying to get a sense from you guys of what is overall happening to advertising and marketing in the first half of the year. Because it seems like it is going down as a percent of sales. And do you view that as sustainable going forward or do you expect there to be a ramp up on advertising? And as you talk about that, which is the core question on sustainability, if you could throw in a comment about Russia. I think there are some concerns about that, we have heard that from some other companies for sure in your sector and the sustainability there, as well as your Latin America growth being driven by Venezuela and Argentina where there is a question mark. But advertising was the main question and the other two add-ons if you could please.","Indra Nooyi","","So Ali, it is a big question. One of the things you said, and we have been very-very clear in this, even within our company is that whatever we\u2019ve set out as an A&M goal for the year, we will not cut it. We will spend it based on the marketing calendar and to make sure that it\u2019s spent properly during the year. But we\u2019re not going to cut A&M budgets for any year. When we took the big A&M step up in 2012, we made a commitment to us, also then to you that A&M is something that we will hold as a percentage of sales. And we are going to keep that number through the year. So you should feel very-very comfortable that across the company, the number is going to remain at 5.9%. I thought that I had to say that number. It will rise with sales and it will stay that way. And that\u2019s true for every segment. ","Let\u2019s talk about Russia and Latin America, all of the questions. You know in Russia, clearly there are some geopolitical issues. Our businesses is doing just fine at this moment, but you know we are basic food and beverage and the Russian consumers still need to eat and drink. And so, except for the FX issues, the business; yes, we\u2019re doing okay. And Hugh, I don\u2019t know if you want to comment about Venezuela.","Hugh Johnston","Yes. I mean it\u2019s certainly the Latin American environment, it\u2019s an inflationary environment. The good news from our perspective is that we do have strong market positions in the snack-food business and our beverage business is doing actually quite well down there right now. As a result we are but able to get the pricing to cover the inflation that we\u2019re facing down in that market and as a result we feel compatible with the trajectory at the Latin American business. So to tie all of that together, Ali, your question around the sustainability of the results, obviously we contemplate the volatile realm that we live in. We contemplate what\u2019s happening inside of the company. We\u2019ve made commitments around R&D and A&M and I\u2019m not cutting those things. And as a result we feel comfortable raising the guidance in spite of all those volatile factors, and that\u2019s why we did raise the guidance for the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bill Schmitz with Deutsche bank.","Bill Schmitz - Deutsche bank","Can you guys just take a stab at why you think the categories, especially in the US, have been so weak recently, and then maybe what you think it is going to take to kind of get them accelerating again? Because obviously, they are trending way below trend.","Indra Nooyi","Well, I think overall food and beverage has decelerated from years ago. People are consuming differently, I think there\u2019s been a trend towards fresh produce, fresh grocery products, more making your food as home as suppose to buying package food and beverages. And I think people have also been eating out, so food away from home is doing just a little bit. And I think from PepsiCo\u2019s perspective the strength of our brand, the strength of our innovation, strength of the complementarity of the portfolio and that fact that we have very popular distribution systems into the retail stores, this launch is enabling us to be the largest contributor to growth among the 30 largest manufactures in the U.S. retail environment. So I think as long as we keep innovating and leveraging our distribution system and really helping the retailers offset some of their labor cost through our DLT systems in high velocity category, we should be able to drive growth. And then on the food service side, they are now with the Culinary centers both in beverages and snacks and all the work we are doing on complementary offerings between snacks and beverages has been to drive a lot of excitement in food services, whether it be Buffalo Wild Wings or 7-Eleven, food service or Taco Bell. I think more and more food services customers are coming to us and saying, what can you do for us to drive traffic and to drive tickets. So it doesn\u2019t matter if somebody comes into buy a product from the sea store and they also be attracted to stop by the food service side and pick up something for immediate consumption. So that\u2019s really what they are working on, taking a relatively low growth North American retail environment and positioning ourselves to be the highest growth food and beverage company and that\u2019s really our strategy. And I think our portfolio as a fact that we have high velocity categories is making us a very valuable partner to retailers all across the country.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.","Dara Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley","Clearly at the corporate level you realized significant pricing in Q2, it drove mostly organic sales growth. So I just wondering how comfortable you are going forward that that strong pricing can continue given the moderate commodity environment as well as the challenged consumer. And then secondly, Hugh, we have really started to see a turn in the operating margin performance for the Company the last couple of quarters here, if one strips out the Vietnam gain. So I was hoping you could also give us an update on the key drivers behind that year-to-date performance and sustainability going forward as we look to the back half.","Indra Nooyi","Yes. In terms of pricing, remember pricing as Hugh mentioned earlier, it\u2019s not an across the board pricing we just implement, it\u2019s done very surgically, innovation helps us drive pricing, in countries where we believe that inflation is high we take pricing to cover the inflation to the extent we can. We do a lot of revenue management in order to get pricing. So pricing is something we realized through surgical management of innovation, in market pricing, revenue management and very careful execution, based on the different channels. And the balance of the year, we feel comfortable that we can sustain pricing and our goal is to focus on value share always, because I think in categories that are slowing down in particular, focused just on volume is an unhealthy trend. So we are very, very careful to make sure that we carefully balance pricing with volume growth and not try to go for volume at all costs. And that\u2019s what really allowed us to get good revenue growth and get good pricing realization. ","Let me turn to Hugh to talk about the operating margin.","Hugh Johnston","Sure Dara, obviously we saw very good operating margin accretion in Q1 and then Q2 the number was 65 basis point, I think you will continue to see good operating and more improvement year-over-year as we progress through the coming quarters, I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s going to stay quite at the levels that we\u2019ve seen in the first two quarters of year. But I do think we\u2019re going to continue to see good operating margin improvement. And the big driver behind that of course is the $1 billion productivity program that we\u2019ve put out there, that productivity program directly attacks the $28 billion operating cost structure that we have and as we work through the productivity program, you are seeing and in fact flow through the bottom line which is why you\u2019re seeing good leverage from revenue down to EPS.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steve Powers with UBS.","Steve Powers - UBS","I guess maybe on the margins a little bit more. Overseas and really outside of the Americas you have made good progress on the profit growth and margin expansion this year in Europe especially. A bit less so though in EMEA, even adjusting for that Vietnam gain. Can you talk about the puts and takes there in each region perhaps, if you could, differentiating between progress in snacks versus beverages in each region? And maybe as you do, given that we have seen you re-franchise beverage businesses in China, Mexico and Vietnam recently, what is the likelihood that you might pursue similar efforts in other geographies whether Western Europe, Russia or India where you still hold the bottlers? Thanks.","Indra Nooyi","Thanks you for the question Steve. Again, we don\u2019t get into the puts and takes by region, but broadly speaking Europe has been relatively stable. Even those retail environment is difficult, geo-politically it\u2019s been stable year-over-year. And we put through productivity programs, we\u2019ve become more efficient in terms of how we run the whole region and that\u2019s why you saw improving margin trends. We have been one of the strong performers from a top line basis in Europe and again the complementarity of our categories is really helping drive traffic and top line growth at many retailers. I just had a series of talks with many European retailers and I must say looking at the numbers, we\u2019ve outperformed same store sales of many of those retailers by a significant factor. So I feel pretty good about the European trends. ","In the case of EMEA, parts of EMEA that are going to significant geopolitical issues. The Middle-East has got significant issues, we\u2019ve had the IQAMA issue in Saudi Arabia. ","So the reason you\u2019re seeing a little bit muted margin trends in EMEA is because we\u2019ve had to power through those geopolitical issues. Coupled with the facts that as we mentioned in our script, in China, we\u2019re going through the transition of our system into Tingyi and we want to make sure we don\u2019t rush it, we want to make sure we do it responsibly, we want to make sure we do it right because at the end of the day we are trying to build a very efficient and effective system. And we are making sure that we work constructively with our bottling partner Tingyi to end up with a system that really plays at its strength which is in almost 1.6 times the size of the next competitor. So that\u2019s really why you saw better margin expansion in Europe.","In terms of refranchising our business, where we think it makes sense, where we think our partner is stronger and where we think we have a partner, where we refranchise the business to ensure the continued health of the business, we will look at it. But if we believe that refranchising could jeopardize the business, we will not refranchise it. So we look at it on a case-by-case basis. In Vietnam, you saw that we did refranchise the business; in Mexico, where the business is performing very well. I mean countries where it makes sense, we do it. So stay tuned as we find interesting opportunities, we will be back to talk to you.","Operator","","Our next question comes from the line of Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs.","Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs","","So I just wanted to go back to maybe North America beverages and talk about the pricing environment. Clearly I think some of the industry participants have become a little bit more rational in terms of the pricing strategy. We are going to be -- start to lap the pretty heavy promotional period you saw a year ago around Labor Day. So just your thoughts on the competitive environment and the pricing outlook in North America CSD. And then secondarily, just thinking about the diet trends, and we are lapping a big decline that you started to see in a year ago period. So what are you seeing just in terms of now more consumer perception around the diet portfolio and your efforts to perhaps address that issue?","Indra Nooyi","","Pricing environment is just fine. I think that we have rational pricing and we\u2019ve always said we were going to price responsibly and we\u2019ve continued doing that and we\u2019re glad the industry is being responsible too. On the diet trends, I mean you\u2019ve seen the numbers Judy. We continue to see declines in diet and this is something that seems to continue.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Amit Sharma with BMO Capital Markets.","Amit Sharma - BMO Capital Markets ","","Indra, just wanted to quickly talk about Mexico, especially the beverage performance, pretty encouraging. Is that in-line with expectations that you will see year-over-year growth so soon after the higher tax implementation there? And also, does this reduce the threat of similar taxation efforts in the US or what you will model if some similar tax is adopted here?","Indra Nooyi","","On the Mexico beverage performance I think when we refranchised our business to the combination of Polar and GEUSA and created GEPP that company is performing very well. In market execution is excellent and they are doing a very good job. So I think the reason we are growing the business is because of superior execution. In the case of taxes in North America, the good news Amit is we have a total portfolio of carbonated, non-carbonated, full sugar, low sugar, all kinds of products. So from a consumer perspective if they shift from one category to another, there is always a PepsiCo product they can have for any need state, for any sugar level, for any taste, for any flavor. ","So I think that, that is the advantage of the PepsiCo portfolio. And incidentally, they can also pair it with a great snack. So we feel good about the complementarity of the portfolio, the breadth of the portfolio in North America and our goal is to make sure there are no discriminatory taxes but to work constructively with state governments and other organizations to make sure of whatever is done, is done responsibly.","Our final question comes from the line of Mark Swartzberg with Stifel Nicolaus.","Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus ","","Obviously you are not going to change the Company's view on a breakup in this call, but there are two data items I wanted to ask you about. One is on the corporate unallocated and how it is built up. Do you intend to share that build up? And then the second one is on the subject of dis-synergies, it's been a couple years now since you put a number out there, you put the $800 million to $1 billion number out there talking about separation related dis-synergies. Is that still in number you abide by? And do you have any plans, if it is a number you abide by, to share that build up?","","Indra Nooyi","Mark I was hoping you talked about the good quarter, but having said that, hoping unallocated we have given you the numbers, we have said that if you look at the total corporate cost, about half of it is compliance cost which is about the lowest of any company. The other half is either the vision cost we carry at corporate because we want to manage the volatility; for example like pension costs or commodity mark-to-market. The others, you know smaller bucket which is centrally driven capability cost because we want to make sure that we protect those costs and build the capability. So the numbers we put out remain unchanged. In terms of this synergy, there\u2019s no reason for those numbers to change. I mean we spent an incredible amount of time checking the ties on this and this is the conservative estimate. And this company is engineered as one, and we feel very comfortable about the vigor with which we analyzed the proposals and we stand by our 800 million to a billion-dollar number. So thank you for the question. ","So let me close by reiterating that we\u2019re pleased with our results for the first half.

Your lines have been placed on listen-only until the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Today\u2019s call is being recorded and will be archived at www.pepsico.com.","It is now my pleasure to introduce Mr. Ravi Pamnani, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Pamnani, you may begin.","Ravi Pamnani","Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. I\u2019m joined this morning by PepsiCo\u2019s Chairman and CEO, Ramon Laguarta; and PepsiCo\u2019s Vice Chairman and CFO, Hugh Johnston. We\u2019ll begin with some brief prepared comments from Ramon and Hugh and then open up the call to your questions.","Before we begin, please take note of our cautionary statement. We will make forward-looking statements on today\u2019s call, including about our business plans and 2019 guidance. Forward-looking statements inherently involve risks and uncertainties and reflect our view as of today and we are under no obligation to update.","When discussing our results, we refer to non-GAAP measures, which exclude certain items from reported results. Please refer to today\u2019s earnings release and 10-Q available on pepsico.com for definitions and reconciliations of non-GAAP measures and additional information regarding our results, including a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from forward-looking statements.","And now, it\u2019s my pleasure to introduce Ramon Laguarta.","Ramon Laguarta","Thank you, Ravi. Good morning, everyone. Before we get to our results, I would like to congratulate Ravi on his recent appointment to Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ravi has been with PepsiCo Investor Relations since 2012. Most of know \u2013 most of you know Ravi very well.","We\u2019re very pleased to have Ravi advanced to lead the IR function. Jamie Caulfield was recently appointed CFO for Frito-Lay North America. And we\u2019re glad that he\u2019ll continue to play a very important role in PepsiCo\u2019s finance organization and in the Frito-Lay business.","Now moving on to the results. We\u2019re very pleased with our results for the third quarter and year-to-date. Our top priorities entering 2019 were to accelerate our full-year rate of organic revenue growth and to position the business for sustained future growth, and we have good evidence that we\u2019ve made solid progress on both fronts.","In the third quarter, organic revenue increased 4.3%, lapping very strong 4.9% organic revenue growth during the third quarter of last year. And year-to-date, our organic revenue growth stands at 4.6%, an acceleration from 3.4% a year ago. So given the strength of our year-to-date performance and the solid momentum we\u2019re seeing in the business, we now expect to meet or exceed our 4% organic revenue growth target for the full-year.","Our strong performance in the third quarter was broad-based with organic revenue growth generated by each one of our divisions. Frito-Lay North America grew organic revenue 5.5%, driven by volume growth and net prize realization. Importantly, the business is not only growing, but winning in the marketplace versus competition.","In the quarter and year-to-date, Frito-Lay is growing value share in salty, savory and macro snack categories. Investments we\u2019ve made in innovation, marketing and consumer insights and manufacturing and go-to-market capacity are providing benefits across the brand portfolio with strong net revenue growth in our large mainstream brands like Doritos, Cheetos, Ruffles and Fritos and double-digit growth in our smaller premium brands such as Bare and Off the Eaten Path.","The breadth of our growth was also evidenced across every key retail channel, with gains in grocery, mass, club, convenience, foodservice and e-commerce.","Turning to PepsiCo Beverages North America. We\u2019re very encouraged by the 3% organic revenue growth we generated in the quarter, driven by solid net price realization, the result of effective revenue management execution. Our third quarter growth accelerated sequentially from the second quarter and was on top of 2.5% organic revenue growth achieved in the third quarter of 2018.","The business is benefiting from improved local market focus and execution driven by our streamlined field structure, increased go-to-market capacity and significant step-up advertising support and innovation. We\u2019re especially pleased with the performance of Gatorade, which generated mid single-digit net revenue growth and improved sequential market share performance.","Innovation has played a big role in Gatorade\u2019s performance, led by Gatorade Zero, which has surpassed $0.5 billion in retail sales since its launch in May of last year. And we recently launched Bolt24, a new functional beverage that supports athletes around the clock by providing advanced all-day hydration.","Other key parts of the business also continued to show progress. Trademark Pepsi posted its fifth consecutive quarter of net revenue growth and Bubly has continued to post very strong growth and is gaining share in the flavored sparkling water category aided by packaging and flavor innovation. Other notable highlights include double-digit net revenue growth for LIFEWTR and Propel and high single-digit net revenue growth for Pure Leaf Tea and Starbucks.","Rounding out our North American performance, Quaker Foods delivered net revenue growth in the quarter propelled by our light snacks, Aunt Jemima syrup and mix, Roni and Near East businesses. With our advertising and marketing having increased in the quarter and year-to-date, we remain focused on accelerating growth at Quaker Foods.","Before we move on to international, I want to note the terrific work our supply chain and customer teams are doing in North America with our snacks and beverages businesses, receiving the two top ranking in the 2019 U.S. Advantage Survey for Food Multichannel Report. This is one of the annual surveys, where retailers across multiple channels provide feedback on how suppliers are performing with respect to strategy, people, category development, marketing, supply chain, customer service and e-commerce.","Moving beyond North America. Each of our international divisions delivered solid organic revenue growth in the third quarter, despite ongoing macroeconomic volatility in certain markets. Notably, organic revenue in our developing and emerging markets increased 7%. This included double-digit growth in Mexico, Saudi Arabia, China, Turkey and Pakistan, and high single-digit growth in India, Egypt, Poland and Colombia.","Our international results reflect the benefits of our increased investments, as we continue to leverage our global capabilities to drive higher per capita consumption and improved market share, while executing in locally relevant ways.","PepsiCo\u2019s performance today gives us confidence that the strategy we laid out in February to become faster, stronger and better is working. Importantly, we\u2019re balancing our investments to both drive results in the short-term and position our business for sustained long-term performance.","Becoming faster is about winning in the marketplace, being more consumer-centric and accelerated investment for top line growth. For example, we\u2019ve increased our investment in advertising and marketing by 12% year-to-date. This investment spans across many of our big brands and geographies, as well as support for innovation and emerging brands, which we will continue to develop over time.","We\u2019re invested to increase the capacity and reach of our go-to-market systems with substantial investments in new routes, merchandising racks and coolers, and we\u2019re investing in additional manufacturing capacity to remove bottlenecks and expand growth capacity for our brands. This includes investments in new plants, new lines and added distribution infrastructure.","Becoming stronger is about transforming our capabilities, cost and culture by operating as One PepsiCo leveraging technology and winning globally and locally. For example, we\u2019re making significant investments in capabilities like data analytics and systems to digitalize the company to achieve precision at scale, which is to execute in every store with precisely the right products at the right price.","To do so, we\u2019re capturing and analyzing more granular consumer level data to build true consumer intimacy, that is understanding the consumer in a much more personal way, to move from thinking of consumers in groups of millions, to understand in-depth the household or individual level by leveraging robust data from multiple sources. Using this information, we\u2019re increasingly structuring personalized communication and satisfying demand at the store level.","We also continue to strengthen our omni-channel capabilities, particularly in e-commerce, where our retail sales are expected to be nearly $2 billion in 2019. We\u2019re building on this success by investing further in our go-to-market and supply chain systems to capitalize on more opportunities in today\u2019s dynamic retail environment. And we\u2019re elevating our talent and fostering a culture, where employees act like owners with a greater sense of empowerment and accountability.","To fund these investments in capability and culture, we\u2019re driving efficiency throughout the enterprise and we remain on track to deliver our target of $1 billion in annual productivity savings in 2019.","And finally, becoming better reflects our aspiration to integrate purpose into our business strategy and brands. With this in mind, we\u2019re embracing a set of focused initiatives to help build a more sustainable food system. And I\u2019d like to spend a little extra time this morning to share with you what we\u2019re focusing on.","First is advancing environmental, social and economic benefits to farmers and communities by promoting more sustainable agriculture. Through our sustainable farming program in 2018, we achieved a key milestone with over half our farmer-sourced agricultural raw materials, like potatoes, whole corn, oranges and oats, verified as sustainability sourced. Our aim is to reach 100% by the end of 2020.","Second is improving water stewardship across our businesses and in the regions where we operate. We\u2019re striving to improve water use efficiency and aiming to replenish 100% of the water we consume for manufacturing in high water risk areas by 2025.","Third is delivering our vision of a world, where plastic packaging need never become waste. We recently unveiled a new target to reduce 35% of virgin plastic content across our beverage brands by 2025, driven by increased use of recycled content and alternative packaging materials.","Fourth is improving choices across our portfolio by continuing to reduce added sugars, sodium and saturated fats in many of our products. We currently offer several choices that address this objective, including Pepsi Zero Sugar, Lay\u2019s Baked, whole fruit and multigrain, Tropicana Whole Fruit and Sunbites Veggie Harvest. And we will continue to expand our offerings of more nutritional options.","Our fifth focus area is mitigating the impact of climate change by curbing greenhouse gas emissions across all our value chain with an ambitious goal to reduce absolute greenhouse gas emissions across our value chain by 20% by 2030.","And lastly, we\u2019re working to support our associates and society by advancing respect for human rights, promoting diversity and inclusion in our workplace and increasing the earnings potential of women in our communities. This is a journey with a lot of work ahead of us, but we want all of our stakeholders to know that advancing to sustainability and being a more purposeful company will play an essential role in PepsiCo\u2019s future.","For more details on how we\u2019re integrating sustainability into our business and our brands, we encourage you to read our most recent sustainability report.","And now, I\u2019ll hand it off to Hugh.","Hugh Johnston","Thank you, Ramon, and good morning, everyone. As Ramon noted earlier, we now expect organic revenue growth to meet or exceed our previous objective of 4% growth for the full-year. We continue to expect our core constant currency earnings per share to decline approximately 1%, as we plan to continue to invest in our business for the long-term.","All other guidance measures provided remain unchanged, including a core effective tax rate of approximately 21%, free cash flow of approximately $5 billion and total cash return to shareholders of approximately $8 billion, comprised of dividends of approximately $5 billion and share repurchases of approximately $3 billion.","With respect to the fourth quarter, please keep the following in mind as you build out your models. First, our asset division will be lapping gains from a refranchising and a strategic asset sale; and second, the higher investments in the business will continue, and you will see this again reflected in both our operating margin performance and core EPS.","Now, we\u2019ll open it up to questions. Operator, we\u2019ll take the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley.","Dara Mohsenian","Hey, good morning.","Ramon Laguarta","Good morning, Dara.","Dara Mohsenian","So it looks like in Frito-Lay North America, organic sales growth is probably on track for 5% or even better this full-year based on the year-to-date trends. That\u2019d be the best growth we\u2019ve seen in a decade. So I was just hoping you could give us a bit of postmortem on what\u2019s driven the acceleration year-to-date?","How much is improved category growth versus building Pepsi market share momentum? And given the acceleration over the last year appears to be more driven by pricing, how sustainable is the momentum as you cycle higher pricing in Q4 and beyond? And then just last, with the capacity additions to supply chain work you\u2019re doing on the Frito-Lay side in North America this year? Should that have an appreciable impact on volume or mix as we look out to 2020? Thanks.","Ramon Laguarta","Thank you, Dara. This is a long question, good question. The performance of Frito is, I think, is very holistic, right, what\u2019s driving the performance and it\u2019s, I guess, a combination of increased A&M, increased capacity, we put more routes. And we made some choices around what are the priority brands and non-priority brands and that\u2019s driving the overall business performance.","We\u2019re gaining share and the category is also very healthy. Of course, we\u2019re a big part of the category. So we\u2019re driving the attractiveness on the category as well with our increased advertising, very good innovation across the big brands and the small brand.","So I think it\u2019s a good performance, both in terms of maintaining the attractiveness of the category and making sure our customers continue to see growth, even by adding this category, which is critical for our customers. And then we\u2019re gaining share, because we have, I guess, a very broad portfolio that plays across all the different consumer segment. And the team is doing a fantastic job in terms of building the brand and developing the innovation. So, a holistic set of reasons why this business is continuing to perform at a very high level compared to other consumer packaged goods in the United States.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Bryan Spillane","Hey, good morning, everyone. I had a question, I guess, around NAV. And I think as you started this year, the investment was in a few different areas, one being marketing and product, another being in route, and then also in packaging, like getting mini cans into the market, I guess.","And I guess, specific to CSD, where do you feel you are in the process of having all those investments in place and the effect of those in the marketplace? I guess, currently in \u2013 like how much more is there to go to in terms of having that drive some improvement in market share, as we go into next year?","Ramon Laguarta","Yes. Good morning, Bryan. The success of our beverage business is in continuing to drive the \u2013 the whole portfolio, the non-carbonated portfolio. So we need to continue to do a great job in our teas, our waters, our teas, our sports drinks and then obviously improve the performance in CSDs. We\u2019re seeing progress across all of those multiple objectives, which is quite complex to manage, right.","So we\u2019re seeing as continue to gain share in what are the critical strategic categories for ads and doing very well with some of our critical brands like Pepsi. As we discussed last quarter, we still have a pending matter in Mountain Dew. The Mountain Dew is improving, but it\u2019s not to the levels that we would like to see.","So that\u2019s the focus of the team for the next few quarters to make sure that we get you back to a what we think is a more sustainable performance. But we\u2019re happy with the growth we\u2019re having in all the other categories. We\u2019re happy with the way Pepsi\u2019 is performing.","And as I said on my remarks, we\u2019re very happy with Gatorade. And with the performance of Gatorade in the sports drinks category, this quarter reflects both the additional investment we\u2019ve made on core Gatorade, the great innovation behind Zero, which is really a very well received incremental innovation to the category, and now we\u2019re starting to make some additional investments in that category with Bolt24. We\u2019re testing and learning and there will be a bigger roll out of that brand next year.","So, overall, we feel good. Again, Mountain Dew continues to be the pending matter, But we feel good about the ideas we have, the resources we have allocated to this brand and how the teams are thinking about Mountain Dew for the future.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ali Dibadj of Sanford Bernstein.","Ali Dibadj","Hi, guys. So I have two questions. One is on CapEx specifically, clearly is signal that going up. I want to better understand please the CapEx obviously in FLNA, you had mentioned increased capacity. But in PBNA, in particular, and where you are and rolling that out, because if it\u2019s things like your competitors doing in North America like in-store displays like coolers, like more efficient routes, like more efficient vehicles, there\u2019s a lag before you get that benefit. So I want to get a sense of what you expect the benefit on the CapEx, again, particularly in PBNA to start coming through going forward?","And then the second question is around Latin America, Latin America foods and I\u2019m sure with Jamie going there CFO. I won\u2019t have to ask about it again. But it looked like it slowed a little bit, goes on the top line, the bottom line, you can add any color there. That\u2019d be helpful? Thank you.","Ramon Laguarta","Let\u2019s start with Latin America. I already said, Jamie is going to Frito-Lay North America, Latin America as a separate division, but regardless. The Latin America performance continues to be very strong. Mexico is growing double digits. There was a \u2013 we had a lap in our Brazil business last year. We had the drivers strike, remember, in Brazil, then we had a very strong June or lapping that June this year. The business in Brazil is back to very good performance in the back of the quarter and into the Q4.","So we don\u2019t see any deceleration. The biggest challenge obviously in Latin America is Argentina. You guys read the news every day. It\u2019s a very volatile environment with the currency devaluation and then we\u2019re having to adjust to \u2013 in our affordability levels with a consumer. So that \u2013 that\u2019s the biggest challenge in Latin America, but it\u2019s not meaningful enough to \u2013 for the overall Latin America performance now that\u2019s there.","In terms of NAB, as you said, we\u2019re \u2013 I think, it is the same answer as with Frito. We\u2019re trying to make investment in a very holistic way, so that we drive performance with no bottleneck. So we\u2019re investing in the brands, both in the large brands, but also in the smaller brands in PBNA. We\u2019re investing in routes. We\u2019re investing in coolers and marketplace, cooling infrastructure, which drives our business and drives our profitability. And yes, we\u2019re seeing the performance. As you see, it\u2019s a \u2013 3% is a very good performance for NAB.","We think that \u2013 or we still have opportunities to do better than that, and we\u2019ll continue to fight for that for that performance. So again, it\u2019s holistic CapEx investments across all the leavers of grills that will make a successful long-term.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer of Cowen.","Vivien Azer","Hi, good morning.","Ramon Laguarta","So I wanted to follow-up please on the commentary that you just offered on NAB and the continued improvement. With the CSD volumes down 3%, I mean, I think, from a fundamental perspective, it is a structurally challenged category. So what do you think is reasonable from a volume perspective? What does success look like on the CSD component of the segment? Thank you.","Ramon Laguarta","Yes, great. As we discussed last quarter, I think, there is a \u2013 I think a structural change in consumer demand and this category is moving to a smaller format, different formats that drive a different volume, net revenue construction here. So the net revenue of CSD is up. Part of that is pricing, but a lot of that is mix and is mix driven by obviously as becoming, I would say, more insightful in what are the different occasions that consumers are buying our products and offering the best pack for those locations.","But also, I think there is a fundamental change in demand or consumers are going for smaller packs. And that\u2019s driving a change in the price per liter of the category and price per unit. So that is the \u2013 and to reiterate into that to what Ali asked before, that drives some of the CapEx as well. So we\u2019re investing capacity for those smaller formats and we\u2019re seeing the return in higher pricing.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Andrea Teixeira of JPMorgan.","Andrea Teixeira","Hi, good morning, and congrats to Jamie and Ravi on the new assignment.","Ravi Pamnani","Thank you, Andrea.","Andrea Teixeira","So very \u2013 you\u2019re welcome. Thank you for everything. So very top down on international and in particular because of your experience, Ramon. I was thinking like the international growth has been accelerating. And I was hoping to hear, how do you feel about both beverages and snacks consumption going forward, given the macro volatility? And also if you can, I think, we haven\u2019t heard about Mountain Dew on the beverage side. So if you can kind of explain if investments might be going to that \u2013 into that brand as well going forward?","Ramon Laguarta","Okay, let me start with international. It is a volatile, macroeconomic and political situation and more and more geopolitical and the macroeconomic discipline. And if you go, our larger businesses are performing very well. I mean, like Mexico is growing double-digit, Russia is having a very good year. We see high growth, double-digit in China, very high growth in India. Even Saudi Arabia was a challenge for us, it\u2019s going back to double-digit.","So we\u2019re seeing, from the demand point of view, we\u2019re seeing a very, still very strong demand to our, what are our categories. Part of that is, we\u2019re gaining share in many of these markets. Part of that is still the categories are very \u2013 not not very developed and consumers continue to come to our categories as we offer more innovative products and more affordable products.","So far, we\u2019re not seeing a reduction in demand for our categories on a global level. There are some markets where we\u2019re seeing the consumers acting a little bit differently. For example, the UK is one where we\u2019re seeing the consumers a little bit \u2013 a little more defensive, as you know, with all the political uncertainty there. We\u2019re seeing obviously, Argentina, as I said, Venezuela, we\u2019ve been there for many years now.","But we don\u2019t see and they have a fundamental change of demand, let\u2019s say, in the last few months versus the beginning of the year or last year. We\u2019re seeing the categories still growing very healthy and the demand come into our categories in good, I would say, good positive levels, right.","So that Mountain Dew, I said, the \u2013 it is our pending subject. It is a focus of the organization. And we\u2019re, I think, the brand is well-resourced at this point and it\u2019s going to be down to having the right ideas and execute in the right \u2013 the ideas with quality. And as we\u2019re becoming a better execution company, I think, that will happen.","As we talk \u2013 it is a brand that is in the intersection of CSDs and energy. And it\u2019s not as easier problem to solve in terms of maintaining the relevance and the consumer high awareness for this brand compared to some of the other \u2013 the new trends that are happening in energy. So that\u2019s work for us to do. But I would say is \u2013 the brand is flat at this point. And we\u2019ll continue to invest to make it a positive brand for us in the coming quarters.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Caroline Levy of Macquarie","Caroline Levy","Good morning, and congrats, Ravi, and as Jamie is in the room, too, listening.","Ramon Laguarta","Good morning.","Caroline Levy","I was wondering if you \u2013 good morning. I was wondering if you could elaborate a little bit on your SodaStream and the opportunity there. I mean, just given, I think, priority number one for many, many companies now seems to be reducing plastic. And then, what is the cost of recycling investments that you see hope, you view as a corporate having to make alongside, but perhaps states and governments? And then what role the SodaStream play, particularly in the U.S., just because it hasn\u2019t really taken off in the way it has in parts of Europe?","Ramon Laguarta","Yes. It\u2019s a great question. And it\u2019s \u2013 we made a strategic bet, right, when we decided to go by SodaStream. We saw this potential consumer change stores on plastic beverages in part of the world. And also we saw that SodaStream adds the opportunities for consumers to personalize their drinks or add a personal touch to their drink.","So the good news is that, SodaStream is driven very well. And it\u2019s doing better than what we had in our business case for M&A. So it continues to be very successful across multiple parts of the world. So, obviously, Western Europe, what is started is very, very strong, Germany, France, Holland, Central, Northern Europe as well. It is strong in Japan. It is very strong in Canada. And there is some opportunities in the U.S., which we\u2019re making some organizational changes or upgrading talent.","We\u2019re leveraging obviously the customer relationships that we have with our PepsiCo business to open some new relationships and we are innovating a lot. You will see some, I think, some transformational progress for SodaStream next year in the U.S. that I think \u2013 I\u2019m very optimistic about the step change in household penetration that will give us. But overall, this is the huge strategic opportunity for us as a company.","We\u2019re realizing, I think, part of that opportunity. We\u2019re adding some of the knowledge from PepsiCo to SodaStream. And that will make that company better in a very, very innovation and design of the machines and some technologies direct-to-consumer. So I think SodaStream will be a better company as part of PepsiCo and PepsiCo will be a better company by having SodaStream and being able to address that potential consumer opportunity. So good news on the financial short-term delivery and I think very good news coming for us in the future with this new business.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog of Wells Fargo.","Bonnie Herzog","Hi, thank you. Good morning. I\u2019m actually\u2026","Ramon Laguarta","Good morning.","Bonnie Herzog","\u2026good morning, I did want to ask on gross margin, which has really been quite impressive this year. So kind of wondering how we should think about the margins through the end of the year, especially given the tough comp year lapping in Q4? And then could you highlight some of the key puts and takes for margins, especially as we look into next year, you\u2019re definitely going to be facing some tough gross margin compares in 2020. So any color on how you\u2019re looking at lap those, particularly if FX headwind amounts, that would be helpful? Thanks.","Hugh Johnston","Good morning, Bonnie. It\u2019s Hugh. Yes, a couple comments on on margin. Number one, obviously, we\u2019ve gotten very good price realization across the company this year. As we get into Q4, we will start to lap some of the pricing that we took in Q4 of last year. So we\u2019ll get less of a pricing benefit to gross margins.","Regarding commodities, nothing notable there. As you know, we have our four buying program on commodity. So we have good line of sight into what we will see there and no notable change versus year-to-date. And then last, obviously, our productivity has been quite strong this year. We\u2019ll continue to see that in Q4. So gross margins will certainly continue to be positive as we move forward. But do note that the pricing benefit toward gross margins will be less as we enter the quarter.","Regarding 2020 and forward, I think it\u2019s best if we talk about that holistically as a part of our 2020 guidance, which we\u2019ll get to in February.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rob Ottenstein of Evercore.","Robert Ottenstein","Great. Thank you very much. Ramon, you touched on it a little bit in terms of consumers moving to smaller packs for CSDs. But I was just wondering if you could kind of step back and and give us your assessment of where the U.S. consumer is on health and wellness-related issues, sugar, artificial sweeteners, and what your company strategy is on that? And then one of the reasons why I\u2019m asking it is, Gatorade Zero doing really well, great product, and then \u2013 but then you come out with the Bolt24. And if I recollect quite a bit of sugar in that, which was a little bit surprising to me. So I\u2019m just trying to understand where you see the consumer and how you\u2019re responding to it. Thank you very much.","Ramon Laguarta","Right, the question \u2013 great question, and it\u2019s critical to our strategy, right? So when we talked about our strategy in February, we said we\u2019re going to play against each one of the vectors of demand in our categories and not all the health and wellness, but every vector of demand.","So we\u2019re seeing the consumer and he\u2019s not only snacks, but beverages and the two categories. We\u2019re seeing the consumer going after functionality, going after health and wellness, but also going after indulgence and going to many spaces in the convenience, association. So a lot of different vectors that drive consumer preference and choices. And then, obviously, a very important vector, which is price. So premium value and mainstream being a very important segmentation as consumers make choices.","So we\u2019re \u2013 we \u2013 the decision we made is that, we\u2019ve gone to either consumer maximum choice against each one of the vectors and we\u2019re trying to capture demand from all of the different occasions throughout the day. That \u2013 that\u2019s the only way we\u2019re going to keep our share, continue to grow and we\u2019re going to be successful in our category. So that\u2019s where we\u2019re seeing.","The trend towards small packs is not only in beverages, it is also in snacks. And actually, it has been going on in snacks for several years as well, where our variety packs in Frito-Lay are growing very fast. And then internationally, by far, our smaller packs are the number one packaging of choice for consumers.","Then to the point on Gatorade, yes, Zero is great. Zero has been a great addition to the category to the brand. It is capturing consumers that I think were very heavy users of Gatorade and had abandoned the brand because of the calories. So it\u2019s been a great addition. It\u2019s putting the brand back as a relevant brand to many more consumers as they exercise or do other activities. And it\u2019s expanding the brand, I think, is structurally and will give us, I think, a lot of great moments going forward.","Bolt24 is a very low calorie product and is not no added sugars, and it\u2019s all this sugar that is in the \u2013 basically the watermelon water that is that is kind of the base of the product. Obviously, we reserve the right to have a Zero Bolt24 going forward. I think at this point, the brand is positioned for athletes of the field and you will see innovation around functionality more than sugar, no sugar, but very, very low sugar levels, actually much lower than competitors in that space for sure. And I think is the right way to launch the brand. It is below 100 calories per bottle, so it\u2019s 80 calories. So it\u2019s very, very, a very healthy balance between taste, functionality and sugar levels.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Laurent Grandet of Guggenheim.","Laurent Grandet","Hey, good morning, Ramon and Hugh. Hey, a question on Quaker. Quaker\u2019s trend seems to be getting better, second quarter in a row that \u2013 of organic growth at Quaker something not seen since 2016, if I\u2019m correct. So could you please give us more granularity in those results, especially it\u2019s not necessary what we are seeing in instant data? And how sustainable this trend is in your view?","And also, I mean, this growth seems to be coming at the expense of operating income, which seems to be a change of strategy versus the last few years? Should we think about the gross margins to continue to compress to sustain the growth here? Thank you.","Ramon Laguarta","Good question, Laurent. Of course, we want our \u2013 each one of our businesses to be a positive growth business. So Quaker no difference. We will continue to invest to make sure that business continues to grow, maybe not at the levels that we have Frito-Lay, but yes, good levels.","We\u2019ve done several things with that business. One is, we invested a bit more both in CapEx and kind of cost of goods, specifically in the area of improving the formulation of our Quaker products. So we\u2019ve eliminated all the artificials. Now it\u2019s only natural. And I think that will do well for the brand going forward, although, it\u2019s quite an important investment in terms of cost of goods. So that\u2019s why you\u2019re seeing the operating \u2013 the gross margin reducing a little bit in Quaker.","In terms of the breadth of growth, it is across all the different brands that make up that business. So it is our oats, but it\u2019s also our life snacks, which I think have tremendous potential. It\u2019s part of Aunt Jemima. It\u2019s part of the convenient foods in \u2013 with Near East. So it\u2019s a broad growth. And I think it\u2019s sustainable as we put a bit more focus on the brands, the innovation and the execution of those particular brands.","The fact that we\u2019ve put this business under the Frito-Lay organization, so they report to Williams. Now he will bring more operational excellence to that organization in terms of both supply chain and sales and I think that per se will drive growth as we execute better. So I would say, again, holistic, look at the business starting from innovation brands. And in this case execution as well being a big lever, I think, of potential future performance.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Grundy of Jefferies.","Kevin Grundy","Hey, thanks. Good morning.","Ramon Laguarta","Good morning.","Kevin Grundy","Question on the Pioneer Foods deal and then M&A more broadly. So the Pioneer deal announced back in mid-July, I understand it hasn\u2019t closed yet. But perhaps a little background how the deal came together and why Pioneer is the right asset to accelerate growth in the sub-Saharan Africa region? And then more broadly, Ramon, on M&A. Is it fair to say that international and food snacks is where investors should expect to see capital deployed going forward from an M&A perspective? Thank you.","Ramon Laguarta","Yes. Listen, Pioneer is \u2013Africa is a continent of the next 30 years. So we\u2019re putting a capital against a market opportunity that will deliver itself in the next 20 years.","What Pioneer gives us is more scale in a continent where you\u2019re successful, not only because of you have good products, but you need to have very good infrastructure, very good, go-to-market, very good manufacturing clearly closer to the consumer and very good talent.","I think, from Pioneer, we get a very good set of brands across multiple categories, starting with basic food and \u2013 but going all the way to more sophisticated breakfast solutions and juice solutions. It gives us great talent, great local talent that understands how to operate in Africa. It gives us scale for our go-to-market and these will help our beverages and our snack businesses. And it gives us a good operating efficiency as we integrate all these businesses.","So it is a good investment for us. Why Pioneers? We\u2019ve been looking at different options, obviously, over time. And Pioneer, we\u2019ve \u2013 we\u2019re a good friend for many years with the Pioneer team and the opportunity came as of recently. So, it is a strategic geography for us from, I would say, Horizon 3, not Horizon 1 or 2, but Horizon 3. And we think it was going to be a very, very strategic investment for us going forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Amit Sharma of BMO Capital Markets.","Amit Sharma","Hi, good morning, everyone.","Ramon Laguarta","Good morning.","Amit Sharma","Ramon, a follow-up to, I think, Dara\u2019s question earlier about pricing in FLNA, like clearly pricing-driven, but just about how sustainable that is going forward? And then broadly for Hugh, we clearly hear you on small packages and innovation in beverages. But as you look at your overall portfolio, do you feel like you have the brand to meet the evolving consumer demand, or do you need to look at M&A for your beverage portfolio as well?","Ramon Laguarta","Yes, I\u2019ll talk about the brands and then maybe Hugh can talk about the other part of the question. I think we have a very good portfolio actually in North America to cover both existing demands and future demands, right? So if you think about our CSD brands, when you think about water brands with LIFEWTR, Bubly, Aquafina, if you think about our coffee, Starbucks, if you think about our teas, Pure Leaf, I mean, we have the newly acquired value-added dairy business, SodaStream going forward.","So we have, I think, a very broad portfolio to cover both existing demands, future demands. And as I said, indulgent functional hydration, I mean multiple occasions around the day and today\u2019s demand and future demand, weather we\u2019ll need some smaller brands to add to their portfolio, like we have KeVita or some other smaller brands, we\u2019ll see as we go forward. They will not be meaningful to the overall breakdown of the portfolio that I think we have the big brands that we need to take the business forward and those brands can innovate into multiple spaces, right?","So I mean, that\u2019s the beauty. So Gatorade can see the beautiful brand that has been playing on part of the market. Now we take it to another part of the market and we generate $500 million of additional revenue in one year now. So I think we have the brands that we need to keep those brands very relevant, keep them modern, keep them attractive to the consumer as the new generations come into the marketplace, and then we need to keep innovating into new spaces under the umbrella of those brands and they\u2019re broad enough brands that can cover multiple spaces.","So I would not, I think, we\u2019re very well positioned better than our competition, I think, in that space. And then we\u2019ll have to, as I said, keep innovating and keep building the brand into more modern ways of communicating. But it\u2019s, I think, we\u2019re very well positioned to capture today\u2019s demand and future demand. And Hugh, do you want to talk about the other part?","Hugh Johnston","Yes, regarding Frito-Lay. I\u2019m at a couple of things to keep in mind. Number one, the Sabra business. We include Sabra in our volume, but not in our revenue. It\u2019s not a consolidated venture. So we do capture volume, but not revenue. Sabra is growing below the Frito-Lay average and the product is quite heavy.","If you back out Sabra, that\u2019s worth 0.5 a point. So the 1.5 volume is actually two points of volume if you back out Sabra. That relates more directly to the 5.5 Frito-Lay revenue. So that leaves you about 3.5 points of price mix. Obviously, pricing was a bit higher this year than what we\u2019ve seen on average over the last couple of years, but not dramatically.","So and mix is clearly a tailwind as well as we move more of the portfolio into premium products. So I think you\u2019ll see numbers that are pretty consistent with that relationship. Once you back out Sabra maybe a little bit less, but not dramatically so in the Frito-Lay business.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Bill Chappell of SunTrust.","Bill Chappell","Thanks. Good morning.","Ramon Laguarta","Good morning.","Bill Chappell","Just looking at Gatorade, in particular, I mean, great that it\u2019s turned around? And is it as simple as saying just long overdue and putting a Zero cal version out there? And if that\u2019s the right way to look at it, I mean, is that resident in the whole business? And maybe you were a little too conservative, a little too slow to some of the changes and some things can be done to kind of accelerate the beverage business from going forward?","Ramon Laguarta","It\u2019s not \u2013 we feel \u2013 good morning. We didn\u2019t say it was the only lever, right, it\u2019s multiple leavers that we\u2019re playing to make Gatorade successful. And we changed some packaging, we improved our communication, we improved our execution on kind of the broad Gatorade brand and then we added innovation, which normally it is a big lever of acceleration, right?","If you hit the right innovation in this big brands, that is really a big, big, big lever. We\u2019re looking at hydration as a holistic opportunity and we have Gatorade. We have Propel. We have Bolt24. So we\u2019re looking at different solutions for different type of consumers there. We\u2019re looking at direct-to-consumer solutions for Gatorade. We\u2019re looking at other ways of personalizing consumption for Gatorade to make sure our kind of value added to the consumer is higher, more personalized.","So, I didn\u2019t mean to say that it was only launching zero. And that was \u2013 it\u2019s a much broader set of efforts across the organization to make sure that we continue to be the preferred house of solutions for sports drinks, Gatorade being one part, again, Propel is growing very fast. And it\u2019s a great solution for low calorie hydration. And the same now with Bolt24 we expect to innovate going forward.","So that we\u2019re looking at this opportunity and physical performance is a big going forward consumer need that I think we want to participate not only with hydration, maybe other solutions as well.","Ramon Laguarta","So thank you all for your time and participation in this morning\u2019s call. To conclude, summarizing, we\u2019re pleased with our results in the third quarter and we now expect to meet or exceed our original target for our full-year organic net revenue growth. We\u2019re executing well against our key priorities. And especially, we thank you all for your confidence you\u2019ve placed in us with your investment.

Your lines have been placed on listen-only until the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Today's call is being recorded and will be archived at www.pepsico.com.","It is now my pleasure to introduce Mr. Jamie Caulfield, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Caulfield, you may begin.","Jamie Caulfield","Thank you, operator and good morning everyone. I'm joined this morning by PepsiCo's Chairman and CEO, Ramon Laguarta and PepsiCo's Vice Chairman and CFO Hugh Johnston. We'll begin today's call with some brief prepared comments from Ramon and Hugh and then we'll open the call up to your questions.","Before we begin, please take note of our cautionary statement. This conference call includes forward-looking statements, including statements regarding 2019 guidance and long-term targets, based on currently available information. Forward-looking statements inherently involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those predicted.

You should refer to the glossary and other attachments to this morning's earnings release and to the Investor section of PepsiCo's website under the earnings information tab to find full explanations and reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures.","And now it's my pleasure to introduce Ramon Laguarta.","Ramon Laguarta","Thank you, Jamie. Good morning everyone. About two months ago, we shared with you in some detail our priorities for the business and our financial goals for 2019. So today we're keeping our prepared comments short, just touching on the highlights for the quarter, and then we will leave enough time to get to all your questions.","I'll start by simply saying that we're very pleased with our results for the first quarter. Our rate of organic revenue growth accelerated to 5.2%, our highest rate of quarterly growth in more than three years.","This top line performance was broad based, with particularly strong organic revenue growth at Frito-Lay North America, which grew 6% and our international divisions, while negatively affected on a quarterly basis by FOREX and refranchising, delivered organic revenue growth of 8% in ESSA and 10% in both Latin America and AMENA.","We also had solid growth and continued progress at PepsiCo beverages North America where organic revenue was up 2.5% in the quarter. We invested as planned across our businesses and these included a double digit increase in advertising and marketing. And our productivity and restructuring actions were implemented according to plan.","Our strong performance in the quarter is emblematic of a number of key strengths in the business. Amongst then, the health and resilience of our categories, our leading brands, a broad based portfolio capable of evolving to satisfy consumer thesis and while develop geographic footprints with some positions in our largest markets, suite of strong and relevant capabilities across the value chain, scale that allow us to run our operations very efficiently. And of course, our highly engaged and motivated associates, we execute every day in a way that enables us to win in the marketplace.","So with strong start to the year and one quarter under our belt, we remain confident in achieving the 2019 financial goals we shared with you two months ago. Looking ahead, we're staying focused on the priorities we share with you in February. Namely, to accelerate our top line growth in a sustainable way, to compete more effectively to win in most of our markets and more rapidly evolve our capabilities to widen our advantages versus the competition.","To achieve these objectives, we're focused on becoming faster, stronger and better. We'll become faster by being more consumer centric and accelerating investment for top line growth and winning in the marketplace. This means, broadening our portfolio and packaging formats to win locally, fortifying our North American business businesses by investing in Frito-Lay North America and PepsiCo Beverages North America, and accelerating our international expansion with a discipline focus on right to win markets.","We'll become stronger by transforming our capabilities and our culture. This means, driving savings through holistic cost management, to reinvest in the marketplace. Developing and scaling the core capabilities necessary to better understand and meet new consumer trends, strengthen our brands and improve customer service and building a differentiated organization, talent base and culture.","And finally, we'll become better by integrating our purpose agenda into our business strategy with a particular focus on four critical initiatives.","First, advancing farming practices to optimize crop yields, protect human rights, improve farmer livelihoods and secure supplier; second, replenishing more water than we use in water stress areas; third, creating a circular economy for plastics and fourth, increasing the appeal of our products by reducing added sugars, sodium unsaturated fats and adding more positive ingredients. The entire organization from the board to our frontline is moving forward with urgency and we look forward to updating you on our progress as the year progresses.","And now let me hand it off to Hugh.","Hugh Johnston","Thank you Ramon and good morning everyone. I have just a few comments on the balance of your outlook.","As we mentioned in the release, we are reiterating each of the components of our 2019 guidance, namely, we continue to expect organic revenue growth of 4%, a core effective tax rate of approximately 21%, core constant currency EPS to decline approximately 1%, free cash flow of approximately $5 billion and total cash returned to shareholders of approximately $8 billion comprised of dividends of approximately $5 billion and share repurchases of approximately $3 billion.","With both organic revenue growth and core constant currency EPS drop, higher in Q1 than in our full year targets, that implies the growth rate for the balance of the year will be below the Q1 growth rates. So let me address how you should think about that starting with the top line.","First, the rate of organic revenue growth at FLNA inQ1 was extraordinary. We don't expect that rate of growth to continue for the balance of the year. And second, Q1 represented our easiest lap of the year, so balance of year laps will be more difficult, especially in the back half of the year.","From an EPS perspective, you should consider the following. One, in Q1 we had the benefit of lapping the onetime frontline bonus from 2018 and we also benefited from approximately $50 million of insurance recoveries in the current year. Two, over the balance of the year we will be lapping gains from various strategic asset sales, and we're franchising gains and insurance recoveries, most notably in Q2.","Three, our rate of net commodity inflation, which includes the impact of transactional foreign exchange, is expected to accelerate in the second quarter and finally, our pace of planned reinvestment will accelerate over the course of the year and you will see this reflected both in core EPS, as well as in our operating margin performance.","Now we'll open it up for your questions. Operator, we'll take the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from a line of Lauren Lieberman of Barclays.","Lauren Lieberman","Thanks Good morning.","Ramon Laguarta","Good morning.","Lauren Lieberman","I was curious if we could talk a little bit about gross margins, obviously really solid in the quarter kind of as expected, but I was curious about one, in the near term PEM have next year let's call it thinking about commodity inflation environment, so on how you might expect that to progress and then also longer term as mixing the portfolio evolves, I guess category mix within Beverages, price tier ins and I think you've talked about in emerging markets. How should we think about gross margins from a longer term perspective? Thanks.","Hugh Johnston","Yeah, happy too Lauren, it's Hugh. A couple of things, one, obviously, we don't give gross margin guidance. So I'll talk more conceptually then I will specifically to numbers. We were obviously pleased with gross margins in the first quarter. But as I just mentioned, we do expect to see more commodity inflation in the balance of the year and transactional for export pressure commodities as well. So I think in the first quarter we saw probably, I call it very strong gross margin performance, in the balance of the year, we'll see how it plays out based on how FX and commodities play out. Longer term, obviously, we're looking to increase gross margins over time and that's driven primarily by productivity in the cost of goods area.","Ramon Laguarta","Yeah, Lauren, there's a three capabilities we're working on to make sure we protect our gross margins long term expanded, one is net revenue management, key capability. Other one is innovation. And the other one is holistic cost management. So those three capabilities are the ones where we'll invest in and developing the team to make sure that we protect gross margin long term.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.","Judy Hong","Thank you. Good morning. So obviously, a pretty strong quarter from an organic revenue growth perspective, particularly as you called out some of the international markets in ESSA and AMENA, maybe you can give us a little bit more color just in terms of what you've seen in category versus your market share in some of your key markets. And, Hugh, you commented on sort of the strength in ESSA not repeating in the back half the year, so maybe a little bit more color, just why you don't think that that will be sustainable in the balance of the year. Thank you.","Ramon Laguarta","Hi Judy, this is Ramon. Yeah, we're very pleased with the growth in international and really the macros have been very, very positive, I would say, during the quarter. We haven't seen any major geopolitical or big evaluation in any of our markets. So with your comments on ESSA, we've been investing in ESSA for many years now in building sustainable market place performance and that's coming across and most of our markets are gaining share both in beverages and snacks. Turkey has been the only country where we've seen some FOREX disruption and the team is doing a great job going through that. The same in AMENA where we had a great Chinese New Year, very, very strong Chinese New Year, the team prepared very well and we're getting better at capturing that. That's big seasonal opportunity there in that large market. So we're seeing very positive thing with Mexico. Mexico has had a great a great quarter gaining share consistently already for three quarters and continues to be a very solid performing business. So we've seen good macros and good performance across most of our operations.","Hugh Johnston","Yeah and Judy, just to clarify, the only thing I'd add about the laps, my comment about the laps being tougher in the back half of the year are about the company laps, not just specifically about ESSA.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane of Bank of America.","Bryan Spillane","Hey, good morning everyone.","Ramon Laguarta","Good morning.","Bryan Spillane","So I guess my question - Ramon, I know it's early in the year, but you now have the ability to begin the kind of measure or assess the efficacy of the step up in marketing and advertising, especially in PBNA, so I guess can you give us some color on whether you think A, it's going to be enough and B, are you beginning to see the consumer response to lift from the investments that you're making?","Ramon Laguarta","Hi, Bryan, Yeah, of course, listen it's a third quarter of growth in NAB, so we feel good about the progress we're making in NAB. We feel good about our capital variance. First, I think we're really strengthening the brands. We feel very good about how Pepsi is performing. So yes, the investment in Pepsi and some of the portfolio innovation and especially packaging innovation is working very well in Pepsi. We're seeing an improvement in Gatorade, the velocity of Gatorade is improving as well. I think we have some more work to do in Dew and we will be investing more in Dew during the year. So we feel good about that part of our investments. I think what we feel really good is of our innovation; innovation is really working very well in North America Beverages. If you think about LIFEWTR, third year of growth, doubling velocities as we increase distribution, still the velocity is going is going very fast.","We're, feeling very good about Game Fuel, some of the innovation we have in the energy area. Gatorade Zero is going to be a big incremental opportunity for us. It's driving category growth and its driving share for Gatorade, so we feel good about our innovation and some of our brand investments. The areas where we are still working on his execution on excellence and we made the new division structure that's going to help us a lot in terms of becoming a much more stronger local operator whilst keeping a very good customer service or large national customer. So we keep investing in that area, but I will feel good about the velocity of the brands, as I mentioned, the innovation and we'll get better execution as we invest and take maximum benefit from the new organization.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ali Dibadj of Bernstein.","Ali Dibadj","Hey, guys. So I actually have two questions. One is just a clarification on the one timers because as we add them up and understand last year about the transfer covers everything else, it seems like there's about $100 million swing from last year to this year in these one timers are about $0.05 a share. And I just want to make sure we're kind of getting to roughly the right number as you guys think about it. And that's probably for Hugh. And then the broader question is about the ROI and the nature reinvestments. Not because 5% organic sales growth isn't good, I mean, we thought you ran up to five, you ran it down to five, so that's all great. But it's really in North America driven more by price mix versus volume. So trying to understand the nature of the reinvestments that we would expect a little bit more, I guess volume driven or demand building type investments given the plans you laid out before for marketing et cetera. So those two questions would be really helpful please. Thank you.","Hugh Johnston","Hey, Ali its Hugh. I'll take the question around one timers, depending on what you characterize it as one time, I think that's about right $100 million swing. In addition to that, obviously, the tax rate was higher in the quarter this year, but I think $100 million swing is about right.","Ramon Laguarta","Yeah. And on the investment Ali, I think it's still pretty much your - to get any good readings on the return on investment. However, we've seen, as I said, velocity of the brands improving, we're seeing market share recovering in a lot of the segments. We're seeing the brand equity better. We're seeing some of our numerical distribution and customer service, KPIs improving, so we feel good about how our investments in turn, turn it into positive operating numbers. And we feel good about the progress we're making.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira of JPMorgan.","Andrea Teixeira","Yeah, hi, thank you. So I wanted to just follow up on FLNA and volumes continue to be strong on a serious spec and running about 3% in pricing the same way. I was just wondering if you can give us comfort that you're seeing good quality on that growth and I think you called out in the queue on the big franchises I assume running at a very high pace. So if you can comment on how you're seeing the progress into the goal of this 5% and how sustainable you see it going forward.","Ramon Laguarta","Yeah. Good morning Andrea. The category and savories is performing very, very well in the US and I think it's a combination of our investments. Obviously, we have a big share of this category and some other players investing. We are obviously having a very good partnership with our customers building - increasing the space of this category in the store. So it's a compounded impact of multiple factors that is driving the category. Within this category Frito-Lay is improving its share performance as well. So we've seen the doubled impact of that. You were referring to pricing. And we're getting better at net revenue management and how we're capturing the maximum pricing of every occasion and Frito has done a great job of managing their mix to obviously maximize revenue of the demand that there is in the market.","And then they've made some operational adjustments to some of the supply chain bottlenecks that we had in the past and we've been able to capture some of the seasonal opportunity, especially around Super Bowl I would say in a very, very impactful way together with our Beverages business as well. So we had a very good Super Bowl, so you put it all together and the category is healthy. I think this category we're going to have strong tailwinds as consumers. We've talked this in the past; consumers go into more unstructured meals during the day. So I think we have tailwinds, plus our investments, I think are accelerating the performance of these categories. So we feel good about Frito. Obviously, also, we're working on productivity and make sure that the business continues to generate efficiencies through invest; make sure that this model is sustainable long term.","Operator","Your next question comes from Bonnie Herzog of Wells Fargo.","Bonnie Herzog","All right, thank you, good morning. I wanted to ask about CSDs, there's a fairly wide delta remaining between your share performance and that of your largest branded competitor, especially in the US. So could you guys update us on some of your initiatives in CSDs, specifically innovation which you didn't mention any plans that I heard? And then how successful has your stepped up spending been in that category specifically? And then finally, I guess I'd like to understand how big of a priority CSDs are relative to your other beverage categories in terms of the investment spend and allocation of resources. Thanks.","Ramon Laguarta","Okay, good. So of course CSD is a very critical category for us. And we talked about that we need to have a balanced growth between CSDs and then NCBs if we really want to make progress in this business. So from that point of view it's clear that we're turning both segments of the market with a very clear intention of allocation of resources with CSDs taking a very important role for us. Within CSDs our first priority was Pepsi and we started investing in Pepsi last year. The good news is that the Pepsi brand is gaining share of CSDs already. And pretty good growth compared to our Cola competitor. So we feel good about that large segment of CSDs. Now, as I said before, we're working on Dew. Dew is - it's also improving its performance in its core portfolio and we have some laps that are over as of March, so you will see an improvement in CSD share.","We continue to invest. Again you'll see, I didn't mention the innovation, there is innovation on dew brand. Game Fuel is one of the innovations in dew brand. We have other innovations coming up this summer that you guys will be able to see in the marketplace and you'll see some very strong activations of the brand coming up in the summer. So we feel good about Pepsi and it's a combination of brand, is a combination of - non-sugar doing very well, mini-cans doing very well, so the portfolio transformation we've made as well is helping us to - for Pepsi to outgrow the CSD market and now Dew is the next area of focus and I'm confident we'll see performance improvement in the next quarters in Dew.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer of Cowen & Company.","Vivien Azer","Hi, thank you. Good morning.","Ramon Laguarta","Good morning.","Vivien Azer","So I was just hoping also to talk about Beverages and ask for an update on SodaStream, how that's going and any update on your thinking on the role that'll play in your broader beverage initiative. Thanks.","Ramon Laguarta","Yeah, I think we talked during the strategic review. SodaStream is a long term strategic bet for ads and it's in multiple dimensions. One is we think consumers will be looking for customization of their beverages solutions at home and I think SodaStream, it is a very good tool to provide that to consumers. Obviously, we're going to innovate in improving the flavor experience and other options for consumers to really capture that need. Obviously, there is a sustainability angle to SodaStream and we think that we can provide consumers with very good beverage experiences without packaging, without ways and that's I think a big plus for these effort [ph]. The performance is good; it's accelerated versus the past. We're not going to disclose specifics, but if you know the past performance of SodaStream, it is accelerating. The penetration in most of the European countries, which is the number one KPI we're measuring, keeps increasing, the same in Canada, the same in the US, which are the largest markets for this business. So we feel good about the operational results and we feel good about the value that PepsiCo as a company is adding to SodaStream, especially in the areas of R&D and flavor innovation, customer relationships and some of the direct to consumer opportunities that this business has.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of [indiscernible] of Credit Suisse.","Unidentified Analyst","Hey, everybody, good morning. Ramon presumably when you first started you developed a one year, three year, five year plan and such in, as we think about that, do we think about this year's investment spending as a bit of a one and done and the investment becomes part of the base and we're back to algorithm or do you think of it as this is the first full year we have some critical things to do and then next year there's a new set of initiatives that require further step up to hold momentum or maybe or maybe even something different.","Ramon Laguarta","No, when we talked in February we were quite clear I think on this is a year where we - we are obviously taking some of our internal monies and redirecting them that we needed some additional investments to make sure that we stepped up our performance in some areas. And also, we're starting to create some capabilities that will hopefully drive the sustained performance in the future. So we will remain with the same investment position as we said in February.","Hugh Johnston","And to add to that, and just to reiterate what Ramon was saying kind of, we talked about next year we will be back on long term algorithm so don't worry.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Caroline Levy of Macquarie.","Caroline Levy","Thanks very much, and good morning. I wonder if you could talk a little bit about the other categories in Beverages. They stepped up competition coming in coffee. We're just seeing a lot of new brands as well as the monster coffee business is doing pretty well and then needless to say energy and again some great new brands, but in Sports and Energy and almost a merging of those two categories. So if you could talk about your approach to defending share in coffee and to growing against Energy and Sports against the newer players that would be really helpful.","Ramon Laguarta","Yeah, different market positions in different segments, right. So in Energy we're challengers and our portfolio in Energy clearly innovates to move on to space as the current players are not playing. So we're addressing Energy from the coffee market, we're addressing Energy from energy, like Game Fuel with specific positioning within that narrower but probably more functional. And so we are challengers and we want to have that mentality of going after existing leaders in this category and trying to get market share from that segment. In the other two categories that you mentioned our critical role is to keep building the - make sure that those categories remain very healthy and they keep growing above our LRB and that's what's happening with coffees and with sports drinks. They're both growing fast. Our biggest innovation in beverages is Gatorade Zero, I think it's going to be a very good innovation, very incremental to the category and good for our for our show market.","We're investing big into Gatorade Zero and we're investing big into Gatorade. Of course Propel is doing very well and so we have a broad based approach to the sports category and we see our velocity is improving. When it comes to coffee the same approach that we think our role is to continue to innovate in this category and make sure that we premiumize at the same time we value, we cover all the different spaces where the category can go and we see our Starbucks coffee partnership very strong and clearly growing above what is the average of our company, so very accretive. Some of these players are coming into our categories. Some of them they stay for a long time, some of them, they come in and then two years later they're not there. So our approach to these categories is sustained innovation, consumer insights to drive the category long term. keep investing; make sure that we keep driving the growth, the margin expansion of those categories long term.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Powers of Deutsche Bank.","Steve Powers","Thanks and good morning. So Ramon you talked to the category about the importance of investing among other areas in more impactful science and design led innovation and you've highlighted on this call just in response for last question some of the initiatives you have underway this year is related to beverages. But when you step back, how would you assess the 2019 innovation and new product pipeline globally, relative to what you hope to bring to market in 2020 or '21. And where might you say you see the most room for incremental improvement there.","Ramon Laguarta","Yeah, listen, as part of the capabilities we're building is this one that you refer to, I think it's critical for us to continue to drive the growth of our categories, continue to create value for our customers in sustained way, right and that's where we are investing. We'll talk to you in the probably in this summer about how we are looking at innovation. And from the capability point of view how we're segmenting different ways of innovate. I think it's very different how you do a local refresh innovation versus what are the big bets for the company versus how do you do lift and adapt and lift and shift globally, which is a huge opportunity as you can imagine for a global company. So we'll talk more in the future, but in all of the capabilities that we're investing heavily and we're refurbishing money from other costs, lines of our P&L into capabilities, it is innovation and it is especially the different types of innovation that you were talking about. We feel good about 2019 from the innovation point of view, and then the fact that we're growing 5.2%, it is a reflection of we're growing the core, but we're also adding some new segments that are very incremental to our top line and also to our categories and our customers who \u2013we want to position ourselves as a key growth contributor to our customers through innovation, through category growth.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Ottenstein of Evercore ISI.","Robert Ottenstein","Great, thank you very much. A few related questions on Frito-Lay North America. First, you mentioned that you expect the growth to slow as the year progresses. Is that purely a function of tougher comps? Second, can you talk about the impact of mix in the quarter both in terms of the pricing and volume? And third, I think it's mentioned in the 10-Q that you had double digit declines in Sentidos, if you could talk a little bit about what's going on there. Thank you very much.","Hugh Johnston","Yeah. Hey Robert, its Hugh, I'll handle that one. Some of the commentary I gave on Frito-Lay with performance penalty year is driven by the laps as you've anticipated. In addition to that, we had a particularly good January as we had some tightening in areas of our supply chain, we address those issues, and we really had a very big Super Bowl, bigger than we've had in previous years because we unlocked some areas of the supply chain. So I think that was a big driver for the quarter, obviously that's a onetime event. We don't see that repeating over the balance of the year because it was much more driven by January challenges. Regarding mix in the quarter, it was quite positive. So we certainly feel good about where Frito-Lay mix is.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Amit Sharma of BMO Capital Markets.","Amit Sharma","Hi, good morning, everyone.","Ramon Laguarta","Good morning.","Hugh Johnston","Good morning.","Amit Sharma","Ramon, you mentioned good macros in most of your markets during the quarter. Can you just outline for us, how do you see that evolving for the rest of the year? IMF recently cut down global growth out a little bit. Can you just talk about how you see that developing for the rest of the year as well please?","Ramon Laguarta","Yeah, happy to - listen, we're seeing very good demand for our categories globally, right. So obviously, I mean, we sell snacks and we sell beverages, so low price point product. So sometimes the big GDP fluctuations are driven by other components of the GDP and not so much consumption of our category. So the way we tend to look at our businesses is, is employment good, is wages and salaries are they moving in the right direction. So we see that stay and we don't see any reasons why in the US or in some of our big markets they just change it. FOREX has a big impact to our P&L, especially in markets where we - some of the supply chain comes from outside of the country. And so far FOREX has been good, it's been stable in the ruble, the Euro, the peso, Mexican peso, so some of our big markets, the FOREX has been good. So our estimates are that it's going to continue to be quite stable.","Having said that, there's always possibility obviously of geopolitical events or some others that might disrupt some of the demand, but at this point we feel good about the projections for macros for the balance of the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell of SunTrust.","Bill Chappell","Thanks Good morning. Just want to go back to North American Beverage and just try to understand your commentary. You said you're pleased with the kind of progress of CSDs in the quarter that Pepsi was kind of gaining share and pleased with the progress there, but really kind of two quarters removed or really one quarter removed from changing the strategy, reinvesting and kind of taking a step back. So trying to understand are things moving faster than you expected? Was advertising have a bigger impact than you expected this quarter or are we still expect - are there still a kind of a step change from here.","Ramon Laguarta","No, I think the teams are doing a great job and things are coming as planned, right. So is a combination innovation, is a combination of good advertising, quantity of advertising, execution in stores and Pepsi has been the focus of our execution in stores, implementing the innovation and also improving the looks of the product. So things are coming as planned, as you said, three, quarters into this turnaround strategy and we're pleased with the results. I mean, growing above CSD category, I think is a very good output of the inputs that we put into this plan. We feel good about it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Laurent Grandet of Guggenheim.","Laurent Grandet","Hey, good morning Ramon and Hugh. I like to focus my question on the profitability of your international segments those increased significantly. Could you give us more color on where the improvement is coming from and how sustainable that is in the coming quarters? Thank you.","Hugh Johnston","Yeah happy too Laurent, I mean, we saw profitability improvement across all three of the big segments. We did benefit to some degree in both Russia and in Mexico from some insurance recoveries and we put all that in the end the disclosure so you can you can back those onetime items out. That said, we saw good solid fundamental operating profit performance improvement basically across there, the big segments even ex those gains.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Grundy of Jeffries?","Kevin Grundy","Thanks. Good morning. This question I hope it just has housekeeping for Hugh, free cash flow conversion for the business longer term, understanding that you're ramping up some spending this year. What's the right free cash flow conversion and what period of time you think you can return to it? And then the strategic question for Ramon, I'm just trying to reconcile some of your comments on sports drinks with what we're seeing in the scan data from a market share perspective with PepsiCo down\u2013 excuse me Gatorade down 360 basis points in the most recent four weeks and over the past year, down close to 400 basis points. So when should we expect to see that get better? I'm sure that cannot be satisfying and then not we'd expect going forward? When should we expect to see some of those trends get better and is there anything tactically you need to do differently? Whether this is more advertising, your promo is down quite a bit, your competitors is up materially. So question is around Gatorade and anything you need to do tactically and when do share trends get better? Thank you.","Hugh Johnston","Why don't I handle the free cash flow question first? We don't get specific guidance on free cash flow. The one thing that we did comment on in the past just as a reminder is that we would see a step up in CapEx this year and lesser so in the next several years and we would expect over the course of four years. So for that to go back to something around 5%, so I as you model that out I think you'll get to a reasonable overall cash flow number, nothing else should be notably different relative to the historical projections on cash flow. It's just a step up in CapEx.","Ramon Laguarta","Yeah and with regards to Gatorade, we're investing in several areas. We're investing in improving our communication and the amount of advertising as you're saying, we're improving the packaging of the product. I think there is an opportunity to improve the packaging. And then most importantly, we're going after additional consumers and Gatorade Zero is a very strategic intentional innovation to go after consumers that had left Gatorade franchise because of the sugar levels up. People that still want that same efficacy when it comes to hydration, but want less sugar. From the early reads that we have on Gatorade Zero, it is performing as we intended in terms of expanding the category, capturing new consumers and driving incoming challenges for the brand. So we're very hopeful that those three leavers will help us regain growth.","The fact of the matter is that we also have other brands play in that space, Propel is a great brand that we have in that space of sports hydration with a different positioning that's growing very fast. And we'll come up with some other innovations. Obviously, I cannot disclose for competitive reasons, but there is new innovation coming up that hopefully will attack some spaces in the current sports overall category where we've probably got weaker. That's the way we're approaching. Yeah, this is a very important business for as it's part of our management conversations quite often and I think we will, as I'm saying we'll improve the performance of our sports set of brands and products in the in the coming quarters","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sean King of UBS.","Sean King","Hi, thanks guys. I guess now that you closed the CytoSport deal, how do you see the - I guess, do you see any incremental channel or category innovation opportunities to build on that investment?","Hugh Johnston","All right. Yeah. Hey, Sean, this is Hugh. I think you'll see us now that we sort of have control of the brand there combined with the Gatorade Shakes business that we have, sort of craft a premium and mainstream approach to that business and they clearly appeal to different consumer segments. And we think by virtue of owning that business we'll be able to have more success with both of those brands. So more to come on that, but that's sort of the broad thinking behind the move that we made.","Ramon Laguarta","Yeah, we think there is obviously, executional opportunities with these brands. But most importantly we think that this category is going to grow fast in the coming years. And we want to make sure that we have full ownership of the full value chain so we can innovate both, as Hugh was saying, with multiple brands to make sure that we cover all these spaces, and more functional, more lifestyle, more premium or value. So there's a lot of - I think there's a lot of ways how we can help accelerate a category that has a lot of consumer tailwinds already. So it's a good strategic acquisition for us so that we make sure that we drive this category to its maximum.","Ramon Laguarta","Okay, so this is the last question. Thank you, all of you for your time and participation in this morning's call. To conclude, just a summary, we're pleased with our results for the first quarter. We're executing against our key priorities with a very high sense of urgency. We remain on track to achieve our 2019 financial goals. And lastly, we thank you for your confidence that you've placed in PepsiCo with your investment. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you.

Your lines have been placed on listen-only until the question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded and will be archived at www.PepsiCo.com.","It is now my pleasure to introduce Mr. Jamie Caulfield, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Caulfield, you may begin.","Jamie Caulfield - PepsiCo, Inc.","Thank you, Operator. With me today are Indra Nooyi, PepsiCo's Chairman and CEO; and Hugh Johnston, PepsiCo's CFO. We'll lead off today's call with a review of our first quarter 2017 performance and full-year outlook, and then we'll move on to Q&A.","We're aware today is a particularly busy reporting day for the CPG sector, so we've kept our comments brief and intend to conclude the call by 8:30. Before we begin, please take note of our cautionary statement. This conference call includes forward-looking statements, including statements regarding 2017 guidance based on currently available information.

Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.","Thank you, Jamie. I am pleased to report that we are on track to meet our 2017 financial goals, with first quarter operating results right in line with our expectations. Organic revenue was up 2% globally. We delivered positive volume growth in both global snacks and global beverages, along with positive net price realization. And core constant currency EPS grew 7%.","And despite the macro volatility and weak currencies in many of our key overseas markets that impacted our reported results, our organic revenue growth was driven by our developing and emerging markets businesses, with mid-single-digit organic revenue gains. We are particularly encouraged by the broad-based gains we saw in our two largest developing and emerging markets, Mexico and Russia, where growth across snacks, beverages and dairy led to high single-digit organic revenue growth in each of these important markets.","And the developed markets, we grew organic revenue 1%, led by solid performance of Frito-Lay North America and North American Beverages. And we delivered this performance despite facing a few headwinds, including: the timing of the New Year holiday, which fell into the 53rd week of our 2016 fiscal year; a later Easter this year; and the delay of U.S. income tax refunds that dampened Q1 consumer spending across virtually every consumer category.","With Q1 coming in line with our expectations, we remain confident in the full year 2017 outlook we shared with you last quarter, namely, organic revenue growth of at least 3% and core constant currency EPS growth of 8%. We are proud of the strength and consistency of our performance over the years and we expect 2017 to be yet another strong year of achievement. As I wrote in my annual letter to shareholders, our performance has been enabled, in large part, by our anticipation of and response to far-reaching demographic environmental and societal shifts. For more than a decade, it has been clear to us that if we wanted to make our future as bright as our past, we needed to transform our company in a number of critical ways.","With changing consumer preferences reflecting a growing shift towards healthier lifestyles, we needed to continue to transform our portfolio to offer more nutritious products. With increasing strains on natural resources and the increasing importance governments are placing on protecting our planet, we needed to transform our operations to limit our environmental footprint. And we're changing attitudes, values and demographics in the workplace, especially as Millennials enter the workforce in large numbers. We needed to transform our workplace and our culture to make sure we were meeting the evolving expectations of a new generation of associates.","The urgency of responding to these shifts is what gave rise to the approach we call Performance with Purpose. From the start, Performance with Purpose has been more than a slogan. It's been an overarching vision, guiding every aspect of our business. It's about building a healthier future for all our stakeholders. Of course, this begins with generating healthy financial returns for our owners, but that is just the table stakes. Our challenge is to deliver them consistently and sustainably year after year.","And the way we are doing this is by continuing to transform in five areas: first, making healthier foods and beverages for our consumers. To meet the evolving needs of our consumers around the world, we are shifting our portfolio to a wider range of what we call: first, Everyday Nutrition products, which are products with positive nutrients like grains, fruits and vegetables or protein, plus those that are naturally nutritious like water and unsweetened tea; and two, what we call guilt-free products, which includes the Everyday Nutrition products plus beverages with 70 calories or less from added sugar per 12-ounce serving and snacks with low levels of sodium and saturated fat.","As a result, today, more than 45% of our net revenue is derived from guilt-free products. And our Everyday Nutrition portfolio is growing faster than the balance of the portfolio. This transformation has been enabled by a series of critical investments in R&D that are paving the way for new flavors and sweeteners, as well as ingredients and recipes. And we are also investing in advanced manufacturing technologies, like our proprietary frying innovation that can reduce the amount of fat in potato chips by 20%.","You see our commitment to our product transformation and our recent innovation around the globe. For example, in North America, we just launched LIFEWTR, a premium bottled water, PH balanced, with electrolytes for added taste. The brand fuses creativity with design to serve as a source of inspiration by featuring the works of some of today's top visual artists on the package. We also launched LEMON LEMON. It's a sparkling lemonade, a modern take on an old tradition with bubbles, lemon juice and a touch of sweeteners, with just 70 calories per 12-ounce serving. We launched IZZE FUSIONS, a next-generation sparkling beverage, modernized with unique flavors and just 60 calories per 12-ounce serving. And we're expanding the lineup of our highly-successful Smartfood Delight popcorn, that contains just 35 calories per cup. It's made with air-popped 100% whole grain popcorn, contains no artificial colors, flavors or preservatives and offers gluten-free and non-GMO project verified varieties.","In Brazil, we are launching new Quaker fruit bars made with oats and real fruit. Quaker fruit bars are just 60 calories per serving, have no added sugar, has zero trans fats and are a source of fiber and Vitamin C.","In Russia, our J7 whole fruit line, containing 100% fruit juice and nectars with the fiber of a whole fruit, hit the market earlier this year. In Mexico, we are expanding our global Sunbites franchise with the launch of three product forms, multi-grain chips, popcorn and plantains. And in the UK, we launched Quaker Super Goodness in two forms, SuperGrains and Super Fruits, both made with 100% whole-grain oats with beta glucan, which has been shown to lower blood cholesterol levels.","And we believe there is much more room to grow in the space. For example, working with our retail partners, Quaker Foods North America has the opportunity to return to growth by leveraging one of the most beloved nutrition distribution brands to renew excitement in the center of the store through innovative merchandising.","The second area is generating healthy growth for our retail and foodservice partners. As a result of all the investments we have made to position ourselves for success over the long term, from anticipating consumer trends to building a robust innovation pipeline, to transforming our product portfolio to meet consumers' needs, we are delivering top-tier growth for our retailers. For the third consecutive year, PepsiCo was the largest contributor to branded retail food and beverage sales growth in the U.S. In fact, in 2016, we generated more retail sales growth than all other $5 billion-plus food and beverage manufacturers combined. We're driving growth by leveraging our global scale and driving excellent local in-market execution.","For example, in 2016, we placed with our retail partners more than 250,000 single-serve displays dedicated to our fastest-growing brands with our best innovation, driving growth in single-serve beverages for our retail partners and us. By implementing the GES model pioneered Frito-Lay, our North America Beverage unit is improving order accuracy, reducing out-of-stocks and driving even greater levels of in-store service.","To drive growth with our foodservice partners, in just one year, we placed 20,000 Hello Goodness branded vending units that offer consumers access to foods and beverages from across the PepsiCo portfolio that meet certain nutrition criteria. And we are building a powerhouse e-commerce team, creating global capability in markets from the U.S. to China to the UK and tailoring that capability with retailers to fit their growth strategy.","Third, we are contributing to a healthier planet while boosting our bottom line. One of the central planks of Performance with Purpose, the vision we set out over a decade ago, has been protecting our planet and conserving natural resources. We continue to advance these efforts in a number of ways, including responsible water use, shrinking our carbon footprint across our supply chain and reducing our waste and packaging material, not only because it's the right thing to do, because it's the smart thing to do for business. I am pleased to report that globally, approximately one-third of our plants have now achieved near-zero waste landfill while reducing, reusing or recycling their waste. And our efforts continue.","In January, we activated a wind turbine at our Skelmersdale plant in the UK, which is now providing 25% of the site's electricity with this renewable energy source. These and many other environmental sustainability initiatives are not only shrinking our environmental footprint, they're also substantially reducing our costs and boosting the bottom line.","The fourth area is creating a healthy workplace and culture for our associates. The extraordinary men and women who make up our company are our greatest assets. That's why we're committed to remaining a place that the best and brightest come, not only to earn a living, but to build a life by fostering a healthy workplace and culture. So we've undertaken a broad set of initiatives: to build a work force that's diverse and inclusive; to provide working caregivers the support and flexibility they need to meet their responsibilities at work and home; to foster learning; and to promote more effective ways to work together.","For example, in North American Beverages, we've declared 2017 to be the year of the frontline leader and launched frontline leader excellence training to our almost 3,000 frontline managers, with topics covering employer advocacy, time management and career building. And at Frito-Lay, we are piloting innovative programs to address the continuous need for skilled labor by creating a variety of programs aimed at skill development for our current associates as well as partnerships with local technical schools for development of future talent.","Our workplace and culture are more than the product of corporate policies. It also reflects our values, holding ourselves to the highest standards of excellence, speaking with truth and candor and selling only products we can proudly stand behind.","And the fifth area is promoting healthier communities wherever we operate. Although we're thought of as a global enterprise, we are also members of every local community where we do business. Our associates live there, we make our products there and we often source our raw materials there. For all of these reasons, we have a stake in the local communities we serve and we work hard to meet our responsibilities to them. An important way we contribute to our communities is by creating well-paying jobs, along with the possibility of long, successful careers.","We are also doing our part to be a good neighbor in other ways. For example, in Chicago, for over a decade, we've been the title partner of the largest high school soccer tournament in the U.S., the PepsiCo Showdown. In 2017, there are 216 Chicago area high schools and more than 21,500 student athletes involved in the event, which is built around the theme Make a Difference On AND Off the Field. Relatedly, there is a monthly community service push with the thousands of PepsiCo Showdown student athletes to cultivate leadership for a brighter future.","And throughout Mexico, our Entrepreneurship for Growth program supports youngsters from vulnerable communities to improve their quality of life, to develop enough soft skills through sport and hard skills through technical education. So taken together, these steps form a virtuous cycle that's powering our ongoing transformation as a company, enabling us to do well by doing good and positioning us for success, not only over the short term but also over the long term, adding to both the durability and duration of our shareholder value creation.","So net-net, we feel good about the state of our business. We are on track to deliver our full-year financial targets. And we are managing our business to both the short-term and the long-term in a way that delivers healthy, sustainable returns to our shareholders.","With that, let me turn the call over to Hugh Johnston. Hugh?","Hugh F. Johnston - PepsiCo, Inc.","Thank you, Indra, and good morning, everyone. Let me start by picking up on Indra's point regarding healthy financial returns. As much as we are proud of the advancement of our agendas with customers, consumers, our associates and communities, we are equally pleased with the financial gains these initiatives have contributed to our shareholders. Over the past five years, we have generated approximately $40 billion of free cash flow, excluding certain items, and returned $38 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases.","This cash flow has been the result of healthy organic revenue growth, margin expansion, diligent working capital management and disciplined capital allocation, including responsible reinvestment in the business to position it to remain strong and generate attractive returns far into the future. We believe 2017 will add to our track record of balanced earnings growth and strong cash generation for the company and attractive cash returns for our shareholders, which brings me to our outlook for 2017.","As we set out in the release, we continue to expect organic revenue growth of at least 3%, fueled by successful product innovation and strong marketplace execution, but tempered by a cautious macro environment. Foreign exchange is now expected to negatively impact reported revenue by approximately 2 percentage points, which is an improvement of 1 point from our previous guidance based on current market consensus rates. And we continue to expect core earnings of $5.09 per share, which assumes core constant currency growth of 8%, offset by an expected 3 percentage point drag from foreign exchange translation based on current market consensus rates, which remains unchanged from our previous guidance.","In terms of other key considerations and assumptions embedded in our full-year outlook, we continue to expect raw material inflation driven by both an increase in our basket of commodities and additional pressure from transaction ForEx. We continue to expect core operating margin expansion, contributed to by our productivity programs. And we continue to expect our core effective tax rate to be approximately 24%.","Turning to cash flow, we expect to continue to generate strong cash flow and to exercise discipline over capital allocation, with prudent reinvestment into the business and the majority of our free cash flow, excluding certain items, to be returned to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. So for 2017, we continue to expect: approximately $10 billion in cash flow from operations; net capital spending of approximately $3 billion; approximately $7 billion in free cash flow, excluding certain items; cash dividends of approximately $4.5 billion \u2013 recall that we previously announced a 7% increase in our quarterly dividend, to begin with the June payment, and this would represent the 45th consecutive year in which we have increased our dividend; and share repurchases of approximately $2 billion.","Finally, as you update your models, I'd like the highlight the following three items as they relate to the second quarter. First, we expect our rate of organic revenue growth to show sequential improvement. Second, we expect our consolidated core operating margin to contract in the quarter, due to the timing of business investments in Latin America and AMENA. And finally, we expect foreign exchange translation to be a low single-digit headwind on both reported revenue and EPS, based on current market consensus rates.","With that, we're ready to take the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Your first question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman of Barclays.","Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.","Morning, Lauren.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Good morning. Thank you. Indra, I found it curious you mentioned you went straight to the tax refund as sort of being an explanation for some of the weakness we've seen in the U.S. I wonder if you could elaborate a little bit on what you've seen as you've kind of come out of the quarter and maybe anything, frankly, distinctive about your businesses, because outside of Quaker, it certainly looks like snacks and beverages were relatively immune to some of the softness we've seen more broadly across CPG. Thanks.","Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.","Thank you, Lauren. Let me just say that, clearly, in the first part of the quarter, several things happened. One is the fact that the New Year build up into the 53rd week of 2016 and then we had the slowdown because the tax refunds were delayed. By the time we got to the end of the first quarter, the business started to pick up again. So we aren't really concerned. It's just a timing issue.","I'd just say globally, our business is looking good. Let me quickly give you a snapshot of what we are seeing globally. Europe is doing very well. It's strong. The return to growth has been impressive, so we are feeling very good about Europe, across all parts of Europe. The Latin American continent, outside of Brazil, Argentina and Venezuela, is good, but Brazil, Argentina and Venezuela are causes for concern. The Middle East is retooling itself, and we have to wait for it to figure out how they're going to come out of the oil price decline.","China, the GDP growth is good. Our snacks and nutrition business is doing very well, and our beverage business is slowly recovering. And India is coming out of a bold demonetization now to remonetization. There's good GDP growth and we feel good about our business prospects there, too. And as far as the U.S. is concerned, as we head into the second quarter, we don't have a reason to be worried.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ali Dibadj of Bernstein.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hey, guys.","Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.","Morning, Ali.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hi. So although we've been, obviously, pretty positive on Pepsi for a while and certainly understand the timing shifts you went through just recently, your volume growth in the developed markets wasn't perhaps as great as it could be, certainly not as well as we had expected. And when we talk to investors and ask about the risks to the company \u2013 and I'm not sure it's all manifested in the quarter or not \u2013 but the risk to the company longer term, we kind of talk about three things and I'd love your perspective on it. One is Pepsi's business over-indexing to convenience stores in a time where gas prices are up. Have you seen any of that impact? Two is the company's difficulty, I guess, perhaps inability, to capture impulse purchases online as consumers shift to e-commerce. And then three is if health and wellness ever really impacts snacks like it does the rest of packaged foods? And have you seen any of those things manifested in the quarter or do you think it's all timing? And I guess also, are those perhaps legitimate concerns more broadly going forward?","Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.","You know, Ali, those are all very good questions, but every one of these concerns can also be reframed as an opportunity. And that's really what we do because if PepsiCo's business is over-developed in C-stores, we look at expanding in grocery and other channels, whether it's foodservice or vending, as a bigger opportunity. And then we look to see how we can leverage our DSD system to grow our business into new categories in C-stores. And that's what has made us more valuable partners to convenience store retailers.","And in terms of difficulty with impulse on online, we've built a very good e-commerce business. It's growing at impressive rates. I don't want to discuss those rates, but it's growing at impressive rates. And clearly, our challenge is to create impulse online. And we are working on tools with all of our partners to make our categories look like impulse categories online. It's a work in process, but I must tell you that our growth rates are quite impressive.","And in terms of health and wellness and impacting the snacks business, look, snacks are simple pleasures of life. What we are doing is making our snacks more permissible. We're reducing the saturated fat levels. We remove trans fats. We're reducing the sodium levels. If you're going to eat a snack, eat a PepsiCo snack. And there's nothing wrong with eating a snack that's guilt-free. So our goal is to offer you a range of options from sort of fun-for-you products to guilt-free products, which include Everyday Nutrition, both in a snacking form and in a food-like form. And at this point, we are singularly focused on growing the core, expanding out of the core but making sure across the board we make them a lot more permissible. And it looks like that strategy is working at this point.","Operator","Your next question comes from the name of Bryan Spillane of Bank of America.","Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.","Morning, Bryan.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, good morning, everyone. Just a quick question on working capital, Hugh, it looked like it was a use of cash in the quarter. So can you just give us a little more color on that in terms of just the phasing I guess of cash flow for the year?","Hugh F. Johnston - PepsiCo, Inc.","Yeah, Bryan, happy to. We typically are a user of working capital in the first quarter. If you go back, I think you'll see in most years we have generally had a couple hundred million dollar use of working capital, so same here. What are the drivers? Biggest one is we're starting to build inventory as we get into the hotter seasons, so not atypical in any regard. I think you'll see a pattern that is very, very consistent with what you've seen historically.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley.","Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.","Morning, Dara.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey. Good morning. So, Hugh, gross margins compressed year-over-year for the second straight quarter. That's a rarity for you guys. Obviously, you'd highlighted it previously, but I was hoping you could discuss your expectation in the balance of year on gross margins and also give us more detail on what drove the compression in Q1, particularly in terms of the balance between pricing realization versus commodity pressure and the commodity outlook in the balance of the year. Thanks.","Hugh F. Johnston - PepsiCo, Inc.","Yeah, happy to, Dara. As you know, we saw some late in the year commodity inflation after a number of quarters of commodity deflation. When I say late in the year, I'm talking about late in the year 2016. That continued into 2017. And we expect that to continue, as we've shared before, over the course of the year. As you know, our intent is generally to price through commodity inflation. In developed markets, we generally price through 100%. In developing and emerging markets that have particularly high rates of inflation, we've tended to price through between two-thirds and three-quarters right away and then basically manage the rest of the P&L through productivity.","What you saw this quarter, more than anything else, was our pricing in AMENA, in particular, was relatively light. Couple of markets driving that, the biggest one is Egypt, where we've seen particularly high inflation driven by ForEx. And our pricing is in place such that over the course of the full year, we should see margin appreciation. But in the first half of the year, we will likely see margin compression. So you'll likely see one more quarter of that, and then you'll see margin appreciation in the back half of the year. That is going to be driven, more than anything, by the fact that in the developing and emerging markets, we'll be taking more pricing to cover the commodity inflation.","We do like to balance that out, as you know. We don't like to sticker shock the consumers in those markets because we want to keep them in the category. So a phased approach to pricing when we see high inflation, we found generally works best for long-term value creation.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.","Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.","Morning, Judy.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Good morning. So I wanted to delve a little bit more into the Frito-Lay performance in the first quarter. Obviously, it was more of a price\/mix-driven quarter with pretty healthy price\/mix and volume down. So can you just talk about the acceleration in price\/mix specifically and what's sort of driving that? And then with Kellogg transitioning out of the DSD system, have you started to see any positive impact on your business? And then, Hugh, just in terms of the currency impact in EBIT or EPS, that actually didn't change, even though revenue numbers came up a little bit, so is it just more of a rounding situation there?","Hugh F. Johnston - PepsiCo, Inc.","Yeah, I'll answer the third question first, Judy. It was rounding. So the revenue tipped towards 2% but earnings stayed at 3%, but they both improved directionally, just one tipped over into 2% and the other stayed at 3%. Regarding the Frito-Lay business, two big numbers to point to that I think both cover the volume and also cover the pricing question that you're asking; the two big factors regarding why volume was down in the quarter, and both are temporary in that regard, number one was the New Year's build. As Indra pointed out in her opening, New Year's fell into the 53rd week. In the previous year, it fell into Quarter 1 of the year. That cost us about 1.3 points on volume for the quarter.","The second was some of the challenges that we had in the Sabra business due to some product challenges, which we're now through and have largely solved. That cost us about six-tenths of a point on volume for the quarter. Now, one of the things to keep in mind is we don't get revenue credit for Sabra because it's a 50%-50% JV. We get, obviously, volume credit and we get profit credit. By virtue of that six-tenths of a point coming out of volume but not having an impact on revenue, it probably made it appear that there was more pricing than there is.","Net, I think we've got our Frito-Lay pricing in the right place for the year. And as you see the Sabra volume start to come back, you should see improved volume performance. Obviously, we'll be out of the Easter as well as the New Year's overlap, and the volume will certainly come back because of that. Those were temporary factors, so.","Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.","And we're already seeing the volume back.","Hugh F. Johnston - PepsiCo, Inc.","Absolutely. The exit rate on the quarter is certainly solid.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira of JPMorgan.","Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.","Morning, Andrea. Welcome.","Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning. Thank you, appreciate it. Good morning, everybody. Just following up on the gross margin that I had asked, from what I understood is like, obviously, a lot of impacts on the international side, but looking into U.S. and Frito-Lay and all and the beverage business as well, what could we expect in terms of like should we expect more of a smoother quarters at the balance of the year? Appreciate that, thank you.","Hugh F. Johnston - PepsiCo, Inc.","Yeah, happy to. So for Beverages, you saw 1% revenue and 3% operating profit growth. I think you will see that strengthen slightly. And then for Frito, you saw 2% revenue and 4% operating profit growth. Again, I think you should expect to see that strengthen slightly as we get into the balance of the year. Quaker, we certainly expected to see a bit of improved performance. So, I think you'll see all the numbers lift a little bit as we get out of the first quarter and into the balance of the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Powers of UBS.","Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.","Morning, Steve.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Hey, thanks. Good morning. Good morning. So picking up on the pricing theme, it was again a pretty large driver of growth organically in Latin America this quarter. And maybe just could just talk a little bit more about how that played out, snacks versus beverages. But more importantly, looking ahead, do you see that current pricing trend as sustainable, just given some of the comments made by your competitor yesterday, at least with respect to Brazil, as well as the currency reversals we've begun to see since the start of the year? I guess a similar question might relate to Russia and Eastern Europe, as well.","Hugh F. Johnston - PepsiCo, Inc.","Yeah, I'm happy to handle that one, Steve. We do expect to continue to see solid pricing down in Latin America. A couple things to think about in that regard, our beverage business in Brazil is relatively small, so we are somewhat insulated from some of the commentary that they made. In addition to that, our biggest business in Latin America is Mexico, where we continue to see very strong performance, both from the beverage business and particularly in our very large snack food business. And then, last but not least, obviously, Argentina has very high rates of inflation. That does create a significant pricing benefit in our overall numbers. So I do think we'll continue to see somewhat similar results.","To the degree that the pricing trends need to moderate because of certain countries, I think you'll see, as you saw last year, improved volume performance. That's been our history in Latin America is as the pricing comes down from what are visually high single-digit types of numbers, our volume does tend to pick up. So I'm comfortable with the trends. You may see a bit more balance between volume and pricing is all.","Operator","Your next question comes...","Hugh F. Johnston - PepsiCo, Inc.","Sorry. The last question was regarding Russia. Again, I think same answer there. You'll probably see less pricing. The pricing was very ForEx driven anyway. So to the degree that the Russian consumer economy continues to strengthen, and as ForEx has less of an impact, I think you'll see us take less pricing but you'll see stronger volumes, so you'll probably get a fairly similar revenue result.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Laurent Grandet of Credit Suisse.","Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.","Morning, Laurent.","Laurent Grandet - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Good morning, Indra. Good morning, Hugh. Question about Quaker. I mean, despite Quaker being one of the LTS of all (34:54) PepsiCo brands, it seems the top line has been soft for quite some time, now including this quarter. At the same time, operating margin have reached a new high with 27.4% in the quarter. So could you please give us more color on this business segment and is this first quarter kind of a reflection of what we should see for the entire year?","Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.","Great question, Laurent. I'd say the Quaker business internationally outside the United States is doing very well. Solid growth, we are entering new markets. It's doing very, very well. In the U.S., the Quaker North America numbers that you see includes the Quaker hot cereal, which is where the Quaker brand is housed. And then all of the other businesses that go within Quaker North America, including Rice-A-Roni, Pasta Roni, Aunt Jemima, there's a whole bunch of other businesses, ready-to-eat cereals. One-third of the business is the Quaker hot cereals. And the Quaker hot cereals business, I'd say, over the past few years, has been flat to very slightly down. And the only reason why the overall portfolio looks negative is because it's center store business in grocery stores. And the overall center store category is down high single digits, sometimes even low double digits in some quarters.","And so while we are outperforming the center store categories handsomely, I think our next challenge is how do we leverage our relationships with retailers to reinvent center store. And that's a conversation we've been having with some of the retailers to say how can we help you rethink the center store so that we can bring growth back to that category. And we need to do that in order to bring interest back to that whole cereal aisle and, therefore, Quaker. By itself, Quaker remains a much-loved brand and it's profitable. And our hope is that with the rejuvenation of center store, our categories grow, too.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer of Cowen.","Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.","Morning.","Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC","So, Indra, the commentary in terms of category trends in North America exiting the quarter is certainly encouraging, but given how much pricing you saw this quarter and how reliant the business has been on pricing for some time now, in particular in Frito, can you talk about the evolution of price elasticity in your categories and whether you're seeing any shift there given some of the nearer-term consumer softness? Thank you.","Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.","Yes. I think to talk about elasticity on a category basis is too general, Vivien. I think we look at elasticity sub-segment by sub-segment. And all the pricing we've put in place in the U.S. is very carefully looking at the elasticity curves. And we look to see what kind of pricing the consumer can adopt, what kind of volume impact it will have and what can we sustain as a portfolio. And I think that what you're seeing right now is pricing that was sensible for the first quarter. And as the year goes on, I mean, look, we put the pricing in place in Q1, or in fact, I'd say Q4 we started putting the pricing in place, and that's ticking through the year. And we modify that as we go along if we believe that we need to change our promotional calendar to accommodate the consumer trends. I don't know, Hugh, if you want to add anything.","Hugh F. Johnston - PepsiCo, Inc.","Yeah, I completely agree with that. And in addition to that, if you look at our pricing in North America, macro top level, it's generally in the 2s, kind of in the low 2% range. And given commodity inflation is low single digits, I think that's sustainable pricing. Now, the Frito pricing appears a little bit larger than that because of the Sabra conversation that we had earlier, because we were hit on volume and, obviously, it doesn't have an impact on us on revenue. But as that normalizes, I think you'll see Frito pricing in the 2s, I think you'll see beverage pricing in the 2s and Quaker pricing in the 2s, and I think that's a reasonable place for us to be for the long term. I think that's very consistent with what those businesses can sustain in a modest inflationary environment.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Ottenstein of Evercore ISI.","Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.","Hi, Robert.","Robert Ottenstein - Evercore ISI","Great. Thank you very much. You identified a number of factors that made the first quarter challenging. One of the things that you didn't mention \u2013 I was just wondering if you had any thoughts and observations was did you see any kind of weakness in consumer confidence impacting your results post the election in the Hispanic American community? And overall in terms of the U.S. business, did you see the tone of business trying to correct for Easter improve? Thank you.","Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.","No. No change in tone of business, and I think consumer confidence continues to remain as positive as we've seen it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Grundy of Jefferies.","Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.","Morning, Kevin.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","Thanks. Good morning. Hey, morning, guys, morning, Indra. Indra, question for you, if I may, on soda taxes. Naturally, seem to be increasing focus. The law passed in Philadelphia, which received a lot of attention and has had a pretty profound impact on entry volumes. And now we have the vote upcoming in Santa Fe, and then there's reports they have a rather well-known advocate behind such taxes, putting money into that market behind the effort. So, Indra, hoping to get your updated thoughts there on risk to your business and to the industry; maybe even some historical context for how you view this risk now relative to recent years. Thank you.","Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.","Thanks, Kevin. Look, at the end of the day, we oppose beverage taxes that are regressive and unfairly target one category or industry. I think, unfortunately, today's beverage taxes are more revenue generation-focused rather than health-focused. But whatever the reason be, from our perspective, we are working on two things: one, making our portfolio deliver products that are lower in sugar and a lot of zero sugar products and beverages with positive nutrition. So that's one part of our strategy, and we've been working on that for 10 years.","The second part of our strategy, making sure we bolster the rest of the portfolio outside of beverages. So when taxes do come in, we can cushion the effect through managing the portfolio in a more intelligent way. And that's been our strategy over the last decade because we anticipated some of these trends early on and we started to re-tool the company for that.","So at this point, let me just say that our strategy is crystal clear and we feel comfortable as to where we are headed.","Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc.","So let me just close by thanking you all for your questions. To summarize, we will continue to manage everything within our control to deliver attractive results in the short-term as we continue to position the business for long-term success. Thank you all for joining us this morning and, more importantly, thank you for the confidence you've placed in us with your investment. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. That does conclude today's PepsiCo's first quarter 2017 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect."]}}
