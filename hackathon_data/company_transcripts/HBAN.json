Please go ahead.","Mark Muth","Thank you, Brenda, welcome. I\u2019m Mark Muth, Director of Investor Relations for Huntington. Copies of the slides we\u2019ll be reviewing can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website, www.huntington.com. This call is being recorded and will be available as a rebroadcast starting about 1 hour from the close of the call.","Our presenters today are Steve Steinour, Chairman, President and CEO; and Mac McCullough, Chief Financial Officer. Dan Neumeyer, Chief Credit Officer, will also be participating in the Q&A portion of today\u2019s call.","As noted on Slide 2, today\u2019s discussion, including the Q&A period, will contain forward-looking statements. Such statements are based on information and assumptions available at this time and subject to changes, risks and uncertainties, which may cause actual results to differ materially. We assume no obligation to update such statements. For a complete discussion of risks and uncertainties, please refer to this slide and material filed with the SEC, including our most recent forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filings.","Let me now turn it over to Steve.","Steve Steinour","Thanks Mark, and thank you to everyone for joining the call today. As always, we appreciate your interest and support. We produced very good results in the fourth quarter and for the full year 2018. For the full year, we reported net income of $1.4 billion, an increase of 17% over 2017, which marks the fourth consecutive year of record net income. Full year earnings per common share were $1.20.","Importantly, we achieved all five of our long-term financial goals on a full year GAAP basis in 2018, two years ahead of schedule. We\u2019re especially pleased with our full year efficiency ratio of 57%, a 400 basis point improvement versus the prior year. And this was the result of managing to our sixth straight year of positive operating leverage, an annual goal we began targeting in 2014. Our return on tangible common equity was also very strong at 18%.","Our strong financial performance also enabled us to increase our capital return to our shareholders in 2018. Last year marked the eighth consecutive year of an increased cash dividend, which as you know is our second highest capital priority behind support for organic growth. Coupling the increased dividend payout with $939 million of share repurchases during the year, we returned nearly $1.5 billion to our shareholders, which represented a total payout ratio of 112% of our 2018 earnings. We believe our earnings power, capital generation and risk discipline will continue to support strong capital distribution with a targeted total payout ratio of 70% to 80% going forward.","As briefly outlined on Slide 3, we developed Huntington strategies with the vision of creating a high performing regional bank and delivering top quartile through the cycle shareholder returns. Our fully year profitability metrics are among the best in the industry. We built sustainable competitive advantage in our key businesses that we believe will deliver top quartile performance in the future.","Our franchise continues to perform well on many fronts, allowing us to make investments and capabilities we need to drive consistent organic growth. And we\u2019re focused on driving sustained long-term financial performance for our shareholders. We remain committed to our aggregate moderate-to-low risk appetite, which we implemented nine years ago. And as a reminder, we reinforced the importance of these risks standards by requiring the top 1,400 officers of the company to comply with holder retirement restrictions on their equity awards.","Slide 4 illustrates our previous long-term financial goals. And as I\u2019ve already mentioned, and as you can see in the slide, we successfully achieved each of these five targets on a GAAP as well as an adjusted basis during 2018. We had record revenue of $4.5 billion, a 4% increase over 2017. Our expenses remained well controlled, declining 2% year-over-year on a GAAP basis, and up 3% on an adjusted basis. Our commitment to positive operating leverage coupled with the scale we achieved through the FirstMerit acquisition drove our efficiency ratio down from 64% in 2015, the first full year under the plan to 57% in 2018. And this exemplifies that our strategies are carefully decisioned, well executed and certainly driving impressive results.","Our credit metrics remain very strong. Our net charge-off ratio for 2018 remained below our average through the cycle target range of 35 to 55 basis points. Loan loss provisions in excess of net charge-offs have now been taken in each of the past six quarters demonstrating our high quality earnings. Our 18% return on tangible common equity positions Huntington as a top performing regional bank.","Now Slide 5 provides our new three-year financial targets that are a result of our 2018 strategic plan in process. Through thoughtful investment and disciplined execution, our two previous strategic plans build our capabilities, strengthened our competitive advantages in key businesses and positioned us as an industry leader in customer experience. The new 2018 strategic plan is designed to drive continued improvement in financial performance as well as customer experience.","We introduced some details to the 2018 plan at an industry conference in November, the initiatives will build upon momentum from our previous strategic plans and will extend our customer experience advantage across our businesses to improve customer acquisition, reduce customer attrition and deepen relationships with our customers.","Further, we planned investments in digital, data and technology enhancements that will bolster our existing capabilities and infrastructure with the goal of making banking intuitive, easier and faster for our customers. Finally, we retained our capital priorities including our 9% to 10% CET1 operating range.","Now let\u2019s turn to Slide 6 to review the 2019 expectations and discuss the current economic and competitive environment in our markets. As we look to the year ahead, we are cognizant of recent market volatility, mixed economic data and changing interest rate outlook. We\u2019re very focused on and closely working with our customers and reacting to their views of the economy.","Recall it over the years, we\u2019ve communicated actions that we\u2019ve taken to de-risk our portfolios and strengthen our risk management disciplines. In 2009, we centralized credit risk management rather than delegate it to the regions and this change was to ensure that the bank had standard set of enterprise wide risk management capabilities and appetite as well as credit metrics.","We eliminated products that didn\u2019t meet our risk profile such as auto leasing and home equity lines of credit, requiring balloon payments at the end of the draw period. Three years ago, we pulled back on leverage lending and commercial real estate, specifically multi-family, retail and construction. We have remained disciplined in these areas. And as a percentage of capital, all of these have lower exposure today than at 2016 year end.","Our consumer lending is targeted to prime plus consumers across all of our consumer loan portfolios. We disclose detailed origination data each quarter. And the slides include annual data for the past nine years. We believe these actions of the past decade, including a consistency of underwriting and detailed metrics that we disclose to you every quarter, have prepared us well, to perform well across economic cycles, what we\u2019re hearing from our customers is positive.","Businesses in our local markets generally continue to deliver good performance. The strong C&I activity in the fourth quarter suggest the businesses are investing in capital expenditures and business expansions. Uniformly, we hear our customers that their biggest issue is the tight labor markets constraining economic growth in a period, where we already have strong GDP growth.","The Midwest has had the highest job opening rate in the nation for the last two years. And some of these businesses have weathered the headwinds of ongoing tariff and trade disputes. Further, consumers also remain upbeat with strong labor markets, driving wage inflation. Consumer confidence in the Midwest was the second highest level in December in nearly two decades, and was also higher than the nation as a whole. Additionally, in the 12 months ending November, 19 of our 20 largest footprint MSAs saw employment growth and unemployment rates remain at historic low levels.","So I\u2019d summarize by saying that we\u2019re bullish on our footprint and our customers. We expect full year average loan growth in the range of 4% to 6%. Full year average deposit growth is also expected to be 4% to 6% as we remain focused on acquiring core checking accounts and deepening core deposit relationships. In light of recent market volatility, the flattening of the yield curve as well as the softer tone coming from the Federal Reserve. We have removed the assumption of two additional rate hikes in our 2019 forecast.","We are now utilizing the same unchanged rates scenario that has been part of our annual plan for the last several years. And given that change in modeling assumptions, we now expect full year revenue growth of 4% to 7%. Full year NIM is expected to remain relatively flat on a GAAP basis versus 2018 as modest core NIM expansion offsets the anticipated reduction in the benefit of purchase accounting.","With the change in revenue outlook, we\u2019ve paced our planned investments for 2019. We now expect a 2% to 4% increase in non-interest expense consistent with our stated priorities. We continue to target annual positive operating leverage in 2019. We anticipate the net charge-offs will remain below our average through-the-cycle target range of 35 to 55 basis points. Our expectation for the full year 2019 effective tax rate is in the 15.5% to 16% range.","So with that, Mac, I\u2019ll turn it over to you to provide an overview to financial performance for the fourth quarter and the full year.","Mac McCullough","Thanks, Steve and good morning, everyone. Slide 7 provides the highlights for the full year 2018. Steve mentioned, we are very pleased with our 2018 results. We reported earnings per common share of $1.20, up 20% compared to 2017. We continue to see solid growth in core customer relationships and disciplined execution of our business models driving full year revenue growth of 4%, a 2% decline in non-interest expense, 6% average loan and lease growth and 5% core deposit growth.","Our full year efficiency ratio was 57%. Return on assets was 1.3%, return on common equity was 13% and return on tangible common equity was 18%. We believe all three of these metrics distinguish Huntington among our regional bank peers. Tangible book value per share increased 5% year-over-year to $7.34 even with the increased dividend and substantial share repurchases during the year.","Slide 8 provides similar financial highlights for the fourth quarter. Please note that comparisons the year ago quarter are impacted by the $123 million tax benefit recognized in the fourth quarter of 2017 related to Federal Tax Reform. We posted record quarterly revenue of $1.2 billion, up 4% versus the year ago quarter. As we continue to see momentum build across the franchise. We reported earnings per common share of $0.29, down 22% year-over-year.","Excluding the $123 million tax benefit in the year ago quarter, earnings per common share were up $0.03 or 12% year-over-year on an adjusted basis. Return on assets was 1.3%, return on common equity was 13% and return on tangible common equity was 17%.","We saw net interest margin expansion of 11 basis points to 3.41% compared to the 2017 fourth quarter, as a result of disciplined asset and deposit pricing and the benefit of interest rate increases partially offset by the run-off of purchase accounting accretion.","Turning now to Slide 9, we had very good balance sheet growth during the fourth quarter, as average earning assets grew 4% from the fourth quarter of 2017. This increase was driven by a 7% growth in average loans and leases, which include a broad-based strength in both consumer and commercial portfolios. Average residential mortgage loans increased 20% year-every-year, reflecting an increase in loan officers as well as the expansion into the Chicago market. As we typically do, we sold the agency qualified mortgage production in the quarter and retained jumbo mortgages and specialty mortgage products. ","Average C&I loans increased 8% year-over-year with 10% linked quarter annualized, reflecting the ongoing strength we are seeing in the Midwest economy. We once again saw heavy C&I activity during the final weeks of the year, centered in middle market, asset finance and corporate banking.","Average auto loans increased 4% year-over-year as a result of consistent disciplined loan production. Originations totaled $1.4 billion down 9% year-over-year. As we have previously mentioned, we\u2019re \u2013 we executed a pricing strategy during the second half of the year to optimize revenue. We consistently increased auto loan pricing throughout 2018 with new money yields on our auto originations averaging 4.60% during the fourth quarter up 109 basis points from the year ago quarter.","Average RV and marine loans increased 34% year-over-year, reflecting the success of our well-managed expansion of the business into 17 new states over the past two years.","Average commercial real estate loans were down 4% on a year-over-year basis and down 3% on a linked quarter basis. This reflects anticipated pay downs as well as our strategic tightening of commercial real estate lending, as Steve mentioned earlier to ensure appropriate returns on capital.","Finally, securities were down 7% year-over-year, as we left the portfolio run-off and utilize the cash flows to fund higher yielding loans during 2018.","Turning now to Slide 10. Average total deposits grew 7% year-over-year, including a 7% increase in average core deposits. Core certificates of deposits were up 193% from the year ago quarter, primarily reflecting consumer deposit growth initiatives during the first three quarters of 2018. Average interest-bearing DDA deposits increased 9% year-over-year, while average noninterest-bearing DDA deposits decreased 6%.","We can seem to see our commercial customers shift balances from noninterest-bearing DDA to interest-bearing products, primarily interest checking, hybrid checking and money market. However, as shown on Slide 38 in the appendix, our consumer noninterest-bearing deposits actually increased 5% year-over-year as we continue to grow households and deepen relationships.","Average money market deposits were up 4% year-over-year, driven by solid growth in consumer balances and changing preferences of commercial customers shifting to the higher yielding products. As you can see in the bottom left of the page, our percentage of core deposit funding has increased three quarters in a row. Our focus on core funding resulted in a 65% year-over-year reduction in average short-term borrowings.","Moving now to Slide 11. Our net interest income increased $59 million or 8% versus the year ago quarter. Driving this growth was the 4% increase in average earning assets, higher yields, in both our consumer and commercial loan portfolios and disciplined deposit pricing.","Our GAAP net interest margin was 3.41% for the fourth quarter, up 11 basis points from the year ago quarter and up nine basis points linked quarter.","Moving to Slide 12. Our core net interest margin for the fourth quarter was 3.34%, up 14 basis points from the year ago quarter, and up nine basis points linked quarter. Both the GAAP and core NIMs in the fourth quarter benefited from two basis points of higher than normal commercial interest recoveries.","Purchase accounting accretion contributed seven basis points to the net interest margin in the current quarter compared to 10 basis points in the year ago quarter. Slide 34 in the appendix provides information regarding the actual and scheduled impact of FirstMerit purchase accounting for 2018 through 2020. As you will see, purchase accounting accretion is becoming less and less material to the net interest margin and certainly the bottom line when all of the income statement components of purchase accounting are considered together.","As Steve mentioned, assuming no further increases from the Fed in 2019, the full-year 2019 and NIM is expected to remain relatively flat on a GAAP basis versus 2018, as modest core NIM expansion offsets the anticipated reduction in the benefit of purchase accounting. The 2019 NIM guidance also reflects certain costs to begin to reduce our asset sensitivity position.","Turning to earning asset yields. Our commercial loan yields increased 71 basis points year-over-year, while consumer loan yields increased 36 basis points. Our deposit cost remained well contained with the rate paid on total interest-bearing deposits of 84 basis points for the quarter up 47 basis points year-over-year. Consumer core deposit costs were up 36 basis points year-over- year and commercial core deposits were up 30 basis points.","Moving now to Slide 13. Our cycle-to-date beta \u2013 deposit beta remains low at 30% through the fourth quarter of 2018, which is still well below our expectations. We have been communicating that we believe our consumer core CD strategies initiated at the beginning of 2018 will serve us well over time and you can see that beginning to happen here on the slide. This quarter we saw only a 2% increase in our cumulative beta, while the peer group increased 4%. As we have mentioned the last couple of quarters, overall deposit pricing remains rational in our markets. ","Slide 14 provides detail on our non-interest income for the quarter and comparisons to the year ago quarter. Our non-interest income decreased $11 million or 3% from the fourth quarter of 2017. This decline was primarily driven by $19 million of securities losses resulting from 2018 fourth quarter portfolio repositioning. Earlier in the quarter, we remixed approximately $1.1 billion of securities with an incremental yield pickup of almost 120 basis points by modestly extending duration and without taking additional credit risk.","The restructuring of the portfolio was completed in the first half of the fourth quarter and added approximately $3 million of incremental quarterly run rate for the revenue line. We are seeing positive momentum in our three largest contributors to fee income as deposit service charges, cards and payments processing fees and trust and investment management fees were all higher year-over-year. Further, we continue to see strong momentum in our capital markets business as demonstrated by a 26% increase versus the year-ago quarter.","The acquisition of Hutchinson, Shockey and Erley contributed $4 million of capital market fees during the quarter. Mortgage banking income was down $11 million driven by pressure on secondary marketing spreads.","Slide 15 highlights the components of the $78 million or 12% year-over-year growth in expenses. Expenses related to branch and facility consolidations totaled $35 million including $28 million in net occupancy expense and $7 million of equipment expense. results also included almost $4 million of expense related to the closing of the HSE acquisition and the announcement of the divestiture of our Wisconsin retail branch network. As we execute on our new strategic plan, we have not lost sight of the need to control expenses in a more uncertain economic environment. To that end, we remain focused on driving positive operating leverage while making disciplined investments in our colleagues and businesses.","Slide 16 illustrates the continued strength of our capital ratios, tangible common equity into the quarter at 7.21%, down 13 basis points year-over-year, and four basis points linked quarter. common equity in tier one ended the quarter at 9.65%, down 34 basis points year-over-year and 24 basis points linked quarter. These declines were driven by balance sheet growth and accelerated share repurchase activity. We will continue to manage CET1 with our \u2013 within our 9% to 10% operating guideline with a bias towards the upper end of the range.","Slide 17 illustrates our previously articulated capital priorities. First, fund organic growth; second, support the cash dividend; and finally, everything else including share repurchases and selective M&A. Our strong capital management and profitability allowed us to execute on these priorities accordingly in 2018. first, we grew full-year average loans by 6% year-over-year while maintaining consistent underwriting discipline.","During 2018, we increased the common dividend by 43% to $0.50 per share for the full year. Our end of year dividend yield was 4.7%, the highest in the peer group. Finally, we repurchased $939 million of common stock during the year. Recall that in the 2018 first quarter, we converted $363 million of our Series A preferred stock to common shares. This set us up well going into the 2018 CCAR planning process and allowed us to submit a request that would result of in a full-year total payout ratio above 100%.","We have previously stated that we have a long-term payout ratio target of 70% to 80% and a long-term dividend payout ratio target of approximately 45%. during the fourth quarter, we received no objection from the Federal Reserve to our proposal to adjust the path of common stock repurchases. This allowed us to pull forward repurchases from 2019 in the end of the fourth quarter in order to take advantage of market volatility. As a result, during the fourth quarter, we repurchased $200 million of common shares at an average cost of $13.36 per share. We have $177 million of share repurchase capacity remaining under a 2018 CCAR capital plan.","Moving on to Slide 18, credit quality remains strong in the quarter. Consistent prudent credit underwriting is one of Huntington\u2019s core principles, and our financial results continue to reflect our disciplined approach to risk management and our aggregate moderate-to-low risk appetite. We booked loan loss provision expense of $61 million in the fourth quarter and net charge-offs of $50 million. The loan loss provision expense in the quarter reflected the strong loan growth that we saw. We have now booked loan loss provision expense above net charge-offs for 12 of the 13 quarters illustrating our high-quality earnings.","Net charge-offs represented an annualized 27 basis points of average loans and leases, which remains below our average through the cycle target range of 35 to 55 basis points. Net charge-offs were up 11 basis points from the prior quarter and up three basis points from the year-ago quarter.","There is additional granularity on charge-offs by portfolio in the analyst package in the slides. The allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of loans decreased one basis point linked quarter to 1.03% while the non-performing asset ratio came down three basis points to 0.52%.","Slide 19 highlights Huntington\u2019s strong position to execute on our strategy and provide consistent through the cycle shareholder returns. The graph on the top left quadrant represents our continued growth in pre-tax, preprovision net revenue as a result of focused execution of our core strategies. The strong level of capital generation positions us well to support balance sheet growth and return capital to our shareholders and advantage rate over the long-term.","At the top right, chart highlights the well-balanced mix of our loan and deposit portfolios. We are both a consumer and commercial bank, and believe that the diversification of the balance sheet will serve us well over the cycle. Our DFAST stress test results in the bottom left highlight our disciplined enterprise risk management. We consistently rank in the top four commercial banks in the severely adverse scenario DFAST. Finally, at the bottom right, demonstrates Huntington\u2019s strong capital position.","Let me turn it back over to mark, so we can get to your questions.","Mark Muth","Thanks, Mac. Brenda, we will now take questions. We ask that as a courtesy to your peers, each person ask only one question and one related follow-up and if that person has additional questions, he or she can then add themselves back into the queue. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from the line of Scott Siefers with Sandler O\u2019Neill.","Scott Siefers","Good morning, Scott.","Scott Siefers","Mac, I was hoping you could expand a little on your thoughts on how the core margin kind of trajects throughout the course of the year. I think I\u2019ve done math correctly, in other words, there was the couple of basis points of benefit from interest recoveries in the fourth quarter, but the full-year guide looks like it would imply kind of flat to down from here despite some of the balance sheet restructuring actions in the fourth quarter. So, I\u2019m just curious \u2013 I mean that would be of course, understandable given the environment, but just curious how you see things playing out from where you sit?","Mac McCullough","Yes. Thanks, Scott. So the guidance that we\u2019re giving as we move to an unchanged rate curve is very consistent with the guidance that we\u2019ve given historically over the past few years, as we\u2019ve used the unchanged rate curve to build our budget. So, basically, you capture the two basis points of \u2013 I would say over normal interest recoveries in the fourth quarter. So, you have to adjust for that as a starting point. And then we\u2019ll actually lose three basis points in full-year 2019 related to a purchase accounting accretion, it\u2019s about four basis points additive to the 2019 margin versus seven basis points to the 2018 margin.","So from there, I think it\u2019s just a matter of taking a look at the core NIM and believing that that\u2019s going to increase modestly, we\u2019ve talked about a basis point or two, I would say for the full year, we\u2019re likely looking for a three or four basis point increase and that is driven both by the fact that we took the two rate that increases out of the forecast and also the shape of the curve. It\u2019s much flatter than \u2013 when we\u2019ve done this historically and that also impacted the guidance for the NIM in 2019. So, those are the components that bringing all together. So again, kind of a flat reported NIM and modestly improving core NIM.","Scott Siefers","Okay. All right, perfect. Thank you. And then I guess just as we look at the overall revenue growth guide I guess, it\u2019s going to be driven relatively a little more by fee income as opposed to NII this year. And I know you have the benefit of the acquisition from second half of last year. But as you look out through the year main drivers of that fee momentum as you see them.","Mac McCullough","We have really good momentum in capital markets as I mentioned in the script and we also see continued good improvements in deposit service charges that we continue to build households very impressively. We also see good performance in the card and payments line, and also in trust and investment management fees. So, we see good performance across those four categories, partially offset by what we see in mortgage banking in this quarter, but certainly, we have really good momentum in those other lines.","Scott Siefers","Perfect. All right, great. Thank you very much.","Mac McCullough","Thanks, Scott.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Ken Usdin","Hey, Mac.","Mac McCullough","Hey, Ken.","Ken Usdin","So in fourth quarter, NIM was 3.41% with the two interest recoveries, that\u2019s 3.39%. So, can you just explain sequentially, I\u2019m not sure I understand the magnitude of a six-basis point drop and then staying there for the rest of the year, especially with the help you just mentioned from the portfolio purchase knowing that there is the accretion run-off. So can you help us a little bit more understand just the step down and \u2013 because I don\u2019t \u2013 I get the moving parts of among the positive versus the negative, but the delta from that kind of underlying, can you help us understand what drives such a big step down?","Mac McCullough","Yes. So can I \u2013 I do think a portion of it is going to be based on what we\u2019re assuming around will be the shape of the curve in 2019. There is incremental impact from that based on what we\u2019ve modeled for the budget in the forecast in 2019. We could also have some deposit cost maybe front-loaded into the first and second quarters. As we continue to see good momentum and good flow of deposits across both commercial and consumer, we just want to make sure that we keep that momentum going. We\u2019ve done a good job in reducing our short-term borrowings and we want to continue to stay in that position.","So I think at this point, just thinking about the full year and thinking about the core NIM increasing three to four basis points is the way to think about it, there could be some conservatism built in this, but it all comes down to what we\u2019re assuming around the rate environment and also how we\u2019re thinking about liability cost and what we want to do to stay core funded.","Ken Usdin","Okay. And then just a follow-up on the full-year guide, then in your total revenue guide, which I always understand is on a \u2013 it\u2019s GAAP, but inclusive of the FTE. Do you include anything either on a gain from the branch sales or also the effect of removing that business from the total revenue base? Thanks.","Mac McCullough","Yes. So we certainly have impact when you think about the 70 branch consolidations and you think about the sale of the Wisconsin branches. There\u2019s no doubt that there\u2019s revenue impact from that and most of that is going to come in the form of net interest income. So we have factored those impacts into 2019. And you\u2019re right, we look at it on an FTE basis, but there really are no other adjustments in 2019 to speak up.","Ken Usdin","Okay.","Mac McCullough","Okay?","Ken Usdin","Yes. So there is no gain baked into that as well?","Mac McCullough","Yes, there is no gain on sale baked into any of these numbers for 2019.","Ken Usdin","Understood. Okay. Thank you, Mac.","Mac McCullough","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley.","Ken Zerbe","Great Thanks.","Mac McCullough","Hey, Ken.","Ken Zerbe","Sorry to ask another question on margin. I just want to be really quick is that is a pretty steep drop that you guys are building in on a core basis. So, if we go from the 3.41%, 3.39% excluding two basis points, I get it. You say that your deposit cost is going be front-loaded. I mean, are we looking at a meaningful step down in first quarter specifically or to get your full-year guidance, is it more of just this gradual reduction over the course of the year?","Mac McCullough","Yes, it would definitely be a gradual reduction over the course of the year and that would be primarily the report as the core NIM even adjusting for the two basis points in the fourth quarter, I would say over normal interest recoveries. You could see a step-up in the first quarter in the core NIM. So, it really is the impact of purchase accounting and the impact of the interest recoveries that would be impacting the reported NIM. So, we\u2019re not talking about huge changes here and either, we\u2019re talking about basis points, but that should help to explain some of that drop fourth quarter to first quarter.","Ken Zerbe","Got you. It does, it does. So then by the end of the year, maybe your \u2013 I mean I pick a number, plus cost 3.30% is your sort of reported NIM heading into 2020. That seems like the right way to think about it.","Mac McCullough","Yes, that\u2019s not unreasonable.","Ken Zerbe","Got it. Okay. And then sorry, there might sort of follow-up question, if you will. Can you just talk a little bit more about what you\u2019re doing specifically to help reduce your asset sensitive position and how much is that dollar impact in terms of your NII? Thanks.","Mac McCullough","Yes. So what we\u2019re looking at right now would be out of the money interest rate floors. You might see us also add some additional investment securities to reduce some of that asset sensitivity. Overall, we think that there is a slight cost to the out of money interest rate floors, but not significant in the scheme of things based upon the way we\u2019re thinking about it right now. But we\u2019re continuing to evaluate that position based on how 2019 unfolds. You could see us further reduce that asset sensitivity position, but we\u2019re comfortable with how we\u2019re positioned right now and the actions that we\u2019re taking.","Ken Zerbe","All right. Perfect. Thank you.","Mac McCullough","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI.","Steve Steinour","Good morning, John.","Mac McCullough","Hi, John.","John Pancari","Good morning. On your long-term goals, just seems like you maintained your long-term revenue target of 4% to 6% despite removing the Fed hikes from your 2019 assumptions and assuming a flatter curve and everything, and I\u2019m assuming dialing in some of this hedging plans and everything. So does that mean in terms of long-term revenue expectation you can come in at the lower end of that 4% to 6%? Or do you still have a high degree of confidence in the attainability of the mid or higher end?","Mac McCullough","Yes, John, its Mac. So we feel comfortable with the range that we\u2019ve put out. When we put a range out like this, we typically earn that at the low-end or at the high-end and we have \u2013 we probably do have some conservatism built into 2019 from a revenue perspective as we think about this. But feel very comfortable with the 4% to 7% range we put out there for revenue. We did bring it down, it was 5% to 8% that we disclosed in November at an industry conference.","So that certainly would reflect the impact that we see from the rate increases coming out of the forecast. But I would tell you that from a fundamental balance sheet growth fee income perspective, we really haven\u2019t made any changes to what we see based upon what Steve talked about the strength of the Midwest economy and what we\u2019re hearing from our customers. We also did take the expense guidance down by a 1% on either end just recognizing the fact that in this environment we\u2019ve got to manage the expense to fit the revenue outlook and continue to drive the positive operating leverage. So we feel very comfortable with the ranges that we put out and, again, the revenue impact is entirely due to the change in the rate outlook.","John Pancari","Got it. Okay, thanks. And then separately I just want to ask around credit for the \u2013 I just wanted if you can get a little bit more color on the $20 million \u2013 $21 million increase in charge-offs, I know you indicated that at C&I, just want to see if you have any more color there that you can give us what type of industries and if there\u2019s any kind of leverage lending in there? And then separately, your 30 to 89 day delinquencies in C&I increase, it looks like 43%, so the ratio went from 19 to 26 bps, not a big jump in the ratio, but still pretty big jump dollar wise. So want to get some color there? Thanks.","Steve Steinour","Sure. So just in terms of the charge-offs. I think it\u2019s important to obviously point out that we\u2019re operating at a very low level. So in the entire C&I book in the last year, I think we took $15 million of total charge-offs that\u2019s commercial and commercial real estate. So just to kind of level set there, last quarter, we actually had net recoveries in the entire commercial book. So in terms of concentrations, there certainly aren\u2019t any because the numbers are so low. We had no charge-off in the last quarter larger than $4 million. We had one for $3 million, one for $2 million. They are all in different industries. There were no leverage lending, no leveraged loans in that population.","So \u2013 and if you look year-over-year in terms of our charge-offs that\u2019s there they are very consistent, 24 basis points to 27 and that\u2019s largely due to the fact that fourth quarter the consumer loans are generally, you\u2019ll see delinquencies and charge-offs bump up. So we \u2013 so from that standpoint, I think that\u2019s the story on the charge-offs. And then on the delinquencies, commercial delinquencies are you can have a single deal that moves the numbers may hit over or over 30 days and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve got going on here. That\u2019s not the indicator of any trend there, so no concerns at all.","John Pancari","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Peter Winter with Wedbush.","Peter Winter","Good morning.","Steve Steinour","Good morning, Peter.","Peter Winter","I wanted to ask about mortgage banking. Obviously given the market conditions under a lot of pressure. But should we think about the fourth quarter being close to bottoming here?","Mac McCullough","So, Peter, it\u2019s really going to depend on where we end up with the secondary marketing, that\u2019s been the pressure point for the entire year. We\u2019ve actually performed well from a volume perspective as we\u2019ve added mortgage originators in the Chicago market at \u2013 performing at a very high level. And we\u2019ve also, I would say upgraded talent across the franchise from a mortgage perspective. So feel very comfortable with the health of the business we completed a in-depth analysis for the business in 2018 and feel very comfortable with our position and how we\u2019re managing that business. But it just depends on where we go from secondary marketing from here.","Peter Winter","Okay. And then Mac, if I could just follow-up on your comments about the securities portfolio. In 2018, you kind of ran it off as \u2013 partly, I guess as of funding for loan growth and then you said you might actually add to securities to reduce the asset sensitivity?","Mac McCullough","Yes.","Peter Winter","Can you just talk about what the \u2013 so we should expect 2019 to see that portfolio actually grow a little bit and more reliance on core deposits just the way to think about it.","Mac McCullough","Yes. Peter, so we are going to start to reinvest cash flow in 2019 back into the portfolio as well as maybe get a little bit more aggressive in building the portfolio if we decide that\u2019s the best action to manage our asset sensitivity. So we did let the portfolio run down in 2018, we did replace those assets with resi mortgage that we kept on the balance sheet to a certain extent. But you\u2019ll start to see us grow that portfolio in 2019 and the degree to which we use that as a hedge against asset sensitivity is still under consideration, but you could see that.","Peter Winter","Thanks, Mac.","Mac McCullough","Yes. Thanks, Peter.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks.","Marty Mosby","Morning.","Steve Steinour","Hi, Marty.","Mac McCullough","Hi, Marty.","Marty Mosby","I had two questions. One is, Mac, when we look at this net interest margin, I don\u2019t want to go back to the details of that, we\u2019ve hammer that pretty hard. What I want to do is combine that with the other side, which is, you\u2019ve been building your allowance coverage as this PAA is being recognized. So it\u2019s kind of just a natural shift between kind of the PAA that\u2019s over there and then also and it comes out it and becomes a regular loan and then you put it back into the build. So there is kind of a natural offset. You\u2019ve had $20 million of average build in your allowance through each quarter in 2018.","So just wondering, because a lot of the margin compression that\u2019s really kind of getting communicated here is the purchase accounting accretion, so is there a natural offset, you just don\u2019t have to build as much in your allowance that helps to compensate for some of that impact.","Mac McCullough","Yes, Marty. I think we lay that up pretty well on Slide 34 in the deck, where you can see that, for 2019, we\u2019re anticipating that the overall impact of purchase accounting is actually a loss or minus $8 million for full year 2019. So we are seeing the first accounting accretion come down, we\u2019re seeing what we need to add to the allowance for the FirstMerit portfolio to come down since we\u2019re cycling through that. We still have a bit to go.","But as you can see on Slide 34, we still anticipate some provision expense related to FirstMerit in 2019. So I think this slide does layout how all these things play together and the impact on the bottom line, but clearly PAA is becoming less material and we\u2019ll have less of an impact on the margin in 2019, but certainly still does have that impact.","Marty Mosby","And just the build also kind of comes down I guess as well, the need to build for the FirstMerit is less, there\u2019s still some because there\u2019s still some PAA, but it\u2019s less than what it was in 2018.","Mac McCullough","That would be absolutely correct.","Marty Mosby","Okay. And then Steve, you kind of threw something in there early on about this almost like a vesting till retirement for equity positions of members of your team. Just was curious about how you envision that, why you chose to highlighted and how you think that affects culture in a way that the employees kind of look at equity ownership?","Steve Steinour","So Marty, we may not have been totally clear in the past, but we made this change in 2010 and we put percentage of equity granted, net of tax into a hold to retirement requirement for colleagues and overtime its accumulated to where we have 1,400 colleagues in some position with a hold to retirement and it gets track, these are shares that are segregated in a separate account with the third-party. And we believe what we did it and continue to believe that it aligns the management of the company with our shareholders\u2019 interests. And I think we\u2019ve seen over time a greater focus on risk management across the board, but especially in credit with it \u2013 throughout the company as a consequence.","So there\u2019s definitely skin in the game as a result of this and we \u2013 2009, we as a group were not a top 100 shareholder, today with generally the seventh largest shareholder with the growing position off of equity grants made every year. So fundamental change in philosophy going back to 2010 by the board and very supportive in making the change we recommended to make sure that there is complete alignment between management and shareholders overtime and through cycles. Is that answers your question?","Marty Mosby","It did and it was not a 100%, but there\u2019s a portion or amount that\u2019s actually set aside, that would be vested at retirement.","Steve Steinour","Its 25% to 50% of equity granted net of taxes and there is no ceiling. So it compounds.","Marty Mosby","No, that\u2019s great as an industrially angle and not \u2013 so all that\u2019s that about the seventh holder of shareholder I thought that was very impactful and interesting. So thanks.","Steve Steinour","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Lana Chan with BMO.","Lana Chan","Good morning.","Steve Steinour","Hey, Lana.","Mac McCullough","Good morning.","Lana Chan","I just \u2013 first question about what you\u2019re seeing with competition. It seems like there is some new bigger banks moving into some of your markets and also any comments about non-bank competition any changes in the recent quarter?","Steve Steinour","Lana, this is Steve. We monitor through a number of different data points impacts of non-bank competition is remains very, very muted and essentially no change quarter-to-quarter from what we can see. And then separately, we have some banks, larger banks expanding into the footprint. But we have a lot of large banks already here. So the old bank, one presence here in Columbus, JPM Chase is very, very large in Columbus in terms of employees. We see BBVA in Michigan. So there is a presence from the large banks already and we\u2019ve \u2013 through our strategies and focus, we have managed to compete okay or adequately and somewhat successfully over time. We\u2019d expect to continue to do that. But recognize that there are some targeted investments in the Midwest. Actually, we view that as a positive in some sense. The Midwest was clearly a disinvestment region for years and years and it\u2019s an affirmation of what\u2019s going on in the economy here to show \u2013 to see that recent focus.","Lana Chan","Okay, thank you. And the second question was around capital. Just wondering the way you look at the CET1 ratio targeting at upper end of the 9% to 10% range. Is there also a binding constraint on that in terms of \u2013 sort of the old school capital ratios that we used to look at prior to the financial crisis the TCE to TA ratio?","Mac McCullough","Yes, Lana, we do take a look at tangible common equity quite carefully and we do monitor that ratio relative to CET1. CET1 is our primary constraint as we think about the CCAR process and what we\u2019ve set goals around. And we do have a bit of a larger gap between TCE and CET1 because of the size of our investment security portfolio and the makeup of that investment security portfolio. So at this level, we\u2019re comfortable with TCE, but CET1 is the measure that we basically measure and go against.","Lana Chan","Okay. Thanks, Mac.","Mac McCullough","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Jon Arfstrom with RBC.","Jon Arfstrom","Great. Thanks. Good morning.","Steve Steinour","Good morning, Jon.","Jon Arfstrom","Steve, maybe a quick one for you. It sounds like you\u2019re optimistic lending in the economy, but just \u2013 and you talk about the labor issue, I\u2019m just curious if you\u2019re hearing anything new that causes you any concerns? Or anything from your customers that might be a little bit different than what you\u2019ve heard in previous quarters?","Steve Steinour","Jon, we\u2019ve done more outreach in the last 60 days or so than at any time since I\u2019ve been here. The customer has to get a sense of what their plans are and the impacts of the market volatility and at least at this point, it is very, very benign. There are some companies impacted both ways on the tariffs as we\u2019d expect, but the market volatility has not impacted at this point in any material way outlook. So there is a continued expectation of growth, maybe these companies have backlogs or pipelines that are committed. And I think I shared in the last call, we get contractors and others with long lead times that are well out into next year was with the group that\u2019s \u2013 has commitments to 2020, 2021. In fact, so it\u2019s getting extended, again, this tightness of labor is benefiting, so the competitive dynamics in some of these industries, the fact that they can just deliver is giving them a locked in opportunity of a longer duration that they\u2019ve seen.","Jon Arfstrom","Okay, good. Thank you, that helps. And then a question on the expense guidance in terms of the change in expense growth by basically by taking rates out of your revenue side. Can you give us some \u2013 these aren\u2019t big numbers, but can you give us an idea of the types of projects you might delay a bit and if we do get a couple of more hikes, does that change your spending plans again and where would that money go?","Steve Steinour","Sure. Jon, we have a fair amount of reinvestment coming off of the branch consolidations that are completed and were completed around the end of the year and the sale of Wisconsin. And so we\u2019re self-funding a fair amount of investment in digital, data and other technology. In addition to building out a number of our revenue groups and so you\u2019ll see expansions in business banking, commercial banking, some of our fee businesses on the private banking side and the capital markets in particular.","We\u2019ll pace the rate of investment and we\u2019ve talked about this in prior quarterly calls and an analyst sessions, we\u2019ll pace the rate of investment to match the expected revenue, it was not like we\u2019re going to walk away from these. This is just a pacing thing. So if interest rates come our way or for other \u2013 with other reasons where we\u2019re generating revenue add or beyond the high-end level of that range, we would look to accelerate some of the investments, but we\u2019ll continue to manage it, we\u2019ll pace it or moderate it as we see the economy in the outlook.","Jon Arfstrom","Okay, all right. Thank you.","Steve Steinour","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Barker with Piper Jaffray.","Steve Steinour","Good morning, Kevin.","Kevin Barker","Good morning. I just want to follow-up, you mentioned the capital markets pipeline was really strong . You had a really good quarter, fourth quarter and it could be some seasonality in there, but when you look into 2019, where do you see the run rate from the $29 million you have today expected to come down in the first half and then accelerate in the back half. Just give us some color on the capital market side?","Mac McCullough","So Kevin, its Mac. So it will be, it\u2019s usually a little bit slower in the first quarter, but we do expect capital markets revenue to increase as the year progresses. We\u2019ve made some, I think some smart investments into that business and really executing at a very high level when it comes to the people we have on that team and how they interact and support of lending groups.","Steve Steinour","Well the pipelines as we enter the year are consistent with third, fourth quarter sort of pipeline. So we have reasonable volumes that we\u2019re expecting over the first half of the year from the pipeline and a lot of that C&I, again, our capital markets activity is customer focused. And \u2013 so the carry \u2013 the continued strength of the pipeline gives us some confidence as we move forward in addition to the investments and additional capabilities.","Kevin Barker","And then the follow-up on the expense side, you had the $28 million you called out in the branch consolidation and $7 million in equipment. So we assume the run rate associated with occupancy and equipment to be significantly lower going into 2019 and then the 2% to 4% expense growth on a GAAP basis will be primarily due to investments, maybe in salaries or other portions of the business.","Mac McCullough","Yes, Kevin, I think that\u2019s the right way to take a look at it, we\u2019ll definitely see reduced run rates related to the facilities actions that we\u2019ve taken in the fourth quarter branches and kind of corporate facilities. And Steve mentioned some of the investments that we\u2019re doing as we think about the expenses that we took out related to Wisconsin or the 70 branch consolidation. So we\u2019re comfortable with how we\u2019re investing in 2019 and it would be in a typical lines you would expect to see it, personnel and certainly anything that relates to technology development. So those are the areas that I would look for growth, but beyond that, I would say nothing out of the ordinary.","Kevin Barker","Okay. Thank you.","Mac McCullough","Thanks, Kevin.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank.","Matt O\u2019Connor","Good morning. I was just wondering from a strategic point of view, any further bolt-on whether its deals or divestitures? And then obviously you\u2019re not going to tell us accurately what you do, but just thoughts on if there is further tinkering to the franchise and then of course, some \u2013 as you think longer term strategic opportunities that might be bigger that could be interesting?","Mac McCullough","So, Matt, we\u2019re always looking at opportunities and I will tell you that what we\u2019re focused on is probably less around core banking franchises, as we\u2019ve talked about historically and maybe more focused on things like HSE or Macquarie Equipment Finance. So, I think that we haven\u2019t stopped in terms of what we\u2019re looking at from an M&A perspective, but we\u2019re very comfortable with the businesses that we have and it\u2019s not that we\u2019re out looking for something in particular, but anything we can find like an HSE or Macquarie that helps to strengthen our position in businesses that we\u2019re already in, bring us additional capabilities and talent. Those are very attractive opportunities that we think we\u2019ve acquired at a very attractive price. So like I said, we\u2019re always looking, but in this market, I wouldn\u2019t expect that we\u2019re going to be doing a lot if anything.","Steve Steinour","We think, we can improve the core performance as you\u2019ve seen in the long-term financial metrics that as well. And so that\u2019s the focus drive the core.","Matt O\u2019Connor","And then just thoughts on maybe something bigger that will get you more scale, do you feel like you need more scale as we look out kind of more medium to long-term?","Mac McCullough","So we\u2019re comfortable with how we\u2019re positioned right now. I think the FirstMerit transaction was extremely beneficial to us from a scale perspective. Steve pointed out, the improvement in the efficiency ratio earlier in this call. We\u2019ve been pretty direct in the saying that at this point in the cycle and based upon valuations and expectations, it\u2019s very unlikely that we\u2019re going to be doing a core deposit franchise at this point in the cycle. So very, very unlikely math and like I said, we\u2019re focused on some of the specialty things that are few and far between, but good opportunities when we can find them.","Matt O\u2019Connor","Okay, thank you.","Mac McCullough","Yes. Thanks, Matt.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we\u2019ve reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I\u2019d like to turn the call back to Steve Steinour for closing remarks.","Steve Steinour","2018 was highlighted by the achievement for the first time of all five of our long-term financial goals implemented with the 2014 strategic plan on a GAAP basis. We\u2019re really pleased with that. The focused execution of our strategic initiatives over the years spill the company that we believe will produce consistent high-quality earnings and attractive returns to our shareholders.","2019 commences the first year of the new three-year strategic plan. We\u2019ve raised the bar for ourselves once again, as you\u2019ve seen. And while the plan involves important investments in our businesses that will improve our customer experience, the core strategies remain the same. We expect to continue to gain market share and grow share wallet through our differentiated products, distinctive brand and superior customer service. So we see this as a lower risk set of initiatives over the next three years. We look forward to carrying the momentum that we\u2019ve built into 2019 and beyond.","And finally, there\u2019s a high level of management alignment between the Board, management, our colleagues and our shareholders.

It was also another clean quarter as for the third quarter in a row, there were no significant items.","We reported net income of $378 million and earnings per share of $0.33, increases of 37% and 43%, respectively, over the third quarter of 2017.","Return on common equity was 14% and return on tangible common equity was 19%.

We're pleased with the resulting efficiency ratio of 55.3%, an improvement of 520 basis points from the year ago quarter.","The average total loan increase was strong at 7% versus the third quarter of 2017 and 5% annualized versus the 2018 second quarter. This loan growth was driven by a 10% year-over-year increase in average consumer loans with particular strength in residential mortgage, RV and marine financing and automobile lending. We remain focused on core funding the balance sheet with 6% growth in average core deposits.","In the third quarter, we increased the quarterly common dividend to $0.14 per share, representing a 27% linked quarter increase and a 75% year-over-year increase. This year marks the eighth consecutive year that we've increased the common dividend. We believe our earnings power, capital generation and risk management discipline will support higher dividends, including a higher dividend payout ratio over time. We also repurchased $691 million of common shares or approximately 65% of the total repurchase included in our 2018 CCAR capital plan.","As briefly outlined on Slide 3, we developed Huntington strategies with a vision of creating a high-performing regional bank and delivering top quartile through-the-cycle shareholder returns. Our profitability metrics are among the best in the industry, and we have built sustainable competitive advantages in our key businesses that we believe will deliver high performance in the future.","The franchise continues to perform well in many fronts, allowing us to make investments in capabilities we need to drive consistent organic growth. We're focused on driving sustained long-term performance for our shareholders. We remain committed to our aggregate moderate-to-low risk appetite, which we put in place 8 years ago. And as a reminder, we reinforced the importance of these standards by requiring the top 1,400 officers of the company to comply with hold-to-retirement restrictions on their equity awards.","Slide 4 illustrates our long-term financial goals, which were approved by the board in the fall of 2014 as part of our strategic planning process. As a reminder, these goals were originally set with a 5-year time horizon in mind, and we fully expect to achieve these goals this year on a reported GAAP basis, 2 years ahead of original expectations.","I've already touched on our record revenues, the continued expense discipline and our third quarter efficiency ratio, which was below the low end of our long-term goal.","In addition to our credit metrics -- our credit metrics remain excellent. The third quarter of 2018 was the 17th consecutive quarter where net charge-offs remained below our average through-the-cycle target range and loan provisions in excess of that charge-offs have been taken in 12 of the last 13 quarters. Our 19% return on tangible common equity positions Huntington as a top-performing regional bank. Now these results demonstrate that our strategies are clearly working and will continue to drive Huntington forward.","So let's turn to Slide 5 to review 2018 expectations and discuss the current economic and competitive environment in our markets. The local economies across our 8-state footprint continue to perform well, and we remain optimistic on the near-term outlook. Unemployment rates remain near historical lows, and we continue to seek labor shortages throughout our footprint markets. The Midwest, in fact, has the highest job opening rate in the nation so far in 2018. Of the 4 major regions of the country, the Midwest is the most dynamic region for potential jobs growth according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics August JOLTS survey. The employment and growth opportunities in Midwest continue to make it a favorable economic region. 6 of our 8 footprint states experienced net population in-migration in 2017. In fact, 2017 was the first year Ohio had net immigration in a quarter of a century. As shown on Slide 70 in the appendix, the Philadelphia Fed's state leading economic indicator indices for our footprint point toward a favorable economic operating environment for the next 6 months.","While the impact of the ongoing tariff issues, some positive and some negative, can be seen in specific industries, we've not yet seen a material impact to our customer base overall. The uncertainty regarding NAFTA was far more impactful to our customer base and our footprint. And we're encouraged by the new USMCA trade agreement as we believe it will be beneficial to our footprint, especially within the auto industry.","Customer optimism has materialized throughout 2018 as we've seen our customers invest in capital expenditures and grow their businesses. Our commercial pipeline is up year-over-year. Consumers are doing well, with consumer loan growth remaining steady. It's a good time to be doing business in the Midwest, and we remain bullish on our local economies.","Now moving to our updated 2018 expectations. We expect the full year average loan growth rate growth in the range of 5.5% to 6.5%, consistent with our year-over-year growth for the first 9 months. But the fourth quarter provides a challenging comparison given the significant amount of growth at the end of last year following the federal tax reform. Loan growth rates in the third quarter and so far in October have been encouraging.","Full year average deposit growth is expected to be 3.5% to 4.5%, while full year growth in average core deposits is expected to be 4.5% to 5.5%. We remain focused on acquiring core checking accounts and deepening core deposit relationships.","We expect full year revenue growth of 4% to 4.5%, and during the fourth quarter, we expect to realize approximately $20 million of security losses related to a portfolio restructuring. This will allow us to optimize the securities portfolio, improving the revenue outlook for 2019. The modest reduction in our 2018 revenue outlook is related to the cost of the portfolio restructure -- restructuring as all remaining aspects of our prior revenue expectations remain intact.","We continue to project the GAAP NIM for the full year will expand by 2 to 4 basis points compared to 2017. We expect NIM expansion in the fourth quarter on a GAAP and core basis will be in the range of 4 to 6 basis points.","We will deliver positive operating leverage for the sixth consecutive year. We expect a 2% to 2.5% decrease in noninterest expense on a GAAP basis. Full year expenses are now projected to be slightly higher than previous guidance as we expect to incur approximately $40 million of expense in the fourth quarter related to the recently announced consolidation of 70 branches and some additional corporate facilities. The run rate cost savings associated with these consolidations will be entirely redeployed into targeted investments in both people and technology, and specifically, digital and mobile technology. We anticipate the net charge-offs will remain below our average through-the-cycle target range of 35 to 55 basis points. Our expectations for the full year 2018 effective tax rate is in the 14.5% to 15% range.","Before I turn it over to Mac, I'd like to give you a quick update on the strategic planning process we began earlier in the year. We're excited about the progress we've made and the meaningful discussions geared by our Board of Directors, the executive leadership team and many dedicated colleagues in Huntington. In September, we had a 3-day board offsite to further refine and decision the strategic plan. And last week the board had another robust set of conversations as we are nearing completion of the plan. As we previously mentioned, we anticipate new long-term financial goals will be an important outcome of the new strategic plan, and we look forward to sharing those with you later this year. So Mac will now provide an overview of our financial performance. Mac?","Howell McCullough","Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Slide 6 provides the highlights of the third quarter results. As Steve mentioned, we had a strong third quarter. We recorded earnings per common share of $0.33, up 43% over the year ago quarter. Adjusting for $31 million of acquisition-related significant items in the third quarter of 2017, core EPS was up $0.08 or 32% year-over-year.","We are very pleased with the momentum we are seeing across all of our businesses as evidenced by our 5% year-over-year revenue growth and our 55.3% efficiency ratio, down 520 basis points from the year ago quarter.","Return on assets was 1.4%, return on common equity was 14% and return on tangible common equity was 19%. We believe all 3 of these metrics distinguish Huntington among our regional bank peers. ","Tangible book value per share increased 3% year-over-year to $7.06, even with a considerable share repurchase in the quarter. Lastly, the tax rate was 14.1% during the third quarter, which was impacted by a $3 million benefit from stock-based compensation and a $3 million benefit related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.","Turning now to Slide 7. Average earning assets grew 4% from the third quarter of 2017. This increase was driven by a 7% growth in average loans and leases, including broad-based strength in consumer lending.","Average residential mortgage loans increased 22% year-over-year, reflecting an increase in loan officers as well as further expansion into the Chicago market. As we typically do, we sold the agency qualified mortgage production in the quarter and retained the jumbo mortgages and specialty mortgage products.","Average C&I loans increased 4% year-over-year with growth centered in middle market, asset finance, energy and corporate banking. On an inter-period basis, C&I balances increased 5% linked quarter annualized as we saw a healthy pickup in originations in the final month of the quarter.","Average auto loans increased 6% year-over-year as a result of consistent and disciplined loan production. Originations totaled $1.4 billion for the third quarter of 2018, down 15% year-over-year. This was deliberate, as we've been consistently increasing auto loan pricing, which slowed originations while optimizing revenue. The average new money yield on our auto originations was 4.62% in the quarter, up 40 basis points from 4.22% in the second quarter and up 100 basis points from 3.62% in the year ago quarter.","Average RV and marine loans increased 31% year-over-year, reflecting the success of the well-managed expansion of the business into 17 new states over the past two years. Linked quarter growth was 52% annualized, reflecting the normal seasonality during the summer months. ","Average commercial real estate loans were down 1% on a year-over-year basis and down 3% on a linked-quarter basis. This reflects anticipated pay downs as well as our strategic tightening of commercial real estate lending, specifically in multifamily, retail and construction in order to remain consistent with our aggregate moderate- to low-risk appetite and to ensure appropriate returns on capital.","Finally, securities were down 3% year-over-year as we continued to let the portfolio runoff and remix the cash flows into higher-yielding loan products.","Turning now to Slide 8. Average total deposits grew 5% year-over-year, including a 6% increase in average core deposits. Core certificates of deposit were up 141% from the year ago quarter, reflecting the initiatives during the past 3 quarters to grow fixed rate term consumer deposits in light of the raising -- rising interest rate environment. Average interest-bearing DDA deposits increased 9% year-over-year, while average noninterest-bearing DDA deposits decreased 7%. This was almost entirely driven by our commercial customers as they continue to shift from noninterest-bearing to interest-bearing products, primarily interest checking, hybrid checking and money market. However, as shown on Slide 37 in the appendix, our core consumer noninterest-bearing deposits were actually up 5% year-over-year as we continue to grow households and deepen relationships.","Average money market deposits were up 6% year-over-year, driven by solid growth in consumer balances and preferences of commercial customers shifting towards higher yielding products. On a linked-quarter basis, total deposits grew $2.2 billion or 3%, reducing our average short-term borrowings in the quarter by 44%. We remain focused on core funding the balance sheet in the current rising interest rate environment.","Moving now to Slide 9. Our net interest income increased $39 million or 5% versus the year ago quarter. Driving this growth was the 4% increase in earning assets and rising yields in both our consumer and commercial loan portfolios.","Our GAAP net interest margin was 3.32% for the third quarter, up 3 basis points from the year ago quarter and up 3 basis points linked quarter. The third quarter was impacted by a slower rise in short-term rates as average 1-month LIBOR increased 14 basis points during the quarter versus 63 basis points in the first half of the year. We do not anticipate the same headwind in the fourth quarter.","Moving to Slide 10. Our core net interest margin for the third quarter was 3.25%, up 7 basis points from the year ago quarter and up 3 basis points linked quarter. Purchase accounting accretion contributed 7 basis points to the net interest margin compared to 12 basis points in the year ago quarter. Slide 33 in the appendix provides information regarding the scheduled impact of FirstMerit purchase accounting accretion for 2018 and 2019.","On earning asset slide, our commercial loan yields increased 59 basis points year-over-year, while consumer loan yields increased 22 basis points. Our deposit costs remained well contained with the rate paid on total interest-bearing deposits of 73 basis points for the quarter up 38 basis points year-over-year. Consumer core deposits costs were up 26 basis points year-over-year and commercial core deposits costs were up 27 basis points. ","Moving now to Slide 11. Our cycle-to-date deposit beta remains low at 28% through the third quarter of 2018, which is still well below our expectations. While our CD funding strategy negatively impacted our deposit beta in the second and third quarters, our core deposit growth continues to outpace peers, and we'll be better positioned for continued interest rate increases in the future. As we told you last quarter, overall deposit pricing remains rational in our markets.","Slide 12 provides detail on our noninterest income for the quarter and comparison to the year ago quarter. Our noninterest income increased $12 million or 4% from the third quarter of 2017. We are seeing momentum in our fee businesses, driven by our ongoing household and relationship acquisition and the execution of our strategies, including our Optimal Customer Relationship strategy.","Slide 13 highlights the key drivers in our 4% year-over-year reduction in reported noninterest expense. Comparisons to the third quarter of 2017 are impacted by $31 million of acquisition-related significant items in the year ago quarter. We remain focused on expense control, while also investing in our key businesses. Our efficiency ratio has trended down, reflecting the successful cost-save initiatives from the FirstMerit acquisition.","Slide 14 illustrates the continued strength of our capital ratios. Tangible common equity ended the quarter at 7.25%, down 17 basis points year-over-year. Common equity Tier 1 ended the quarter at 9.89%, down 5 basis points year-over-year and down 64 basis points linked quarter. CET1 is now back within our operating guideline of 9% to 10%. We expect to stay near the upper end of this range given the length of the current recovery and where we believe we are in the economic cycle.","Slide 15 illustrates our previously articulated capital priorities, which have been confirmed during the current strategic planning process. Our first priority is to fund organic growth of the balance sheet. Our second priority is the cash dividend. As Steve mentioned earlier, we were pleased to be able to increase our cash dividend materially this quarter. This was enabled by the significant improvement in capital generation driven over the past few years and our strong results in the DFAST and CCAR processes. Our final capital priority is everything else, which includes share repurchases and selective M&A.","Our $691 million share repurchase during the third quarter include a $400 million ASR. We use the ASR to effectively offset the dilution incurred during the first quarter from our Series A preferred equity conversion as was contemplated in our CCAR submission. Excluding the onetime nature of this ASR, the total payout ratio this year would look closer to our long-term payout ratio targets versus the elevated 112% year-to-date payout ratio shown on the slide. We previously stated that we have a long-term total payout ratio target of 70% to 80% and a dividend payout ratio target of approximately 45%. We continue to view whole bank M&A as an unattractive use of capital at this time given the highly inflated seller's expectations and where we believe we are in the economic cycle. Earlier this month, we closed on a previously announced acquisition of Hutchinson, Shockey, Erley & Co, a small specialty broker-dealer with expertise in municipal underwriting. This is a small bolt-on acquisition, which is a nice addition to our government banking and capital markets businesses.","Moving to Slide 16. Credit quality remained strong in the quarter. Consistent prudent credit underwriting is one of Huntington's core principles, and our financial results continue to reflect our disciplined approach to risk management and our aggregate moderate-to-low risk appetite. We booked loan loss provision expense of $49 million in the third quarter compared to net charge-offs of $29 million. The loan loss provision expense in the quarter reflected the strong loan growth and continued migration of the acquired FirstMerit portfolio into the originated portfolio. We have now booked provision expense above net charge-offs for 12 of the past 13 quarters, illustrating our high-quality earnings.","Net charge-offs represented an annualized 16 basis points of average loans and leases, which remains below our average through-the-cycle target range of 35 to 55 basis points. Net charge-offs were flat from the prior quarter and down 9 basis points from the year ago quarter. There is additional granularity on charge-offs by portfolio in the analyst package in the slides.","The allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of loans increased 2 basis points linked quarter to 1.04%, while the allowance for credit losses as a percentage of loans also increased 2 basis points linked quarter to 1.17%.","Slide 17 highlights Huntington's strong position to execute on our strategy and provide consistent through-the-cycle shareholder returns. The graph on the top left quadrant represents our continued growth in pretax preprovision net revenue as a result of focused execution of our core strategies. The strong level of capital generation positions us well to support balance sheet growth and return capital to our shareholders at an advantage rate over the long term. The top right chart highlights the well-balanced mix of our loan and deposit portfolios. We are both a consumer and commercial bank and believe that the diversification of this balance sheet will serve us well over the cycle. Our DFAST stress test results in the bottom left highlight our disciplined enterprise risk management. And finally, the bottom right demonstrates Huntington's strong capital position. ","Turning now to Slide 18. This new slide highlights Huntington's continued investment in our customer experience advantage, with a focus on human-led technology-enabled delivery and solutions. We are seeing an ongoing shift towards mobile and digital usage by our customers. 62% of our households are digitally active, and we would expect that figure will continue to increase materially in the years to come. On the top right of the slide, you can see a few of the most recent mobile and digital initiatives. As you can imagine, the current strategic planning process has a significant focus on digital and mobile technology, and we will share more details once the plan is finalized.","We remain focused on extending our customer experience advantage through targeted investment. As previously announced, we are consolidating 70 branches and a handful of corporate facilities in the fourth quarter. The strategic decision to consolidate these offices is the result of our continuous review of our distribution channels and our customers' perceptions, behaviors and needs. The run rate costs -- savings associated with these consolidations will be entirely deployed in the targeted investments in technology, specifically digital, in order to better serve our customers.","Let me now turn it back over to Mark, so we can get to your questions.","Mark Muth","Thanks, Mac. Sherry, we'll now take questions. We ask that as a courtesy to your peers, each person ask only one question and one related follow-up. And then if that person has additional questions, he or she can add themselves back into the queue. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Kenneth Usdin","Mac, wondering if you can just help us flush out the incremental securities loss and then the incremental charges on your previously announced restructuring charges? And maybe even more so than understanding the fourth quarter, help us understand the return on those? And how we should expect that to affect the '19 starting points for both the securities portfolio yield and also just for the cost base?","Howell McCullough","Thanks, Ken. So we're selling about $1.1 billion of investment securities in the fourth quarter, and we will replace those one-for-one. So there won't be an increase in the securities portfolio from this action. Basically, it's a shorter-duration, low-yielding securities. And the payback is pretty quick, under two years, on this transaction. We're going to get a net yield pickup of about 1.2%, which should translate into about $13 million in additional net interest income in 2019. So we do see this as good hygiene and continuing to make sure that we stay efficient with the balance sheet and think about opportunities. On the expense side, so this is basically related to the 70-branch consolidation that will take place in the fourth quarter. And there will be some corporate facilities that we will be closing, consolidating as part of that as well. And we estimate that to be approximately $40 million and it would be the typical expenses that you see in these types of activities. And when you think about the 2018 guidance and the change to the 2018 guidance for both revenue and expense, these items impacted those changes to a very large degree, entirely on the expense side and primarily on the revenue side. So shouldn't think about this really as being a change in core guidance for 2018. This is really about these actions that we're taking in the fourth quarter.","Kenneth Usdin","Got it. And my follow up, Mac, just on that expense point. If I follow you on that and just put in the $40 million on the expense side, it would still seem that underlying that, you're still expecting a decent increase in kind of underlying cost growth third to fourth. Can you just level set us on that versus the $651 million result you just put up, the type of underlying expense growth you're still expecting in 4Q?","Howell McCullough","Yes, Ken, so it is somewhat seasonal. We do have higher expenses in the fourth quarter. I would tell you there's not anything out of the ordinary relative to what we've seen historically in the fourth quarter, just the fact that we do have higher revenue because of seasonal actions taking place in the fourth quarter by our customers and the expenses that come along with that.","Operator","Our next question is from Jon Arfstrom with RBC Capital Markets.","Jon Arfstrom","Question on lending. When you talk about your pipelines and the outlook, this mid-single-digit pace that you guys have put up, maybe even a little bit better, Steve, I'm just curious, longer term, do you see any threats to that? Or do you feel like that's a sustainable pace for the company?","Stephen Steinour","Thanks, John. We are sitting with pipeline that's largely equivalent to where we were this time last year on both the consumer and commercial side. As we look forward, we're bullish on the economy and our footprint. There is certainly a line of macro volatility right now, so that could impact things, but we're optimistic. And getting the NAFTA risk off the table is a big step forward for us in this region. Underlying commercial demand seems to, if anything, be triggered by a constraint on employment, and we have many, many customers throughout all of our regions now suggesting that they could do more if they had more labor. So there's clearly a labor supply impact going on. And then additionally, we've been outplayed a bit and have had a lot of commentary about pipelines now going into 2020. So it would appear to be -- it would appear that business is consistent. And to be at this time of the year with backlogs into 2020 is a bit unusual. So very positive to the year.","Jon Arfstrom","Okay, good. And then, not necessarily an M&A question, but Mac's comment about having less interest in M&A because of where we are on the economic cycle. I'm just curious, where you think we are in the economic cycle? And are you, or maybe Dan, could comment, seeing any kind of stress or irrational behavior?","Howell McCullough","Yes. No, I think that irrational behavior -- I mean, we're definitely seeing people pick their spots in terms of being quite aggressive, but that really is nothing to -- we've seen that for some time. So I think it's pretty much the status quo. In terms of where we are on the cycle, we're several late in the cycle. I think this is the third year that we've said we're late in the cycle. So we continue to plan and look at our portfolio and view new transactions in light of the fact that we have to be prepared at all times for a downturn, whether that happens 18 months from now or 3 years from now. So it really hasn't changed that posture.","Operator","Our next question is from Scott Siefers with Sandler O'Neill and Partners.","Robert Siefers","I was hoping you could sort of rewalk through the margin expectations for the fourth quarter. I know, Mac, after the second quarter, you guys have been thinking somewhere in the neighborhood of 3 to 6 basis points of core margin improvement per quarter in the second half. So -- I know LIBOR was sort of an issue for you and others this quarter, so maybe you got off to a slower start, kind of bottom end of the range. But if you can rewalk through what the expectations for core and reported would be for the fourth quarter and then the main puts and takes as you see them?","Howell McCullough","Yes, Scott. So we believe that we're going to see expansion in the fourth quarter NIM, both for core and reported, 4 to 6 basis points. Part of that is just understanding that we're not going to have the same impacts with LIBOR in the third quarter -- like we did in the third quarter in the fourth quarter. The other part of it is we continue to remain very disciplined on asset pricing and just making sure that we're getting paid appropriately for the risks that we're taking. And we also are anticipating maybe a lower deposit beta in the fourth quarter. So those things coming together along with the recent rate increase, we feel confident that the 4 to 6 basis point expansion for both core and reported in the fourth quarter is very doable.","Robert Siefers","Okay, perfect. And then I just want to make sure -- sorry, this might sound a little vague in here, but I just want to make sure I understand the expense guide. So we're starting off the 2017 reported dollars of expenses and now we're taking, I guess, it's the 2% to 2.5% off of that and then the guidance includes the $40 million of expenses that are sort of unusual. So are we effectively in the middle of that range, implying a fourth quarter expense somewhere of about $670 million when you net out the year-to-date expenses you already incurred?","Howell McCullough","That probably sounds a little bit high. Again, the fourth quarter is seasonally higher from an expense perspective. But that would be the math that you'd want to go through, Scott, in order to be able to do that.","Operator","Our next question is from John Pancari [ph] with Evercore ISI.","Samuel Ross","This is Sam Ross on for John Pancari. Just a quick question on the auto securitizations. I'm just wondering if there's any updated plans for the near term in that regard?","Howell McCullough","At this point in time, we don't have plans for auto securitization. We've -- the increased pricing that we've been able to execute on the auto book has helped us pull volume back and really maintain revenue where we expected it to be, even at a higher origination number with lower rates. So we feel confident in terms of how we're managing the exposure on the balance sheet and don't really see in auto securitization in the future.","Samuel Ross","That's helpful. And then, looking at your tax rate, it seems like the tax rate is coming in lower than you had previously expected. And I'm just wondering if this is a function of some of the moving parts or onetime items that you have seen? Or is this like the normalized run rate we should expect going forward?","Howell McCullough","Yes, what you need to adjust for in the third quarter is $3 million of benefit related to stock-based comp and $3 million related to the true-up of tax reform in 2017. If you adjust for that $6 million, you'll be at 15.5% for the third quarter, and that is the low end of a range that we have been giving you earlier for first, second quarter. So we're still in that 15.5% to 16.5% range, it's just these 2 unusual items this quarter that took us down.","Operator","Our next question is from Steven Alexopoulos with JPMorgan.","Steven Alexopoulos","On the deposit side, if we look at the sharp growth again in time deposits, where would you guys ultimately like to take those balances to?","Howell McCullough","Well, we've -- if you take a look over time, Steve, and we've actually run CD balances, time deposits off pretty significantly over a number of years. This really is the first year that we've started to grow that portfolio again. We don't really have a target for it. The growth has slowed down. Basically, we're not the price leader in the market right now, in the region right now on the CD products, but we're still getting decent growth, I would say, on a monthly basis. We just felt that, that was a smart move for us in the first quarter as we saw the loan growth materializing for the year and wanting to stay core funded without impacting some of the backlogs, say, in money market or savings. So we put the promotion in place in kind of the middle of first quarter, and we've raised probably over $3 billion since then and feel really good about the term and the rates that we paid. So it's not going to be -- become a significant portion of our core deposit funding going forward. It's more situational, just given the rate environment and what's happening right now.","Steven Alexopoulos","Got you. Okay. And then, just a follow-up. If we look at deposit costs up 14 bps quarter-over-quarter and the time deposits were a part of that. How do you think that continues to trend going forward? Is 14 bps a reasonable range? Or does some pressure come off as maybe you slow time deposit growth?","Howell McCullough","Yes, I think some pressure will come off of that, Steve. And I think we are seeing time deposit growth slow down. And we're also being cautious with deposit pricing in the fourth quarter. We're thinking of a big growth at the rates that we're paying today. So I do expect the deposit beta in the fourth quarter to be lower than the year-to-date deposit beta. So that's where we stand.","Operator","Our next question is from Kevin Barker with Piper Jaffray.","Kevin Barker","Concerning your lowering the deposit beta in the fourth quarter. I mean, do you expect the deposit beta to run a little bit lower going to the first half of '19? Or do you think that's going to reaccelerate just given your guidance for 50% cumulative deposit beta?","Howell McCullough","Yes, so we still feel comfortable with that 50% cumulative deposit beta. We're at about 50% year-to-date in 2018. And I would tell you that the fourth quarter is probably somewhat situational in terms of where we are and the deposit flows that we see. I would still think about that 50% longer-term deposit beta as being the right way to model going forward.","Kevin Barker","Okay. And then can you talk about the deposit flows that you're seeing on the consumer side versus the commercial side and the betas you're seeing on commercial versus consumer, especially around noninterest-bearing deposits?","Howell McCullough","Yes. So we haven't disclosed betas consumer versus commercial, but we do continue to see good consumer growth of 5% year-over-year growth and in core, checking accounts balances is really strong. And we've also seen good money market growth as well. So very, very comfortable with what's happening on the consumer side of the business and the growth that we're seeing. And commercial, as you know, is competitive. We evaluate every request that we get for a rate increase, and we look at the depth of the relationship and the strength of the opportunity going forward and deciding if we're -- what we're going to pay out for those deposits. So I think we have a very good process in place that's serving us well, and we're managing that side of the balance sheet appropriately.","Operator","Our next question is from Brock Vandervliet with UBS.","Brocker Vandervliet","Just following up on some of these deposit questions. Borrowings and noncore deposits have been clearly headed the other way. Is the goal to effectively run those out?","Howell McCullough","Well, we do like to minimize both those balances as best we can, and we think about that as being a bit of a feeling around what we might be willing to pay on commercial deposits and thinking about how we manage that side of the balance sheet. We certainly don't have a plan to minimize other types of funding, but to the extent we can raise good core deposits at the right cost, we're going to continue to do that. And we've been actually very successful doing that in 2018. So feel good about where we're positioned and the deposit flows that we're seeing. And wouldn't be surprised if we stay around these levels in terms of overnight funding and those other types of funding sources.","Brocker Vandervliet","And then just stepping back, I mean, the more common pattern across the industry appears to be acceleration in betas, a more violent mix shift into higher cost deposits. And you called that out as occurring more rapidly on the commercial side. But overall your deltas and deposit costs are actually down sequentially. Do you think that's more a factor of your own strategy and tactics or a lack of competitive response or a bit of both?","Howell McCullough","I would say a bit of both. I think the competition in the region has remained very rational. I don't think we see any one, really at any size of organization, doing something that looks unreasonable. So that certainly helps. And I do think that we have a bit of a unique customer base because of the Fair Play strategy and what we've done from a satisfaction and loyalty perspective. We've long-tenured customers on the consumer side, in particular. And I do believe that's certainly going to help us from a pricing and retention perspective going forward. And I think those things really contribute to the fact that we can manage our costs perhaps a little bit better than the average regional bank.","Operator","Our next question is from Erika Najarian with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Unidentified Analyst","This is Brandon [ph] on behalf of Erika. So two quick questions. And the first question, sorry to be the dead horse, I just want to understand the expenses. So if we plug in the $40 million, are you basically saying that the quarter-over-quarter growth in expenses on a core basis should be around 3%. And then if we back out that $40 million, it kind of gets to the negative 2.5% for the year?","Howell McCullough","So think about it on a full year basis. That's the guidance that we've given. And just make sure you adjust for the $40 million in doing the math.","Unidentified Analyst","Understood. And then, separately, I know you guys have previously said that for every 25 basis point increase in rates, you guys should see about $25 million in annual net interest income growth. Is that still intact? Or do you guys see some pressure on the loan side that is compressing spreads?","Howell McCullough","Yes, I would say that has reduced a little bit. It's probably around $20 million now.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our next question is from Terry McEvoy with Stephens.","Terence McEvoy","Just the growth in the RV and marine finance portfolio up $800 million year-over-year. Could you just talk about how much of that is out of footprint? And what you're doing internally to manage the risk within that portfolio?","Howell McCullough","Yes, Terry, so the growth is -- we're now in 34 states. So the growth is going to be dispersed. Early on, obviously, it was majority in footprint, I would say. Now, we've got greater diversification. The important thing is the profile of the customer, which is identical in all of our markets. You'll note that we're at about an 800 FICO score in that business, so very low probability of default. And we do underwrite this business individually. We're looking at liquidity, we're looking at other measurements, they're not auto decisions. Average size of the boats and RVs are modest, tend to be second time buyers of these assets. So very consistent origination metrics regardless of geography, and, frankly, we like the geographic diversification.","Terence McEvoy","And then just as a follow-up, could you maybe discuss reserve building going forward relative to loans? It's been up -- taking up 1 basis point or 2 each quarter. And just going back to your comments on the credit cycle, do you expect that bill to accelerate from here just based on some of those earlier comments?","Howell McCullough","We've said that we expect the reserve to build very gradually over time. I think we've been consistent on that going back many quarters. And I think that obviously the components of that bills have been charge-offs, the growths in the portfolio, which has been fairly strong, the marked amortization, and then we've got portfolio specifics, market dynamics, things like that built in. So I would see a fairly consistent view with a slow built going forward.","Operator","Our next question is from Kevin Reevey with D.A. Davidson.","Kevin Reevey","So could you walk us through the thinking as far as how you decide which branches to consolidate?","Stephen Steinour","Kevin, there's a lot of work that goes into this. It's coordinated amongst multiple teams, but it's keyed off of usage patterns within the branches. And so we have #1 branch share in Ohio and Michigan. So we have a density in many of our markets to work from. And those utilization patterns are looked at with a view of not just physical, but also what's going on, on a digital and ATM usage. So we have a fair amount of our distribution that's fairly close in to other branches, and those patterns help us or guide us in terms of where we see opportunities.","Kevin Reevey","And then earlier in your -- and Steve, earlier in your prepared remark, you talked about the strength and your bullish outlook on your markets, but I'm just curious just how your ag dependent markets are faring?","Stephen Steinour","Well, we're not by any stretch a meaningful ag lender. And while the states of Ohio, Illinois, to some extent Michigan are ag, they're very diversified ag states. They will have some impact from the tariffs. But there is also a fair amount of relief coming to that sector. And the ag sector has had a very robust run for a number of years. Typically, these are individuals or companies that are very, very low leveraged, and so they don't see a significant impact on any of the states we're in, in terms of ag in the near term at this point.","Operator","Our next question is from Peter Winter with Wedbush Securities.","Unidentified Analyst","This is Adele Lee [ph] in for Peter Winter today. I just have a quick question. Could you provide some color around your fee income expectations for the fourth quarter? I mean, given all your continuous tech spend, I would like to see some very exciting things happening there.","Howell McCullough","So I think you're going to see growth in the areas that we've experienced the growth year-to-date. I think capital markets will continue to have a good year and a good fourth quarter. I think, going to continue to see growth in card and payment processing revenue, with the growth in households that we see on the consumer side of the bank, good growth in deposit service charges as well on both consumer and commercial when you think about treasury management and some of the product opportunities we have there. I think weakness will be in mortgage banking as we've seen across the industry and throughout the year. The gain on sale has been lighter this year, and that has impacted that line for the entire year. So in general, I think we're in good shape as we think about some of the lines that are performing well for us. Trust and investment management is another, just with the way the market has been performing so far this year. So I would look at the lines where you've seen growth already this year and think about those lines continuing into the fourth quarter.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Steve Steinour for closing comments.","Stephen Steinour","Again, thank you, all, for joining us. Through the first 3 quarters of 2018, we've consistently produced quality earnings and look to continue the momentum into the end of the year. We're building long-term shareholder value with our top quartile financial performance and strong risk management. We have a track record of disciplined execution and delivering on our goals and commitments as you've seen. So we look forward to providing new long-term financial metrics later this quarter. And then finally, as always, we'd like to include a reminder that there's a high level of alignment between the board, management, our colleagues and our shareholders. The board and our colleagues are collectively the seventh largest shareholder of Huntington, and all of us are appropriately focused on driving sustained, long-term performance. So thanks for your interest in Huntington. We appreciate you joining us today. Have a great day.","Operator","This concludes today's conference.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question and answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference call over to your host, Mark Muth, Director of Investor Relations. Thank you, you may begin.","Mark Muth","Thank you. Welcome. I\u2019m Mark Muth, Director of Investor Relations for Huntington. Copies of the slides we will be reviewing can be found on the IR website, of Huntington\u2019s website huntington.com. This call is being recorded and will be available as a rebroadcast starting about one hour from the close of the call.","Our presenters today are Steve Steinour, Chairman, President and CEO; and Mac McCullough, Chief Financial Officer. Dan Neumeyer, our Chief Credit Officer will also be participating in the Q&A portion of today\u2019s call.","As noted on Slide 2, today\u2019s discussion, including the Q&A period, will contain forward-looking statements. Such statements are based on information and assumptions available at this time and are subject to changes, risks and uncertainties, which may cause actual results to differ materially. We assume no obligation to update such statements. For a complete discussion of risks and uncertainties, please refer to this slide and materials filed with the SEC, including our most recent Forms 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K filings.","Let\u2019s get started by turning to Slide 3 and an overview of the second quarter results. Mac?","Mac McCullough","Thanks Mark, and thanks to everyone for joining the call today. As always, we appreciate your interest and support. We are very pleased with our second quarter financial performance, including record net income and we continue to make solid progress with the FirstMerit integration completing the remaining FirstMerit Systems conversions during the quarter. Steve will provide a more detailed update on the integration later in the call.","During the quarter, we also received the results for the annual Dodd-Frank Act Stress Test and the annual CCAR process. We believe our DFAST credit losses distinguish Huntington among our peers again this year. Our cumulative stress losses and a severely adverse scenario were the fourth lowest, our third consecutive year to be among the four lowest regional banks.","We also received no objection from the Federal Reserve to our proposed capital plans submitted and the CCAR process. The capital plan includes an increase in the cash dividend from $0.08 per share to $0.11 per share beginning with the fourth quarter of 2017 dividend, subject to board approval at that time, and a repurchase of up to 308 million of common stock over the fourth quarter period through June of 2018.","The reinstatement of the buyback is an important milestone for Huntington as we have completely replenished our CET1 capital ratio following the strategic capital deployments in the FirstMerit transaction.","Let\u2019s now turn to Slide 3 and review second quarter results. Please keep in mind that all year-over-year comparisons will benefit from the inclusion of FirstMerit as the acquisition closed during the third quarter of 2016. Huntington recorded earnings per common share of $0.23 for the second quarter of 2017, up 21% over the year ago quarter. This is inclusive of $0.03 per share of significant items related to the FirstMerit acquisition, which also impacted the financial metrics that I will highlight on this slide.","Also including the significant impact of significant items, return on assets was 1.09%, return on common equity was 10.6%, and return on tangible common equity was 14.4%. Tangible book value per share decreased 8% from the year ago quarter to $6.74. Tangible book value per share was up 3% sequentially from the first quarter. Total revenue increased $295 million or 37% year-over-year, which included 47% growth in net interest income and 20% growth in non-interest income.","Non-interest expense increased $171 million or up 33% year-over-year. Non-interest expense adjusted for the year-over-year change in significant items increased 141 million or 28% year-over-year, reflecting the addition of FirstMerit and ongoing investments in technology, including digital, mobile, and cyber and ongoing investments in our colleagues.","Our reported efficiency ratio for the quarter was 62.9%.However net acquisition related expenses added 4.6 percentage points to the efficiency ratio. Adjusting for the significant items, the adjusted efficiency ratio was 58.3%. The reconciliation for this number can be found on Slide 16.","Moving onto the balance sheet, average total loans grew 30% year-over-year, while average core deposit growth fully funded loan growth increasing by 39% year-over-year. Credit quality remained strong with improvement in the quarter. Consistent prudent credit underwriting is one of Huntington\u2019s core principles and our financial results continue to reflect our disciplined risk management.","Net charge-offs were 21 basis points of average loans remaining well below our long-term financial goal of 35 basis points to 55 basis points. This was up from 13 basis points in the year ago quarter, but down slightly from 24 basis points in the first quarter of 2017 consistent with normal seasonality. The NPA ratio decreased by 32 basis points from a year ago benefiting in part from the impact of purchase accounting and the acquired portfolio. We managed the bank with an aggregate moderate to low risk appetite and our results continue to illustrate disciplined focus on risk management.","Finally, our capital ratios continue to increase. As of quarter-end, our CET1 ratio was 9.88%, well within our 9% to 10% operating guideline. While our TCE ratio was 7.41%. As I mentioned previously, our CET1 ratio is now above our pre-FirstMerit level from year ago, while other capital ratios continue to replenish.","Turning to Slide 4, total revenue was up 37% from the year ago quarter, primarily driven by net interest income, which was up 47% reflecting the addition of FirstMerit and disciplined organic growth. The net interest margin was 3.31% for the second quarter, up 25 basis points from a year ago and up 1 basis point on a linked quarter basis. Purchased accounting had a favorable impact of 15 basis points on a net interest margin in the second quarter, compared to 16 basis points in the first quarter.","Non-interest income increased 20% year-over-year. We continue to see good growth in service charges on deposit accounts in card and payment processing revenue. Both of which reflect the FirstMerit acquisition, as well as organic customer acquisition and continue to increase customer debit and credit card activity. Non-interest expense increased 33% year-over-year. Significant items again impacted both 2017 and 2016 second quarter expenses.","For the second quarter of 2017, acquisition related expense totaled $50 million. Adjusted non-interest expense in the first quarter grew 28% from the year ago quarter primarily from the inclusion of FirstMerit. Compared to the first quarter of 2017, adjusted non-interest expense increased 10 million or 2%, driven primarily by the seasonal increase in marketing and the seasonal increase in personnel expense, related to the implementation of annual merit increases and long-term incentive grants in the second quarter. These increases were partially offset by the benefits from the FirstMerit cost takeouts.","For a closer look at the details behind these calculations, please refer to the reconciliations on Page 15 of the presentation slides or in the release. Let me also reiterate, we remain on track to achieve the $255 million of annual expense savings that we communicated when we announced the FirstMerit acquisition. With the successful FirstMerit conversion and branch consolidations, particularly with respect to consumer deposit retention positioned us to re-examine our physical distribution sooner than we would have otherwise expected.","As a result of this review, we recently announced the planned consolidation of 38 branches, plus seven drive-through only locations. All of which are expected to close late in the third quarter. These locations included both the legacy Huntington and legacy FirstMerit branches. ","This could be viewed as a modest upsizing of our cost savings expectations by a couple million dollars per quarter. However, the additional servings are not expected to fall to the bottom line as we have recently accelerated some of our ongoing technology investments, especially digital.","Slide 5 illustrates that we are well on our way to delivering positive operating leverage again in 2017. You're accustomed to hearing us talk about this every quarter stressing how important annual positive operating leverage is to us as a company. In 2016, we enjoyed our fourth consecutive year of positive operating leverage and we remain confident that 2017 will be the fifth consecutive year.","Moving to Slide 6, average earning assets grew 35% from the year ago quarter. This increase was driven primarily by a 56% increase in average securities and a 31% increase in average C&I loans. The increase in average securities reflected the addition of FirstMerit's portfolio, the reinvestment of cash flows, including the proceeds of the auto securitization in the fourth quarter of 2016, and additional investments in liquidity coverage ratio Level 1 qualifying securities.","During the second quarter, average total loans increased about 0.5%, compared to the prior quarter. On a period end basis, total loans increased 1.4% or 5.7% annualized. In light of normal seasonality, coupled with our expectations for a modest increase in economic activity in our footprint over the remainder of the year, we are reiterating our expectations for a period end loan growth of 4% to 6% for the full year of 2017.","The year-over-year increase in average C&I loans, primarily reflected the FirstMerit acquisition, as well as increases in core little market, especially lending verticals, business banking, and auto core plan. During the second quarter, we continue to face headwinds and corporate banking as a number of these large borrowers paid down their bank debt by accessing the debt markets in order of the lock in current low rates.","This quarter also saw an elevated amount of run-off from FirstMerit loans targeted to exit the bank as they did not fit our strategy on risk appetite. These were all loans identified during the due diligence and included both auto floorplan and middle market commercial credits. C&I balances were further impacted by payoffs and paydowns of certain non-performing loans helping to drive a 9% sequential decline in non-performing assets.","We also experienced paydowns and run-offs within the commercial real estate portfolio, which declined 4% sequentially. Average auto loans increased 12% year-over-year with the second quarter representing another strong quarter of consistent disciplined loan production. Originations totaled 1.7 billion, up 6% year-over-year. Average new money yields on our auto originations were 3.58% in the second quarter up from 3.54% in the prior quarter and up almost 50 basis points from the year ago quarter.","Average residential mortgage loans increased 29% year-over-year, as we continue to see strong demand for mortgages across our footprint. As typical, we sold the agency qualified mortgage production in the quarter and retained the jumbo mortgages and specialty mortgage products.","Turning our attention to the chart on the right side of Slide 7, average total deposits increased 38% from the year ago quarter, including a 39% increase in average core deposits. Average demand deposits increased 56% year-over-year. We remain pleased with the trend in funding mix, particularly the increase in low-cost DDA. This reflects the addition of FirstMerit's low-cost deposit base, as well as our continuing focus on checking account relationship acquisition.","We continue to experience only modest core deposit attrition so far from the FirstMerit acquisition limited primarily to certain governments and corporate deposits. Further, we have had tremendous success on the consumer side as consumer deposits from FirstMerit customers and former FirstMerit branches were up 2% between August 2016 and June 2017. Importantly, we remain ahead of our original pro forma model with respect to retention of deposit balances.","Moving to Slide 7, our net interest margin was 331 for the second quarter, up 25 basis points from the year ago quarter. The increase reflected a 34 basis point increase in earning asset yields and a 2 basis point increase in the benefit of non-interest-bearing deposits balance against 11 basis point increase in funding cost.","On a linked quarter basis, the net interest margin increased by 1 basis point, driven by 5 basis point improvement in earning asset yields and a 3 basis point increase in the benefit of non-interest-bearing deposits. Firstly, offset by a 7 basis point increase in funding cost. The increase in funding cost was more heavily weighted to wholesale funding as we remain pleased with our ability to successfully lag deposit pricing so far as our cost of total deposits only increased 3 basis points.","Purchase accounting contributed 15 basis points to the net interest margin in the second quarter, down from 16 basis points in the prior quarter. After adjusting for this impact the core NIM was 3.16%, compared to 3.14% in the first quarter, also adjusted for the impact of purchase accounting and 3.06% in the second quarter of 2016. The linked quarter comparison improves by approximately 1 basis point, if you adjust for day count.","As I just mentioned and calling your attention to the orange line at the bottom of the graph on the left, our cost of total deposits was only 22 basis points for the second quarter. This represents a 6 basis point increase over the year ago quarter and a 3 basis point increase sequentially. Clearly illustrating the strong core deposit base we enjoy and our ability to successfully lag deposit pricing.","We have seen consumer and small-business deposit pricing remain relatively steady in the face of recent Fed interest rate hikes. While the majority of pricing pressure has been limited to Government Banking, Corporate Banking, and the upper end of middle market commercial.","On our earning asset side, our commercial loan yields increased 57 basis points year-over-year and consumer loan yields increased 48 basis points. On a linked quarter basis, commercial loan yields increased 11 basis points, while consumer loan yields increased 4 basis points. Security yields were relatively flat with both the prior and year ago quarters. Approximately $625 million of asset swaps matured in the second quarter and we intend to continue to allow the remaining swaps to run off by the first quarter of 2018 as scheduled. ","Slide 8 shows the expected pretax net impact of first accounting adjustments on an annual forward looking basis. We introduced this slide last fall and believe it is useful in helping you think about purchase accounting accretion going forward. It is important to note that the purchase accounting accretion estimates on this slide are based on current scheduled accretion and accept for what we experienced in the first half of 2017, do not include on the accelerated accretion from the accelerated recapture through early payoffs or extensions in the projected periods.","As we have stated previously, and our results in the past four quarters illustrate, in reality we're likely to experience loan extensions and early payoffs resulting in accelerated accretion. Therefore you are likely to see the accretion revenue in the green bars continue to be pulled forward as modifications and early payoffs occur.","Let me also remind you that some of the accelerated accretion may be offset by provision expense as acquired FirstMerit loans renew and we establish a loan loss reserve in normal course. As a result, we intend to continue to provide regular updates of this schedule going forward and so the majority of that of purchase accounting accretion has been recognized.","Turning to Slide 9, from the very beginning we made it clear that value creation for the FirstMerit acquisition was built upon the significant cost savings inherent in the deal and that our financial positions did not depend on revenue synergies. That said, we believe there is significant revenue enhancement opportunities, some near-term and some longer-term, which will be additive to the baseline economics of the deal.","Slide 9 is an update of a slide you have seen numerous times over the past three quarters, discussing our expectations for achieving the full 255 million of annualized cost savings and illustrating our 609 million adjusted noninterest expense target for the fourth quarter of 2017. As we have stated previously, the 609 million adjusted expense target excludes expense from intangible amortization, the FDIC\u2019s temporary surcharge, and the incremental expense from FirstMerit related revenue enhancement initiatives.","The chart on the upper right details these items and provides our initial estimate of the incremental expense from the revenue initiatives, which is about $12 million. As you can see in the chart, on the bottom of the page, we currently estimate a total of $41 million of the total incremental expense from revenue initiatives this year and $50 million in 2018. As I mentioned during last quarter's conference call, we expect the revenue initiatives to have an incremental efficiency ratio of approximately 50% in 2018, and higher this year as the ramp in revenues will naturally lag some of the up cost expense.","Slide 10 provides additional detail on the FirstMerit related revenue enhancement opportunities. The bar chart on the top of the slide displays our current targets for additional revenue from the initiatives, which are detailed below. In 2017, the revenue ramp corresponds with incremental hiring and the corresponding increase in production. For 2018, we are targeting the 100 million of total revenue enhancements that we have discussed since we announced the deal.","The bottom half of the slide details some of the specific revenue enhancement opportunities we have discussed on prior presentations. First, there is a significant opportunity to deepen our relationships with legacy FirstMerit customers utilizing our optimal customer relationship or OCR strategy, our more robust products and capabilities and our deep commitment to excellent customer service. We are encouraged by the early progress and we'll build on this long-term opportunity through focused execution.","Next, our interest into Chicago and Wisconsin represent attractive opportunities in two areas where we\u2019ve made significant investments and developed strong capabilities. SBA lending and mortgage banking. Our past results illustrate that SBA lending is at a distinctive area of expertise in strength for Huntington. We\u2019re excited to expand our SBA expertise into these new markets, especially Chicago where there are more small businesses in the entire states of Ohio or Michigan.","We\u2019re fully staffed on SBA lenders and these two new markets and we are highly confident in our success based on our initial results. In fact, as of June, Huntington has increased from basically zero presence a year ago to the number four most active SBA 7 A lender in both Illinois and Wisconsin. We also feel there is an opportunity to expand our mortgage banking business in these markets and our overlap markets. ","We have made significant investments in our mortgage banking platform in the past few years and the expansion provides further opportunity to leverage our enhanced capabilities. Again, we have already added new mortgage lenders in these new markets and are especially pleased with the talent and production we are seeing out of the Chicago market.","Finally, we believe there is an opportunity to expand FirstMerit's attractive recreational vehicle and marine finance business. Nick Stanutz, who is the head of our highly successful auto finance business, runs RV and marine finance with the same discipline, risk management protocols, and in some cases technology that he applies to our super prime auto finance business. We have expanded this business from its prior 17 state footprint to 34 states and the early results are already exceeding our business plan.","Slide 11 illustrates the continued progress we\u2019ve made in rebuilding our regulatory capital ratios following the FirstMerit acquisition. Common Equity Tier 1 or CET1 ended the quarter at 9.88%, up 8 basis points year-over-year. We have mentioned previously that our operating guideline for CET1 is the 9% to 10% range. Tangible Common Equity ended the quarter at 7.41%, down 55 basis points year-over-year, but up 13 basis points linked quarter.","Moving to Slide 12, we book provision expense of $25 million in the second quarter, compared to net charge-offs of $36 million. The lower provision expense this quarter reflected the overall improvement in credit quality and reduced purchase accounting market amortization. Net charge-offs represented an annualized 21 basis points of average loans and leases, which remains below our long-term target of 35 basis to 55 basis points.","Net charge-offs were down three basis points from the prior quarter, and up 8 basis points from the year ago quarter. As usual, there is additional granularity on charge-off by portfolio in the analyst package on the slides. In particular, I would point out to you the improvement in auto net charge-offs this quarter. The ACL as a percentage of loans decreased 3 basis points linked quarter to 1.11%, but the NAL coverage ratio increased to 207% as a result of the 9% linked quarter decline in nonaccrual loans.","Overall asset quality metrics remained strong. Non-performing assets decreased $43 million or 9% linked quarter. The NPA ratio is 7 basis points sequentially to 61 basis points. The criticized asset ratio decreased 6 basis points from 3.72% to 3.66%. Our 90-day plus delinquencies remained essentially flat. We also continue to experience lower NPA inflows in the third quarter in a row.","Let me now turn the presentation over to Steve.","Steve Steinour","Thanks Mac, and good morning to all of you. We are on the home stretch of our prepared remarks. So moving to the economies, Slide 14, we illustrate selective key economic indicators for our footprint. We previously noted our regional footprint has outperformed the rest of the nation during the economic recovery over the last several years and I remain bullish on the outlook for the local economies across our eight states.","The bottom left chart illustrates trends in the unemployment rates across our footprint and as you can see unemployment rates across the majority of our footprint continue to trend favorably. The charts on the top and bottom right show coincident and leading economic indicators for the region.","As shown on the top chart five of the eight states in our footprint produced stronger economic growth in the nation as a whole and during three months through May, which is the most recent date available. Further as depicted in the bottom chart, the leading indexes for our footprint as of May showed that 78 states expect positive economic growth over the next six months.","Slide 15 illustrates trends and unemployment rates for our 10 largest deposit markets in many of the large MSAs, the footprint remains at or near 15 year lows for unemployment as of the end of May. The labor markets in our footprint have proven to be strong with several markets such as here in Columbus and in Indianapolis and Grand Rapids, where we see labor shortages. Now we've previously noted that we are seeing wage inflation in our expense base and our customers are too.","Housing markets across the footprint continue to display broad-based home price inflation, while remaining in some of the most affordable markets in the US. There are also exciting pockets of innovation centers developing in our footprint, including here in Columbus, in Pittsburgh, and in Ann Harbor Michigan, for example. In fact there is a recent article in the New York Times discussing some of the innovation centers are related to the auto industry.","I can tell you that the transportation research Centre at Ohio State is world-class and is incredibly significant to the future of mobile, of AV for auto. So the research and development related to these centers adds an exciting element to the economic outlook for our footprint.","And finally we continue to see optimism across our consumer and business customer base. Our loan pipelines have remained steady. We continue to expect that economic activity and thus loan production will modestly improve in the second half of the year.","So let\u2019s turn to Slide 16 for some closing remarks and important messages. We\u2019ve delivered good results in the second quarter, a record quarter of net income. Our financial performance in the first half of the year was solid, and we successfully completed the FirstMerit system systems conversions.","We\u2019re very focused on driving revenue and achieving the financial benefits inherent in the FirstMerit acquisition. We remain focused on delivering consistent through the cycle shareholder returns and the strategy entails reducing short-term volatility and achieving top tier performance over the long-term and maintaining our aggregate moderate to low risk profile throughout.","We were pleased with the DFAST and CCAR results released in June, which provided important industry comparisons and illustrates our strong enterprise risk management and our discipline to operate within our credit risk appetite. The non-objection from the Fed to CCAR capital plan sets us up to significantly increase our cash dividend for the fourth quarter or for the fourth consecutive year and reinstate our buyback program.","The FirstMerit acquisition accelerated our ability to achieve our long-term financial goals and with the integration largely complete, we expect to deliver against the goals this year, as well as next year. We remain on pace to deliver our targeted $255 million of annual cost savings from the acquisition with a only limited number left to be implemented in the third quarter. All remaining cost savings will be completed by the third quarter as originally communicated.","We also continue to execute on the significant revenue enhancement opportunities, including the SBA, and home lending expenses in Chicago and Wisconsin, and the RV and marine lending expansion. This is combined with the OCR opportunity from bringing our superior products and services to our expanded customer base. All of which have been discussed on previous earnings calls and investor conferences.","It is very exciting to build on these initiatives and to see them perform at these levels. We continue to execute on delivering a differentiated customer experience built upon our welcome culture and our relationship focus to drive sustained core deposit and loan growth. ","We\u2019ve invested and as we\u2019ve often indicated we will continue to invest in our businesses, particularly within our customer facing teams and in mobile and digital technologies, as well as data and analytics. Importantly, we plan to continue to appropriately manage our expenses within our revenue outlook. We have shown agility in the past to adjust expenses when conditions or outlook changes and we will do so in the future.","Finally, I would like to include a reminder that there is a high level of alignment between the board, management, our colleagues and our shareholders. The board and our colleagues are collectively the fifth largest shareholder of Huntington. We have holder retirement requirements on certain shares and are appropriately focused on driving sustained long-term performance.","Our outlook for the full year of 2017 is unchanged from what we shared with you at year end and last quarter. We continue to expect total revenue growth in excess of 20% consistent with our long-term financial goal we are targeting annual positive operating leverage. We expect average balance sheet growth also in excess of 20%, and we expect to fully implement all of the $255 million in annualized cost savings from the FirstMerit acquisition by the third quarter. Finally, we expect asset quality metrics to remain near current levels, including net charge-offs remaining below our long-term target of 35 basis point to 55 basis points.","So with that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to you Mark, so we can get to your questions.","Mark Muth","Thanks Steve. Operator, we will now take questions. We ask that as a courtesy to your peers, each person ask only one question and one related follow-up. And if that person has additional questions, he or she can add themselves back into the queue. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Ken Usdin from Jefferies. You may state your question.","Ken Usdin ","Hi thanks, good morning. ","Mac McCullough","Good morning Ken.","Steve Steinour ","Good morning Ken.","Ken Usdin","Mac, just wondering just on the loan growth outlook, I know you talked about the pay downs in commercial and theory, and you know just wondering are you expecting loans to get better as you go through the second half to get to the to 4% to 6% range and are you still contemplating at auto securitization within that 4% to 6% outlook? Thanks.","Mac McCullough","Yes, thanks Ken. Yes, so we do expect the second half of the year to improve from organic growth perspective, and we did have the headwinds that we talked about with the FirstMerit exits, were all - all were anticipated. We actually identified during the due diligence process and I would tell you that there is probably 200 million there that came out in the quarter. We do anticipate an auto securitization yet this year, which is included in the 4% to 6% guidance that we\u2019ve given and we would tell you that the pipelines are where we\u2019ve seen them in terms of the strength and what\u2019s coming through. So, again we do expect to see some improvement as the year progresses.","Steve Steinour","We also had Ken about 2% drop in commercial utilization. So, a fair amount of headwinds in the second quarter with the combination of those factors and we came through that and so the pipeline as we sit here today reflects essentially what we had at the end of the first quarter and we think a lot of the headwinds have been adjusted.","Ken Usdin","Okay. And just a follow-up on another start of the balance sheet, so Mac, your point about the reserve build related to the FirstMerit new loans, this quarter you had not only really low charge-offs, but a reserve release. So can you just try to walk us through what are these components moving on and do we kind of go back to the reserve builds or this one seem to be a zag within that broader commentary of continuing to expect the reserve to build over time? Thanks","Dan Neumeyer","Hi Ken, this is Dan. So this was an unusual quarter for us. So, obviously we did have the credit quality improvements, particularly in C&I, the big reduction in nonaccrual loans of about 9%. The interesting thing was this quarter a number of those loans had large specific reserves tied to them. So, a largest single specific reserve we got paid out of that credit and then we had a couple - two of a next three largest credits where energy deals where we had pay downs of the loans and improvement in the collateral and cash flows negating the needs for a specific results on those.","So that combination was an unusual dynamics. So on a go forward basis, we would expect that natural accrual. We would expect, as we\u2019ve said a slow and gradual move back towards the coverage ratios you would have seen prior to the FirstMerit deal. Think about charge-offs, plus some room for a growing portfolio is how we think about it.","Steve Steinour","Ken, I would point out that we had good performance in auto so across the board the metrics was really was quite strong. It is unusual were literally everything comes positive in the given quarter, and in this - so we have one of those. This is exceptional and not the norm.","Ken Usdin","Understood, good to see the underlying there as well. So, thanks Steve.","Steve Steinour","Absolutely. Thank you.","Mac McCullough","Thanks Ken.","Operator","Our next question is from Steve Moss with FBR Capital Market. You may proceed.","Kyle Peterson","Hi guys, this is actually Kyle Peterson on for Steve today. I was wondering if you could start on margin, specifically kind of the core when you kind of strip out the accretion. Got a couple of bps of expansion in this quarter, I was wondering what you guys were kind of thinking between loan and deposit side benefit from June rate hike?","Mac McCullough","Yes, Kyle, we are going to continue to see expansion in the core margin. We haven't seen all of the benefit in the loans side from the June increase and we continue to manage the cost of deposits really well as you can see with the 3 basis points increase on a linked quarter basis. So, clearly we think that there is expansion in the core margin from here, and adjusting for day basis in the second quarter we\u2019re probably up 3 basis points from the first quarter.","Kyle Peterson","Okay great. And then I guess if you could just expand a little bit on that, kind of on the swaps I know you guys have been pouring back some of that exposure, just kind of potential impacts that could have on NIM with any future rate hikes kind of once those are all rolled off?","Steve Steinour","Yes, so the asset swaps continue to roll off as scheduled and we don't have any plans to replace those. We\u2019re currently about 6.4% asset sensitive and actually without the asset swaps it only has the 10th of a percent to asset sensitivity. So really the asset swaps are pretty much a non-event at this point.","Kyle Peterson","Okay great. Thanks guys.","Steve Steinour","Thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question is from Scott Siefers from Sandler O'Neill & Partners. You may proceed.","Scott Siefers","Good morning guys.","Mac McCullough","Hi, Scott.","Scott Siefers","Hi Mac, quick question. First of all, thank you guys for adding those slides 9 and 10 with the 4Q expense expectation as well as, sort of the walk forward on revenue side, I don\u2019t mean to pin you down too much on the near term expectation Mac, but could you kind of walk us through the expense trajectory for the remainder of the year? Because I guess, what is implied is, you come down a little from this quarters, call it $645 million to the $639 million in the reminder of the year and just there were a few puts and takes, right, I guess you have seasonally upgraded in a couple of areas in the 2Q, but then you also presumably have the branch consolidation benefits, I think, though you said there is some offset on the digital and investment side. So, how should we expect expenses to progress through the remainder of this year?","Mac McCullough","Yes, Scott, so a few things, I mean, we are highly confident in the 609 for the fourth quarter excluding the intangible amortization and the FirstMerit revenue initiatives. The second quarter that we're looking at is seasonally higher, we have merit increases in this quarter, we have the impact of some stock compensation expense that hits this quarter that one-time in nature as it relates to the year, and we also had some seasonally higher marketing this quarter. So, those three things alone are probably $10 million to $15 million, closer to $15 million. So, very confident as we move from this level down to the 609 in the fourth quarter as I described.","Scott Siefers","Okay. All right. I think that actually does it for me. That\u2019s a helpful walk there, I appreciate that.","Mac McCullough","Thanks Scott.","Operator","Okay. Our next question is from Jon Arfstrom from RBC Capital Markets. You may proceed.","Jon Arfstrom","Thanks, good morning guys.","Mac McCullough","Hi Jon.","Jon Arfstrom","I did have a bigger question, but I just wanted to ask on the swaps, Mac. During the details, it looks like the swaps maybe cost you a little bit of money on commercial loan yield this quarter. Am I looking at that correctly?","Mac McCullough","That would be correct.","Jon Arfstrom","Okay. And is it a bit of a headwind again in Q3 and Q4? And then as we see these swaps roll off, it's maybe helpful in 2018 to commercial loan yields?","Mac McCullough","Yes absolutely. It will be a headwind through the first quarter of 2018, really pretty small in the scheme of things and then once they are got we get the full benefit of the rate increase coming through and the adjustable rate C&I levels.","Jon Arfstrom","Okay, okay. Good, that helps. On the incremental reduction in branches, Steve, do you view this as a onetime item? Or is this something that's ongoing? And could we see more of this as things progress?","Steve Steinour","Jon, we\u2019ve been suggesting that we would review the branches like any good retailer, periodically. We tend to do it about every year and the track record would show a fairly consistent period of activity between every year, year and a half for the last 5, 6 years. So, we will continue to operate with that, and again like any good retailer we will be looking at our distribution. We are seeing continued - in particular mobile take-up by our customers both consumers and businesses, it is one of the reasons we\u2019re investing more, if you will, accelerating some of our plans, and so you could expect to see more distribution consolidation from us over time.","Jon Arfstrom","Okay.","Steve Steinour","We remain Jon with number one branch here in Ohio and Michigan. So, you think about that over an extended period of time and as this transition to more and more mobile occurs, I think it gives us a really significant, set of opportunities over time.","Jon Arfstrom","Okay. Does this change your thinking at all on distribution in Chicago, in terms of maybe looking at a more digital expansion of your retail business in Chicago?","Steve Steinour","It doesn't change our strategy because it has all been consistent. We are looking for niche opportunities, principally business focused. We are not going to run the same play in Chicago that we\u2019re doing in Ohio and Michigan in terms of dense distribution. We will, so we do think of Ohio, Chicago as an opportunity to pilot some of what we want to get done with mobile. And we will continue to use it on that basis. The combination of mobile and digital and data and analytics in a market as dense as Ohio is very attractive to us with the current distribution. We\u2019re subscale, I don't think we are highly unlikely to build it out. So, we will be coming at it differently.","Jon Arfstrom","Okay. All right. Thank you.","Mac McCullough","Thanks Jon.","Operator","Our next question is from Kevin Reevey with D.A. Davidson. You may proceed.","Kevin Reevey","Good morning guys.","Steve Steinour","Good morning Kevin.","Kevin Reevey","So it looks like second quarter you had some very strong performance in your capital markets business, what\u2019s the pipeline going forward into the third quarter, do you expect this line of business to continue to remain strong as this is kind of more seasonal than anything else?","Mac McCullough","Kevin we had a really good quarter in the second quarter and a lot of that activity can be tied to either market circumstances volatility or commercial activity, and as we have said we think the commercial activity in the second half of the year is better than the first half or will be and we are also pretty good start in the quarter.","Kevin Reevey","And then my last question is related to deposit price, it sounds like you were able to continue the lag your deposit pricing in the quarter, which had helped you a little bit on the margin, how many rate hikes do you think that will take before you will have to kind of start moving your deposit pricing up?","Mac McCullough","Kevin it is going to be really based on what\u2019s happening in the marketplace. We are seeing a little bit more competition in our markets, but feel very confident in our core deposit base because of the strategy that we\u2019ve put in place in 2010, around building relationships with the quality of the fair play product sets and mindset, and how do we actually serves the customer. ","We think it feels us with an advantage in times like this when we see increases in deposit pricing and we can maybe lag a little bit more than the competition even. We are really pleased with what we have been able to do so far. The deposit betas are very attractive for us at this point in time, but I would think by that time we get at least the second increase from here, we will see a bit more pressure in what\u2019s happening.","Kevin Reevey","Great, thank you.","Mac McCullough","Thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question is from Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous Research. You may proceed.","Geoffrey Elliott","Hi good morning, thank you for taking the question. I wondered if you could speak a little bit more about auto, you had some growth this quarter, what it\u2019s your appetite for growing auto like at the moment and how is the competitive environment shaping up?","Steve Steinour","Geoff we remain highly confident in the quality of what we\u2019re underwriting. We\u2019re very, very disciplined and you see the statistics every quarter. The credit quality performance, there\u2019s been an anxiety around auto for last three years. The credit quality performance and the consistency of it, I think it\u2019s clearly coming through, as it did in this quarter in particular. And so we will we have limits in place in terms of what we believe on balance sheet, we use securitization as an outlet. ","We will continue to do that. As you heard Mac talk about it, it is not a business where we expect to adjust the limits that we have now. We will operate within those guidelines. We ramped it up a bit post Q3 and just believe then that with our discipline on credit that we were getting our better risk return trade-off than what was available in securities. So we continue to believe that as we look at the business today and prepare it to alternative risk returns.","Geoffrey Elliott","And on the competitive side, how things are shaping up there, we have seen some of the other banks pulling back a bit, is that creating opportunities?","Steve Steinour","There is a - this industry cycle is on the finance side, and we think we\u2019re entering one of the more attractive periods. Like 2010, 2011, 2012 were attractive. So there is a bit less competition, as others pull back. Those that bought deep are clearly feeling the challenges from the credit risk they took and so a combination of factors, I think we are making it even more interesting to us prospectively. We are also applying some of our data and analytics to this portfolio. We\u2019ve been managing with some unique tools over the last year and a half. We think we are making better trade-off decisions, and pricing clearly has gone up as we referenced it is up about 50 basis points of Q2 last year to this year.","Geoffrey Elliott","Great, thank you very much.","Steve Steinour","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Kevin Barker with Piper Jaffrey. You may proceed.","Kevin Barker","Good morning.","Steve Steinour","Hi Kevin.","Kevin Barker","In regards to the comment about the swaps earlier, would you expect some of that incremental interest income or at least the interest headwind to start to be released over third and fourth quarter before the swaps actually expire in the first quarter or is it something just where it just happens as a full maturity in the first quarter? ","Mac McCullough","Well it is basically will run off pro rata along with the run off of the swaps themselves.","Steve Steinour","It is very laddered.","Mac McCullough","It is. So it\u2019s very gradual from this point to the first quarter of 2018. It is actually a very small amount in the first quarter of 2018.","Kevin Barker","So at the short end of your current stay is, or that stay is stable, from where it is today and so the first quarter, how much of a tail wind would you expect on interest income?","Steve Steinour","Related to the swaps?","Kevin Barker","Yes.","Mac McCullough","It is a very small number. I think it\u2019s probably 1 million or 2 million. I mean it is not large at all.","Steve Steinour","The specific details will be in the footnotes in the Q, here in a few weeks.","Kevin Barker","Okay. And then in regards to the revenue synergies that you are generating off of the $50 million investment, what specifically have you seen so far in the second quarter start to benefit and start to come through on the income statement?","Steve Steinour","Well we obviously have our mortgage production and pipelines and we are seeing that flow-through very significantly. FirstMerit was not an SBA lender, so for us to be number three in Chicago, four in Chicago depending on what you want to measure, and same with Wisconsin, that\u2019s all a result of the initiatives. We\u2019re starting to break out some of the RV marine portfolio, as well for as you can see the growth in that portfolio, and it\u2019s a portfolio that has performed very well through the cycle for FirstMerit. And we have some experience in terms of the team we put in place, about two years ago now to help us understand and manage that.","So we are able to leverage the skill sets and technology is somewhat in auto and apply it to that book as well. So we see in terms of broadly the OCR activity whether it\u2019s cross sell of products. At the branch level or through phone or other distribution channels we\u2019re able to track that and we see that coming on as well. So, we like what we see occurring now. And there's been a lot of effort to make sure the conversion and integration activities went really well through the first half of this year. So, second half is entirely a focus on driving that revenue further.","Dan Neumeyer","And Kevin on Slide 10 you can see the progression by quarter of the revenue related to the initiatives for 2017, and you can see it for 2018 as well with the expected expenses with those initiatives on Slide 9.","Kevin Barker","Thank you for taking my question.","Mac McCullough","Thank you.","Mark Muth","Operator, next question.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. You may proceed.","Marty Mosby","Thanks. ","Steve Steinour","Hi Marty.","Marty Mosby","Steve I wanted to back up a second because we\u2019ve been talking about a lot of minutia and details and we really haven't talked about the key results from what you\u2019ve been able to do with FirstMerit acquisition, and that is the improvement in return on tangible common equity, it is one thing that we don't have a trend in this massive presentation you give out, but yet looking at how that\u2019s stepping up. And then, you know Mac you just talk about the impact of the seasonality in expenses, which actually held back this particular quarter, so a step-up from what was a 12% return before the acquisition, now is getting to, when you look into the next quarter and take that seasonality out, something north of 15%, and even could be close to 16% next quarter. So, you are seeing that kind of benefit come through and as you are then going to generate synergies going forward, kind of where do you think we kind of push forward on that particular matter because I think that\u2019s the end result of the combination you\u2019ve made here?","Steve Steinour","Well Marty when we announced the deal, we talked about it as accelerating and enhancing our long-term financial goals and one of those is a TCE, return on TCE of 13% to 15% and at the announcement we suggested we saw our way to the upper end of that. And we in fact expect to deliver that and potentially go beyond it depending on was it occurring in the economy and sort of the interest rate environment, but we are very, very focused on those metrics and that\u2019s an important one. May, one of the most important ones for us, and as we have talked before, our board will be reviewing performance against the metrics and coming into next year determining whether they should be adjusted or not. ","We do feel this was a very powerful transformational opportunity for us and we think we are executing it very well. So, that combination should put us in a position over just another couple of quarters where we can show without one-time expense or transaction-related expenses, pretty strong performance. Anything to add Mac.","Mac McCullough","I think it sums it up really well. I mean that\u2019s one of the reasons why we did the deals, it is obviously a great strategic fit, risk appetite was the right, customers we know, great colleagues and improving the return profile. So, we feel like we're right on track in terms of what we expect.","Marty Mosby","And then Mac, just on a follow-up in that kind of vein is, when you look at the purchase accounting accretion, the way that kind of works out, you have been offsetting most of that benefit from building allowance. This particular quarter you had some events that didn't turn out that particular way, but when you are looking at purchase down accounting accretion versus the eventual synergies that you pick up, it\u2019s almost like that will schedule that you put down there and show that versus the intangible kind of write-off, you ought to put the synergies on there too, to show the three elements.","In other words, the other piece of the puzzle is the synergies you are going to build instead of a positive number that\u2019s going to go negative. Over time you actually have the reverse. You have the synergies kind of come in and over swamp this particular diagram. So, again it is a little misleading in a sense it feels like oh my gosh we are accelerating the benefit when in reality you have things offset the PAA as it rolls off.","Mac McCullough","That\u2019s a great observation Marty, and we appreciate you pointing that out.","Marty Mosby","Thanks.","Mac McCullough","Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back over to Steve Steinour for closing remarks.","Steve Steinour","Thank you all. The first half of 2017 produced solid results, and as you can tell we are excited about our prospects to finish the second half of the year strong. The integration of FirstMerit is largely complete and we are now focused on the revenue upside. Our success with the integration accelerates the achievement of our long-term financial goals as we were just talking about, and our strategies are clearly working, our execution goals continues to drive good results, and we expect to continue to gain market share and growth share of wallet.","So finally, I just want to reiterate that our board and management team are all long-term shareholders. Our top priority is realizing revenue synergies from FirstMerit, as well as growing our core business. And at the same time, we will continue to manage risk and volatility and drive solid consistent long-term performance. We remain optimistic about our future performance. So thank you for your interest in Huntington, we appreciate you joining us today. Have a great day.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's conference.

At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the Huntington Bank First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Todd Beekman, you may begin your conference.","Todd Beekman","Thank you, Matthew, and welcome. I'm Todd Beekman, the Director of Investor Relations for Huntington. Copies of the slides that we will be reviewing will be found on our website at www.huntington.com. This call is being recorded and will be available as -- for rebroadcast starting about an hour after the call. Please call the Investor Relations department at (614) 480-5676 for more information on how to access this recording playback if you -- should you have difficulties.","Slide 2. There's several aspects of the basis of today's presentation. I encourage you to read these but let me point out one key disclosure. This presentation contains GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures where we believe it is helpful to understand Huntington's results of operations or financial performance. For the non-GAAP financial measures used, the comparable GAAP financial measure, as well as the reconciliation to the comparable GAAP financial measure, can be found in the slide presentation, its appendix, the earnings press release, the quarterly financial review, the quarterly performance discussion, or the related 8-K filed today, all of which can be found on our website.","Turning to Slide 3. Today's discussion includes a Q&A period that may contain forward-looking statements. Such statements are based on information and assumption available at this time and are subject to change, risk and uncertainty, which may cause actual results to differ materially. We assume no obligation to update such statements. For a complete discussion of risks and uncertainties, refer to the slide and material found with the SEC, including our most recent 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filings.","Now turning to today's presentation. As noted on Slide 4, participating today will be Steve Steinour, Chairman, President and CEO; Don Kimble, our CFO; Dan Neumeyer, Chief Credit Officer; Mary Navarro, Head of Retail and Business Banking Director. Let's get started. Turning to Slide 5. Don?","Donald R. Kimble","Thanks Todd, and welcome, everyone. We're going to mix up the order a little bit today and I'll begin with a review of our first quarter performance highlights, and Dan will provide a review of credit. Mary will continue with an update on our in-store partnership with Giant Eagle. Steve will then provide you with an update of our OCR strategy, review of our Fidelity Bank acquisition and close with a discussion of our expectations for this year.","Turning to Slide 6. We reported net income of $153.3 million or $0.17 per share. That's up 21% from a year ago and also from the fourth quarter. There were 2 significant items that impacted this quarter's results. First was an $11.4 million gain relating to our recently announced FDIC-assisted purchase of Fidelity Bank in Dearborn, Michigan. The other was a $23.5 million addition to our litigation reserves related to previously existing actions taken against us.","Total revenues increased $58.6 million or 9% over the fourth quarter. Our non-interest income growth drove most of this improvement, up $56 million, reflecting the benefit of a $23 million gain from our first quarter auto securitization, the $11.4 million gain from our Fidelity Bank acquisition, and a $22.3 million increase in mortgage banking revenues.","Fully taxable equivalent net interest income increased $2.6 million or 1%. For the quarter, our net interest margin increased by 2 basis points as we continue to lower our deposit and other funding cost. We also had a 5% annualized growth in average earning assets. This growth reflected the benefit of continued strong commercial loan growth, up 17% annualized from the fourth quarter. The auto securitization negatively impacted auto loan growth for the quarter, as we transferred the balances to loans held for sale at the end of last year.","Average total core deposits were stable this quarter with the mix continuing its shift to lower-cost demand deposits. Total demand deposits increased $0.6 billion or 16% annualized. Non-interest expense increased $32.4 million as the quarter included the $23.5 million increase to our litigation reserves. Also, the prior quarter included a $9.7 million gain on the extinguishment of debt related to our TruPS exchange. Adjusted for these items, expenses were essentially flat.","Turning to Slide 7. Our OCR methodology is continuing to drive success throughout the company. On the consumer side, we grew checking account households by an annualized 14.2% this past quarter. This represented an 11.7% growth rate since the first quarter of 2011. More importantly, our cross-sell performance also continued to improve.","At the end of the quarter, 75.1% of our consumer checking account households have over 4 products or services. This compares with 70.5% a year ago, an almost 5 percentage-point improvement. We continue to drive similar success on the commercial side. Annualized growth in commercial relationships was 13.3% this quarter. Our cross-sell measures were also impressive. At the end of the quarter, 32.7% of our commercial relationships used 4 -- over 4 products and services, up from 25.4% a year ago or up over 7 percentage points. These cross-sell metrics continue to reinforce the message that our strategy of acquiring customers and deepening the relationships with those customers through additional sales of financial services is working.","Turning to credit quality. Our metrics continued to improve as well. Non-accrual loans were up 14%. This reduction is after reflecting an $8.7 million addition to our home equity non-accrual loans resulting from the application of the new regulatory standards to our portfolio. Our allowance for credit losses as a percentage of non-accrual loans increased to 206%, which we believe will continue to compare favorably to our peers. Net charge-offs declined 1% on an annualized basis point of -- 85 basis points remained consistent with last quarter.","Our capital position remains strong. Our tangible common equity ratio rose 3 basis points to 8.33%. Our regulatory capital ratio strengthened further with most improving by 10 to 15 basis points from the prior quarter. These ratios reflect the impact of the Fidelity Bank acquisition, which closed on March 30, but they do not reflect any of the capital actions included in our first quarter capital plan.","Turning to Slide 8. Other highlights for the quarter included $400 million purchase of an equipment finance portfolio, which closed in March, allowing us to leverage our equipment finance team expertise. We continue to reposition our branch network, completing a consolidation of 29 of our full service branches in March, providing some efficiency improvements to help fund our investments and strategic initiatives, including our in-store expansion where we added 14 new locations in the first quarter. We also were, again, recognized for outstanding customer service with the APECS 2011 Top Advocacy Award for Customer Service in our region. Huntington had the highest net-advocacy rating for customer service for 3 years in a row.","Slide 9 provides the summary of our quarterly earnings trends. Many of the performance metrics will be discussed later in the presentation.","Turning to Slide 10. We show the summary of -- a summary income statement. We've also adjusted the revenues and expenses for the impact of significant items. On this adjusted basis, revenues were up 8% over the prior year with expenses up 6%. This 2% positive operating leverage is critical for our long-term success and reflects our early-stage results for many of the strategic initiatives we have started over the last several years.","Slide 11 depicts the trends in our net interest income and margin. During the first quarter, our fully taxable equivalent net interest income increased by $2.6 million, reflecting the benefit of a $0.6 billion increase to our average earning assets and a 2 basis-point increase to our net interest margin to 3.40%. The increase in net interest margin reflected the impact of the following: 7 basis-point increase related to the reduction in deposit rates and the improvement in the deposit mix, and this was offset by a 4 basis-point reduction related to the impact of the extended low-rate environment on loan yields.","Slide 12 shows the trends on our loan and lease portfolio. Average total loans and leases decreased $0.4 billion or 1%, which is 4% annualized from the fourth quarter and primarily reflected a $1.1 billion or 19% decline in average automobile loans. Decline from the fourth quarter average balances reflected the December 31 reclassification of a $1.3 billion of auto loans that held for sale.","Originations remained strong in the quarter, with over $950 million of loans booked this past quarter. This decline in average automobile loans was partially offset by a $0.6 billion or 4%, which is 17% annualized growth in average commercial and industrial loans, reflecting increased activity from multiple business lines, including equipment finance, large corporate and dealer services. C&I utilization rates were down slightly from the prior quarter due to an increase in unfunded loan commitments. Very little benefit was recognized from either the Fidelity Bank acquisition or the equipment finance portfolio purchase due to timing in the current quarter.","Continuing onto Slide 13. We've shown continued improvement in our deposit mix over the last 5 quarters as we've increased the non-interest bearing DDA balances from -- to 26% from 18% of total average deposits. The improved deposit mix reflects the success of a fair banking -- Fair Play banking on growing consumer DDA and our treasury management OCR focus on growing commercial demand deposits.","Turning to Slide 14. We show a stable level of total average core deposits. This reflected a $0.6 billion increase in total demand deposits offset by declines in money market deposits of $0.5 billion and core CDs of $0.3 billion. The demand deposit growth reflected strong growth in consumer households, which again increased an annualized 14% pace, and similar growth in our commercial relationships of an annualized 13%. As mentioned last quarter, about $1 billion of our commercial balances reflect temporary deposits, which are expected to decline over the next couple of quarters.","Slide 15 shows the trends in our non-interest income, which increased $56 million or 24% from the prior quarter. The increase reflected the $23.9 million of higher gains on loan sales as the current quarter included $23 million of gain associated with our automobile loan securitization. We expect to have about 2 securitizations a year going forward. This quarter also showed a $22.3 million increase in mortgage banking income driven by a $10 million increase in origination and secondary marketing income, as well as a net improvement of about $12 million in our MSR hedging activity, as the current quarter included a gain of $7.7 million compared with a $4 million MSR loss last quarter. Other income included an $11.4 million gain related to the Fidelity Bank acquisition. This was offset by a $7.2 million decline in mezzanine investment gains.","The next slide summarizes expense trends. Non-interest expense increased $32.4 million or 8%. Again, this included the impact of the $23.5 million increase in our litigation reserves, previously existing actions recorded in the other non-interest expense. In addition, it reflects the prior quarter's benefits of the $9.7 million gain on the early extinguishment of debt related to our trust preferred securities. Other areas to note include a $15.4 million increase in personnel costs, as this quarter reflected a $9 million increase in benefit expense, primarily seasonal payroll tax-related, and a $6 million increase in performance-based incentives. It also reflected an $11.4 million reduction outside data processing and other services. This is primarily due to the prior quarter costs associated with the conversion to a new debit card processor.","Slide 17 reflects the trends in our capital position. These are all as of end-of-period balances and reflect the addition of over $700 million of assets from the Fidelity Bank acquisition. Tangible common equity ratio increased to 8.33%, up from 8.3% the prior quarter. The Tier 1 common risk-based capital ratio increased to 10.15%, up from 10% the previous quarter. We believe this increase is noteworthy during a quarter when we grew risk-weighted assets by nearly $1 billion. With that, let me turn the presentation over to Dan Neumeyer to review the credit trends. Dan?","Daniel J. Neumeyer","Thanks, Don. Slide 18 provides an overview of our credit quality trends. The first quarter continued to show good overall improvement in our credit quality metrics. Net charge-offs fell by $1 million, and net charge-off ratio remained flat at 85 basis points reflecting slightly lower average loans, particularly due to the March automobile securitization. We do expect the positive trend in charge-offs for the balance of the year, although the pace of improvement will likely remain more modest as we move closer to normalized charge-off levels.","Loans, 90-plus days delinquent and accruing were down in the quarter, falling to 15 basis points. This is an improvement from the prior quarter and also an improvement over the prior year. We continue to have no commercial delinquencies in the 90-day plus category. The non-accrual loan ratio fell noticeably to 1.15% from 1.39%. This was the largest quarterly reduction in the non-accrual loan ratio in over a year. The Criticized asset ratio also showed a meaningful reduction in the quarter falling to 5.8% from 6.53%. The allowance for loan loss, loan and lease lost, and the ACL-to-loans ratios fell to 2.24% and 2.37% from 2.48% and 2.60%, respectively, due to the asset quality improvement. However, the ACL to NAL ratio increased from 187% in the prior quarter to 206%, even with the addition of $8.7 million of performing secondly in home equity loans that are sitting behind delinquent first mortgage as we implemented the new regulatory guidance that was issued earlier this quarter.","Slide 19 shows the trends in our non-accrual loans. The charts on the left demonstrate the continued reduction in the level and percentage of our non-accrual loans. The 14% reduction in the first quarter was the largest percentage reduction experienced in the last year. As shown on the charts on the right, during the quarter, we also experienced the lowest level of new inflows that we have seen in several years.","The performance of the commercial book was very strong. We did see a modest increase in consumer non-accruals, due in large part to the addition of $8.7 million of the home equity non-accrual loans due to the new regulatory guidance just mentioned. As we reach a more normalized level of nonperformers, the change between quarters may have some level of variability, although we expect the overall trend to remain positive.","Slide 20 provides a reconciliation of our non-performing asset flows. NPAs fell by 11% in the quarter, compared to a 4% reduction in the prior quarter. Inflows were down 29% from the prior quarter and was the primary driver of the overall decline.","Turning to Slide 21. We provide a similar flow analysis of commercial Criticized loans. Inflow of new Criticized loans was 28% lower in the first quarter compared to the fourth, and was the primary contributor to the 8% reduction in Criticized loans for the quarter. Upgrades to Pass were steady for the quarter, while paydowns were somewhat lower.","Moving to Slide 22. Commercial loan delinquencies were up modestly from the prior quarter, although they remain very well controlled and within expectations for current and future periods. We continue to have no 90-day plus commercial delinquencies, and as a result of our early identification and treatment of problem loans.","Slide 23 outlines consumer loan delinquencies, which were down modestly in the quarter in both the 30- and 90-day categories. This is consistent with typical seasonal patterns. Year-over-year performance was flat in the 30-day category and showed modest declines in the 90-day segment. The black line on the left side of the slide excludes government guaranteed loans and shows an improvement in the 30-plus day category to 1.87% from 2.06% in the prior quarter. Auto and home equity both showed improvement in the quarter, while residential delinquencies were up slightly.","On the right, the 90-day plus delinquencies fell to 32 basis points from 40 basis points in the prior quarter. In the 90-day category, all consumer segments saw improvement in the quarter.","Reviewing Slide 24. The loan loss provision of 34.4 was lower than the prior quarter and was less than charge-offs by $48.6 million. The ratio of ACL to NALs improved to 206%. The ACL to loans declined to 2.37% compared to 2.6% last quarter, although we believe this is to be a very solid ratio, given the continued improvement in the risk profile of the portfolio.","Overall, despite the continued challenges presented by the economic environment, we remain pleased with the direction of credit quality across the portfolio and expect continued improvement throughout 2012. Let me now turn the presentation over to Mary Navarro to provide an update on our in-store channels. Mary?","Mary W. Navarro","Thank you, Dan. Turning to Slide 25. Now that we're 18 months into our partnership with Giant Eagle, we wanted to provide you an update on the progress we've made and the great results we're seeing. We signed a 15-year agreement with Giant Eagle, one of the largest grocers in Ohio. Giant Eagle has significant market share in most of the state. We wanted to have full service branches in grocery stores because convenience is very important to customers, both consumers and small businesses.","As you can see from Slide 25, adding 104 in-store branches significantly improved our branch market share in many markets. In fact, when we complete 2012, we'll have more branches in Ohio than any other bank. Again, making it more convenient for our customers. When the buildout is complete, we'll have almost 500 branches across the state with a population of nearly 12 million.","Turning to Slide 26. The grocery store branch is a very efficient point of distribution. The average Giant Eagle store has 5x to 6x more customer visits per week than a traditional branch. Most customers are usually there more than 2x per week. When you look at Giant Eagle's customer demographics, they're very attractive. The income, network, homeownership and college degree percentages are all higher than our overall customer base and a stand-out when compared with Ohio -- the Ohio average.","Giant Eagle's customer base is a great fit for us, and we're acquiring them at a fast clip. 10% of our new customer households have come from our 40 Giant Eagle branches, which is less than 6% of our total branch count. This is happening because our colleagues are out in the grocery store aisles helping customers find what they need in the store. They're also using an iPad to download coupons to the customers of Giant Eagle's foodperks! account, so that when they check out, they actually get the advantage of those coupons right there that day. They also can be seen occasionally bagging groceries. They're really looked at as the friendly banker. The transactions have also ramped up in these branches and faster than a new -- traditional branch, proving out the fact that customers appreciate the added convenience.","The cost to build an in-store branch is 1\/8 of a traditional branch. Plus, there is less ongoing overhead. We have 3 branches that have been open 18 months, and they're all very close to breaking even and are on track to meet our 24-month goal. As customers continue to use more and different technologies to do their banking, fewer customers will use the branches for transactions. We think the full-service bank branch inside a grocery store will be a convenient alternative for new product purchases like mortgage, investments or insurance. We're doing this very differently than other banks. We have a different type of colleague. They're all universal bankers that do more than just take deposits. We have also full-service branches, and the bankers working there are gold like the colleagues at a traditional bank. The focus is on acquiring new customers and building deep relationships. We're also open more hours, 7 days a week, totaling 75 hours.","We're very excited about the results so far and are thrilled to have Giant Eagle as our in-store partner, not only because they have a great customer base but because we're able to work together to come up with new ways to grow both of our customer bases. Now, let me turn it back to Steve.","Stephen D. Steinour","Thank you, Mary. Turning to Slide 27. As mentioned in Don's opening comments, our Fair Play banking philosophy, coupled with our Optimal Customer Relationship, we call it OCR, it's clearly driving accelerated new customer growth and product penetration. This slide recaps the continued strong upward trend in consumer checking account households. In the first quarter, consumer checking account household growth accelerated 14.2% and has grown by 11.7% from a year ago. Importantly, 75% of total households use over 4 products or services, a significant improvement from 73.5% at the end of last year.","For the first quarter, related revenue was $237 million, up 2.6% from the fourth quarter of 2011. However, it was $12 million lower than a year ago, due mainly to the impact of the Durbin Amendment's mandated reduction of debit card interchange fees. While notably, related revenue was up $8 million since the first quarter of 2010, which is pre-Reg E and pre-Durbin. We continue to analyze potential opportunities to expand the product offering, and most recently began developing our own credit card product, which we plan to roll out in 2013.","Slides 36 and 37 in the appendix provide additional details of consumer quarterly OCR trends. We're seeing similar trends in our commercial relationships as shown on Slide 28. Commercial relationship growth was also strong and also accelerating. After growing just over 8% in 2011, commercial relationships in the first quarter grew at an annualized rate of 13.3% and are up nearly 10% from a year ago.","At the end of fourth quarter, 32.7% of our commercial relationships utilized 4 or more products or services, up from 25.4% a year ago. Related revenue, while experiencing its usual seasonal first quarter decline, increased $12 million or 8% at this time last year, and by over $30 million since the first quarter of 2010.","Slides 38 and 39 in the appendix provide additional details. On Slide 29, as we announced on March 30, we acquired Fidelity Bank in Dearborn, Michigan through an FDIC-assisted transaction. As we've told you for several years, we're looking for acquisition targets. They're between $500 million and $2.5 billion in size in our footprint, which are financially attractive. Fidelity definitely fits these criteria. We acquired approximately $800 million in assets and assumed a similar amount in liabilities.","After performing due diligence on more than half the loan portfolio, we bid $150 million asset discount that eventually led to the $11.4 million bargain purchase gain that Don described earlier. This is a strong franchise with 15 branches that are north and west of Detroit and stretch to Ann Arbor. We have some overlap and plan on consolidating 6 branches out in the combined network.","Importantly, the acquisition is a nice, little tuck-in deal that will add more than 18,000 Fidelity customers to our platform, where we can provide a broader range of products, and some of the highest-rated customer service in the industry. This acquisition, coupled with the recent CapPR result, provides a good opportunity for us to review our longer-term capital priorities. Those priorities coincidentally align with the timeline of the last 2 years.","After ensuring appropriate capital and risk levels, rallying the core business is our top priority. Over the last 2 years, Huntington has invested in people, products and services required to become a top quartile-performing bank. We analyze those investments monthly to our goals, and are nimble enough to be able to quickly reallocate resources. We can clearly see the benefits of those investments to the growth of our customer relationships. Since the first quarter 2010, we've added nearly 200,000 consumer checking households and over 20,000 commercial relationships. Much of the groundwork of those investments is behind us. But there are still some pieces, like the completion of the Giant Eagle in-store buildout, to be completed.","Our next capital priority is dividend. During the middle of last year, the board raised the dividend from $0.01 per share per quarter to $0.04, and we announced the target payout range of 20% to 30% of net income available to common shareholders. We will continue to evaluate the dividend and have a view that the regulators, with their comments on increased scrutiny, have placed a cap on the dividend payout ratios of most banks at around 30%.","As we announced in mid-March, the Federal Reserve had no objection to our proposed capital actions, which included the potential repurchase of up to $182 million of common stock. As a result, the Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program consistent with that capital plan. Like the other aspects of our approach to capital management, we will be disciplined in this activity and see a direct relationship between the price of our stock and the number of shares we may repurchase during any given quarter.","The next capital priority is to use it for other strategic actions and we're defining strategic actions very broadly, and that would include possibly acquisitions, portfolio purchases or remixing our liabilities. Disciplined management of capital to improve long-term shareholder risk-adjusted returns is of paramount importance. Hopefully you all can see the clear progression we've made over the last several years, and know that Huntington's management with their requirements to hold 50% of their net stock awards to retirement is standing right alongside us long-term shareholders.","Turning to Slide 30. Over the course of the last 6 months, investors have been asking about our view that the Midwest is recovering faster than the rest of the country. We believe that there's strong evidence the Midwest is turning from the rust belt, historically, to a recovery belt, with that being led by a growth in manufacturing, education, medical and natural resource investments. According to the March Philadelphia Fed Coincident, in economic activity index, our footprint states are predicted to grow faster than the country as a whole, and the recovery in unemployment is leading the nation in some states.","For example, in February, Ohio's unemployment rate dropped to 7.6%, Pennsylvania to the same number, Indiana to 8.4. Michigan is now back to levels not seen since 2008, at under 9%.","Manufacturing generally is strong or at least returning. For example, auto companies are predicted to increase production over 14 million units in 2012, up from 10 million units just a few years ago. Several major manufacturers have opened or expanded new plants, investing hundreds of millions of dollars in Midwest-based facilities.","The natural resources boom from the Utica and Marcellus Shale covers half the states in our footprint, and the multiplier effect of the E&P exploration and production investment is clearly evident. It's in the commercial real estate and the growth in jobs relating to steel, construction and broader chemical industrial complexes.","With the investments we have been making since 2009, our OCR sales process and focus, we are clearly capitalizing the benefits of this recovery as evidenced by improving credit quality, growth in SBA loans and 8 consecutive quarters with commercial loan growth. Midwest is an exciting place to be and Huntington is right in the middle in capturing the disproportionate benefit from this recovery.","Slide 31 is our last slide and recaps our expectations for 2012. With regard to the economic environment, some of the encouraging signs seen late last year continue to build throughout the quarter. While our footprint states are clearly benefiting from this recovery, the U.S. and global economies continue to experience elevated levels of volatility and uncertainty. This requires that we remain cautious.","With regard to net interest income, we anticipate modest growth. The momentum we are seeing in total loan growth, excluding any future impacts of additional auto securitizations, is expected to continue, as is growth in low cost deposits. Although benefit from this growth is expected to be mostly offset by net interest margin pressure.","C&I loans are expected to show meaningful growth, reflecting the benefits of our strategic initiatives to expand our business and commercial lending expertise through related verticals like health care, asset-based lending and equipment finance. Commercial real estate loans are expected to decline from current levels but at a slowing pace, than that which we have seen over the last several years as we begin to approach a level that is more in line with our overall aggregate, moderate-to-low risk profile and concentration limits.","Residential mortgages and home equity loan growth is expected to remain modest. We continue to expect to see strong automobile loan originations. About one balance sheet growth will be muted due to the expectation of completing the occasional securitizations. Growth in low- and no-cost deposits remains our focus. Growth in overall total deposits, however, is expected to be slightly less than growth in total loans. Fee income is expected to show modest growth from the first quarter level, and we excluded the bargain purchase gain, auto securitization and any net impact from the MSR. This modest growth, we expect, will be driven by increased cost cross-sell success, growth in key activities related to customer growth, as well as increased contribution from our capital markets activities, treasury management and brokerage business.","For the full year, we anticipate positive operating leverage and modest improvement in our expense efficiency ratio. This will likely reflect the benefit of revenue growth as expenses could increase slightly. While we continue -- we'll continue our focus on improving expense efficiencies throughout the company, additional regulatory costs and expenses associated with strategic actions, including the planned opening of over 40 in-store branches, along with the integration of Fidelity Bank, may offset any efficiency improvements.","On the credit front, we expect to see a continued improvement. The level of provision expense, as mentioned earlier, is at the low end of our long-term expectations. And there could be some quarterly volatility, given the uncertainty and uneven nature of the economic recovery. As we have done over for the last 2 years, our focus is on continuing to execute our core strategy, to make selective investments and initiatives to grow long-term profitability. We will remain disciplined in our growth and pricing of loans and deposits. There is still some leverage there. Our Fair Play banking, coupled with OCR, is proving to be absolutely the right strategy and market positioning for us. We will remain focused on improving cross sell. We believe 2012 will be another year of marked progress in positioning Huntington for better, sustained, long-term earnings growth and profitability. Thank you for your interests. Operator, we will now take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Erika Penala with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Leanne Erika Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","My first question relates to 2 loan categories that everybody in the industry has talked about as very competitive, commercial C&I and auto, where your yields were respectively flat to up 7 basis points. Could you give us a little bit more color on how -- the reasons why the yields held in -- held so much this quarter, and relative to your margin guidance, what your expectations are for a future potential pressure?","Donald R. Kimble","Good question, Erika. This is Don. I'll take the first crack and at the end of the comment, additionally on the commercial. But as far as the auto, the reason for the increase in their link quarter really reflects the impact of taking some of the more recent production originations and transferring them into held for sale or at the end of the fourth quarter. And so those were a lower-yielding loan compared to the portfolio in the aggregate. Now that being said, we were very pleased with our production in the current quarters, that originations, as I said, were in excess of $950 million. Spreads were still in that 2 to 2.25 spread and adjusted range that we had targeted before, and they were actually up slightly from the previous quarter. And so we've been pleased with our ability to continue to maintain the appropriate yields on that portfolio and have a good success in originating volumes with those levels. On the commercial loan side, you're right, that the market is very competitive, especially if you look at the upper middle market and large corporate books. We are seeing more pressure downstream as well, that our guidance prospectively says that our margin should be relatively stable, having some slight pressure because of lower interest rates, but it's also given the expectation that we are going to continue to see some pressure on commercial loan yields. Dan, any other thoughts on that?","Daniel J. Neumeyer","No. I mean, I concur with those comments. We are -- obviously, it is -- C&I side is quite competitive. I think everybody's feeling that pressure. I think we've worked hard to maintain those margins. We'll continue to see some pressure going forward, but we're pretty pleased with what we're able to maintain at the present time.","Leanne Erika Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, and the second question, before I move back into the queue. Your guidance on the expense side for modest growth, does that exclude the litigation -- the addition to the litigation reserve that you booked this quarter? And that, are the actual run rate that we should be growing from would be closer to $439 million on a quarterly basis?","Donald R. Kimble","You're absolutely right, Erika, and it would reflect impact of the Fidelity acquisition and other initiatives that we have. That's correct.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Foran from Nomura.","Brian Foran - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","I guess, a follow-up on the auto. The cumulative loss expectations, back in the appendix, are going up. Is there -- I guess, what's driving the higher cumulative loss expectations, fully recognizing that they're still at pretty low levels?","Donald R. Kimble","We would consider those very low levels. I think for the past quarter, they're up a little bit because of the mix of used versus new. And as I mentioned, we were actually seeing a slight increase in the credit adjusted spreads during the past quarter, and that's reflective of a little bit higher loss expectation. But we haven't changed our underwriting standards. Again, very pleased with the overall credit outlook. And so, that's more of an indication of why we're seeing higher loss rate. You'll see a slight tick down in average FICO scores there, too, but not meaningful.","Brian Foran - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","And then just kind of, as we think about overall level of gain on sale that we should kind of expect over time, the $23 million versus the $1.3 billion of securitizations, do you have any historical context? I mean, is that kind of 1.7%, 1.8% gain on sale rate? I recognize in the short term, it will fluctuate based on auto rates and to your swap spreads, but is that a normal level of gain on sale, or are we historically high right now? Or where would you peg it?","Donald R. Kimble","That's a good question. I wish we had a crystal ball to more accurately predict that, but that our third quarter securitization last year was at a 1.5% gain. Now, we're at $50 million a gain on a $1 billion securitization. This quarter was helped because it was a publicly registered transaction as opposed to a private transaction in the third quarter of last year. So we hope that with our continued familiarity in the market as far as our asset quality and the performance for underlying indirect auto loans in those securitizations, we'll be able to maintain appropriate spreads and pricing, but I don't want to put guarantees out there as far as any market condition changes. But that's a reasonable expectation based on what we're seeing right now.","Brian Foran - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","And the last one I had was just competitive environment in Ohio. Some of your competitors, I guess, have highlighted it as particularly bad on the commercial lending side. How would you kind of see the competitive environment in Ohio?","Stephen D. Steinour","I don't know that I would consider it any more competitive than -- we're only in the Midwest, so I think we generally feel like the competitive environment is fairly consistent across that footprint, and I think now, folks are realizing that with the recovery, it's a good place to be. So I would expect that will continue, but I wouldn't say that we feel it's really that much more competitive than what we've been seeing. We feel that we've been seeing that for the last couple of years.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.","Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","A couple of unrelated questions. Just first, to follow up on the comment about rolling out a credit card sometime next year. I guess first, is there a current Huntington-branded credit card that somebody else owns in services that you might be able to take back or purchase?","Stephen D. Steinour","There is a credit card that is branded Huntington. We will not be taking it back, however, Matt.","Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. So I assume your relationship with that provider ends this year, which is why you can get it next year?","Stephen D. Steinour","That's correct.","Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And then just any thoughts on, like the target customer base and how quickly you can grow that and how many you can likely, over time?","Stephen D. Steinour","Well, this is intended to be a customer-focused offering. And we would expect it to at least get to industry norms with that product.","Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And any idea what that means in terms of outstanding, if you had a penetration of, I guess, maybe 20%, 25% which is what some others have?","Stephen D. Steinour","I don't think we've provided any direction on that at this point. It's so far out, Matt.","Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. No, it sounds interesting, though. And then just separately, you've rolled out some of these or a number of the in-store branches. You consolidated some of the traditional branches, which obviously will save you some money. Or is there opportunity as you look out the next couple of years to consolidate more traditional branches?","Stephen D. Steinour","Yes, and it's something we look at and we think about as any good retailer would. How can you become more efficient with your distribution?","Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","All right. Care to share any numbers or not at this point?","Stephen D. Steinour","Not at this point, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","First, just on your near-term strategy in terms of the size of the securities portfolio. We grew a lot in the first quarter. Before that it was declining. I'm just wondering, kind of, what your plans are here. What's driving it? And also, what type of securities have you been adding in terms of duration and also type?","Donald R. Kimble","Craig, this is Don. As far as the securities portfolio, some of that was really related to the timing of the securitization transaction, the build up there, that we would expect our period end balances that we're showing in securities portfolio that migrate more back toward the average position as far as the balances. The duration of our portfolio actually dropped a little bit from the fourth quarter, at end of 3.2 years to the first quarter of 3.1 years. And so, we've been continuing to purchase more of our agency-backed CMOs and other similar structures to what we've had in the past, and so we really haven't changed the mix significantly from the previous quarters.","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then, when you think about credit quality, generally in the indirect auto business, it seems like it's really benefited from really a robust, kind of, used car market. But if trends do reverse, do you think there's any risk? And this is broadly for the industry of any rep and warranty issues in this market?","Donald R. Kimble","As far as rep and warranties, I don't know that I see used similar to what you would have seen in mortgage that as far as our sales for the securitizations, we really don't have the same type of exposure from a put-back risk perspective there. As far as the expected losses that will model out and also the rating agencies model out in connection with the securitization transactions, don't assume that we'll continue to have the benefit of the stronger used car prices. And so the cume losses that you'll see in the back slides do not reflect the current robust used car prices, and show more of a normalized level. So our expectation is that should not have a significant change to our outlook from that perspective.","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And in terms of risk management there, what kind of oversight do you have to make sure dealers aren't filling in the paperworks, saying that, this individual is a teacher or a doctor, and that they're not unemployed. I wondered, kind of, how do you oversee that risk?","Donald R. Kimble","As far as that the risk that we've been in the business for 50 years and we've got very good relationships with our dealers and really take the dealerships that we can have an ongoing trust-based relationship with them. And so, that's really where that confidence starts with, is our client selection and our partnership with those dealerships. Beyond that, we've developed internal score cards that are using historic information that we've been able to accumulate that are helpful for more predictive models. Dan, any other...","Daniel J. Neumeyer","Yes, what I would just say, if there were any kind of trends developing, that would be picked up very quickly because it would start to show up in the credit reports, in the customer scores, et cetera. So not that something like that couldn't ever happen, but I think that our controls would catch it very early on. And obviously, we've not had any experience like that in our long history.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Don, I just wanted to ask you a question about the operating leverage. As you guys are talking about, we'll see it better in the second half of the year, and I'm just wondering if you can help us think about when the jaws really start to occur. And any type of magnitude that you think you're going to be able to deliver, whether it's in terms of a growth gap between percent revenue growth and percent expense growth, or helping us kind of understand at least a point in time at which we really start to see that wedge start to increase?","Donald R. Kimble","Ken, good question. And as far as the operating leverage, we came into this year with all the headwinds we are facing between Durbin and the low interest-rate environment, that if we could have revenues slightly exceed our expense growth given the initiatives that we have in place, that we would have been very pleased. I think the 2% year-over-year -- first quarter-over-first quarter kind of positive operating leverage, is a very good operating leverage for us, and what we hope to see it continuing and showing growth that exceeds the -- a growth in revenues exceed the growth in expenses, and I wouldn't expect it to widen dramatically from there at this point in time.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. I would just think that with your continued comments about starting the season, some of the investments that are starting to show that it would actually -- it would naturally improve and widen over time. What would prevent that from happening? Would it just be continuing to reinvest some of it and just kind of managing to it? Or something else that we wouldn't necessarily be able to just see in the operating environment.","Donald R. Kimble","Well, that we will continue to see benefits from the reinvestments. The challenge, I think, that we'll see as far as continued revenue growth at this pace, is that the first quarter did include the securitization transactions, which we'll have twice a year, and it did include much stronger mortgage revenues, including the MSR gain. And I wouldn't want to assume that we're going to have an $8 million link quarter MSR gain every quarter after quarter. And so, those are some of the things that are more cautionary as far as the expansion of that operating leverage.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay, got it. And my second question is just one -- two small things on credit. Just, you guys mentioned that the provision has kind of gone down to the low end of your range, but obviously we see continued improvement in most of the metrics. I wanted to ask you about two in specific, and we did see a bit of a C&I bump-up, and I know the commentary was that it was made up of smaller credits. I was wondering if you could kind of comment on whether we're seeing some type of seasoning in C&I? And then secondly, the residential mortgage MPs have gone up for several quarters in a row, and I know you've talked about values and such, but any color in terms of -- should that start to improve, given that what we've seen in the unemployment side?","Stephen D. Steinour","Yes, so I guess taking the -- your comment on commercial first. On Page 88, if you look at what the charge-off trends have been over the last year, commercial as a category, actually has been on a -- kind of a nice, steady downward projection. C&I, just last quarter, was up but it was at abnormally low levels the past quarter. So we are going to see some variability from quarter-to-quarter just based on the specific mix of credit. So I don't see any trends there, I think the overall trend will continue to be positive. On residential, that's obviously a continued area of stress, but yes, it goes along with unemployment and home prices. And so we hope to see some stabilization there with the improvement, but that's been one of the stubborn areas that we're working on.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then, Steve, just one for you on M&A. I know you talked about broad thoughts about size but obviously, you guys just did an FDIC deal. Can you just talk to us about what you guys would be considering or looking at from a broad perspective of what may be less in FDIC land versus regular weight deals, and what's happening as far as the conversation levels about potential sellers out there in the marketplace?","Donald R. Kimble","Well, the FDIC -- the level of FDIC activity, frankly, has been a lot lower than we would have estimated. And it makes, via through the cycle, substantially lower numbers than many would have thought. So I don't think they're at the absolute end of the line in terms of resolutions, but it's not clear that there's any significant additional level of activity in our footprint, and we're only interested in our footprint. There is some level of conversation occurring in a more traditional sense. And it's a little more active at the moment than it might have been the last couple of years, but there is still a wide gulf in terms of value. And I don't think activity necessarily picks up in 2012.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley.","Ken A. Zerbe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So you're obviously seeing very, very good growth in C&I, given the resurgence in the Midwest. I guess, my question though, is when the broader economy does start to pick up, is it fair to assume that the Midwest could benefit even more than it is now? Or is the growth right now as good as it potentially could get given a broader economic recovery?","Stephen D. Steinour","We are more bullish on the Midwest, and for a number of reasons. It's -- this energy play between the Marcellus and Utica is going to provide local manufacturers with very, very long-term stable supplies of probably low-cost energy, certainly on a relative basis. And so, we're of a belief that, that's going to continue to expand the manufacturing sector in the footprint. There's a tremendous amount -- additionally, there's just a tremendous amount of investment that's going on in a variety of related areas, education and medical. And it seems to us that there's much more coordinated economic development activity also occurring now of a strategic nature in Michigan, in Ohio and possibly some of the other states we're in, which should be very good for us long-term, as well. So we're bullish on the economic expansion continuing and not just being in a defined early phase.","Ken A. Zerbe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then the other question I had, in terms of asset yields, I guess, if you look out over the next year or so, are there any quarters where there is any kind of cliff drop in terms of asset yields or loans that reprice and more so than other quarters?","Donald R. Kimble","No, I wouldn't say that there's any cliff quarters. But there are quarters where there's a little higher propensity as far as repayments and renewals, but I wouldn't consider anything cliff or out of the ordinary.","Ken A. Zerbe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And have you matched up the liability sides against those quarters that could see greater repricing?","Donald R. Kimble","That's part of our challenge is managing that asset liability position, and we try to match that up the best we can. Right now, we're slightly asset-sensitive. So if you could do something for us to help get those short-term rates up, that we will be helpful for us. But I think we're pretty well setup.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin St. Pierre with Sanford Bernstein.","Kevin J. St. Pierre - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","On the litigation reserve, could you just give us a little bit more color and perhaps why we should consider that nonrecurring? What drove the increased litigation reserve?","Donald R. Kimble","I don't know that we can provide a whole lot more commentary there, that we did have developments during the quarter on some previously existing cases and that resulted in us taking a fresh look at the reserves that we had established and resulted in a $23.5 million increase. We do review those reserves at least quarterly. As I said, that there were a few developments this quarter that resulted in us wanting to increase this. And again, as far as the issues in sales, they are several years old, and they're not new cases and not new developments that hadn't previously been assessed.","Kevin J. St. Pierre - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. And then separately, with a 30-ish percent payout ratio and the announced or proposed share repurchase plan, it would seem as if Tier 1 common, which ticked up 15 basis points this quarter, is probably going to continue to build over the foreseeable future. Can you anticipate a time, or can you think about when and if you might start managing that down and how you would do so?","Donald R. Kimble","Great question. That I think as far as the outlook that we would agree with our announced capital plans, absent any unusual or extraordinary type of events, that we would see our capital ratios flat to up. And as far as managing that down, we'll continue to review that, at least annually, with the regulators as far as our capital plan. We did, between the Fidelity Bank acquisition and the municipal loan purchase, acquire over $1 billion of assets this past quarter. And so, to the extent that there are opportunities for us to continue to evaluate other potential purchases, now that could be one tool that could be useful to help manage that position.","Operator","And your final question comes from the line of Jon Arfstrom with RBC Capital Markets.","Jon G. Arfstrom - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just a question on the demographics that you laid out for your in-store customer. It looks like it's a little different kind of customer. And you typically see fee income as a driver rather than credit, but it looks like this is a little bit different. Curious at what you're seeing so far in terms of credit growth out of the in-store branches.","Mary W. Navarro","Well, they're still service branches, so we are doing consumer loans out of those locations. And they're pretty new, so we have -- we've hired all new colleagues, so they're learning a lot of this as we go here, but if you look at our more seasoned locations, they do have pretty solid loan balances on the book. So I wouldn't say that they are more credit-focused versus deposit-focused. We're in a pretty low deposit rate environment right now, so we are seeing -- the biggest thing here, is we're seeing a lot more checking account household growth than what we had anticipated when we started those. So that's proving out to be profitable, as well.","Jon G. Arfstrom - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","That's helpful. Just a quick question on the buybacks, Steve. I don't necessarily want to pin you down on it, but what makes sense in terms of buyback? You said it's stock price-driven. Curious if you view the stock price as attractive here, or are there some other limits that you're taking into account?","Stephen D. Steinour","Well, the board has -- had a lot of time to have robust discussions. There are a number of elements, including market conditions and outlook, but nothing that we're prepared to be more specific with at this time, though.","Todd Beekman","Thank you very much for joining the call. If you have got any other follow-up questions, please feel free to reach out to me, (614) 480-3878. Thank you very much. Have a good day.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call.

[Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host Mark Muth, Director of Investor Relations.","Mark Muth","Thank you, Melissa, and welcome. I'm Mark Muth, Director of Investor Relations for Huntington. Copies of the slides we will be reviewing can be found on our IR website at www.huntington-ir.com or by following the Investor Relations link on www.huntington.com. This call is being recorded and will be available as a rebroadcast starting about one hour from the close of the call.","Our presenters today are Steve Steinour, Chairman, President and CEO, and Mac McCullough, Chief Financial Officer. Dan Neumeyer, our Chief Credit Officer, will also be participating in the Q&A portion of the call.","As noted on slide 2, today's discussion, including the Q&A period, will contain forward-looking statements. Such statements are based on the information and assumptions available at this time, and are subject to changes, risks and uncertainties which may cause actual results to differ materially.","We assume no obligation to update such statements. For a complete discussion of risks and uncertainties, please refer to this slide and material filed with the SEC, including our most recent forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filings.","Let's get started by turning to slide 3 and an overview of the financials for 2016. Mac?","Mac McCullough","Thanks, Mark, and thanks to everyone joining the call today. As always, we appreciate your interest and support. 2016 was a transformational year for Huntington. As you know, we closed the acquisition of FirstMerit in the third quarter, and much of our efforts since close has been focused on ensuring a smooth and seamless integration. We are extremely pleased with the progress we're making in bringing the two companies together as one.","As evidenced by fourth-quarter results, we're already seeing significant benefit in our efficiency ratio and return on tangible common equity. And we are looking forward to introducing the distinctive Huntington brand to the Chicago and Wisconsin markets later this quarter, helping to accelerate our long-term growth rate. All of our colleagues are engaged and excited by the opportunities in front of us in 2017 and longer term.","Before we move to the detailed financials, I want to provide a few quick comments on the integration. As Steve will discuss later in the call, we are ahead of schedule, as we completed a number of significant milestones in the fourth quarter. Our new colleagues are embracing our fair play philosophy and welcome culture, and they are excited to have access to Huntington's more robust product set and capabilities.","We're very pleased with our progress thus far, but we know the work is not yet finished. We are focusing on achieving flawless execution with the conversion, resulting in minimal disruption for our customers and the acceleration of our long-term financial goals.","With that in mind, let's move to slide 3 and discuss the full-year 2016 financials. As I mentioned, 2016 was a transformational year for Huntington, and there were acquisition-related significant items which affected bottom-line results.","I want to emphasize that legacy Huntington performance, including our net interest margin, operating leverage and balance sheet growth, continued to meet if not exceed our expectations in 2016. We delivered core revenue growth well within the range of our long-term goal, positive operating leverage for the fourth consecutive year and a NIM greater than 3% for each quarter of 2016.","As I walk through our results for full year 2016 and the fourth quarter of 2016, please note that comparisons to previous periods are inclusive of FirstMerit. Huntington recorded earnings per common share of $0.67 for full-year 2016. This is inclusive of $0.20 per share of significant items related to the FirstMerit acquisition, which also impacted the financial metrics that I will highlight on this slide.","Tangible book value per share decreased 7% from the year-ago quarter to $6.41. Return on tangible common equity was 10.2%, while return on assets was 0.82%. Full-year revenue increased 18%, which included 11% growth in non-interest income. Full-year non-interest expense grew 24%, although after adjusting for FirstMerit's acquisition expense, full-year non-interest expense growth was 13%.","Average total loans grew 18% for the full year, while average core deposit growth fully funded loan growth also increasing by 18% year over year. Credit quality remained strong in 2016. Consistent prudent credit underwriting as one of Huntington's core principles, and 2016's financial results continue to reflect that.","Net charge-offs were 19 basis points of loans, relatively flat from 2015, while remaining well below our long-term financial goal of 35 to 55 basis points. The NPA ratio decreased 7 basis points from year end 2015. We managed the bank with an aggregate moderate- to low-risk appetite, and our results illustrate this disciplined focus.","Finally, our capital ratios declined midyear, as we effectively deployed capital via the acquisition of FirstMerit. Assisted by the balance sheet optimization strategy that we detailed on the third quarter earnings call and that was completed in the fourth quarter, we have strengthened our capital ratios since acquisition close. And as of yearend 2016, our CET1 ratio was 9.53%, well within our 9% to 10% operating guideline.","Moving to slide 4, let's take a look at some of the financial metrics for the fourth quarter of 2016 compared with the year-ago quarter. Fourth-quarter earnings per share was $0.18, inclusive of $0.06 per share of significant items related to the FirstMerit acquisition. Also including the impact of significant items, ROA was 0.84% and return on tangible common equity was 11.4%.","Compared to the fourth quarter of 2015, revenue grew by 39%, with net interest income up 48% and non-interest income up 23%. Non-interest expense increased 45% from the year-ago quarter. Although adjusted for significant items, non-interest expense growth was 29%.","Our reported efficiency ratio for the quarter was 65.4%. However, FirstMerit related acquisition expense added 8.8 percentage points to the efficiency ratio in the quarter. The reconciliation for this number can be found on slide 18.","The efficiency ratio also benefited from $7.5 million of net hedging activity on mortgage servicing rights, a $5.6 million gain on our November auto loan securitization. $5 million of gains on the sale of loans resulting from our balance sheet optimization strategy, and a $6.5 million benefit from the extinguishment of trust preferred securities, as well as the impact of normal fourth-quarter seasonality.","Moving on to the balance sheet, average total loans for the fourth quarter grew 33% year over year. Average core deposits grew 40% year over year, once again, fully funding loan growth. Fourth-quarter net charge-offs were 26 basis points, up 8 basis points from a year ago. Again, this remains below our long-term financial goal, and is consistent with our outlook of gradual reversion to our long-term range of 35 to 55 basis points.","Turning to slide 5, let's take a closer look at the income statement. Fourth-quarter revenue was up 39% from the year-ago quarter. Primarily driven by net interest income, which was up 48%, reflecting the addition of FirstMerit and disciplined organic loan growth.","The net interest margin was 3.25% for the fourth quarter, up 16 basis points from a year ago and up 7 basis points on a linked-quarter basis. Purchase accounting had a favorable impact of 18 basis points on the net interest margin in the fourth quarter.","For the fourth quarter, net interest income increased 23% year over year. Non-interest expense increased 45%, but adjusted for significant items, non-interest expense in the fourth quarter grew 29% from the year-ago quarter. For a closer look at the details behind these calculations, please refer to the reconciliations contained on pages 16 and 17 of the presentation slides or in the release.","While we're on the subject of expenses, I want to reiterate our confidence in achieving the $255 million in total annual expense savings that we communicated when we announced the FirstMerit acquisition. All the cost savings have been identified, and we have already realized roughly 50% of our cost savings goal. We expect to realize the majority of the remainder of the cost savings during the branch and systems conversion over Presidents' Day weekend next month.","In total, we plan to consolidate 103 branches at conversion or roughly 9% of the combined post divestiture branch network. Recall that there is a significant amount of overlap in the two branch networks, as 39% of legacy FirstMerit branches are within one mile of Huntington branches. In addition, in connection with our normal periodic review of our distribution network, we will be consolidating nine legacy Huntington branches unrelated to the FirstMerit acquisition during the first quarter.","Slide 6 shows the expected pretax net impact of purchase accounting adjustments on an annual forward-looking basis. We introduced this slide at a recent conference, and we think it will be useful in helping you think about purchase accounting accretion going forward.","It is important to note that the purchase accounting accretion estimates on this slide are based on current scheduled accretion, and do not include any projected accelerated accretion from early payoffs or renewals. Therefore since in reality we're likely to experience some level of early payoffs and accelerated accretion, just as we already did in 3Q of 2016 and 4Q of 2016, you are likely to see the accretion revenue in the green bars pulled forward as early payoffs occur.","Some of the accelerated accretion may be offset by provision expense, as acquired FirstMerit loans renew and we establish a loan-loss reserve in normal course. As a result, we intend to provide regular updates of this schedule going forward until the majority of the purchase accounting accretion has been recognized.","Slide 7 illustrates the achievement of positive operating leverage for full-year 2016. Of course we talk about this every quarter, and stress how important annual positive operating leverage is to us as a company. In 2016, we enjoyed our fourth consecutive year of positive operating leverage, realizing adjusted revenue growth of 17.8% which outpaced adjusted expense growth of 13.1%.","As you know, annual positive operating leverage is one of our long-term financial goals. We contained our target positive operating leverage on an annual basis, and we have budgeted to meet this goal for the fifth consecutive year in 2017.","Turning to slide 8, let's look at balance sheet trends. As you look at the left of the slide, you can see that the addition of FirstMerit has not had a material impact on our earning asset mix. Recall the last quarter, we announced certain actions to optimize the balance sheet in order to improve capital efficiency and flexibility.","With that in mind, during the fourth quarter, we completed a $1.5 billion auto securitization and invested the proceeds into 0% risk-weighted securities. We also repositioned approximately $2 billion of higher risk-weighted securities into 0% risk-weighted securities.","Finally, we sold almost $1 billion of non-relationship C&I and CRE loans. Completing all announced actions during the fourth quarter, added approximately 41 basis points to CET1 at year end, positioning us well for the 2017 CCAR cycle.","Turning back to fourth-quarter performance, average earning assets grew 41% from the year-ago quarter. This increase was driven primarily by a 54% increase in average securities, and a 37% increase in average C&I loans.","The increase in average securities reflected the addition of FirstMerit's portfolio, the reinvestment of cash flows and additional investments in liquidity coverage ratio level one qualifying securities. The increase in C&I loans primarily reflected FirstMerit as well as increases in the automobile core plan and corporate banking loans.","Average auto loans increased 17% year over year, with the acquired $1.5 billion FirstMerit portfolio essentially offsetting the impact of the $1.5 billion securitization. Average new money yields on our auto originations were 3.25% in the fourth quarter, up 5 basis points from the prior quarter and up almost 35 basis points from the year-ago quarter.","Turning to the right side of slide 8, I want to call attention to the trend in funding mix, particularly the increase on low-cost DDA. Average total deposits increased 39% from the year-ago quarter, including a 40% increase in average core deposits. This reflects the addition of FirstMerit's low-cost deposit base. It has been almost two full quarters since the acquisition closed, and we are extremely pleased with customer and deposit retention.","Our net interest margin was 3.25% for the fourth quarter, up 16 basis points from the year-ago quarter. The increase reflected a 23 basis point increase in earning asset yields, balanced against the 7 basis point increase in funding costs. On a linked-quarter basis, the net interest margin increased by 7 basis points, driven by an 8 basis point improvement in earning asset yields.","Purchase accounting contributed 18 basis points to the net interest margin in the fourth quarter. After adjusting for this impact, the core NIM was 3.07, up 1 basis point from the third quarter of 2016. Also adjusted for the impact of purchase accounting.","In addition, similar to what we have seen in recent quarters, the fourth quarter NIM includes 1 basis point favorable impact related to one large interest recovery. Recall our core NIM included two basis points of favorable impact last quarter.","Slide 10 illustrates the progress we have made in rebuilding our regulatory capital ratios following the FirstMerit acquisition. CET1 [indiscernible] the quarter at 9.53%, down 26 basis points year over year and up 44 basis points from the previous quarter.","We mentioned previously that our operating guideline for CET1 is 9% to 10%. We are very pleased to have reached the mid-point level only one quarter following the close of the FirstMerit acquisition. Tangible common equity ended the quarter at 7.14%, down 68 basis points year over year and flat linked quarter.","Moving to slide 11, for the fourth quarter, we booked provision expense of $75 million compared to net charge-offs of $44 million. The higher provision expense was due to several factors, including the migration of FirstMerit loans from the acquired portfolio to the originated portfolio, portfolio growth and transitioning the FirstMerit portfolio to Huntington's reserving methodology.","Net charge-offs represented an annualized 26 basis points of average loans and leases consistent with the prior quarter, which remains below our long-term target of 35 to 55 basis points. The ACL as a percentage of loans increased to 1.10% from 1.06% at the end of the third quarter, while the non-accrual loan coverage ratio remained stable at 174%.","Asset-quality metrics were largely favorable in the quarter. The NPA ratio remained flat at 72 basis points. The criticized asset ratio increased modestly from 3.54% to 3.62%, driven largely by risk rating calibration within the FirstMerit book which increased our OLEM loans in the quarter. Importantly, substandard loans, the most severe category of problem loans, actually decreased in the quarter due to pay downs and refinancings.","Also of note, 58% of our non-performing commercial loans remain current. Other indicators of credit quality include very low 90-day delinquencies at 19 basis points, and lower NPA inflows in the quarter.","I will now turn the presentation over to Steve.","Steve Steinour","Thanks, Mac. Moving to the economy, slide 13 contains what we believe to be some of the more meaningful economic indicators for our footprint. A footprint that has outperformed the rest of the nation during the economic recovery.","The bottom left chart illustrates trends in the unemployment rates across our eight core Midwestern states. And as you can see, despite a leveling off of economic growth during recent periods, the majority of our footprint remains at or below the national unemployment rates relative to the national average.","The charts on the top and bottom right show coincident and leading economic indicators for the region. I want to call particular pretension to the bottom chart which shows leading indexes for our footprint as of November. This is the chart we look to for insights into expected future growth within our footprint, and as you can see the chart shows that all eight states in our footprint expect positive economic growth over the next six months.","Turning to slide 14, it also focuses on trends in unemployment rates, but specifically for our largest Metropolitan markets. In many of the large MSAs, the footprint remained at or near 15-year lows for unemployment as of the end of November.","The auto industry remains a major economic contributor within our footprint, housing markets are strong as well. Home price stability and affordability are some of the best in the nation right here in our footprint, and we continue to see broad-based home price growth in all of our footprint states.","The labor market in our footprint has proven to be strong in 2016, with several markets such as here in Columbus where we are at structural fullest employment. We are seeing wage inflation in our expense base, and our customers are too.","State and local governments continue to operate with surpluses. The election is behind us and many of the businesses in our footprint have expressed optimism about a new business-friendly environment expected from the new administration and regulatory regime.","Overall, the underlying trends and fundamentals remain strong. We are confident in our footprint Midwest economy, based on the sustained job growth and economic production. So with that, let's turn to slide 15 for some closing remarks and important messages. We remain focused on delivering consistent through the cycle shareholder returns. This strategy entails reducing short-term volatility, achieving top-tier performance over the long term and maintaining our aggregate moderate to low-risk profile throughout.","And as you heard Mac mention earlier, the acquisition and integration of FirstMerit provides an opportunity to achieve significant cost savings and improve our overall efficiency. We are progressing as planned toward realizing our targeted $255 million of annual cost savings from the acquisition, with a significant portion of the planned savings, roughly half of them, already implemented. The majority of the remaining savings will be implemented during the branch conversion this quarter over the Presidents' Day weekend.","We continue to win new customers through a strong distinguished brand with differentiated products and superior customer service across all of our businesses. Our new customers provide a deeper pool to deliver our value proposition and to fuel our growth.","We are now five months past the close of the FirstMerit acquisition, and we have seen little attrition from the FirstMerit accounts. This is a testament to our emphasis on customer service, and the progress of our combined teams coming together. We have maintained momentum in our core businesses throughout the integration. We have invested and will continue to invest in our businesses, particularly within our customer facing teams and in mobile and digital technologies as well as data analytics. Importantly, we continue to manage our expenses appropriately within our revenue outlook.","We always like to include a reminder that there's a high level of alignment between the Board, Management, our employees and our shareholders. The Board and our colleagues are collectively amongst the largest shareholders of Huntington.","We have holder retirement requirements on certain shares, and are appropriately focused on driving sustained long-term performance. We're highly focused on our commitment to being good stewards of shareholder's capital.","Looking towards 2017, we expect total revenue growth in excess of 20%. This includes an expected benefit from one rate hike around midyear of this year. We continue to target positive operating leverage on an annual basis. We will grow the average balance sheet in excess of 20%. We expect to fully implement all the cost savings from the FirstMerit acquisition by the third quarter of 2017. We believe asset quality metrics will remain near current levels, including net charge-offs remaining below our long-term target of 35 to 55 basis points.","Finally, we continue to be extremely pleased with the integration with FirstMerit and with the outstanding colleagues we have dedicated to a seamless conversion. The divestiture of 13 branches, primarily in the Canton, Ohio market, was completed during the fourth quarter of 2016, and we have completed the onboarding and initial training of our new colleagues and fully implemented the organizational changes for the combined entity that we announced last summer. 103 branch consolidations will occur coincident with the branch conversion in February, and our system conversion efforts continue to progress well.","As you can see, it was an exciting quarter and indeed an exciting year. We are very focused on the future we're building. We have a lot of momentum across our businesses, and we're ready to build on the hard work that got us to this point.","So I'll now turn it back over to Mark so we can get to your questions. Thank you.","Mark Muth","We will now take questions. We ask that as a courtesy to your peers, each person ask only one question and one related follow-up and then if that person has additional questions he or she can add themselves back into the queue. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Jon Arfstrom with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Jon Arfstrom","Sounds like things are going well on the integration from the expense side, and what I was curious about was the revenue synergy piece. I know that you did not include that in the accretion guidance initially from the acquisition, but in your important messages, you are saying you were executing on the revenue synergies. So maybe give us an idea or an update in terms of how that's going so far?","Mac McCullough","So, Jon, it's actually going very well. We are continuing to make investments into a number of areas, including SBA lending, home equity and home mortgage origination. And the other fact is that we are seeing really good acceptance and interest in capital markets products with the FirstMerit customer base, interest rates, revenues, foreign exchange, those types of things. So really good traction there as well.","And then as we take FirstMerit's [indiscernible] portfolio and capabilities and expand that into our markets, and further we think that's a great growth opportunity. So if you add to that just from the performance that we've seen from a customer retention perspective, a deposit retention perspective with FirstMerit, I would tell you that we are really hitting on all cylinders there.","Jon Arfstrom","Okay. And the other number that you laid out was a percentage of revenues from non-interest income, and if you raised the FirstMerit average to your average that there's more accretion in the acquisition. Anything that you see right now that would prevent you from hitting that corporate average?","Mac McCullough","No. We think that there's probably close to $100 million of revenue if you normalize FirstMerit's fee income to total revenue to ours. And we really have that identified in terms of where we think that's coming from, and we've got the incremental expenses and capabilities built into 2017 and 2018. So we feel pretty comfortable with achieving that number.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question.","Ken Usdin","Just a question on costs and efficiency progress to your clear points about getting to the cost saves run rated by the second half and the third quarter. And then also with this planned accretion runoff, just wondering if you can help us understand how you expect the efficiency ratio to traject? You have got that long-term goal 56%, 59%. Just wondering if think you can get inside of that by the end of next year? How are you thinking about exiting 4Q 2017 to your point moving -- you're still committing to positive operating leverage but with a lot of these moving parts back and forth? Thanks.","Mac McCullough","Thanks, Ken. So we are very comfortable with the range we have put out there the 56% to 59% longer term. And clearly as we start to see increases in interest rates, we do think that's going to help us get towards the bottom end of the range.","We do go through system conversion branch closures in the February timeframe, and we will see the expense come out in the second quarter. There might be a little bit that will come out in the third quarter as well. So I would expect that in the fourth quarter of this year, we'll be a run rate that will certainly reflect the range that we've signed up for longer term.","Ken Usdin","So you think you can get into the range. And I guess you've given the 20% revenue outlook on the top line, and I'm just wondering, I think we're all wondering just what that magnitude of operating leverage is that you were thinking through. Is there any way to help us understand like you did for the fourth quarter just around what you think the rate of expense growth will be versus that 20% plus on the top?","Mac McCullough","We've come out and told you what we expect the fourth quarter expense number to be at a regional conference in the fourth quarter. So that's $609 million.","Ken Usdin","Okay. So that's still on track?","Mac McCullough","That's still on track. That gets us to the $255 million cost takeout we've signed up for growing at 3%, and achieved in the fourth quarter of 2017.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Matt O'Connor","Obviously some moving pieces on the NIM, the purchase accounting accretion was a lot better this quarter, but seems like the core NIM was also better. Wondering if you can help us shape what both components could look like in the first quarter of 2017?","Mac McCullough","Yes, Matt, there are number of moving parts here. And as we discussed, the core NIM is 3.07, 3.06 if you exclude the interest recovery that we saw in the quarter. We do think the core NIM is going to expand from this point. We are 6% asset sensitive. We're going to continue to see the swap book on the asset side roll off. We have about a little over $3 billion in asset swaps that will come off by the end of the year, that will increase asset sensitivity by probably another 0.7, 0.8 and we did see some impact from the December rate increase.","So I would suggest that it's going to be difficult to project the NIM because of the purchase accounting impact and some of the accelerated accretion. That we do expect to happen, that we have seen happen in both the third and fourth quarters. But feel good about the core margin expanding from this point.","Matt O'Connor","And can you help size the impact of call it the 25 basis point increase in rates that we saw in December? Obviously the industry is not experiencing a lot of deposit repricing, so I think we are seeing more NIM left than expected from the first couple rate increases. But maybe just size how much benefit you expect to get from December's hike.","Mac McCullough","We are assuming probably a 40% to 50% beta on that change. And I think as you play that through, it really is going to depend a lot on what happens with competition and how we see pricing change in the environment. So I don't think the impact of this first increase is going to be hugely material, but certainly it will be a positive to the margin going forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.","John Pancari","On the auto side, wanted to see if you can give us an update on some of the dynamics you are seeing there in the industry just given that we've been seeing some of the auto lenders see some volatility there? So just curious about the competitive dynamic, your appetite for ongoing growth there, maybe your growth outlook as well as credit trends how they are moving along. Thanks.","Dan Neumeyer","This is Dan. So I would say in terms of the credit trends, we feel very good as we have stated in the past. What goes on in the market isn't completely relevant to what we are doing since we haven't adjusted our origination strategies in terms of FICO, LTV, term, et cetera. So we are still a prime, super prime lender and our results have been quite consistent.","A lot of noise in what's going on in the market, but I think that relates more to those who are in the sub prime rate or near prime space. So we still see good originations, as Matt noted earlier, we actually saw some margin expansion. We think on a risk-adjusted basis, we are in a really -- in a great spot.","So trends are good, delinquencies remain well controlled. So on the whole, very solid outlook. We continue to plan for more growth, but very steady origination strategy.","Steve Steinour","And our expectation, John, is the dealers will continue to have a good year, roughly in line with last year. And we are very well-positioned in that regard, both on the direct side core plan, the indirect and to finance some of the supply base. And all that's broken out for you on the different schedules that we provide.","Dan Neumeyer","And just I would add that there are a couple of items this quarter that are worth noting. So we do have the FirstMerit portfolio included. And so when you look at the charge-off numbers on page 46, we provide a table that outlines. They do have a higher charge-off rate, but part of that is impacted by the fact that recoveries do not reduce gross charge-offs. Because it's an acquired book, and therefore the recoveries flow through the income line. And so that's one factor to consider.","The other thing is we had securitization. So we had $1.5 billion move out of the denominator, and there are no delinquencies in that pool of loans. So when you really make those adjustments, our originated book continues to be very steady, 1 to 2 basis points higher than last year. Either if you're looking at quarter over quarter, it was 1 basis point, year over year, 2 basis points. So again, very steady performance that we are very pleased with.","John Pancari","And then, Steve, I just would love to get your thoughts on capital deployment here, and how you are thinking about deployment going into 2017 CCAR. Do you see an opportunity to get more aggressive there in returns, and how would you prioritize buybacks versus dividends? Thanks.","Steve Steinour","Our capital priorities haven't changed from what we've had over the years, organic growth, dividend, and then other actions. The balance sheet optimization activities of the fourth quarter were all successfully completed, and that was with the view of giving us the capacity to come into CCAR with a strong foundation. The Board will make decisions later, we don't even have CCAR scenarios yet so it would be very premature for me to comment at this point.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bob Ramsey with FBR Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Kyle Peterson","This is actually Kyle Peterson on for Bob today. It looks like your tax rate has been a little bit lower here. It looks like even when backing out the merger charges, it's running more in that 24%, 25% range. I just want to see if you guys could give any color moving forward on where we should expect that to run?","Mac McCullough","That's pretty consistent with where we have been, and the guidance that we provide is in that same range I think 24% to 27% is what we said in the press release, and that excludes significant items. So when you tax back the significant items of 35%, it does make that rate look lower on a GAAP basis, but if you adjust for the significant items, you get to the 25%. And if you actually FTE adjusted that, it would actually be higher. But that's a range we're very comfortable with going forward.","Kyle Peterson","Okay, great. Then I guess just a little bit on margin. I know you guys mentioned your guidance includes a rate hike in the middle of the year. Where do you guys see the core margin going in the event of no additional rate hikes throughout the year?","Mac McCullough","Higher. We're going to see the core margin continue to expand. Again, it's not going to be hugely significant, but we have talked about probably one to two rate hikes requiring to take place in order for us to start to see margin expansion. And we actually think we're going to get that with the one rate hike now.","And again, March will be a bit volatile this year because of what's happening with purchase accounting and accelerated accretion. But we'll be sure to keep you informed in terms what we see there an update it as it rolls through.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Sandler O'Neill and Partners. Please proceed with your question.","Scott Siefers","Mac, I was hoping you could expand on your comments on the nuance of the purchase accounting pull forward. Just curious specifically on slide 6 if you can walk through the changes and what drove those relative to when you guys had given that slide out at the Goldman conference last month. Just kind of curious, is that just initial behavior of the acquired portfolio or what changed in that time period?","Mac McCullough","Scott, so the best way to think about it is if a loan pays off and it renews early, then we accelerate the purchase accounting adjustment and that comes into the margin. That happened in the fourth quarter to the tune of about $10 million.","Scott Siefers","Okay.","Mac McCullough","Okay. So what you have to also realize the flip side of that, as an acquired loan moves from the acquired portfolio to the originated portfolio we have to establish a reserve for that. So in the fourth quarter, roughly half of the increase or of the reserve build is due to acquired loans from FirstMerit being in the originated portfolio. So we are going to continue to see accelerated accretion in the margin, and we're going to continue to see some higher provision expense as we've reserved for those loans that come into the originated book.","Scott Siefers","Okay.","Mac McCullough","That's where it gets a little complex, and we can't actually predict what is going to renew on a forward basis. But we will give you this chart every quarter updated for what's happened, and let you know what the inflows and outflows are.","Steve Steinour","Scott, if I could just add to try and -- normally, you would expect to see renewal activity first and second quarter on these commercial loans. So we're trying to share with you an expectation that there will be, in addition to scheduled maturities, there will be we think just more economic activity associated with the outlook, the improved outlook. Expansions of working capital lines, maybe more CapEx, things like that, so we could be in a period that's more active than what we've had recently as we go through the first half of 2017.","Scott Siefers","Okay, that all makes sense. Thank you. And then was just curious as well, I think when you originally gave the guidance for 2017 on that 20% plus revenue growth, that was assuming no rate increases either the one we got in December or anything this year.","So would the 20% still hold true even if we got nothing else? And just out of curiosity, you guys have always been so conservative on the rate outlook with basically always assuming none. Just curious why you decided to add even just the one into the outlook?","Mac McCullough","Scott, I think the guidance still holds true. We just felt that it feels more certain this time, and that it just made more sense from a reality perspective and how we've built out the budget and how we thought about 2017. So we did put the one additional increase in midyear, and that's rolling through our budget for 2017.","Scott Siefers","Okay.","Steve Steinour","And, Scott, like prior years, we have contingent expense reduction should we find the environment to be different than we anticipate.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.","Erika Najarian","I wanted to ask a question on how given that rate hikes could potentially be more certain in 2017 and especially beyond, I'm wondering if you could help us think about how your asset sensitivity could have changed with the FirstMerit acquisition now fully in your books for the next rate hike? So in 1Q of 2016, your margin went up 2 basis points.","And I'm wondering given the comments on a potentially structurally higher NIM anyway, core NIM in 2017, plus the 25 basis point rate hike, plus the fact your deposit costs haven't moved. Whether the expansion quarter over quarter in core NIM is likely going to be greater than the 2 basis points in 1Q 2016?","Mac McCullough","So, Erika, the FirstMerit balance sheet actually didn't change our asset sensitivity or interest rate risk significantly. So if anything, FirstMerit might have been a little bit more asset sensitive. So we don't really think that this has had a huge impact on how we are positioned, either before or after the FirstMerit acquisition.","And clearly, it's all going to depend on what happens in the marketplace and what happens with the competition. We're in a new environment for liquidity based on new regulations and requirements. And certainly when the first rate hikes come through on an increasing cycle, you typically don't see as much of up pricing on the deposit side as quickly.","We might be conservative with the 40% to 50% beta in what we are assuming. But we feel comfortable with those assumptions, and we are going to continue to monitor what's happening in the environment just to make sure that we are competitive from a liquidity perspective.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Long with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.","David Long","I just wanted to see if you guys can talk a little bit about your strategy on the retail banking side in your newly-acquired Chicago market here after the FirstMerit deal? In the Chicago market, you guys may not have the critical mass like several of the competent larger banks here. Just want to see how you plan to compete, and then also how you'd look to invest in that market in the future?","Steve Steinour","David, we have outlined it and I will try and cover this again. Mac may want to add to it. We've outlined that we will continue with the strategy that FirstMerit had, which was a niche approach emphasizing commercial or business lending. We have made a commitment to SBA lending in Chicago, and the team largely is in place now, the same with home lending.","With our mortgage capabilities, we've added significantly. We are continuing to add at this point into our Chicago team on the mortgage front. So we like our distribution in terms of the spread. It's not concentrated given the size of that market. It's obviously grossly under scale, and that will cause us to focus on these niches and growing these niches and perhaps growing in some other areas over time. But the emphasis will be to maintain the disciplined that FirstMerit had in terms of growing commercial lending activities in Chicago principally.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Terry McEvoy with Stephens Inc. Please proceed with your question.","Terry McEvoy","I just wanted to circle back to Ken's question on that 4Q expense target of $609 million. If I remember that presentation last quarter, it did not include some personnel expenses, the FDIC insurance premiums. And I'm wondering if you could help us with the GAAP number, and also just the amortization as well to better understand what 4Q could look like again from a GAAP standpoint?","Mac McCullough","Yes, Terry. So the $609 million does not include intangible amortization. That's a number excluding that figure. And certainly the $609 million is a quantitative measurement looking at the $255 million growing at 3%. And we're making investments in revenue-producing capabilities, personnel, technology basically for FirstMerit markets where we have additional opportunities. We've talked about SBA, we've talked about home lending.","And we will be adding some expense relative to those investments without a doubt, but we will also be adding revenue associated with those investments too. So certainly, the $609 million as we get closer to that we will reconcile in terms of what those investments look like. But feel very comfortable that we're going to get the cost takeouts that we have signed up for, and we're going to make additional investments into revenue opportunities that we think are available to us.","Terry McEvoy","And then earlier you said for the most part, you'd get the full cost saves by the end of 2Q, with a little bit moving into Q3. Could you be a little more specific in terms of what you expect to realize by the middle point of 2017?","Mac McCullough","It's going to depend a bit on how we move through the conversion and integration process. There's still some expenses that we are working to get out that might be more longer term in nature around real estate and those types of things. To the extent anything bleeds into the third quarter, I don't expect it to be material but there will be some third-quarter impact.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Barker with Piper Jaffrey. Please proceed with your question.","Kevin Barker","I just wanted to follow up in regards to some of the questions around capital. Your CET1 ratio obviously appears to have very healthy and plenty of excess capital to be deployed over time, but it seems like your TCE ratio is relatively low compared to the peer group. Are you comfortable bringing down the TCE ratio below 7% as long as you have the CET1 ratio well above an 8% ratio?","Mac McCullough","Kevin, it's Mac. So we are focused on CET1, and we do have an operating range of 9% to 10% for CET1. As you see, the 9.50% which is where we are today calibrates, translates to a 7.2% TCE. We do monitor the tangible common ratio. It is something that we pay close attention to. I'm not sure I see it going below 7%, but it certainly is calibrated to CET1 and that's the ratio that ratio that we're really focused on.","Kevin Barker","And then you're obviously building the provision given the purchase accounting accretion that's coming off of FirstMerit, and you will probably see that continue to grow. How long -- at what point do you feel like you would be at a more normalized level in a reserve to loan ratio, and how long do you think it will take to get to that point following the FirstMerit acquisition?","Mac McCullough","Kevin, I would probably refer you to slide 6 in terms of what the accretion around purchase accounting. Basically as the acquired portfolio moves into an originated portfolio as those loans renew, we will see the purchase accounting adjustments decline. And you will see us over that period of time replenishing the reserve, building a reserve, on those loans as they move from acquired to organic.","So clearly, what you see on slide 6 would be an elongated view because we're going to see this pull forward as loans renew early. So I would just ask you to think about slide 6 and calibrate around the numbers on that page, understanding that it's going to be accelerated.","Kevin Barker","Okay. And when you think about the risk profile pro forma on the FirstMerit acquisition, do you feel that your reserve to loan ratio should run higher than it was in the past or do you feel like it could run a little bit lower than what it was in previous quarters prior to the acquisition?","Mac McCullough","I think as we move towards normalization, you are probably going to be a little bit higher than previously. That's what I would say. Because just our base charge-off level, we still remain below the long-term target but we are definitely moving towards more normalization as recoveries decrease.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Klock with KBW. Please proceed with your question.","Brian Klock","I wanted to follow up just really quickly, Mac, on an earlier question about the deposit beta assumptions. I think you said 40% to 50%, is that what you're expecting from the December hike that just happened in 2016 or is that what your asset sensitivity assumptions are or is that yes to both?","Mac McCullough","That would be us to both.","Brian Klock","Okay.","Mac McCullough","So the 40% to 50% is average across the entire deposit portfolio, and we have been pretty consistent in talking about a 50% beta over time. And as we think about the December hike, we have modeled something in that range.","Brian Klock","Okay. And then I guess a follow-up question. Steve, you mentioned some of the improved commercial sentiment post election. Actually you guys in the fourth quarter your C&I loan growth was pretty solid relative to some others that we've seen softness in middle market. So maybe you can talk about what kind of trends you're seeing in the C&I book? And is there that potential for some enhanced an increase capital expenditures that may actually finally happen in the Midwest?","Steve Steinour","I think the early read from many of our customers is one of more optimism. And what they are telling us and what are more broadly our various line management and RMs are telling us is much more activity compared to prior periods in terms of potential investments. So we are I think better positioned than we have been for maybe a decade in terms of CapEx and expansion in the different businesses here in the Midwest.","Brian Klock","And if I could throw one more in. I don't know, Mac, do you have the growth you did get in loans this quarter from FirstMerit versus HPN?","Mac McCullough","I don't have that.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back over to Steve Steinour for closing remarks.","Steve Steinour","Thank you all again. 2016 was highlighted by the acquisition of FirstMerit, and our continued strong core financial performance. We are encouraged by the focused activities of our colleagues and the sentiment of our customers. With sound fundamentals in place at the start of the year, we are positioned for solid performance in the coming quarters. Clearly, our strategies are working and our execution of goals continues to drive good results. We expect to continue to gain market share and grow share of wallet.","The addition of FirstMerit's solid balance sheet, strong credit performance, valuable customer base and new markets provide opportunities for us to further accelerate achievement of our long-term financial goals. We're already realizing revenue synergies in several areas.","And finally, I want to close by reiterating that our Board and this Management Team are all long-term shareholders. Our top priority is integrating FirstMerit and growing our core business. At the same time, we will continue to manage risks and volatility and do so with the intent of driving solid, consistent long-term performance.","So thank you for your interest in Huntington.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Mark Muth, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Mark Muth","Thank you, Melissa. Welcome. I\u2019m Mark Muth, Director of Investor Relations for Huntington. Copies of the slides we\u2019ll be reviewing can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website, www.huntington.com.

As always, we appreciate your interest and support. We are very pleased with our fourth quarter financial performance including record net income for the third consecutive quarter and the accelerated achievement of all five of our long-term financial goals in the quarter.","As I turn to slide three to review full year results, please keep in mind that comparisons to 2016 are impacted by the inclusion of FirstMerit, at the acquisition close, during the third quarter of 2016.","We reported earnings per common share of $1 for full year 2017, up 43% over 2016. This includes $0.09 per share of significant items related to the FirstMerit acquisition and $0.11 per share of reasonably estimated benefit from federal tax reform. Also including the impact of the significant items, return on assets was 1.17%, return on common on equity was 11.6% and return on common equity was 15.7%.","Turning to slide four. We reported earnings per common share of $0.37 for the fourth quarter, up 85% over the year ago quarter. This includes $0.11 per share of reasonably estimated benefit from federal tax reform. Also including the impact of significant items, return on assets was 1.67%, return on common equity was 17% and return on tangible common equity was 22.7%.","Our reported efficiency ratio for the quarter was 54.9%. As a reminder, this is the first quarter since the acquisition of FirstMerit that we did not incur merger-related expense, having completed the physical integration of FirstMerit in the third quarter of 2017. Tangible book value per share increased 2% sequentially and 8% year-over-year to $6.97 per share. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased $137 million of common stock, representing 9.8 million shares at an average cost of $14 per share.","Turning to slide five. Total revenue was up 4% from the year ago quarter. Net interest income was up 5% year-over-year due to a 3% increase in average earning assets and a 5% basis-point increase in the net interest margin.","Noninterest income increased 2% year-over-year on strength in capital markets fees, card and payment processing revenue, and trust and investment management fees, partially offset by a reduction in gains on the sale of loans related to the balance sheet optimization strategy executed in the fourth quarter of 2016. Noninterest expense decreased 7% year-over-year due entirely to $53 million of significant items expense in the fourth quarter of 2016 related to the integration of FirstMerit versus no significant items expense in the fourth quarter of 2017. Excluding the significant items, noninterest expense in the fourth quarter of 2017 grew $5 million or 1% from the year-ago quarter, primarily due to the impact of annual compensation increases.","For a closer look at the details behind the calculations, please refer to the reconciliations contained on pages 21 and 22 of the presentation slides or in the release.","Slide six illustrates that we delivered positive operating leverage again in 2017. This is an important annual goal for us and we are pleased that we accomplished this for the fifth consecutive year.","Turning to slide seven. Average earning assets grew 3% from the fourth quarter of 2016. This increase was driven by an 8% increase in average securities and a 4% year-over-year increase in average loans and leases, which were partially offset by a reduction in held for sale assets due to the balance sheet optimization strategy executed in the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase in average securities reflects the reinvestment of cash flows including the proceeds of the auto securitization in the fourth quarter of 2016 and additional investments and liquidity coverage ratio Level 1 qualifying securities.","Average C&I loans decreased 1% year-over-year, primarily reflecting the headwinds in corporate banking, discussed in the first three quarters of 2017. While not impacting average balances materially, the C&I balances ended the quarter on a strong note with a period-end balances up 2.3% or just over 9% annualized versus the prior quarter-end. We saw the bulk of the growth in the final few weeks of the quarter, likely in part resulting from the removal of uncertainty regarding federal tax reform, coupled with a normal late quarter growth in commercial loans that we have experienced for the past few years.","Average commercial real estate loans were flat year-over-year as we have strategically tightened CRE lending, specifically in multifamily, retail and construction to remain consistent with our aggregate moderate to low risk appetite and to ensure appropriate returns on capital.","Average auto loans increased to 10% year-over-year, with the fourth quarter representing another solid quarter of consistent and disciplined loan production. Originations totaled $1.4 billion for the fourth quarter of 2017, up 9% year-over-year. Average new money yields on our auto originations were 3.52% in the fourth quarter, down from 3.62% in the prior quarter. This decline was primarily driven by the normal seasonal mix shift to new car sales in the fourth quarter.","Average RV and marine loans increased 30% year-over-year, reflecting the successful expansion of the business into 17 new states over the past year. Note that the fourth quarter is seasonally the weakest for loan production in this business but this quarter\u2019s production exceeded the business plan and we remain optimistic for growth in 2018.","Average residential mortgage loans increased 15% year-over-year, reflecting continued strong demand for mortgages across our footprint as well as the benefit of our ongoing investments in former FirstMerit geographies, particularly Chicago.","As typical, we sold the agency qualified mortgage production in the quarter and retained the jumbo mortgages and specialty mortgage products. On a period-end basis, total loans increased 5% from a year-ago, driven by strength in consumer lending.","Turning attention to the chart on the right side of slide seven, average total deposits increased 1% from the year-ago quarter, including a 3% increase in average core deposits. Average demand deposits increased 4% year-over-year. We remain pleased with the trend in core deposits, particularly the increase in low cost DDA. This reflects the addition of FirstMerit\u2019s low cost deposit base as well as our continuing focus on checking account relationship acquisition.","The decline in period-end total deposits from the prior quarter was primarily due to seasonal decreases in government banking and expected fluctuations within our specialty banking deposit relationships.","Moving to slide eight. Our net interest margin was 3.30% for the fourth quarter, up 5 basis points from the year-ago quarter. This increase reflects a 23 basis-point increase in earning asset yields and a 7 basis-point increase in the benefit of non-interest bearing funds balanced against, a 25 basis-point increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities. Importantly, our cost of core interest-bearing deposits was only up 12 basis points.","On a linked quarter basis, the net interest margin increased by 1 basis point, driven by a 5 basis-point improvement in earning asset yields and a 1 basis point increase in the benefit of non-interest bearing funds, partially offset by a 5 basis-point increase in the cost of interest bearing liabilities. The increase in funding cost was more heavily weighted to wholesale funding as we continue to remain pleased with our ability to successfully lag deposit pricing, especially on core consumer deposits where the rate paid remained flat sequentially.","Purchase accounting accretion contributed 10 basis points to the net interest margin in the fourth quarter, down from 12 basis points in the prior quarter. After adjusting for purchase accounting accretion in all quarters, the core NIM was 3.20% in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to 3.18% in the prior quarter and 3.07% in the fourth quarter of 2016. Growth in core NIM over the past year has more than offset the reduction in the benefit from purchase accounting accretion.","As I just mentioned and calling your attention to the orange line at the bottom of the graph on the left, our cost of core consumer deposits was 22 basis points for the fourth quarter. This represents a 4 basis-point increase over the year-ago quarter and was flat sequentially, illustrating the strong core consumer deposit base we enjoy and our ability to successfully lag deposit pricing.","We have seen consumer and business banking deposit pricing remain relatively steady in the face of recent fed interest rate hikes with the majority of pricing pressure being limited to government banking, corporate banking and the upper end of commercial middle market. In the quarter, we selectively increased rates to grow and retain core deposit balances on certain corporate relationships, providing better economics for the bank relative to the cost of wholesale funding.","On the earning asset side, our commercial loan yields increased 37 basis points year-over-year, while consumer loan yields increased 18 basis points. On a linked-quarter basis, commercial loan yields increased 8 basis points while consumer loan yields decreased 1 basis point, primarily related to the impact of purchase accounting. Security yields were up 6 basis points year-over-year and were up 9 basis points compared to the prior quarter.","Moving to slide nine. We expanded the information provided regarding the impact of FirstMerit purchase accounting for 2017 and 2018 at a recent conference and we have updated it here. It is important to note that the purchase accounting accretion estimates on this slide, which are the green bars, are based on current scheduled accretion. And except for what we experienced in 2017, we do not include any accelerated accretion from recapture from early payoffs or extensions in the projected period. As we have stated previously, it has been proven out in our results for past six quarters, in reality, we\u2019re likely to experience loan extensions and early payoffs resulting in accelerated accretion. Therefore, you\u2019re likely to see the accretion revenue schedule for 2018 continue to be put forward as modifications of early payoffs occur.","Purchase accounting accretion is currently expected to represent a net interest income headwind of approximately $62 million in 2018 compared to 2017. However, majority of the $62 million decline in purchase accounting revenue is expected to be offset by a $41 million reduction in provision expense related to the acquired FirstMerit loans which is shown in the yellow bars. Importantly, as we think about quality of earnings, looking at the two circled orange bars, the net impact of pretax income from purchase accounting was approximately $13 million in 2017 and is currently expected to decline only $3 million in 2018.","Turning to slide 10, let\u2019s take a look at the progress against our long-term financial goals which were approved by the Board in the fall of 2014 as part of our strategic planning process. These goals were originally set with a five-year time horizon in mind, yet we achieved these long-term financial goals on a quarterly basis in the fourth quarter of 2017 due to the realization of the economic benefits of the FirstMerit acquisition.","Fourth quarter 2017 results on a reported GAAP basis reflect the benefit of federal tax reform. Even with adjusting for this benefit, as shown on slide 27 in the appendix, we are realizing the scale and financial benefits of the acquisition. We are proud to have achieved all five of our long-term financial goals this quarter on both the GAAP and non-GAAP basis. Full year 2017 results on a reported GAAP basis reflect the cost of the FirstMerit integration and the tax benefit.","Adjusting for these items, as shown on slide 26 and 27 in the appendix, we are already meeting the targets on an annual basis. Importantly, we expect to achieve all five financial goals on the GAAP basis for full year 2018, two years ahead of schedule. We have recently begun our 2018 strategic planning process and we\u2019ll be sharing new long-term financial goals for the Company later this year.","Slide 11 highlights the FirstMerit-related cost savings and strategic revenue and synergies. As promised, we are fully realizing the original announced $255 million of annualized cost savings as evidenced by beating our $639 million noninterest expense target for the fourth quarter of 2017. Going forward, our focus is on executing the FirstMerit deal-related revenue enhancement opportunities. In 2017, we realized revenue of $48 million and expense of $36 million on these initiatives.","The initiatives remain on track to deliver more than $100 million of revenue in 2018 with an efficiency ratio of 50%. These projections are included in our 2018 guidance. Early success and the introduction of the full Huntington product suite through our optimal customer relationship strategy and the strong results from SBA, RV and marine and home lending expansions provide optimism for continued revenue growth.","Slide 12 illustrates the continued strength of our capital ratios and a successful replenishment of our capital following the FirstMerit acquisition. Common equity Tier 1 ratio or CET1, ended the quarter at 9.89% up 33 basis points year-over-year. As a reminder, our operating guideline for CET1 is 9% to 10%. Tangible common equity ended the quarter at 7.34%, up 18 basis points year-over-year.","Moving to slide 13. I want to draw your attention to the fact that for the first time our Series A convertible preferred is included in our fully diluted common shares calculation, since the conversion would actually be dilutive earnings per share albeit by an immaterial amount. This is why average fully diluted common shares increased by approximately 24 million shares from the third quarter of 2017 to the fourth quarter of 2017.","On a separate and unrelated note, our common stock is currently trading at a level that would allow us to force mandatory conversion of the Series A convertible preferred as early as February 9th. The potential conversion would have a positive impact on our tangible common equity capital ratio and our CET1 capital ratio with an immaterial impact on earnings per share. Should the conversion happen, we would take the opportunity to optimize our capital ratios, subject to non-objection in the 2018 CCAR submission.","Moving to slide 14. Credit quality remains strong in the quarter. Consistent, prudent credit underwriting is one of Huntington\u2019s core principles. And our financial results continue to reflect our disciplined approach to risk management and our aggregate moderate to low risk appetite. We booked provision expense of $65 million in the fourth quarter compared to net charge-offs of $41 million. Net charge-offs represent an annualized 24 basis points of average loans and leases, which remain below our long-term target of 35 to 55 basis points.","Net charge-offs were down 1 basis point from the prior quarter and down 2 basis points from the year ago quarter. As usual, there is an additional granularity on charge-offs by portfolio in the analyst package and the slides. The allowance for credit losses as a percentage of loans increased 1 basis point linked-quarter to 1.11%, and the non-accrual loan coverage ratio remained flat at 223%.","Turning to slide 15. Overall asset quality metrics remain strong. Nonperforming assets increased $2 million or 1% linked-quarter. The NPA ratio eased 1 basis point sequentially to 55 basis points. The criticized asset ratio decreased 27 basis points from 3.80% to 3.53%. And our 90-day delinquencies slightly declined. NPA inflows increased 4 basis points.","Let me now turn the presentation over to Steve.","Steve Steinour","Thanks, Mac. Moving to the economy, slides 16 and 17 illustrate selected key economic indicators for our footprint. And as we\u2019ve noted previously, our footprint states have outperformed the rest of the nation during the economic recovery for the last several years. And I remain optimistic on the outlook for the local economies across our eight states.","The bottom left chart on slide 16 and the chart on slide 17 illustrate trends in unemployment rates across our footprint. And as you can see, unemployment rates across the majority of our footprint remained near historical lows. The labor markets in our footprint have proven to be strong with several markets such as here in Columbus, in Indianapolis and Grand Rapids, where we see meaningful labor shortages.","We have noted previously that we\u2019re seeing wage inflation in our expense base and certainly our customers are as well. Housing markets across our footprint continue to display broad-based home price inflation while remaining some of the most affordable markets throughout the U.S.","Consumer confidence in our region is at its highest level since 2000. And perhaps more importantly, I would like to direct your attention to the map on the bottom right of slide 16 which illustrates the Philadelphia fed\u2019s state leading indicator indices for our footprint. These leading indicators point toward a very favorable economic operating environment in 2018 as six of our eight states are expected to see an acceleration in economic activity over the next six months. The optimism illustrated by the leading indicators, confirm our own optimism which is based on the daily interactions our bankers have with our small business, commercial and consumer customers. Our customer calling efforts have found widespread confidence across all of these customer segments.","Our loan pipelines remain good including our commercial and business pipelines which are stronger today than they were a year ago. And while the near-term impact may be less predictable, we believe longer term impact of the enactment of federal tax reform is positive for our customers, our region and for Huntington.","We expect positive economic impact from the manufacturing and business expansion to our footprint from increased capital expenditures across wide array of industries and businesses from the reduced corporate tax burdens, as well as the impact of repatriation of foreign earnings by a number of corporations.","And in addition, it\u2019s important to remember that our commercial focus is primarily on privately held businesses. These businesses stereotypically are more likely to pay a full statutory tax rate and therefore are going to see materially improved profitability and cash flow. And importantly, these companies are also likely to reinvest those tax benefits into their businesses to fund growth.","Moving to slide 18. Huntington\u2019s strong positioned to deliver consistent through-the-cycle shareholder returns. This strategy entails reducing volatility of results and returns, achieving top tiered performance over the long-term and maintaining our aggregate moderate to low risk profile throughout. I would like to highlight the graph in the top left quadrant, which represents our continued growth in pretax pre-provision net revenue as a result of the focused execution of our core strategies, plus the economics of FirstMerit. This strong level of capital generation position us well to fund organic growth and to return capital to our shareholders, consistent with our previously communicated capital priorities.","Let\u2019s now turn to slide 19 to review our 2018 expectations. As we look forward to 2018, we expect a full year average loan growth in the range of 4% to 6% inclusive of over $500 million auto loan securitization in the back half of the year. Full year average deposit growth is expected to be 3% to 5%. We continue to budget expecting no change in interest rates as we have for the last few years. While it appears likely as that the fed might said act again this year, it has served us well to take a more of conservative approach in our budgeting process and plan accordingly. And we continue to do so with respect to our plans and budget for this year. We expect full year revenue growth of 4% to 6%; we\u2019re projecting the GAAP NIM to be flat and the core NIM to be up modestly in 2018, under those assumptions.","On the expense side, we\u2019re expecting a 2% to 4% decrease from the 2017 GAAP noninterest expense of $2.7 billion. Our expectations include improvement in the cash efficiency ratio to a range of 55% to 57% towards the positive operating leverage for the sixth consecutive year. We anticipate net charge-offs will remains below our long-term goal of 35 basis points to 55 basis points. And we expect the effective tax rate to be in the 16% to 17% range, fully reflective of federal tax reform.","So, let\u2019s turn to slide 20 for some closing remarks and important messages, please. We had very good fourth quarter, including record net income for the third consecutive quarter. The core franchise continues to perform well on many fronts, but we believe we can further improve our core performance. We\u2019re optimistic on the outlook for the local economies across our footprint. As Mac noted, the FirstMerit acquisition accelerated our ability to achieve our long-term financial goals. And we delivered on those goals for the first time on a GAAP bases in the fourth quarter. We expect to achieve them on a full year GAAP basis in 2018, two years sooner than we planned when we originally announced the revised goals in December of 2014.","We are fully realizing the $255 million of annual cost savings from the acquisition, as originally communicated. We also continue to execute on the significant revenue enhancement opportunities, delivering $48 million in 2017 through OCR, small business, home lending and RV and marine lending initiatives.","As I look back on our announcement of the FirstMerit acquisition two years ago, we delivered on our promises, our promises to improve the efficiency ratio by greater than 400 basis points, our promise to improve return on assets by 15 basis points and our promise to improve return on tangible common equity by more than 300 basis points. In fact, versus the 2015 fourth quarter, right before we announced the deal, our efficiency ratio improved by 880 basis points and our core ROTC improved by more than 360 basis points to 16%. So, today, our teams are fully integrated, they\u2019re focused, and they\u2019re performing well. And we expect them to continue to perform at an even higher level. We\u2019re optimistic about 2018 and into the year -- coming into the year with business line momentum. We remain focused on delivering consistent through-the-cycle shareholder returns. The strategy entails reducing short-term volatility, achieving top tier performance over time and maintaining our aggregate moderate to low risk profile throughout. ","So, I\u2019ll now turn it back over to Mark, so we can get your questions. Thank you.","Mark Muth","Melissa, we will now take questions. We ask that as the courtesy to your peers, each person ask only one question and one related follow-up. And then if that person have additional question, he or she can add himself back into the queue. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Ricky Dodds","Hey, guys. It\u2019s actually Ricky for Matt\u2019s team. Just wondering if you could quickly touch on your fee expectations for the year, I know you gave some of the revenue outlooks. But I was wondering if you could maybe touch on that. And then, maybe specifically talk about some of strengths you\u2019ve had in the capital markets business over the past few quarters. I think you had a nice step up there. So, maybe if you can talk about that is well. Thanks.","Steve Steinour","So, we are seeing, I think a good strength in the fee businesses. I think you need to keep in mind some of the investments that we made around the FirstMerit acquisition and SBA lending and mortgage banking in particular, I think those investments are paying off for us very well. I would say, we\u2019re ahead of SBA. And I think we\u2019re catching up on mortgage. We might have been a little bit behind in terms of hiring in some markets, but I think we\u2019re in good shape as we enter 2018. So, I would expect to see good growth in those lines. Capital markets is a real opportunity for us. They had a record quarter in the fourth quarter in terms of revenue. And when we think about the opportunities to sell into the FirstMerit customer base, we have capital markets with treasury management, our products on the Huntington side much stronger, our expertise from a sales perspective, I think is much better. And we\u2019re seeing real opportunities there as we think about penetrating that customer base.","It all ties into our optimal customer relationship strategy which we continue to focus on across the entire organization. While we believe the opportunities are higher for FirstMerit side, we definitely have opportunities on the Huntington side as well. So, I would say that 2018 is going to be a good year for fee income growth relative to what we\u2019ve seen historically because of those investments and because of our focus on OCR.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. ","Sam Ross","Good morning, this is actually Sam Ross on for John Pancari. I know you guys talked about your loans picking up at the end of the quarter. I\u2019m just hoping you can maybe talk about where your line utilization rate ended the quarter and may be sort of what you are seeing at your line utilization currently?","Dan Neumeyer","Yes. This is Dan. Actually line utilization was down just a tick. I think we were down two-tenths of a percent in the quarter. The dynamics kind of changed throughout the course of the quarter where we had a lot of year-end activity, very much close to the year end. I think there was a lot of built-up demand that had been delayed throughout the year. And so, we have seen an uptick there. I would expect that in the first quarter utilization is difficult to pinpoint and with the benefits of tax reform, you don\u2019t know if there\u2019s going to be an immediate impact or whether you might see it later on. I think as the year goes on, I would expect we will see an uptick in utilization but really hard to estimate in the first quarter.","Sam Ross","Got it. And then, maybe just a following cleanup question. I know you guys gave your NIM expectation for full year 2018. But given the impacts of tax reform, what are you guys seeing from your NIM expectations for Q1?","Mac McCullough","So, I think the one impact you need to think about is just the impact of FTEs; it\u2019s about a 3 basis-point reduction in the NIM related to normalizing for the tax reform on the FTE adjustment. But other than that, I wouldn\u2019t expect material change.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Sandler O\u2019Neill & Partners. Please proceed with your question.","Scott Siefers","Good morning, guys. Steve, I was hoping if you could spend maybe just a moment or two offering a little bit your thoughts on kind of reinvestment of the tax benefits if any, or basically how you look at the balance of allowing it to flow through the bottom-line versus just ongoing or increased investments?","Steve Steinour","Scott, we\u2019ve been working with a long-term set of strategies now for almost a decade and that informs our plans every year, it certainly has in 2018. And as I mentioned, we try to approach it conservatively in terms of assuming no interest rate changes. And we\u2019ve been investing every year in the businesses since 2010. We will continue to do that. So, the tax reform does not change our plans in any meaningful way and we\u2019re set with those. So, we would expect the benefits of the tax reforms to flow very, very substantially to the bottom-line. If some of it tends to get competed away over time, we think we are in a tremendous position to respond with the relatively strong performance in both returns and NIM. So, expecting for 2018 that very substantially it goes to the bottom-line and we\u2019ll see how the market reacts over time.","Scott Siefers","Okay, perfect. Thank you. And then, Mac, I was just hoping to ask just a quick question on the potential conversion of the Series A preferred. So, if I understand it correctly, you could potentially force conversion as soon as next month, if the right circumstances occur. Would you guys have to resubmit CCAR if you wanted to do it this year or is it something that for all intents and purposes maybe it\u2019s just any conversion would be part of the next CCAR process period regardless of the whether or not you can force based on stock price movements?","Mac McCullough","Yes, Scott. So, we wouldn\u2019t seem to resubmit our 2017 CCAR in order to force the conversion. In terms of thinking through how we might optimize capital going forward and the opportunities that that creates, that would be a part of the 2018 process. ","Scott Siefers","Okay I understand. So, you do have plenty of flexibility should you choose to -- in very short order potentially.","Steve Steinour","Absolutely.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Ken Usdin","Follow-up on that capital structure question, Mac. So, just trying to understand the ins and out. So, currently, we got the share count in and I think your point about flat as if we were to then leave those shares in and take out this preferred that would be neutral. But would that also consider the line on 13 about additional potential to new preferred issuance? ","Mac McCullough","Yes. Ken, so, the way to think about it, so, we\u2019re paying 8.5% on the Pref A that has the potential to convert here in the first quarter. And it basically is neutral to EPS as we bring those shares back in because of the yield that we\u2019re paying on that pref. So, what that does for us when we think about 2018 CCAR process, obviously this is going to increase our TCE and our CET1 ratios, again with no impact to EPS. And it will give us the opportunity to optimize capital in the 2018 CCAR process at -- even if we issue additional preferred to offset the preferred that we\u2019re converting, it is likely going to be neutral to EPS because of high rate that we\u2019re paying on the current pref versus where we\u2019re currently in the market for a similar instrument, and then, thinking about how we use the common equity that\u2019s been created in the 2018 CCAR process. So, I think in terms of where we sit today, it\u2019s neutral or positive.","Ken Usdin","Understood. Okay, got it. So, we should think about both the potential preferred but also the potential that you could do more on the equity side and CCAR also. So it\u2019s more than just -- okay, I got it. Second question just then, the credit outlook continues to be very good, taking all of Steve\u2019s points about the strength across the footprint. It did have a bit of that continued provision step up which I would still assume was mostly related to the legacy portfolio. So, can you help us just understand that push and pull about that provision movement on the old book and then just how you expect underlying credit? I know below the 35 to 50 but it\u2019s been for such a long time. So, just kind differentiate the provision for the legacy book and then also just how you think about the core.","Dan Neumeyer","Sure, Ken. This is Dan. So, provision in the quarter, there were three primary drivers, one is just loan growth. We did have a good period-end loan growth, despite the fact that average balances weren\u2019t really up. We did have a surge at quarter-end and that\u2019s on the basis on which reserves are based. So, the second component would be that we had a couple of credits with some specific reserves, nothing huge but nonetheless a driver there. And then, third were the FirstMerit renewals. And as you know, these are loans that were marked, had no reserves established. But when we extend the restructure, they now have a reserve attached to them. So it\u2019s those three components that make up what happened in the quarter. I would point out that when you look at that year as a whole because clearly this is a dynamic process, there is going to be fluctuation from quarter-to-quarter. But, on average, we had about $50 million of provision expense for quarter and about $40 million per quarter of charge-off. So, we said that we would slowly, very slowly build the reserve. I think if you looked a year ago, we were at 1.10 coverage on an ACL basis and we ended the year at 1.11. So, I think that qualifies as a slow build. So, that\u2019s really the dynamics going on there.","Ken Usdin","And that\u2019s what you continue?","Dan Neumeyer","Yes. The impact on FirstMerit is that book continues to mature and more and more is slipped to Huntington origination. The impact there is going to lessen and lessen as the years go by.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Peter Winter with Wedbush Securities. Please proceed with your question.","Peter Winter","I was just -- I know your outlook assumes no rate hikes. I\u2019m just curious what would be the impact to net interest income and net interest margin with the 25 basis-point rate hike?","Mac McCullough","Yes. Peter, it\u2019s Mac. So, if you think about 25 basis points short end for the full year, it\u2019s probably in the neighborhood of $25 million pick-up for the full year, is the way to think about it.","Peter Winter","I\u2019m sorry and that\u2019s assuming two rate hikes?","Mac McCullough","Well, that would be the impact of 25 basis points. So, if it\u2019s two rate hikes, it will be twice that.","Peter Winter","Got it. And then, secondly, you talked about your selectively increasing certain deposit costs. Could you just give us a little bit more color how much you increased the deposit cost and what the impact would be in the first quarter?","Mac McCullough","So, we\u2019re just looking I think more closely at -- on the commercial side, the relationships and the depth of the relationships when we think about how we pass through any additional price increases. As you know, we\u2019re a relationship bank and we deeply value those deep relationships with our customers. And that\u2019s exactly the way we\u2019re thinking about it. I think, we\u2019ve pretty much worked our way through the most recently hike. There still might be a few additional opportunities that we\u2019re considering. But, we\u2019re very focused on the commercial side in terms of making sure that we\u2019re doing the right thing from a rate increase perspective with our deep customer relationships.","Peter Winter","Okay. Thank you. ","Mac McCullough","And Peter, if I could just go back to your first question, what I gave you was the full year impact of 25 basis points. So, you need to decide the timing and kind of factor in how that would impact full year 2018.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please proceed with your question.","Marty Mosby","Steve, I want to ask you about the goals, the five goals that you talked about going into 2018. I wasn\u2019t sure, I thought for while there, I was getting it right, but I just want to make sure that without the impact from taxes, you\u2019re saying that you would have accomplished those in the fourth quarter of this year or you would accomplish those in 2018 or do you need tax benefit to even get it in 2018?","Mac McCullough","No, Marty, to clarify then, we accomplished those in the fourth quarter excluding tax benefit. And we would have expected to accomplish them in 2018 excluding tax benefit. They will only be further embellished if you will, with tax benefit.","Marty Mosby","Okay. That\u2019s what I thought we were getting at and then I kind of got confused there for a second. Mac, on the provision, I want to go back to that, kind of walk forward, but I think that\u2019s where some of this can get a little bit in a sense just convoluted in the way that you got -- in the slide that you showed the reduction of the purchase accounting accretion, you also show a reduction in provision of $50 million. So, if we look at your provision for this year at $200 million roughly, and so, when we are itemizing net interest income and saying basically margins flat on a GAAP basis, so we kind of take that as a guidance. The next thing to do, we take that all else being the same, the charge-offs, you would end up with $50 million or less. So, you would have a walk down of provision from $200 million to a $150 million in that kind of cocoon of assumptions and guidance. So, I just want to make sure that was kind of the way to look at that.","Mac McCullough","Yes, Marty. That is correct. I mean, the year-over-year impact is about $51 million reduction in provision related to FirstMerit, simply because we have less loans moving from the acquired portfolio to the originated portfolio.","Marty Mosby","That\u2019s what I thought. And I think that\u2019s where you can probably get some layering effect that I was wondering why other estimates weren\u2019t kind of catching up to where we were. But, I think that was the missing piece if people kind of start looking at the models and sort of thinking okay well, the NII is pretty clear but the next guidance is you really got to pull down that extra build in allowance of $50 million that then helps lower your provisioning as you go into 2018. So, thanks. I appreciate that clarity.","Mac McCullough","Marty, as we think about 2018 and how Dan kind of described the provision on the reserve build, I mean obviously it\u2019s going to depend on the environment; it\u2019s going to depend on the strength of loan growth in 2018. And we do expect that we\u2019re going to be working into a gradual build of the reserve going forward. So, I would tell you that a lot factors go into that. I think, we saw probably better performance in 2017 than we expected on both the Huntington and the FirstMerit side of the equation. So, things are shaping up well as we think about 2018. But, I do think longer term we have a graphical reserve build.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Barker with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed with your question.","Kevin Barker","Thank you. Your guidance assumes that we\u2019re going to see core operating expenses go up by roughly 1% with GAAP expenses going down about 2% to 4%. With that core EPS -- core operating expense growing at 1%, do you expect that to be a two to three-year run rate on growth for operating expenses, given some of the fall-through from the FirstMerit transaction and any other big investments you have out there? ","Mac McCullough","Yes, Kevin. It\u2019s Mac. So, clearly, we\u2019re getting full year benefit of the cost takeouts from FirstMerit in 2018. So that\u2019s the way I would think about the 1% that you quote in 2018. I would not expect that to be longer term growth rate going forward. We continue to invest in the business. As you know personnel costs are the biggest component of our expense line up, and we continue to give merit increases and those types of things. So, when we modeled FirstMerit, we kind of assumed the 3% core growth rate and expense going forward. And I will just point out that we\u2019ve achieved the cost takeouts, we\u2019ve achieved the metrics that we expected from efficiency and ROTCE and we continue to get benefit in the expense growth rate in 2018.","Kevin Barker","Okay. And then, you\u2019ve made that reinvestment of roughly, was it $100 million, generate additional revenue. Do you see any other large investments that need to be made on the horizon following as you\u2019ve digested FirstMerit fully?","Mac McCullough","Just to go back, the investment we made in the FirstMerit revenue initiatives is $50 million. So, we expect $100 million in incremental revenue and then $50 million would be the assumption we made assuming the 50% efficiency ratio; and going back to the $100 million in revenue that was the number that we expected at a minimum. And we do believe that we\u2019re going to see additional revenue opportunities coming out of the FirstMerit transaction as these initiatives mature and in particular as we execute on OCR which actually is the biggest opportunity of all the revenue initiatives coming out of FirstMerit.","As Steve pointed out, we make investments in the business based upon what we need to do based upon what\u2019s happening in the environment and what we feel we need to do from a colleague perspective, from a customer prospective. And I think we\u2019ve done a really good job of that over time. We\u2019re going to continue to focus on positive operating leverage going forward. And as Steve mentioned also, we\u2019re just kicking off our strategic planning process; we\u2019re evaluating different opportunities to grow the business. The primary focus of that process is on revenue growth and thinking about the customer and thinking about what we can do to improve customer experience.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Reevey with D.A. Davidson. Please proceed with your question.","Kevin Reevey","So, this question is for Steve or Mac. So, your revenue outlook for 2018 is 4% to 6%, which is similar to your revenue outlook for last year. And I\u2019m just curious why you not have higher -- stronger outlook, given the fact now that we have corporate tax reform? And it seems like there is a lot more optimism today than there was last year.","Mac McCullough","Kevin, it\u2019s Mac. The 4% to 6% range we think is reasonable, given our risk appetite and how we think about what we want to put on the balance sheet. I mean, obviously, it wasn\u2019t until late in the year that we knew the tax reform was going to get passed. And we still don\u2019t know exactly how to think about it in 2018, although we did see a strong close to 2017 in terms of loan growth on the commercial side in particular. So, we definitely have the opportunities around the FirstMerit investments. And we think we\u2019re going to perform better on those than what we expected. Offsetting that we got some headwinds around first accounting accretion that we\u2019ve just talked about and we\u2019re still in a 2% to 3% GDP growth economy. So, I think 4% to 6% is the right range for us, in particular as we think about managing risk appropriately in terms of what we put on the balance sheet.","Kevin Reevey","And then, just to follow up on the FirstMerit Synergies. How should we think about how the $100 million of synergies are spread out in 2018? Do you think that\u2019s going to come more -- is that going to be more back half loaded or should we -- was that more evenly spread out?","Mac McCullough","Kevin, there will be some seasonality to certain of those products, mortgage and RV marine. But, by the second quarter, those should be performing well. So, short seasonality first quarter and then, remember, we\u2019ve said a $100 million plus in the revenue side. And so, we kind of lock into this $100 million, but we had a very good year. We put a lot of the base line expense in, coming back to the earlier question $48 million of revenue, $37 million of expense. And so now, we get the operating leverage of goes initiatives as we move forward. And obviously, we\u2019re pretty bullish about on how the integration of FirstMerit has been achieved.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Terry McEvoy with Stephens, Inc. Please proceed with your question. ","Terry McEvoy","A question maybe for Dan. I\u2019m just looking for your comments on some fourth quarter trends and the outlook as it relates to the C&I and CRE loans with retail exposure.","Dan Neumeyer","Sure. So, I think over time, one, we feel very good about -- on the C&I side, as we pointed out, our exposures are very well diversified; we didn\u2019t have any exposures to those entities filing for bankruptcy et cetera. Many of our exposures are in auto part, supply investment grade et cetera. So, feel really good there. With the CRE, a little more challenging, because obviously with every announcement of a new bankruptcy that\u2019s going to impact some of our properties. Now, up until this point, we\u2019re seeing a very slow migration of credits into criticized status because of some of these bankruptcies. We\u2019ve also seen some challenges in terms of delayed projects. Frankly, there is labor shortages in some areas that are causing projects to fall behind. So, we\u2019ve seen some very modest deterioration there. But again, due to the diversification of our portfolio, the strength of our core developers et cetera, we feel really good about where we\u2019re sitting today.","Terry McEvoy","Thanks. And then, just as a follow-up, when I look at the revenue synergies, Chicago comes up a couple of times. And, when I look at Huntington, most of your major markets, your top five, Ohio, Detroit, Indianapolis; whereas in Chicago you\u2019re closer to 20. And I guess my question is do you have the scale that\u2019s necessary to accomplish and generate the revenue synergies that we\u2019ve been talking about on the call specific to that market?","Steve Steinour","Well, remember -- this is Steve. The revenue synergies are across the board, but in Chicago, we have very select focus on our different business initiatives there. We\u2019re not trying to play a broad-based consumer strategy, for example, given the limited distribution. So, we feel -- we definitely feel very good about what we\u2019re accomplishing in Chicago. We have a great team there, set of teams there, and are bullish about our ability to get to a $100 million plus on these FirstMerit synergies this year and obviously expect to keep going. We like the niches we have in Chicago, and that\u2019s how we\u2019re playing.","Operator","Thank you [Operator Instructions]","Steve Steinour","Any questions, operator?","Operator","We have one question from Jon Arfstrom with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Jon Arfstrom","Hey, thanks. Steve, you may not like this question but I will ask it anyway. Just following up on Terry\u2019s question a little bit, just strategic thinking, big picture thinking for the Company. With FirstMerit, obviously, you guys have had ups and down but it\u2019s now really coming through and you\u2019ve proved that you can do an acquisition and integrate it, get the expenses and get the revenues. What is the Steve Steinour and Board big picture thinking on M&A? Willing to do it again?","Steve Steinour","Jon, we always look at things but the priority for us in 2018 is getting the strategic plan process really robustly and well completed; and then, secondarily, making sure we deliver these revenue metrics. We have been saying for several years we think we\u2019re in late innings of the game; it looks like it just had extended into extra innings. But we\u2019re in a cautious pasture. Dan referenced that in terms of some of the things that we were doing earlier and in prior calls around limits on construction, commercial real estate, host of things. We will continue those. We will look for other areas where we think we need to adjust, and during the good times with the view that we will have lower volatility through cycles and continue. So, as we advance the strategic plan, the emphasis is on core, not M&A and that\u2019s our focus.","Jon Arfstrom","Fair enough. Thank you.","Steve Steinour","Thanks, Jon. So I think we have to wrap up here, we\u2019re coming into the home stretch. Thank you very much for joining the call. As you can see, we produced very results in the fourth quarter and for the full year of 2017. And you can tell, we are confident as we come into 2018 that we have momentum in our businesses. Strategies are working. We expect to drive positive results for 2018. We believe we are going to continue to gain market share and grow share of wallet. Our top priorities are growing our core businesses and continuing to realize the revenue synergies from FirstMerit which are not capped at $100 million. So, we\u2019ve always said a 100 million plus. Our fourth quarter results demonstrate the core economic benefits of the acquisition of FirstMerit. We have achieved all of our long-term financial goals and there is more opportunity at hand in 2018 and beyond.","So, finally, I would like to include a reminder that there\u2019s just a unique and high level alignment between the Board and management, our colleagues and our shareholders. The Board and colleagues are collectively one of the largest shareholders in Huntington. We uphold the retirement requirements on certain shares which is very unique. We will continue to proactively manage risk and volatility. And we are appropriately focused on driving sustained, long-term performance.","So, I appreciate again your interest in Huntington. Thanks for joining us today, and have a great day.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today\u2019s conference.

My name is Tracy, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Huntington Bancshares First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","Thank you, Mr. Mark Muth, you may begin your conference.","Mark Muth","Thank you, Tracy, and welcome. I'm Mark Muth, Director of Investor Relations for Huntington. Copies of the slides, we will be reviewing, can be found on our IR website at www.huntington-ir.com or by following the Investor Relations link on www.huntington.com. This call is being recorded and will be available as a rebroadcast starting about one hour from the close of the call.","Our presenters today are Steve Steinour, Chairman, President and CEO; and Mac McCullough, Chief Financial Officer. Dan Neumeyer, our Chief Credit Officer, will also be participating in the Q&A portion of today's call.","As noted on Slide 2, today's discussion, including the Q&A period, will contain forward-looking statements. Such statements are based on information and assumptions available at this time and are subject to changes, risks and uncertainties, which may cause actual results to differ materially. We assume no obligation to update such statements. For a complete discussion of risks and uncertainties, please refer to this Slide and material filed with the SEC, including our most recent Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filings.","Let's get started by turning to Slide 3 and an overview of the financials. Mac?","Mac McCullough","Thanks, Mark, good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We're pleased to report another quarter of solid results and believe 2016 is off to a good start. Huntington's customer centric strategy continues to deliver consistent growth in market share and share of wallet through execution of our distinctive fair play philosophy, our welcome culture and our superior customer service. Disciplined execution of our strategy and well timed investments in our businesses over the past several years are producing solid results for our shareholders, our customers, our colleagues and our communities.","Slide 3 shows some of the financial highlights for the quarter. Earnings per common share of $0.20, was up 5% from the 2015 first quarter, while tangible book value per share increased 8% to $7.12. Return on tangible common equity was 11.9%, while return on assets was 0.96%. Core fundamental trends remain strong and reflect the benefit of our strategic investments over the past several years. Year-over-year revenue growth was 7%, comprised of 8% increase in net interest income and a 4% increase in non-interest income.","We continue to believe that our ability to deliver consistent top-line growth, despite the challenging interest rate environment distinguishes Huntington from our peers. We also believe that our disciplined investment strategy combined with a focus on achieving positive operating leverage on an annual basis is proving to be a key differentiator. While we achieved positive operating leverage for the quarter, non-interest expense increased 7% year-over-year reflecting our ongoing investments including 44 new in-store branches and digital and technology investments such as our new mortgage origination platform that is currently being piloted.","Our efficiency ratio for the quarter was 64.6%, which remains well above our long-term financial goal of 56% to 59%. We will continue to work to improve our operating efficiency organically by growing revenue faster than expense, but we also continue to expect that our recently announced acquisition of FirstMerit will yield meaningful improvement in our pro forma efficiency.","Turning to the balance sheet, average loan growth was 6% year-over-year, while average core deposit growth was 5%, continuing a seven quarter tend of year-over-year core deposit growth being greater than 5%. Overall, credit metrics remain solid. Criticized assets remain stable. We incurred only 7 basis points of net charge offs in the quarter as we continue to benefit from large commercial real estate recoveries.","Non-performing assets increased 23 basis points from the previous quarter with the majority of the increase centered in our oil and gas exploration and production and coal portfolios. Our capital ratios remained strong. Tangible common equity ended the quarter at 7.89%, up 7 basis points from year-end. While all regulatory capital ratios, except common equity Tier 1, increased meaningfully during the quarter due to the issuance of $400 million of perpetual preferred stock on March 21.","Slide 4 provides a summary income statement, including some additional details on our non-interest income and non-interest expense for the quarter. Relative to the first quarter of 2015, total reported revenue increased 7% to $754 million. Spread revenues accounted for the majority of the increase as net interest income increased 8% to $512 million. We benefited from 8% average earning asset growth partially offset by 4 basis points of net interest margin compression.","The NIM was negatively impacted by unfavorable mix shift on both sides of the balance sheet, most notably the increase in our low yielding LCR compliant securities in our earning assets and higher cost senior bank notes in our funding mix. We continue to remain disciplined in pricing of both loans and deposits. Fee increased 4% from the year ago quarter to $242 million primarily driven by continued customer acquisition gains and relationship deepening.","Highlights included a 13% increase in service charges on deposit accounts, and a 12% increase in card and payment processing income. We also faced some headwinds in the quarter in mortgage banking and trust service income. Mortgage banking income decreased 19% from the year ago quarter as a result of a 5% decline in origination volume, coupled with a $2 million decrease from net NSR activity. Trust services income declined 21% year-over-year primarily due to the sale of our funds management and servicing businesses at the end of last year.","Reported non-interest expense in the 2016 first quarter was $491 million, an increase of $32 million, or 7% from the year-ago quarter. This quarter's non-interest expense included one significant item: $6 million of merger and acquisition related expense from the pending FirstMerit acquisition. As detailed on Page 7 of the press release, non-interest expense adjusted for significant items in both quarters increased $29 million or 6% year-over-year.","In March, the FDIC announced the final rule approving the previously disclosed surcharge on banks with assets in excess of $10 billion, including Huntington. In our conference call last quarter, we started that the surcharge would negatively impact our FDIC insurance expense by approximately $13 million in 2016. Due to the delay and the implementation until July 1st, we now expect the negative impact will be approximately $7 million this year.","Slide 5 details the trends in our balance sheet mix. Average loans and leases increased $2.8 billion, or 6% year-over-year as most portfolios continue to experience year-over-year growth. Average securities increased $2.1 billion, or 17%, primarily reflecting growth in LCR complaint securities into a lesser extent growth in our direct purchase municipal securities and our commercial banking segment. We are currently above the 100% threshold for liquidity coverage ratio. Digging into the loan growth little deeper, average commercial and industrial loans grew $1.5 billion, or 8%, primarily driven by $0.8 billion increase in asset finance.","The quarter also benefited from continued momentum in auto floor plan and broad-based commercial lending. Average automobile loans grew $0.9 billion, or 11% from the year-ago quarter. Auto finance remains a core competency of Huntington and we're committed to this business and our dealer customers. The first quarter of 2016 represented the 9th consecutive quarter of more than $1 billion of automobile loan originations. We have achieved this by remaining absolutely consistent in our strategy, which is built around a credit model that is focused on prime and super prime borrowers and a business model of high touch and local delivery.","As detailed on Slide 46 and 47, in the appendix, our underwriting has not changed and our credit performance remains superior. Yields on the new auto paper rebounded slightly in the first quarter backup to around 3% compared to the 2.90% to 2.95% range in the fourth quarter. Recall yields last quarter were impacted by the normal seasonal mix shift towards new vehicle sales that occur in the fourth quarter as manufacturers try to drive yearly volume goals. While the first quarter's originations reflected a return to more normal, new used mix.","The auto portfolio continues to perform very well as expected the seasonal increases in delinquencies and charge-offs we experienced in the fourth quarter reversed course this quarter with delinquencies declining 26 basis points sequentially and net charge-offs declining 5 basis points. Further, if you compare our delinquencies and non-accrual loans with the year ago quarter, you will see they're essentially flat. Net charge-offs are up modestly year-over-year, but will remain well below the level to which we underwrite the portfolio.","Staying on Slide 5 and moving to the right side, average total deposits increased $2.9 billion or 5% over the year ago quarter including a $2.6 billion or 5% increase in average core deposits. We continue to see strong growth in demand deposits as average non-interest bearing demand deposits increased $1.1 billion, or 7% year-over-year, and average interest bearing demand deposits increased $1.6 billion or 26%. This growth reflects our continued focus on new customer checking household and commercial relationship account acquisition as well as relationship deepening. All of which are detailed on Slides 11 through 13 that Steve will discuss later.","We also continue to remix the consumer deposit base at a higher cost CDs into other less expensive deposit products. Average core CDs increased $0.5 billion, or 19%, year-over-year. Average total demand deposits accounted for 37% of non-equity funding in the 2016 first quarter, while money market and savings deposits accounted for a combined 38%.","By contrast, average core CDs accounted for only 3% of our non-equity funding in the quarter. Average total debt increased $2.1 billion, or 34%, as a result of five senior debt issuances over the past five quarters totaling $4.1 billion, including $1 billion issued in March of this year as well as the assumption of debts in the Huntington Technology Finance acquisition. The $1 billion senior debt issuance this quarter was a part of our normal funding strategy.","Slide 6 shows our net interest margin plotted against earning asset yields, interest bearing liability cost and other deposit cost. First quarter NIM decreased 4 basis points year-over-year, but increased 2 basis points from the previous quarter to 3.11%. This quarter, the net interest margin benefited from approximately 2 basis points of interest recoveries in the commercial real estate portfolio and another 1 basis point to 2 basis points in day count. Adjusting these benefits out of the first quarter margin, we expect another 2 basis points to 4 basis points of contraction in the second quarter, but remain comfortable reaffirming our previous guidance from last quarter that the net interest margin will remain above 3% for each quarter in 2016.","Slide 7 provides an update on our asset sensitivity positioning and how we manage interest rate risk. As shown in the chart on top, we estimate that net interest income would benefit by 3.6% if interest rates were to gradually ramp 200 basis points, in addition to increases already reflected in the current implied forward curve. This is an increase from what we estimated a quarter ago, as we recently updated our non-maturity deposit models, resulting in a reduction in the sensitivity of these deposits.","In addition, as we have discussed for some time, our asset swaps are beginning a period of steady amortization as disclosed in our 10-K. We also proactively terminated $1.9 billion of swaps in January taking advantage of volatility in the markets. As we have stated previously, our asset swap portfolio is a laddered portfolio. There are no cliffs looming on the horizon. These actions coupled with changes in our overall balance sheet mix drove the increase in modeled asset sensitivity.","As shown on the bottom right in a hypothetical scenario without the $5.8 billion of remaining asset swaps, the estimated benefit would approximate positive 5.4% in the up 200 basis point gradual ramp scenario. The chart on the bottom of the slide shows our $5.8 billion asset swap portfolio and $5.8 billion liability swap portfolio, including the respective average remaining lives and their impact on net interest income. The incremental benefit of swaps was $24 million in the 2016 first quarter, down from $29 million in the 2015 fourth quarter and $25 million in the year ago quarter.","Slide eight, shows the trends in our capital ratios. Tangible common equity increased 7 basis points sequentially to the 7.89%. All regulatory capital ratios improved meaning fully from the prior quarter end with the exception of common equity Tier 1 regulatory capital ratio, which declined slightly. Late in the quarter, we issued 400 million of 6.25 fixed rate non-cumulative preferred equity in order to take advantage of unusual market conditions and low interest rate environment to lock in low cost permanent capital. With this issuance, we are now more in line with our peers with respect to the amount of preferred equity in our capital structure, although as market conditions allow, you may see us further optimize our capital structure in the future relative to the Basel III rules.","Slide nine provides an overview of our loan loss provision, net charge-offs and allowance for credit losses. Credit performance remains solid and in line with our expectation. Criticized assets remain stable. The loan loss provision was $27.6 million in the first quarter compared to $8.6 million of net charge-offs. Net charge-offs represented 7 basis points of average loans and benefited from the previously mentioned large recovery and our commercial real estate portfolio.","As we've stated last quarter, we expect credit costs will gradually migrate back to more normalized levels particularly as recoveries from previously charged-off commercial real estate loans diminish. For 2016, however, we expect net charge-offs will range below our long-term expectations of 35 basis points to 55 basis points."," The ACL ratio ticked up one basis point to 1.34% of loans and leases, compared to 1.33% at the prior quarter end. The ratio of allowance to non-accrual loans decreased to 138% compared to 180% a quarter ago due to the uptick in ALs primarily within our oil and gas exploration and production and coal portfolios. We believe the allowance is appropriate and reflects the underlying credit quality of our loan portfolio.","Slide 10 shows trends in nonperforming assets, delinquencies and criticized assets. The chart in the upper left shows an increase in the non-performing asset ratio for the quarter to 102 basis points compared to 79 basis points a quarter ago. The increase again primarily reflected several oil and gas exploration and production credits into one large coal credit, which replaced a non-accrual during the quarter.","The chart on the upper right reflects our 90-day delinquencies, which remained essentially flat for the past year. The bottom left chart shows the criticized asset ratio, which also has remained relatively stable for the past few quarters.","Finally, the chart on the bottom right shows NPA inflows as a percentage of beginning period loans at 48 basis points for the first quarter reflecting the oil and gas exploration and production in coal nonaccrual credits mentioned previously.","All credit metrics fully reflect the results of the recently completed Shared National Credit exam. Results were consistent with past exams and then we had a handful downgrades as well as some upgrades. We processed all the downgrades. However, we only processed a few of the upgrades as we believe we either have more recent or more complete information on the relationship or we simply opted to take a more conservative stance. This practice would also be consistent with past exams.","Let me now turn the presentation over to Steve.","Steve Steinour","Thank you, Mac. Slide 11 shows the continued progress driving what we believe to be industry leading customer acquisition and associated revenue growth from both acquiring and building meaningful banking relationships with these customers. We owe these results to the unique combination of our Fair Play banking philosophy, our welcome culture, and execution of our optimal customer relationship or OCR focus on relationship banking. Since 2010, we've increased our consumer checking households and business checking relationships by 8% and 5% compound annual growth rates respectively.","These robust customer acquisition rates have allowed us to post the associated 5% and 9% compound annual growth rates in consumer and business revenue, which you can see in the two lower charts in the slide. You've heard me say this for a number of years and you'll hear me say it again in the future. Our focus remains on growing revenues. We continue to grow revenues despite the challenging environment.","Slide 12 and 13 illustrates the continued success of our OCR strategy and deepening our consumer and commercial relationships. Our strategy has remained consistent since 2010 and has built around two simple objectives gained market share and gained share of wallet. Our track record has illustrated and we will continue to demonstrate that this strategy results both in more loyal, satisfied and stickier customers, as well as revenue growth. As of the quarter end, almost 53% of our consumer checking households use six or more products and services, up from 50% a year ago.","Correspondingly, our consumer checking account household revenue was up $33 million or 12% year-over-year in the first quarter. Similarly, almost 48% of our commercial checking customers used four or more products or services at year end, up from 43% a year ago.","Commercial revenue increased $4 million or 2% year-over-year and you'll notice a step-up this quarter in the number of business relationships utilizing four or more products or services. This increase results from a recent change in pricing for certain of our treasury management products and related impact on the measurement of products and services utilized by these customers. We expect this will represent a one-time step-up.","Slides 14 and 15 provide a glimpse at some of the key economic data for our footprint. Slide 14 illustrates trends in the unemployment rates across our six core Midwestern States as well as other leading coincident and lagging economic data for the region. Unemployment rates in Ohio and Michigan are the lowest since the early 2000s and the unemployment rates in the four largest states in the footprint Michigan, Ohio, Indiana, and Pennsylvania are all at or below national unemployment rates.","Further, the higher rate in the Midwest is the highest in the nation. Over 50% of the net manufacturing jobs created in the country since the recession are in Ohio, Michigan, and Indiana. Finally, despite recent market volatility and global macroeconomic uncertainty, average consumer confidence in the Midwest is around what it was in 2002.","Slide 15 takes a \u2013 deeper look at the trends in unemployment rates in our largest metropolitan markets. Most of the large MSA\u2019s in the footprint were near 15 year lows for unemployment levels at the end of January. As you can probably gather from this data we remain bullish, on our core Midwestern footprint. The auto industry is an important component of the economy in our footprint, and it appears poised for another stellar year in 2016.","Our small and medium sized commercial customers continue to express confidence in their businesses. Real estate markets across the footprint are improving. There is a significant amount of economic activity in our footprint tied to higher education and healthcare. And I continue to believe the benefit of low energy prices, for consumers and manufacturers more than outweighs the isolated pockets of stress on business, within the energy sector in our footprint. Our SBA lending also remained quite robust, in fact March was our best month ever for SBA originations.","Turning to slide 16, while we're only one quarter into the year, slide 16 shows, that we're off to a good start to execute on our long-term financial goal of annual positive operating leverage. We expect, 2016 will represent our fourth consecutive year, to deliver positive operating leverage.","So, with that let's turn to slide 17 for some closing remarks and messages. We remain focused on delivering consistent through the cycle shareholder returns. For this strategy entails, reducing short-term volatility, achieving top-tier performance, over the long-term and maintaining our aggregate moderate to low risk profile throughout. Our value proposition, for both consumers and businesses, continue to drive industry-leading new customer acquisition.","We've successfully built a strong and recognizable consumer brand with differentiated products and superior customer service. We continue to execute our strategies and refine or react where necessary. We've invested and will continue to invest in our businesses particularly around enhanced sales managements, mobile and digital technologies, data analytics and optimizing our retail distribution network.","Importantly, we plan to continue to manage our expenses appropriately within our revenue outlook and we expect to grow revenue. We are optimistic on our core Midwest footprints local economies and the businesses and consumers within them. We are prudently managing certain industries or sectors, potentially impacted by market volatility and global macroeconomic uncertainty. However, we believe these risks remain well contained and the majority of our core consumer and small and medium size business customers enjoy a healthy near-term outlook.","We see no evidence of near-term deterioration or problem looming on the horizon. Customer sentiment remains positive and commercial loan utilization rates showed a slight increase for the fourth consecutive quarter. Pressure on our NIM will remain a modest headwind in the near-term. But we continue to expect that the NIM will remain above 3% throughout 2016. We expect to grow revenue despite these pressures consistent with our 4% to 6% long-term financial goal, excluding significant items and net event of MSR activity and obviously the impact of FirstMerit.","We'll continue to place ongoing investments in our businesses consistent with our revenue outlook and consistent with our long-term goal of annual operating positive leverage. We closely monitor our loan portfolio and given the absolute low level of our credit metrics in recent market and global economic volatility, we do expect some volatility and \u2013 in our credit metrics going forward. Anticipates that loan loss provisioning for both ourselves and the broader industry will gradually begin to return to more normalized levels.","So, let me stress, we do not see any material deterioration on the horizon or simply moving off cyclical lows and we'll gradually move back toward normal for both provisioning in net charge offs. We expect our net charge offs for the year will remain below our long-term expected range of 35 basis points to 55 basis points.","Next we always like to include a reminder that there is little alignment between the Board, Management, our employees and our shareholders. The Board and our colleagues are collectively the sixth largest shareholder of Huntington. We have holder retirement requirements on certain shares and are appropriately focused on driving sustained, long-term performance.","We're highly focused on our commitment, to being good stewards of shareholders and capital. And finally, before we move in to the Q&A period, I'd like to give you a quick update, on the status of the FirstMerit acquisition we announced earlier this year. We've filed our application with the regulators and anticipate that we will receive both regulatory and shareholder approval to allow us to close the transaction in the third quarter.","We also continue our integration and planning, we've made significant progress in our product and data mapping process, as well as our planning around the organizational structure. The more we get to know, the FirstMerit team, the quality and depth of their talent, and similarity of cultures, the more excited I get about this transaction and our ability to deliver on our commitments, as we come together.","So, I'll now turn it back over to Mark, so we can get to your questions.","Mark Muth","Operator, we'll now take questions. We ask that as a courtesy to your peers each person ask only one question, and one related follow-up and if that person has additional questions, he or she can add themselves back into the queue. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","At this time [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Ken Usdin","Thanks. Good morning.","Mac McCullough","Hi, Ken.","Ken Usdin","Good morning, everybody. I just wanted to follow-up on the credit side and hearing your points about not seeing much else, but expecting the normalization. This is the \u2013 your second quarter of a pretty meaningful reserve build and I think for specific reason, so I guess just the questions are, can you help us understand kind of what you think the core charge-offs if we \u2013 and the size of that recovery and then just your general premise around building reserves from here. Do you think you've kind of gotten at there for what you need as far as the energy and coal related?","Dan Neumeyer","Hey. Good morning. Ken, this is Dan. So, I think, the one thing this was a record quarter for us in terms of recoveries. So that 7 basis points charge-off is obviously very good performance, but it is driven by some really unusual \u2013 an unusual level of recovery so that is not going to continue. So if there is going to be one difference in the subsequent quarters, it's going to be a more normalized level of recovery, so that in and of itself will take the net charge-off number up, but we are not seeing anything on the horizon that leads us to conclude that there would be any notable changes other than that we've given guidance that we still expect to be below the 35 to 55, so I think that gives you a pretty good range of what we might see.","In terms of the energy build this quarter, we think we've been very conservative in identifying the issues that we about there we are well reserved on that portfolio. We've got our credit mark on that portfolio at 10%, which given the combination \u2013 the constitution of our portfolio, no energy services have invested big differentiator when we're looking at energy exposure. Ours is all E&P very well secured exposure. So even if you say, there is going to be continued low energy prices, we think that portfolio on a relative basis is going to hold up quite well.","Ken Usdin","Okay. Then just to follow up quickly then is just on reserving builds from here, more for growth or what if you think you've gotten the energy right, then what would be the base of seeing builds from here?","Dan Neumeyer","I think \u2013 I think it will be largely driven by portfolio growth, and then again we do point out always there is \u2013 there is always unevenness in the C&I portfolio, so you are going to have episodic movements here and there, but we are not seeing any significant movement. I think you see in our criticize asset number holding fairly steady. We still have in flows, but we have a lot of good resolutions as well. So I don't see any tremendous movement there either.","Ken Usdin","All right. Got it. Thank you.","Dan Neumeyer","Thanks, Ken.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Siefers, Sandler O'Neill and Partners. Your line is now open.","Scott Siefers","Good morning, guys.","Steve Steinour","Good morning, Scott.","Mac McCullough","Good morning, Scott.","Scott Siefers","I just wanted to ask just sort of an energy related question. So of the total increase, are you - you guys able to sort of bifurcate how much of that came from the coal versus the E&P side by any chance?","Steve Steinour","Yes. Absolutely we can and we do, do that. The coal was one transaction and actually it was not even performance related. This is a more of a \u2013 there is a lawsuit involved in it, so the coal deal actually is a low cost producer performing very well and we expect a good resolution to that particular situation.","Scott Siefers","Okay. This might make the same question little less relevant, but as you look at \u2013 you have said some understandable increase in nonperformers in the energy area, but based on guidance for the entire portfolio, lost content, of course, looks pretty low and still in the aggregate for everything. Just wondering, as you guys are thinking about the sort of stuff that you would keep on, on watch from the energy portfolio. When or how might actual lost content manifest itself just in the way you guys are thinking about things?","Steve Steinour","Yes. I mean, it certainly the potential for lost content increases the longer that we have that protected low energy phenomenon. So \u2013 but I'll say that the stressed analysis we do, there is still quite a bit of room between where we're at today and where we feel we would incur significant losses. So we do various stressing on the portfolio. Our sensitized case that we use is well below the strip case and we even do modeling that goes well below that and even under those scenario, this is going to be a very manageable series of events for us. Just, we have a very small portfolio \u2013 it's one-half of 1% of our entire portfolio for the overall impact. This is not going to be that dramatic.","Scott Siefers","Yes. Okay. Perfect. If I can sneak one last one in there, Mac you have said, so you guys disclosed the two basis points margin benefit from the CRE recovery, did you say two basis points benefit from day count, so in other words in total four basis points of kind of net benefit of which you would be forecasting the margin for the second quarter?","Mac McCullough","Scott, that's exactly the way to think about it.","Scott Siefers","Okay. All right, perfect. Thank you guys.","Steve Steinour","Thanks, Scott.","Mac McCullough","Thanks, Scott.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous Research. Your line is now open.","Geoffrey Elliott","Hello. Good morning. Thank you for taking the question. I wanted to ask about also \u2013 you sound pretty positive, but I guess looking at the year-on-year changes in net charge-offs to strip out some of the seasonality, but that has been a bit of an increase. So, can you talk about the normalization that you're seeing there and what makes you still pretty relaxed on auto credit?","Dan Neumeyer","Sure. This is Dan, again. So, one \u2013 I think we have to look at \u2013 we're looking at very low levels of charge-offs. So, I think if you look to a year ago, probably about 19 basis points and then most recent quarter up to about 28 basis points. That is a very low level of charge-offs and well below what we actually modeled. So, I think that's important. There is a bit of an effect in there from we\u2019ve talked about TCPA, which is the telephone consumer protection act, which limited our ability to make a calls to cellphones, that had a small incremental effect.","So, we probably have a couple of basis points of additional charge-offs that was in that number and that the impact of that will dissipate over time. But just as a reminder, our origination strategy on indirect auto has not moved at all. We continue to maintain the same FICO Scores, LTVs terms, it's a very dealer centric model and I think it is important, when we look at our portfolio relative to others. The distinction in terms of our focus on prime and super prime customers, when we expand in the different markets, which we do from time to time. We go in with more conservative origination criteria than for the book as a whole. So, we just feel we have been rock solid in our origination strategies and don't expect to see any significant movement. So, we remain very confident in our performance.","Geoffrey Elliott","Okay. And then just follow-up, there has been a decline in the Manheim in the last couple of months. What are you budgeting for used car prices and how do you think about that?","Steve Steinour","Yes. So, we've look \u2013 we obviously follow the Manheim closely, and I think their forecast called for the index to decline about 8% cumulatively over the next few years. And even with that adjustment, we don't see this moving the needle significantly in terms of our performance. I would point out that the mix of our vehicles is a little bit different than what industry average would be as well. When you focus on a high FICO borrower, when you have to take the vehicles back you tend to get a vehicle that is in better shape and having a higher resale value.","I think the mix of our book also has more trucks and SUVs in it, and those values tend to hold up better than vehicles as a whole. So, those factors also are going to aid us, so we feel very confident even though we know there will be some reduction in the Manheim because we've been at historically high levels for probably the last five years or six years.","Geoffrey Elliott","Great. Thank you very much.","Steve Steinour","Thanks, Geoff.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bob Ramsey with FBR. Your line is now open.","Kyle Peterson","Hey, good morning guys. This is actually Kyle Peterson speaking for Bob today. I had a question on mortgage banking, kind of your thoughts on that obviously it looks like part of \u2013 it was down partly due to kind of seasonal trends. But, notice it was comes down year-over-year as well, I'm not sure if you view that is mostly really to kind of the MSR impairment or I guess kind of how should we look at mortgage banking moving forward?","Mac McCullough","Yes. Kyle, this is Mac. So, I think if you take a look on a linked-quarter basis there was a fairly substantial decline, that's really \u2013 this can be explained by two things. One is the MSR impairment, which was $6 million to $7 million on a linked-quarter basis, and the other portion of the decline was just due to lower origination volume. So that \u2013 I think that explains linked-quarter pretty well and actually that's the same explanation for year-over-year it's MSR and lower origination. So we're pleased with origination volume where it is that currently. We do have this seasonal effects and also just the impact of the MSR valuation.","Kyle Peterson","Okay. Thank you. And yes, I guess just one other kind of I guess follow-up kind of modeling question. Is the merger related expense for the HBAN for the FirstMerit merger. Is that following into the other expense line item or kind of I guess where is that $6 million shaking up?","Mac McCullough","Yes. A fair amount of it's going to be in professional services in that line and other expense as well. So, that's \u2013 I think that\u2019s the way to think about it.","Steve Steinour","Kyle, that's broken out on page seven on the release. There is the table that will give you some guidance there.","Kyle Peterson","Okay. Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore. Your line is now open.","Steve Moss","Good morning. It's actually Steve Moss for John. I wanted to just touch based on the inflows to non-performing status, how much of the $240 million was for E&P?","Mac McCullough","E&P was about 40% of the inflows.","Steve Moss","Okay. And then in terms of also in the E&P credits in what basins are your E&P credits located?","Mac McCullough","Our entire portfolio is \u2013 it's broadly syndicated shared national credit, so the distribution tends to be very granular throughout the country, obviously would include the Permian basin which is probably one of the most profitable, but I would say it's very well diversified, no concentrations within the portfolio.","Steve Moss","Okay. Thank you very much.","Mac McCullough","Thanks, Steve.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ricky Dodd of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Ricky Dodd","Hi, everyone.","Steve Steinour","Hi, Ricky.","Ricky Dodd","I just had a quick follow-up on energy. Have you guys provided the dollar value as of period end for your total energy and coal portfolios?","Steve Steinour","The aggregate amount of the loans?","Ricky Dodd","That's right.","Steve Steinour","We've indicated that it's right around 5% of total loans.","Mac McCullough","0.5%.","Steve Steinour","I'm sorry \u2013 a big difference. Thank you. 0.5%.","Ricky Dodd","And then you said reserves on those loans are about 10%?","Steve Steinour","Yes. The credit mark, which on a go-forward basis will reference credit mark that takes into account charge-offs and reserves, but it's yes 10% is the number.","Ricky Dodd","Perfect, and then a quick follow-up on recoveries. I think eight of the past nine quarters you've seen some lumpy recoveries in the CRE portfolio. How should we be thinking about that going forward?","Steve Steinour","That there will be less.","Ricky Dodd","All right. Perfect. Thanks for the time.","Steve Steinour","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Barker of Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open.","Kevin Barker","Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions.","Steve Steinour","Hi, Kevin.","Mac McCullough","Hi, Kevin.","Kevin Barker","The order growth is very strong this quarter and what \u2013 usually the January and February usually seasonally pretty slow. How much of this growth is due to existing markets and how much of it was taking market share in the new markets that you're attempting to target?","Mac McCullough","Which portfolio?","Kevin Barker","Auto.","Mac McCullough","So it\u2019s still on the auto portfolio. So, we're stepping into the new market, as Dan mentioned very, very cautiously, we actually increased our standards and how we underwrite in newer markets.","Dan Neumeyer","Yes. And I think, in \u2013 of the year-over-year increase in originations, about 25% came from Illinois, North Dakota, South Dakota, which were our newest markets that we entered into.","Kevin Barker","So, roughly, 25% of your incremental was primarily due to the newer market, is that how you would categorize it?","Steve Steinour","Correct.","Kevin Barker","Then \u2013 and also, a follow-up on the balance sheet items. You obviously shifted gears and become more asset sensitive when you mentioned some of this last quarter and your NIM has increased this quarter. When we look forward, given your guidance for NIM to decline, how should we look at it, going into back half of the year? And then what your expectations are for the Fed increased rate?","Mac McCullough","So, starting with the last question first. I mean, we've budget in and continue to forecast 2016 assuming no rate increase. And under that scenario, which is the scenario that we use in order to provide the guidance for the year. As Scott pointed out, earlier, the 3.11% that we reported probably comes down about four basis points, due to four basis points. And whether that compression is been driven just due to the fact that we're adding the LCR compliant securities.","And then on the funding side, a lot of that is coming through on the debt side. So that results in some compression as we move. Throughout the year there is some additional compression that will take place on certain asset categories. But, again based on everything we know today and way the forecast looks for the remainder of the year, we do believe we stay above 3% in every quarter of 2016.","Kevin Barker","Okay. What would drive the additional compression from outside \u2013 is it just lower asset yields or other items that were push down and NIM in the back end.","Mac McCullough","Given the fact that we're at 100% or over 100% for LCR, it's going to be asset compression for the most part, just continued pricing pressure on commercial portfolio. But again, not material as we think about where we are today, and the guidance that were given for the rest of the year.","Kevin Barker","Thank you.","Mac McCullough","Thanks, Kevin.","Steve Steinour","Hey Mac, I want to clarification in Ricky\u2019s question, I didn't realize he asked about our exposure including coal, and oil and gas. And so when we take the E&P and the coal together it still less than 1% of revenues, but the half percent was in relation to just the E&P did not include coal, but our coal portfolio is actually about half of the size of E&P. So, it still well under 1% when we combine those. So, I just want to make that clarification.","Kevin Barker","Okay. Thanks again.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andy Stapp with Hilliard Lyons. Your line is now open.","Andy Stapp","Good morning.","Steve Steinour","Good morning, Andy.","Mac McCullough","Good morning, Andy.","Andy Stapp","What was driving the sequential increase and other non-interest income other than the general lumpiness that can occur in the side?","Mac McCullough","So, fourth quarter compared to the first quarter?","Andy Stapp","Yes, sequentially, yes.","Mac McCullough","So, on Table 6 of the press release, we actually show other non-interest income going down.","Andy Stapp","Right, it went down pretty substantially \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, yes, that's why I mean to say sequential decline\u2026","Mac McCullough","Yes, I think exactly.","Andy Stapp","Yes. I just wonder why it was driving that if that's a good run rate?","Steve Steinour","It\u2019s a model.","Mac McCullough","It's a bit difficult of lines of forecast.","Andy Stapp","Right.","Mac McCullough","There is a lot of [indiscernible] gains that go through there, there is leased income that goes through there. So, it is a bit lumpy in the scheme things, I think taking a look at just the quarterly progression over time and taking an average might be the best way to think about it.","Andy Stapp","Okay. And, what was your \u2013 what's your reserve or your credit marks on oil and gas versus coal, I want to ask that as well?","Mac McCullough","Actually, they are equal, 10%.","Andy Stapp","Okay. Okay. Great. Thank you.","Mac McCullough","Thanks, Andy.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Peter Winter with Sterne Agee. Your line is open.","Peter Winter","Good morning.","Mac McCullough","Hi, Peter.","Peter Winter","I had a question about the loan growth. So, average loans was pretty solid and then in the period was even stronger. So I was just wondering in terms of the monthly trend, did it start off a little bit slow with all the volatility and then pick up as the year \u2013 as the quarter moved on and that would carry over into the second quarter?","Mac McCullough","Peter, that's a very good conclusion, accurate conclusion, good analogy. And I think the volatility just had people paused as the quarter progressed more confidence emerged. And as we sit here today, our pipelines look reasonably good, going into the second quarter. And frankly they did at the end of the fourth quarter, again that volatility just created, I think a bit of a timing issue.","Peter Winter","Okay and just a quick follow-up. Steve, you mentioned on the FirstMerit, as you spend more time you feel better about the FirstMerit deal. I was just wondering if you could add some color to that?","Steve Steinour","Well we\u2019ve spent considerable amount of time with our team and their team. I mentioned we've gotten through much of the product matching, and mapping, and so the things that would be done early-stage for integration purposes are well underway, terrific cooperation and communication, and we continue to be very impressed with the quality of the people where \u2013 from FirstMerit that we have the pleasure of interacting with. So we had outlined a sequential integration plan when we announced the deal. We\u2019re certainly well on track with that and expecting to get approvals necessary to close in the third quarter.","Peter Winter","Okay. Thanks very much.","Steve Steinour","Thank you.","Mac McCullough","Thanks, Steve.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Joe Shea with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Joe Shea","Good morning. Just related to industry positioning, what's the incremental impact on our asset sensitivity positioning over the next few quarters as the swap book rolls off. And then just more broadly, is there a certain level of asset sensitivity that you are targeting over time, can you just walk us through how your thinking about overall positioning?","Mac McCullough","So, on the first question Joe, about 70% of our \u2013 of the margin benefit from our derivatives actually comes from the debt swaps. So, when you think about the impact of the asset swaps at about 30% of the impact and if you roll that forward, I think we see another $2.4 billion of the asset swaps coming off by the end of 2016, and the remainder come off basically by the end of 2017. That impact is completely manageable when you think about the quarter-over-quarter impact and how slow those are rolling off.","On the second question, we really don't have a target in terms of what we\u2019re looking for. We do think eventually it\u2019s going to be good to be asset sensitive. We\u2019re very comfortable with how we\u2019re positioned today, and how we're managing the balance sheet, with the swaps rolling off. And I think some of the changes that we've made in the non-maturity deposits we have seen the increase in asset sensitivity. But, again we\u2019re very comfortable with how the balance sheet is positioned and the outlook for interest rates as we go through 2016.","Joe Shea","Okay, very helpful. Thank you.","Mac McCullough","Thanks, Joe.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Terry McEvoy with Stephens. Your line is now open.","Terry McEvoy","Thanks. Can you just talk about the 2% C&I growth in the quarter maybe some industries that stand out, as well as maybe some markets that come to mind?","Steve Steinour","Well, our core markets have done well. So, Ohio and Michigan have had good growth. And we've also had growth on the assets \u2013 in the asset finance portfolio Terry. So like what we\u2019re seeing with how the year is progressing at least at this stage, and we're feeling much more confident with the market settling down and this volatility, abating from where it was in early January, February.","Terry McEvoy","And then on the equity you're talking about the efficiency ratio at 65%, above that 56% to 59% long-term target. Can you just remind us what FirstMerit will do to the efficiency ratio? I'm pretty sure it was addressed in the investor handout, once you get to the full run rate of cost saves?","Steve Steinour","Yes, we had it coming down 300 basis points to 400 basis points I think is what we disclosed in that investor presentation. So clearly a good opportunity for us when you think about 80% of their markets overlapping with ours and the number of consolidations that we're going to be able to achieve.","Terry McEvoy","Great. Thanks for helping me there. I appreciate it.","Mac McCullough","Thanks, Terry.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. Mr. Steve Steinour I'll turn the call over to you for closing remarks.","Steve Steinour","Thank you. We are off to a good start in 2016 as our first quarter results provided a solid base to build from. We delivered 7% year-over-year revenue growth, 3% net income growth and 5% growth in EPS and an 8% increase in tangible book value per share. So these are solid fundamentals and we're well-positioned to continue to deliver good results through the remainder of the year. You've heard me say this before and it remains true, our strategies are working and our execution remains focused and strong.","We expect to continue to gain market share and improve share wallet in both consumers and businesses. We expect to generate annual revenue growth consistent with our long-term financial goals and manage our continued investments in our businesses, consistent with the revenue environment and our long-term financial goal of positive operating leverage. We\u2019re optimistic on the economic outlook in our footprint and believe the gradual transition to more normalized credit metrics will be effectively managed.","Finally, I want to close by reiterating that our Board and this management team are all long-term shareholders and our top priorities include managing risk, reducing volatility and driving solid, consistent long-term performance.","So thank you for your interest in Huntington. We appreciate you joining us today. Have a great day everybody.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."],"11532":["Huntington Bancshares, Inc.

Steinour - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.","Thanks, Mark, and thank you to everyone for joining the call today. As always, we appreciate your interest and support. We had a really solid second quarter as we continue to build momentum and deliver high-quality earnings. We reported net income of $355 million and earnings per share of $0.30, increases of 31% and 30%, respectively, over the second quarter of 2017.","Profitability ratios were very good and improving with return on common equity of 13.2% and return on tangible common equity of 17.6%. The average loan increase was strong at 7% versus the second quarter of 2017 and 8% annualized versus the first quarter of 2018.","Our loan growth was driven by disciplined broad-based growth in both commercial and consumer loans. We're pleased with our second quarter efficiency ratio of 57% driven by 4% year-over-year revenue growth and continued expense discipline.","Our organic growth, along with the successful integration of the FirstMerit, provides scale which will allows for continued meaningful investments in extending our customer experience advantage through targeted investments in both people and technology, all while delivering positive operating leverage. The franchise continues to perform well on many fronts, allowing us to make the investments that we needed to compete at the highest levels of the industry as a result of the focused execution of our strategies.","We're very pleased with the recent DFAST and CCAR stress test results which provided important industry comparisons. Now, Huntington's organic capital generation, as illustrated by the profitability metrics that I just referenced, is a significant competitive advantage for the company and is a direct result of our successful acquisition and integration of FirstMerit.","On the credit side of the equation, our nine-quarter cumu loss as a percentage of total loans in a severely adverse scenario ranked third-lowest among traditional commercial banks. Our performance in the Fed's nine-quarter cumulative loan loss estimates in a severely adverse stress scenarios over the past four years, where we have never ranked lower than fourth, clearly reflects our relatively strong and consistently disciplined risk management.","Combined, these results highlight our ability to generate strong earnings and industry-leading profitability. We remain committed to our aggregate moderate- to low-risk appetite, which we put in place eight years ago. And as a reminder, we've reinforced the importance of these standards by requiring about the top 800 officers of the company to comply with Holt's retirement restrictions on their equity awards.","I'd also like to take this opportunity to discuss the performance of the Auto Finance business in the stress test, particularly in light of the Fed's comments earlier this year stating that they intended to stress auto portfolios heavily.","The Fed's black box remains opaque. However, we know that our other consumer portfolios' severely adverse stress scenario losses which includes the super prime indirect auto portfolio, we're among \u2013 we're the fifth best among the traditional commercial banks.","Within the company-run portion of DFAST, our indirect auto portfolio remained profitable in every quarter of the severely adverse stress scenario again this year. In fact, our indirect auto and auto dealer floor plan portfolios combined are the two best-performing portfolios in our entire loan portfolio in the stress test. Now this highlights the high-quality, low-risk nature of our super prime-focused indirect auto portfolio along with our dealer centric floor plan businesses.","Reflecting the power of the FirstMerit acquisition, we were one of the few regional banks to see our stressed total capital increase from the 2017 CCAR process despite the more difficult Fed scenario in 2018. Consistently high capital generation governed by strong risk management is highly correlated to the creation of shareholder value in our industry. Our performance in the 2018 CCAR process clearly indicates that we're on the right track.","We materially increased our total payout in 2018 with quarterly dividend increasing 27% from $0.11 to $0.14 per share. This year will represent the eighth consecutive year of an increased dividend. The board also approved the repurchase of about $1.1 billion of common stock over the next four quarters. And consistent with our CCAR capital plan, we intend to frontload about three-quarters of the buyback into 2018, including the announced intention to enter into an accelerated share repurchase program for approximately $400 million of common stock this quarter.","We understand prudent capital allocation is essential to delivering strong returns to our shareholders. The 2018 capital plan actions are consistent with our stated capital priorities which are to fund organic growth, first; increase our quarterly dividend, second; and finally, other uses including the return of capital via share repurchases.","At this time we do not view traditional commercial bank acquisitions as being attractive, as potential candidates are not meeting our valuation expectations. Now as Mac has stated on previous occasions, we believe our earnings power, capital generation and risk management discipline will support higher dividends including a higher dividend payout ratio over time.","As we've briefly outlined on slide 3, we developed Huntington's strategies with a vision of creating a high performing regional bank and delivering top quartile through the cycle shareholder returns. Our profitability metrics are amongst the best in the industry and we have built sustainable competitive advantages in our key businesses that we believe will drive continued high performance in the future.","We continue to make meaningful, long-term investments in our businesses, particularly around our highly-engaged colleagues and customer experience, enabled by technology and particularly digital technology to drive organic growth. We're very pleased with how we're positioned and the opportunities ahead.","Slide 4 illustrates our long-term financial goals which were approved by the board in the fall of 2014 as part of our strategic planning process. As a reminder, these goals were originally set with a five-year time horizon in mind and we fully expect to achieve these goals this year on a reported GAAP basis, two years ahead of the original expectation.","Our second quarter efficiency ratio was near the low end of our long-term goal as a result of our expense discipline and focus on revenue growth while continuing to invest in our businesses. We're on pace again to deliver our annual goal of positive operating leverage, which will represent our sixth consecutive year of doing so.","Our credit metrics are simply excellent. On our second quarter losses were the 16th consecutive quarter where net charge-offs remained below our average through the cycle target range. Our 17.6% return on tangible common equity positions Huntington as a top-performing regional bank. And these results demonstrate that our strategies are working and will continue to drive Huntington forward.","Now, let's turn to slide 5 to review 2018 expectations and to discuss the current economic and competitive environment in our markets. The local economies across our eight-state footprint continue to perform well and we remain optimistic on the near-term outlook. Unemployment rates remain near historical lows and we continue to see meaningful labor shortages in several footprint markets such as Columbus, Indianapolis and Grand Rapids.","The Midwest, in fact, has the highest job opening rate in the nation so far in 2018, reflecting the dynamic region for potential job growth; the most dynamic region for potential job growth of the four major regions in the country according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics' May JOLTS survey. As shown on the slide in the appendix, the Philadelphia Fed's state-leading indicator indices where our footprint point toward a favorable economic environment for the remainder of 2018. Most of the states are expected to see an acceleration in economic activity over the next six months. Four of our states, including Ohio, are expected to grow significantly faster than the nation.","And while trade and tariff issues are creating some uncertainty in specific industries, we've not yet seen an impact on our customer base. We continue to have conversations with our clients and they remain optimistic for their businesses and the region, in large part reflecting the positive impact of federal tax reform and the overall strength of the economy. We are seeing broad-based commercial loan growth driven by increased capital expenditures including planned expansions.","Our loan pipelines remained steady and moving to 2018 (11:15), we expect full-year average loan growth in the range of 5.5% to 6.5%. And based on our current auto pricing strategy, we no longer expect to do an auto securitization this year.","Full-year average deposit growth is expected to be 3.5% to 4.5%, while full-year growth in average core deposits is expected to be 4.5% to 5.5%. We expect full-year revenue growth of 5% to 6%. We project the GAAP NIM for the full-year will expand 2 basis points to 4 basis points compared to 2017 and we expect both the core and GAAP NIM will be up modestly in the third quarter of 2018.","We remain on track to deliver positive operating leverage for the sixth consecutive year. We expect a 3% to 4% decrease in non-interest expense on a GAAP basis. And our expected efficiency ratio range is 55.5% to 56.5%, in line with our year-to-date results and an improvement from the full-year 2017 efficiency ratio of 61%.","We anticipate the net charge-offs will remain below our average through the cycle target of 35 basis points to 55 basis points. And our expectation for the effective tax rate for the remainder of the year is in the 15.5% to 16.5% range.","Looking beyond 2018, we continue to make meaningful progress on the new three-year strategic planning process we kicked off in the first quarter. Our past two strategic plans significantly advanced the company's financial performance and competitive positioning. To continue this momentum, our areas of focus for the 2018 planning process are top-line revenue growth, capital optimization and business model evolution incorporating expected disruption. And we're fortunate to be in a position to build on the strong foundation of our previous strategic plan, which have positioned us as an industry leader in customer experience.","We're focused on extending our customer experience advantage through a series of initiatives coming out of this year's strategic process that will allow us to improve customer acquisition while reducing customer attrition and deepen relationships with our customers.","As always, our board of directors is highly engaged in the process, meeting for the last \u2013 for two days, just last week, to be followed up with a three-day board offsite in September to further refine a decision on the (13:48) new strategic plan.","As we've stated previously, another important outcome of the strategic planning process will be new long-term financial goals for the company. We expect to be in a position to communicate those goals later this year.","So, before I turn it over to Mac, I want to personally thank everyone who participated in our recent investor and analyst survey. We really appreciate hearing your thoughts on where we've met your expectations and as importantly, where we have opportunities to improve. The survey results are extremely valuable to us and to our board as we continue to work through our strategic planning process. As always, Mark and the IR team are available to anyone that didn't participate but would like to share your thoughts or concerns with us or the board.","So, Mac, let me now ask you to provide an overview of the financials.","Howell D. McCullough III - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.","Thanks, Steve. Slide 6 provides the highlights of the second quarter results. As Steve mentioned, we had a good second quarter. It was also a clean quarter, as for the third quarter in a row, there were no significant items other than the implementation of tax reform in the fourth quarter of 2017. We reported earnings per common share of $0.30, up 30% over the year ago quarter. The year ago quarter included a $0.03 per share reduction due to the FirstMerit integration related significant items.","Return on assets was 1.36%. Return on common equity was 13.2%; and return on tangible common equity was 17.6%. We believe all three of these metrics distinguish Huntington among our regional bank peers. Our efficiency ratio for the quarter was 56.6%. Tangible book value per share increased to 2% sequentially and 8% year-over-year to $7.27 per share.","On slide 7, total revenue was up 4% from the year ago quarter. Net interest income was up 5% year-over-year due to a 5% increase in average earning assets. The non-interest income increased 3% year-over-year, reflecting ongoing household acquisition and execution of our Optimal Customer Relationship or OCR strategy. While both mortgage and SBA originations were higher year-over-year, compression in secondary market spreads and mortgage banking and a higher mix of construction SBA originations, which lengthens the funding cycle for SBA loans, continue to impact these fee categories.","Non-interest expense decreased 6% year-over-year, reflecting $50 million of significant items expensed in the year ago quarter related to the integration of FirstMerit versus none in the current quarter. Expenses were up versus the prior quarter, driven by the timing of compensation associated with long-term incentives and seasonally higher marketing expense. For a closer look at the income statement details, please refer to the analyst package and the press release.","Turning to slide 8, average earning assets grew 5% from the second quarter of 2017. This increase was driven by a 7% increase in average loans and leases. Average C&I loans increased 3% year-over-year with growth centered in middle market, asset finance, energy and corporate banking. On a linked quarter basis, average C&I loans increased 2% or 7% annualized, with broad-based growth in middle market, asset finance, energy and specialty banking.","Average commercial real estate loans were up 4% year-over-year while flat on a linked quarter basis as we have strategically tightened commercial real estate lending specifically in multi-family, retail and construction to remain consistent with our aggregate moderate- to low-risk appetite and to ensure appropriate returns on capital.","Average auto loans increased 8% year-over-year as a result of consistent and disciplined loan production. Originations totaled $1.6 billion for the second quarter of 2018, down 2% year-over-year. We have been consistently increasing auto loan pricing, which slowed originations while optimizing revenue.","The average new money yield on our auto originations was 4.22% in the quarter, up from 3.88% in the first quarter. Average RV and marine loans increased 31% year over year, reflecting the success of our expansion of the business into 17 new states over the past two years. Linked quarter growth was 30% annualized driven by normal seasonality.","Average residential mortgage loans increased 21% year-over-year, reflecting continued strong demand for mortgages across our footprint, as well as the benefit of ongoing investment in former FirstMerit geographies, particularly Chicago. As typical, we sold the agency qualified mortgage production in the quarter and retained jumbo mortgages and specialty mortgage products.","Turning the attention to the chart on the right side of the slide, average total deposits increased 4% from the year-ago quarter, including a 4% increase in average core deposits and a 6% increase in period end core deposits.","Moving to slide 9, our net interest margin was 3.29% for the second quarter, down 2 basis points from the year-ago quarter and down 1 basis point linked quarter.","During the first half of 2018, we took a number of actions to position the balance sheet for higher interest rates, including the origination of approximately $3 billion of attractively priced fixed rate CDs through our branch network. We also closed out approximately $3 billion of pay-floating swaps on fixed rate long-term debt and issued $1.25 billion of fixed rate, long-term debt that was swapped back to floating with an average weighted maturity of 4.6 years. The net sum of these actions made our balance sheet more asset-sensitive and will help better manage our deposit beta over the next 12 to 18 months.","In addition, the second quarter of 2018 reflects the inflection point of balance sheet growth and core net interest margin improvement combined with runoff of purchase accounting accretion, allowing for expansion of our GAAP reported net interest margin to expand going forward.","As Steve mentioned in his comments, we expect the GAAP reported net interest margin for full-year 2018 to expand 2 to 4 basis points over the full-year GAAP reported net interest margin for 2017. This would mean approximately 3 to 6 basis points of improvement in the GAAP reported net interest margin for each of the next two quarters.","Purchase accounting accretion contributed 8 basis points to the net interest margin in the second quarter of 2018 compared to 15 basis points in the year-ago quarter. After adjusting for purchase accounting accretion in both quarters, the core NIM was 3.22% versus 3.16% in the second quarter of 2017. Growth in core net interest margin over the past year has more than offset the benefit in purchase accounting accretion. Slide 29 in the appendix provides information regarding the scheduled impact of FirstMerit purchase accounting for 2018 and 2019.","On the earning assets side, our commercial loan yields increased 41 basis points year-over-year, while consumer loan yields increased 16 basis points. Our deposit costs remained well contained with total interest bearing deposits of 59 basis points for the quarter, up 28 basis points year-over-year. Consumer core deposits were up 14 basis points year-over-year and commercial core deposits were up 25 basis points.","On a linked quarter basis, the core NIM was unchanged at 3.22%. Average earning asset yields increased 16 basis points, including a 26-basis-point increase in commercial loan yields and a 9-basis-point increase in consumer loan yields.","On the liabilities side, the rate paid on interest-bearing deposits increased 16 basis points. Day count negatively impacted the net interest margin by 1 basis point on a linked-quarter basis. Our CD strategy negatively impacted the NIM by 1 basis point and derivative ineffectiveness on debt swaps had a negative impact of 3 basis points.","Moving to slide 10, our cycle-to-date deposit beta remains low at 24% through the second quarter of 2018. While our CD funding strategy negatively impacted our cycle-to-date deposit beta by 2 basis points, we are better positioned for continued higher rates due to the strategy.","As we told you last quarter, overall deposit pricing remains rational in our markets. Assuming one additional rate increase in 2018, our current forecast assumes an incremental deposit beta of approximately 50% for calendar year 2018, driven by the shift in customer preferences to more rate-sensitive products, including money markets and CDs.","Slide 11 illustrates the continued strength of our capital ratios. Tangible common equity ended the quarter at 7.78%, up 37 basis points year-over-year. Common equity Tier 1 ended the quarter at 10.53%, up 65 basis points year-over-year.","Moving to slide 12, credit quality remained strong in the quarter. Consistent prudent credit underwriting is one of Huntington's core principles and our financial results continue to reflect our disciplined approach to risk management and our aggregate moderate- to low-risk appetite.","We booked provisional expense of $56 million in the second quarter, including $8 million of allowance for unfunded loan commitments, compared to net charge-offs of $28 million. The loan loss provision expense in the quarter reflected the strong loan growth and continued migration of the acquired FirstMerit portfolio into the originated portfolio. As a reminder, our provision expense has exceeded net charge-offs in 11 out of the past 12 quarters while driving material earnings power improvement.","Net charge-off represented an annualized 16 basis points of average loans and leases which remained below average through-the-cycle target range of 35 to 55 basis points. Net charge-offs were down 5 basis points from the prior quarter and the year ago quarter. As usual, there is additional granularity on charge-offs by portfolio in the analyst package in the slides.","The allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of loans increased 1 basis point linked quarter to 1.02% and coverage of non-accrual loans was 197%. The allowance for credit losses as a percentage of loans increased 2 basis points linked quarter to 1.15%.","Turning to slide 13, overall asset quality metrics remained near cyclical lows and some quarterly volatility is expected given the absolute low level of problem loans. The non-performing asset ratio decreased 2 basis points sequentially to 57 basis points. The criticized asset ratio decreased 11 basis points from 3.60% to 3.49%.","Slide 14 highlights Huntington's strong position to execute on our strategy and provide consistent through-the-cycle shareholder returns. The graph on the top left quadrant represents our continued growth in pre-tax pre-provision net revenue as a result of the focused execution of our core strategies. The strong level of capital generation positions us well to fund organic growth in the future and return capital to our shareholders, consistent with our capital priorities.","The top right chart highlights the well-balanced mix of our loan and deposit portfolios. We are both a consumer and a commercial bank and believe the diversification of the balance sheet will serve us well over the cycle.","Our DFAST stress test results in the bottom left, which Steve discussed earlier, highlight our disciplined enterprise risk management. Finally, the bottom right demonstrates Huntington's strong capital position.","As we've returned to the key messages on slide 15, let me turn the presentation back over to Mark for Q&A","Mark Muth - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.","Jessie, we will now take questions. We ask that, as a courtesy to your peers, each person ask only one question and one related follow-up. And then if that person has additional questions, he or she may add themselves back into the queue. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. Thank you. Our first question is coming from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC","Thanks.","Stephen D. Steinour - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.","Good morning, Ken.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC","Good morning, guys. Hey, Mac, thanks for the color on the expectation for how the NIM should traject in the second half. I was wondering that's a pretty big step-up, 3 basis points to 6 basis points per quarter. Can you help us understand the \u2013 literally the \u2013 separate the left side and right side of the balance sheet and where that will be driven from?","Howell D. McCullough III - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.","So, Ken, I think a number of things will impact going forward. I do think we're being more aggressive on asset pricing. We've increased pricing in indirect auto. We've increased pricing in boat and RV. We've increased pricing in residential mortgage and we continue to be very disciplined and appropriately priced on the commercial portfolio. So we continue to see good expansion there, in particular, as we take some of these pricing actions.","I think on the liability side, given the CD strategy that we put in place in really the middle of the first quarter of this year, we did expect to see some accelerated deposit costs. We also expected to see the loan growth that we've been seeing. So we wanted to make sure that we got ahead of that with core funding.","We feel very good about the product that we put on the books. We've had very, I would say, good reception from our customer base, good execution by the retail branches in terms of raising about $3 billion to-date. And we do think that longer term that's going to position us well as interest rates continue to rise. We should see this help us both with asset sensitivity and with the deposit beta as going forward.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC","Okay. And as a follow-up, maybe you can also help us understand your reinvestment yields on new securities. I know you're changing the composition of the book, but versus the 271 basis points (28:33), what are you putting on stuff on? And on the right \u2013 lower right side, is there anything going on in the long-term debt line that should also revert relative to the big spike you saw in the cost on that line this quarter? Thanks a lot, Mac.","Howell D. McCullough III - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.","Yeah. So, we are not reinvesting into the security portfolio at this point in time. We're going to continue to run that down through the end of the year, basically not reinvesting cash flow. If you think about where we started the year to where we're going to end the year, the securities portfolio would be down about $1.8 billion. You need to cut through the noise because we do have some municipal loans that are counted as securities that are growing in that book. But basically, the pure investment security portfolio will be down $1.8 billion by the end of the year. We'll start to reinvest in 2019, but we're in really good shape from an LCR perspective right now and we're going to continue to run that down.","We did issue some long-term debt. We did issue the $1.25 billion, $500 million of that was seven-year and $750 million was three-year. We did swap that to floating but we likely will have another issuance of debt later this year.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC","All right. Thanks a lot, Mac.","Howell D. McCullough III - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks, Ken.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of John Pancari with Evercore. Please proceed with your question.","John Pancari - Evercore Group LLC","Morning.","Howell D. McCullough III - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.","Morning, John.","John Pancari - Evercore Group LLC","On your full-year 2018 outlook, I know you kind of bumped up the midpoint of your revenue expectation. You bumped down the midpoint of your expense expectation a bit versus previously. But the midpoint of your efficiency ratio guidance is unchanged despite tweaking the tails a bit. So why not see more of a move in the midpoint of that range? Thanks.","Howell D. McCullough III - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.","Yeah. I think basically the ranges would allow us to calculate out to the range of the efficiency ratio based upon the mix of revenue and expense, feel very comfortable with the range that we provided across all those categories. We did tighten them somewhat significantly in this guidance. But basically, within those ranges, those are the efficiency ratios that we feel comfortable with.","John Pancari - Evercore Group LLC","Okay. So, not meaningful enough really to move the midpoint?","Howell D. McCullough III - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.","Yeah. I think that's the way to think about it. I mean, we likely were this tight in the range when you think about prior guidance.","John Pancari - Evercore Group LLC","Got it. Got it. Okay. And then separately, on the betas, I know that part of that jump up in the beta cumulatively this quarter was from the CD program. How do you think about next quarter? And I know you are indicating you're expecting an incremental beta of about 50% through the back half of the year. How \u2013 what do you view your terminal beta as well? At what point do you think \u2013 or at what level do you see the terminal getting to?","Howell D. McCullough III - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.","So, the 50% for 2018, feel very comfortable with that. That actually might be a little bit high but I would say not materially. And going forward, we continue to think that we're going to be continuing to see deposit betas increase. I'm just not sure at this point in the cycle as we think about the rate increases that are coming that we're going to see materially different performance when you think about incremental 50% in 2019 based upon the rate increases that we see coming through.","John Pancari - Evercore Group LLC","Okay. All right. Thank you.","Howell D. McCullough III - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Ricky Dodds - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey, guys. It's actually Ricky Dodds from Matt's team.","Howell D. McCullough III - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.","Hey Ricky.","Ricky Dodds - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Just wanted to touch on loan growth. You saw some good strong growth in the commercial book. And I'm wondering if you could sort of flesh that out a little bit more, just what are customers saying? Is there an uptick in investment spend and just your general sense as to the climate out there among corporate clients?","Daniel J. Neumeyer - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.","Yeah. Ricky, this is Dan. I would say that we still have a strong pipeline. I think our customer base, overall, is fairly optimistic. I think what you saw this quarter, we had good diversification in the various categories. If you recall, last year, corporate banking, they had big headwinds with bond issues taking out loans. I think that phenomenon has really led up and we're gaining some traction in the large corporate space. Some of our specialty businesses have had good results. Our energy book, which \u2013 our E&P book had always been very modest. It still is of a modest size, so we've had some good growth there because we like the structure and the pricing.","Middle market has seen good growth. So, it's broad and it's diversified. And so, still very positive. Some headwinds out there, we believe, from the trade talk. While I don't think its impacted customers outlook yet that is something we're keeping an eye on.","Ricky Dodds - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks. And maybe just a follow-up on the boat, RV lending piece. Obviously, you've seen some pretty nice pick-up there. Just wondering how big can that become over time. And do you guys have sort of a limit on capital as to how big that can grow in the out years?","Daniel J. Neumeyer - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.","Yeah. So, given the size of the portfolio, we started very small, so there is room for growth, but we have established a concentration limit. And so, we like the business but the growth is going to be controlled. We're now in 34 states. I don't see that growing in the near-term. But when you look at what we're originating, very high FICO. The customer profile remains very strong. And so, we do have room to grow, but we have capped that growth internally.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks. Good morning.","Howell D. McCullough III - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.","Morning, Ken.","Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Can you just elaborate a little bit, the change that you guys have made to make your balance sheet a little more asset sensitive, I guess, can you just walk through the decision process? Why make that decision now versus a quarter or two quarters ago? Thanks.","Howell D. McCullough III - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.","So, Ken, we analyze the situation weekly. We spend a lot of time in ALCO, sub-ALCO, a lot of committees taking a look at the position, looking at different options that we can take. We basically made the call on the CD strategy in the first quarter because we became more convinced that we were going to see rates rise from here, more probable than what we might have thought in 2017, and started to put those deposits on, as I mentioned, because we also saw the loan growth coming at us.","In terms of what we did with the debt swaps, we did contemplate taking those off earlier to become more asset-sensitive. We were doing other things along the way to become more asset-sensitive. In general, we feel pretty comfortable with where we are. We're about 6% and that's a 200-basis-point ramp. So we don't want to get ahead of the situation. We don't want to fall behind the situation but we feel very comfortable with where we are.","Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Understood. And then, my follow-up, in terms of capital return obviously, in my view, I think you're demonstrating your willingness to be more aggressive or as aggressive as you can be in terms of returning capital. Would you consider sort of a mid-year resubmission to ask for more capital return or given the environment and kind of given your capital ratios, are you completely comfortable sort of where you're at with this \u2013 with the current $1 billion authorization? Thanks.","Howell D. McCullough III - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.","So, we're targeting at 9% to 10% CET1. We have had better asset growth relative to what we submitted in the CCAR plan. So, on a risk-weighted asset basis, we're a little bit higher than what we expected but still very comfortable and very \u2013 I would say higher in that 9% to 10% range.","I think we just have to continue to see how the economy progresses. I think we have to see what happens with the interest rate environment and make that decision as we take the various factors into consideration. We do think that our 9% to 10% CET1 target positions us well relative to the peer group. We do see the peer group bringing CET1 levels down. So we have to take all those things into consideration when we decide if we'll do that kind of in a midyear process.","Stephen D. Steinour - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.","There's also Federal Reserve action, Ken, that's expected as a result of the recent legislation for banks our size. And the timetable for that's not clear but it's intended to be within 18 months. Hopefully it's sooner and that'll give us some guidance.","Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","All right. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Scott Siefers with Sandler O'Neill. Please proceed with your question.","R. Scott Siefers - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Morning, guys.","Stephen D. Steinour - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.","Hey, Scott.","Howell D. McCullough III - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.","Hey, Scott.","R. Scott Siefers - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Hey. Mac, maybe I was hoping you could expand a little on your thoughts on the competitive dynamics in both the auto and marine, RV businesses. I mean you guys have clearly had some success raising prices in both. And I guess just as I look at them, auto, you've had some larger players sort of deemphasizing that business, which presumably is good for you guys, but then marine, RV maybe some newer entrants getting in. So, just hoping you could update your thoughts on how the competitive dynamic is in each of those businesses.","Howell D. McCullough III - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.","So, I'll start and maybe Steve or Dan want to add to it, but I think in the auto space, we're very well positioned with our customers who are the auto dealers. I mean we've been in this space for over 60 years. We provide a high level of service when you think about the response time, when you think about same-day funding. We do some things that other banks just don't do. And I think that really puts us in a very strong relationship position with those dealers.","We're not changing our risk appetite as it relates to this business, we're super fine. And we do think that we can optimize the balance sheet, optimize revenue by increasing pricing in the indirect auto space and that's what we've been doing to the point where we don't need a securitization this year in order to stay our limits. So, we think that's just smart balance sheet and capital optimization. And we believe that we've got the pricing power and the relationships to be able to do that in the indirect auto space.","But marine and RV, there really are six major players nationally in that business. It's probably not as dependent on technology as the indirect auto space might be. But again it comes down to the relationships that you have and be in there to be able to service those dealers. It's a space where we're going to continue to make investments and we'll likely bring some additional technology into that space, but we feel that just given our market share and given our position, we do have some pricing power. And part of it also is the level of customer service that we provide that allows the actions to take place.","R. Scott Siefers - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","All right. Perfect. Thanks. And then can I have just one sort of piggyback question on the margin guidance. So, when you talk about the GAAP margins being up a couple basis points versus the 2017 number. Are you using the 330 basis points (41:14) FTE margin for full-year 2017 or are you not including the FTE adjustment?","Howell D. McCullough III - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.","We always use the FTE.","R. Scott Siefers - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Okay. Sorry. I figured as much, but just want to make sure...","Howell D. McCullough III - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.","Yeah. Good question. Good question.","R. Scott Siefers - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Okay. Perfect. Thank you, guys, very much.","Howell D. McCullough III - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.","Thanks, Scott.","Op: Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Steven Alexopoulos with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Steven Alexopoulos - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, good morning, everybody.","Howell D. McCullough III - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.","Hey, Steve.","Steven Alexopoulos - JPMorgan Securities LLC","On the deposit side, what was the term and cost of the CDs that you guys added in the quarter? And is that strategy of building these out continuing in the third quarter?","Howell D. McCullough III - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.","Yes. So we're basically somewhere between 19 and 26 months, and the rates between 2.20% and 2.50% (42:10) is the way to think about it. We are continuing with the campaign and the activity. And I would say we've been averaging about $600 million a month in production pretty consistently.","Steven Alexopoulos - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. That's helpful. I'm curious, is this (42:31) optimism has been really strong in your footprint, but regarding the uncertainty around tariffs, is this impacting your commercial loan pipelines at all? What are you hearing from your customers on that front?","Daniel J. Neumeyer - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.","Yeah. So, I would say at this point, it is not impacting the pipelines, but obviously we'll have to watch the pull-through rate, and if sentiment changes, the longer this goes on. Right now, as I mentioned before, I think our customer base, they're monitoring the situation, they're cautionary, but still going ahead with plans that they've had in place for investment. So we haven't seen the impact at this point. I think the outlook still remains pretty positive.","Steven Alexopoulos - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks for taking my questions.","Howell D. McCullough III - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.","Thanks, Steve.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Jon Arfstrom with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Jon Arfstrom - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks. Good morning, guys.","Howell D. McCullough III - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.","Hey, Jon.","Jon Arfstrom - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Just back on deposits, can you touch a little bit up on the consumer deposit growth for the quarter? I guess, one of the numbers that stood out was the non-interest bearing demand growth and curious what drove that? And if you could maybe tie that into the customer acquisition and reduced attrition comment that you talked about in your longer term plans?","Howell D. McCullough III - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.","Sure, Jon. So, I think we continue to be, I think, advantaged and strong in terms of household acquisition on the consumer side. There is some seasonality in the second quarter that actually worked against us but we continue to have good new account origination. I think that's a big driver of it. And I think also, being able to get deeper into the FirstMerit book of business has been helpful as well. But we haven't published statistics around OCR and some of the household acquisition that we've seen for a while but we continue to see good growth and good household acquisition.","Jon Arfstrom - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Okay. Good. And then, to Steve, one for you, the labor shortage comment. That seems to come up every quarter but maybe it seems a little bit more acute from the tone of your voice when you talked about it this quarter. Would you say is it a bigger problem for you and does that concern you longer term?","Stephen D. Steinour - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.","I do think it's a restraining factor in terms of the economic potential in our footprint. It was surprising to me to see our jobs availability being higher than every other region of the country, Jon. And so that underlying strength and the potential makes me bullish long-term, but clearly, it's holding us back at some level.","Jon Arfstrom - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Okay. Thank you.","Stephen D. Steinour - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Brian Klock with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. Please proceed with your question.","Howell D. McCullough III - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.","Hey, Brian.","Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, gentlemen. So Mac, I just want to have a follow-up question really quickly, and I'm sorry if I missed it earlier, but for the full-year revenue guidance, do you now include a September hike in further \u2013 for the back half of the year?","Howell D. McCullough III - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.","We do. Yes, we do have a September hike in the back half of the year.","Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay. And just really on the deposit beta, so the 50% would be your deposit beta for the full-year 2018. So, the expectation is that there will be another ramp in the back half of the year with that September hike that would be higher than the second quarter?","Howell D. McCullough III - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.","That is the way we would model. We're expecting the 50% to be for the full-year.","Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay.","Howell D. McCullough III - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.","And we think we're probably 40%, 43%, something in that range kind of where we sit today.","Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Got you. But obviously, the NIM expansion is going to come from the earning asset side of this, they're getting the benefit from that rolling through for the second half of the year.","Howell D. McCullough III - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.","That's correct.","Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Got it. Thanks for your time.","Howell D. McCullough III - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.","You bet.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Huntington Bancshares Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]","Thank you. I'll now introduce and turn the call over to Mr. Todd Beekman. You may begin your conference.","Todd Beekman","Thank you, Tracy, and welcome. This is Todd Beekman, the Director of Investor Relations for Huntington. Copies of the slides that we will be reviewing can be found on our IR website at www.huntington-ir.com.","This call is being recorded and will be available for rebroadcast starting about after an hour after the close of the call. Slides 2 and 3 note several aspects of the basis of today's presentation. I encourage you to read these, but let me point out one key disclosure.","The presentation will reference non-GAAP financial measures. And in that regard, I direct you to the comparable GAAP financial measures and reconciliation of the comparable GAAP financial measures within the presentation, the additional earnings material released this morning, and the related 8-K, all of which can be found on our website.","Turning to Slide 4. Today's discussion, including the Q&A, may contain forward-looking statements, such statements are based on information and assumption available at this time and are subject to changes, risks and uncertainties, which may cause actual results to differ materially. We assume no obligation to update such statements. For a complete discussion of risks and uncertainties, please refer to this slide, the material we filed with the SEC, including most recent 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filings.","Let's turn to Slide 5. Participating today are Steve Steinour, Chairman President and CEO; Dave Anderson, Interim Chief Financial Officer; and Dan Neumeyer, Chief Credit Officer.","Let's get started. Dave?","David S. Anderson","Thank you, Todd. I will review our 2013 second quarter financial results. Next, Dan will provide an update on credit. Finally, Steve will provide an update on household and commercial relationship growth, as well as expectations for the balance of 2013.","Turning to Slide 7. Huntington had a good second quarter. Results were very similar to the previous and year-ago quarter. For the second quarter, we reported net income of $151 million or earnings per share of $0.17. This resulted in a 1.08% return on assets and a 12% return on average tangible common equity. Fully-taxable equivalent revenue was $680 million, a decrease of less than 1% from the year-ago quarter. Net interest margin was 3.38%, down 4 basis points. Total average loans were up 1% over the last year-ago quarter. C&I and Automobile loans both increased by 6%. These increases were offset by a decrease in Commercial Real Estate loans of 17%.","Fee income was down slightly as lower mortgage banking income and lower gains on the sale of Low Income Housing Tax Credit investments were offset by growth in electronic banking, service charges on deposits, and trust and brokerage fees.","Expenses increased $1.6 million or less than 1% from the year-ago quarter. Salary and benefits increased due primarily to headcount growth in our in-store initiative and mortgage business. The increase in salaries and benefits was largely offset by lower expenses in marketing, consulting, legal, OREO and foreclosure, and mortgage representation and warranty claims. We continue to focus on controlling expenses as we make prudent investments for the future.","The new rules for Basel III were released 2 weeks ago and we are evaluating the impact on Huntington. At this time, we estimate that the Tier 1 common ratio would decrease by 60 basis points under the final Basel III rules. This potential impact is meaningfully better than our prior estimate of 150 basis points based upon last year's proposed rules. Steve will provide additional detail later in the call, but you can see that our optimal customer relationship methodology is continuing to drive success throughout the company. Consumer household and commercial relationships continue to grow at a pace above that of our regional footprint, and importantly, customers are building deeper relationships with Huntington.","Turning to Slide 8. Dan will cover credit in more detail later in the call, but you can see that credit quality continues to improve in the second quarter. Net charge-offs decreased by $49 million over the last year to an annualized rate of 34 basis points. Charge-offs are now better than our long-term goal of 35 to 55 basis points, a few quarters earlier than we expected.","Even with the addition last year of $63 million related to Chapter 7 consumer loans, nonaccrual loans were down $111 million or 23% over the course of the year, and now represent 87 basis points of total loans and leases.","Our capital remains strong. Tier 1 common risk-based capital increased 63 basis points to 10.71% over the last year. As we compare our results to the first quarter of 2013, net interest margin of 3.38% was down 4 basis points from the last quarter. Mortgage banking income was almost down $12 million to the first quarter of 2013. Last quarter also included a $7.6 million gain from the sale of Low Income Housing Tax Credits. Expenses increased less than 1% due to seasonal-related changes and a 1% increase in headcount.","In the second quarter, we repurchased 10 million shares of stock at an average price of $7.50 under our 2013 capital plan. As a reminder, we have the ability to repurchase up to $227 million dollars worth of common stock from the second quarter of 2013 to the first quarter of 2014, leaving $152 million of authorization remaining for the next 3 quarters. The quarterly level of repurchases will vary based upon the stock price.","Slide 9 is a summary of our quarterly earnings trends and key performance metrics. While this is a great snapshot of our recent results, many of these items will be discussed elsewhere. So I'll move on to Slide 10.","On this slide, we show the breakdown of operating leverage for the first half of the year. In this slide, we measure the growth of revenue and expenses, adjusted for significant items and for the volatility from MSR, the auto securitization gains and last year's bargain purchase gain from the Fidelity acquisition. On the adjusted basis, revenues increased by 0.2% and expenses increased by 0.6%, creating negative operating leverage for the first half of the year. We remain committed to delivering positive operating leverage for the full year, and expect to deliver this through an increase in net interest income and our continued focus on controlling and reducing expenses.","Slide 11 displays the trends of our net interest income and margin. The right side displays a 4 basis point decrease in our net interest margin over the last year to 3.38% for the quarter, which reflected the impact of a 22 basis point increase from the reduction of deposit rates in non-core funding, which reflects the continued benefit of our net remix of deposits and the redemption of trust preferreds; a 21 basis point decline in earning asset yield; and 5 basis points of lower benefit from noninterest-bearing funding.","The right side of Slide 12 shows the improvement in our deposit mix. The improved deposit mix reflects the success of the Fair Play banking strategy by remixing and growing consumer and commercial no- and low-cost deposits. This improving mix has contributed to the 15-basis point decline in the average rate paid on total deposits over the last 5 quarters. On the left side, you'll see the maturities schedule of our CD portfolio, which represents a potential opportunity for continuing to lower our deposit costs, as new CDs are coming in around 30 basis points.","Related to the last 2 slides, we have added a slide to the Appendix, Slide 39, that provides some additional granularity on the breakout of fixed versus variable rate for assets and liabilities.","Slide 13 provides a summary income statement for the last 5 quarters. I spoke earlier about several of the notable changes in non-interest income and expenses, but I would like to touch on these in more detail. Compared to the last quarter, mortgage banking income was down almost $12 million, as the net benefit from the MSR decreased by a similar amount. The vast majority of the MSR asset is held at lower cost to market. With recent increase in the long-term yield -- the long end of yield curve, the asset is now valued on the cost side of that calculation.","Service charges on deposits increased $7 million, as not only commercial treasury management activity picked up, but seasonal trends in customer activity and an 8% annualized growth in consumer checking households more than offset the approximate $2 million drag from the full quarter impact of February's change in posting order.","Capital markets activity increased by over $4 million, to $12 million, which is around the quarterly run rate prior to the particularly low level in the first quarter. As we discussed then, we expected a slowdown in commercial customer activity. As you can tell, that picked up in the second quarter, but it's still not back to what we think is normal. Expenses increased less than 1%, as second quarter marketing experienced its normal seasonality, and personal expenses increased due to a less than 1% increase in headcount and modest merit increases for non-executives. These were offset by lower credit-related costs such as OREO and foreclosure, and lower rep and warranty expenses.","Slide 14 reflects the trends in capital. The tangible common equity ratio decreased 14 basis points from the prior quarter. The decrease was primarily due to a reduction in the value of our investment securities portfolio caused by rising interest rates that flow through to accumulated other comprehensive income. Over the last year, the Tier 1 common risk-based capital ratio increased from 10.08% to 10.71%. Our capital ratios were also impacted by the repurchase of common shares. Total common stock repurchases over the last 4 quarters were 31.6 million shares at an average price of $6.85 per share.","As I mentioned earlier, we currently estimate that Basel III will negatively impact our Tier 1 common ratio by approximately 60 basis points, which is mostly driven by the change in asset risk weightings.","Let me turn the presentation over to Dan Neumeyer to review credit trends. Dan?","Daniel J. Neumeyer","Thanks, Dave. Slide 15 provides an overview of our credit quality trends. Credit quality trends were again very positive in the quarter. The net charge-off ratio fell to 34 basis points on an annualized basis compared to 51 basis points in the prior quarter. This level of charge-offs falls below our longer-term targeted range of 35 to 55 basis points, and is aided by an improved economic environment and healthy recoveries.","Given the absolute low level of charge-offs, some volatility from quarter-to-quarter is likely, although we expect the overall level to continue to be positive. Loans past due greater than 90 days and still accruing were down slightly in the quarter to 23 basis points and remained very well-controlled. The nonaccrual loan ratio showed continued modest improvement in the quarter, falling to 0.87% of total loans. The NPA ratio showed similar improvement, falling from 101 basis points to 95 basis points. The criticized asset ratio also showed improvement, falling from 4.49% to 4.24%.","The allowance for loan and lease loss and the allowance for credit loss to loans ratios fell in the quarter to 1.76% and 1.86%, respectively, down from 1.81% and 1.91% in the prior quarter, reflecting continued asset quality improvement. The ALLL and the ACL coverage ratios both increased modestly due to the reduction in nonperformers in the quarter.","Slide 16 shows the trends in our nonperforming assets. The chart on the left demonstrates the continued reduction in our NPAs, falling another 5% in the second quarter. The chart on the right shows the NPA inflows, which fell in the quarter to 25 basis points of beginning of period loans. We expect this basic trend to continue.","Slide 17 provides a reconciliation of our nonperforming asset flows. As I mentioned before, NPAs fell by 5% in the quarter, and the level of NPA inflows was the lowest experienced in the last year, and is less than 50% of the level of inflows from 1 year ago.","Turning to Slide 18. We provide a similar flow analysis of commercial criticized loans. This quarter saw a similar level of inflow as the prior quarter, with upgrades, paydowns and charge-offs contributing to a 5% reduction for the quarter. All of our reported results incorporate the findings of the recently completed Shared National Credit exam.","Moving to Slide 19. Commercial loan delinquencies remained elevated in both the 30- and 90-day categories over what we had shown from the first quarter of '11 through the first quarter of '12. The increase is due to the addition of the Fidelity portfolio. All of the 90-day delinquencies are related to the Fidelity purchased impaired loans, which are recorded at fair value upon acquisition and remain in accruing status. However, delinquencies remain very well-controlled in the aggregate.","Slide 20 outlines consumer loan delinquencies, which were in line with expectations. 30-day consumer delinquencies showed a slight uptick from the first quarter. Home equity delinquencies showed improvement in the quarter, although that was more than offset by an increase in residential delinquencies. Although residential delinquencies were up in the quarter, they were 74 basis points lower than 1 year ago. 90-day delinquencies remain very well-controlled and showed modest improvement in the quarter. Auto, home equity and residential all showed modest improvement quarter-over-quarter.","Reviewing Slide 21, the loan loss provision of $24.7 million was down $5 million from the prior quarter and was $10 million less than net charge-offs. The ratio of the ACL to nonaccrual loans rose from 207% to 214%, due to the previously noted reduction in nonperformers. The ACL to loans was lower at 1.86% compared to 1.91% last quarter. Most of the major credit metrics showed continued improvement and, therefore, we believe these coverage levels remain adequate and appropriate.","In summary, we are pleased with the quarter's credit results. We remain focused on quality and discipline in our new business originations in a very competitive environment. With regard to our metrics, we anticipate the possibility of some quarter-to-quarter volatility, but expect overall improvement, including lower criticized loans and lower NPAs.","Let me turn the presentation over to Steve.","Stephen D. Steinour","Thank you, Dan. Turning to Slide 22. Our Fair Play banking philosophy coupled with our optimal customer relationship, or OCR, continues to drive new customer growth and strength in product penetration. This slide recaps the continued strong upward trend in consumer checking account households.","For the quarter, consumer checking account households grew at an annualized rate of 8% and have increased 11% in the last year. Since launching this strategy in the third quarter of 2010, we've increased our consumer customer households by over 330,000. In less than 3 years, we've added the equivalent of the entire population of Cincinnati. At the same time, we've meaningfully increased the number of products and services we provide to those customers. In the last year alone, we've increased the number of customers that use 6 or more products, from over 43% to nearly 47%. As we mentioned last quarter, we are beginning to breakout the percentage of customers with 6-plus products because that is the level we've adjusted our internal targets to focus upon. For the last few years, our 4-plus targets are aimed at increasing customer retention, which is important, as it costs less to keep an existing customer longer than it does to bring another customer in the door.","To that end, as we think about incremental customers and revenue generation, consumer checking household revenue increased $3 million since the second quarter of 2012. That's net of an $8 million negative impact related to last quarter's change in posting order.","Turning to Slide 23. Commercial relationships grew at an annualized rate of over 6% and have increased by over 33,000 commercial customers since the second quarter of 2010. At the end of the quarter, 36% of our commercial relationships utilized 4 or more products or services, which is 3% higher than this time last year. Related commercial revenue of $179 million, while down $11 million from a year ago, is up $3 million from prior quarter, as we began to see commercial activity pick back up from below normal levels in the first quarter. The pipeline continue to rebuild and the third quarter is off to a solid start.","Turning to Slide 24 and 2013 expectations, we do have a few changes to our expectations and I will call these out as we go through the slides.","We continue to benefit from the strength in the Midwest economy, and believe our strategies will continue to drive growth and improve profitability. With regard to interest rates, while the long end has seen a high level of volatility, the shorter end of the curve remains low. With our on-balance sheet loans averaging about 3 years in duration, the movement in the long end does not help us all that much, but we expect the low short end to provide continued opportunity for deposit repricing and continued shift in our deposit mix. We expect net interest margin to remain fairly stable, and for the full year, we do not expect it to fall below the mid 3.30s, as a percent. Modest total loan growth is expected to continue, and know that we will remain disciplined. The C&I pipeline is robust, and we continue to expect stronger growth in the second half of the year when compared to the first half.","Auto loan originations remain strong. As we've moved through the quarter, there were several items that we continued to watch carefully. First was the relative attractiveness of incremental securities reinvestment versus auto loans. Auto loans, with their short duration, 3.25% effective yield and very clean credit quality are the compelling asset class in that comparison. The second factor we've been watching is the securitization market itself. And over the last month, rising rates and widening spreads on the senior subordinate tranches leave less excess spread for residual holders and, in turn, results in a smaller gain. And that gain could be reduced by 30% to 40% lower than our last securitization. For those reasons, we do not expect any auto securitization in 2013. This is a change from past expectations, and the net change you should expect is more auto loans and a steady decline of the available-for-sale securities portfolio.","Commercial Real Estate balances should stabilize around the current $5 billion level, and all other consumer loan categories should reflect modest growth.","Deposit balances will continue -- will reflect continued growth in low cost deposits, resulting in total deposit growth in line with or slightly less than loan growth. The other change in expectations this quarter is related to non-interest income. When compared to the 2012 full year, excluding any impact from securitizations, net change in MSR or one-time gains, 2013's expected to be flat to slightly down, as the expected slowdown in mortgage banking should be mostly offset by the benefit of our growth in new relationships with increased cross-sell, and the continued maturation of our past strategic investments. It's worth noting that, yesterday, the board approved the curtailment of pension benefits. This is expected to result in a one-time noncash gain to be recognized in the third quarter. And we'll have more information on this subsequent event in this quarter's 10-Q.","Noninterest expense is expected to increase slightly due to higher commission expense, driven by higher expected fee revenue and the impact of the continued build-out of our in-store branches. The change in pension should lower expense modestly, and we'll continue to evaluate additional cost-save opportunities, as we remain committed to positive operating leverage for the full year. We will deliver positive operating leverage for the full year.","If the revenue doesn't materialize, we will deliver offsetting expense saves. On the credit front, nonperforming assets are expected to experience continued improvement, net charge-offs and provisions are below the long -- the low end of our long term expected range, and we're several quarters earlier than we expected in achieving these results. So very pleased with the work that Dan and all of his team and other lenders throughout the bank, who have been working diligently for years now to improve credit quality and get us to a normal level, and we believe we've achieved that now.","The risk on the balance sheet today is very different than when I arrived in 2009. We've completely overhauled not just credit, but the entire enterprise risk management throughout the organization. We have a much stronger set of practices that we're working from, and a terrific group of colleagues.","In summary, the environment remains challenging, but we have put a few good quarters together, and the year's off to a solid start. The second quarter had some very strong areas, continued household and commercial growth, several times that of the region. That growth and improving customer activity drove improvements in many fee income areas, namely: Service charges on deposits, electronic banking and capital markets, amongst others; nearly flat expenses when compared to linked quarter and last year; increased cross-sell across the board; and net charge-offs reaching normal levels. As with all banks, there were some challenges. Pricing is tight, and structure is loosening, but I think you're seeing some separation between banks. Discipline, during this time of the cycle, we believe is crucial. Decisions now are what impact the balance sheet and credit during the next cycle. The few of us that have continued to invest are just starting to see the long-term benefits of these multi-year investments. And our differentiated strategies are working. We will grow where we have relationship advantages and competitive advantages. And above all else, we will remain disciplined in the use of our capital and deliver appropriate returns.","Thank you for your interest in Huntington. Operator, we'll now take questions.","Todd Beekman","[Operator Instructions] Thank you. Tracy, we'll take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Ken Zerbe from Morgan Stanley.","Ken A. Zerbe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","First question just in terms of operating leverage. Obviously, you've not been hitting it. I know it's a big goal of yours. And, Steve, you're very, I guess, enthusiastic about hitting it this year. Maybe sort of just 2 parts to this. One, what's been the problem in terms of getting operating leverage so far, despite your, I guess, efforts to get positive leverage? And then, two, it seems that we're kind of getting to the point where you've missed in the first half, going into second half, are you at risk of, I guess, taking more aggressive actions like cutting -- just not doing any marketing in the back half the year or something that doesn't -- is not necessarily in the right interest of the bank, but yet it allows you to hit your positive number that may not be sustainable going into '14?","Stephen D. Steinour","Well, Ken, we won't do anything that impairs the long-term objectives and returns of the bank. Remember, we're all long-term shareholders. We changed our structures to include hold-to-retirement. So we will not take decisions and actions that will result in long-term trade-offs, such as you're suggesting. The first quarter started off, as we talked before, with a lot of challenge, I think much of that induced by what was going on in Washington. Second quarter was better. We've said all along, we think the second half gets -- will be better than the first half. We are starting the quarter with a strong commercial pipeline. Activities picked up in the second quarter in trust, brokerage, capital markets, treasury and management, a number of our areas that we expect will offset further decline in mortgage. And as we relayed, we expect modest balance sheet growth and discipline around the NIM. So we will deliver positive operating leverage in the second half. And we've announced initiatives around continuous improvement, the hiring of a new executive to help us enhance our management of processes, and bring more economics through to the company, including the customer -- ease at which our customers do business with us. Does this answer that?","David S. Anderson","Quickly, I'll add to it. If you look at our fourth quarter expenses, we had about a $25 million increase in 2012. And that was really due to us really gearing up for regulatory. So we don't expect to see that repeated in the fourth quarter of 2013.","Stephen D. Steinour","Does that answer your question, Ken?","Ken A. Zerbe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","It does and I appreciate that. I guess my one follow-up question. Just in terms of auto yields, have they changed noticeably over the last couple of months or so? And does that have any impact on your willingness to grow that portfolio faster than you would have, say, 2 months ago?","Stephen D. Steinour","Well, our yields in the last couple of months are essentially the same as what they were previously. There's been yield compression in that asset class over the last year and a half. And as you've seen last year and continuing this year, we remain disciplined on the pricing side. And despite overall increases in new car sales, our originations are flat year-over-year, and that reflects this discipline. As we've said before, we're not playing the market share game here. We were prepared -- we showed it last year, we let market share in Ohio slip a bit in order to maintain price. And our auto business, just to more fundamentally reflect on it, is a lot about relationships. We do a lot with -- on the wholesale side, and we have a single business unit that drives both the retail and wholesale. And we've been at it for a long time.","Ken A. Zerbe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, so new loan yields have not gone up in the last 2 months?","Stephen D. Steinour","The new loan yields have not gone up but they haven't -- I think your question was, have you seen any material change. I thought you're implying reduction.","Operator","Your next question is from Craig Siegenthaler from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Sticking back on the auto loan topic. Can you tell us what the new money yield was in the second quarter on your average indirect auto loan versus a 3.96% balance?","Stephen D. Steinour","We were originating around the 3.25% in the second quarter.","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Got it, helpful. And then second question, and sticking also back to operating leverage. Can you help us quantify the run rate expense saved quarterly from the curtailment of the pension plan?","Stephen D. Steinour","Well, we've not shared that yet, but there will obviously be a run rate impact, which we flagged in the comments. And you'll pick that up with the gain in the Q.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","So just on the context of NIM, the rate of change has been pretty moderate, and you still have the CD benefits coming through. Just wondering as you guys look forward, how close are we getting to that point, with rates now backing up a little bit, where you can see that eventual stabilization of NIM? Do you have that line of sight into what part maybe of next year you think you can start to bottom that out?","Stephen D. Steinour","Well, it's hard to project with all the volatility, even the differences in comments amongst the Fed governors. So we'd be reluctant to venture too far into that. As you know, we're managing it intensely. We will continue. We've shown a lot of discipline. If you look at this overall multi-year period, we still have a fair amount of CD maturities over the next 4 quarters, and the core strategy of growing low-cost deposits continues to work for us. So we're offsetting the asset compression with managing this liability side, both mix and rate, I think reasonably well, and we expect to continue to do that.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. My follow-up, just a more specific question. The securities book has looked like it's kind of lapping the comps. The yield on that book has held pretty consistent, although the book has continued to shrink. So I'm wondering, is there any change with regards to what you're putting on now versus what's rolling off and -- or your desires to start building that back up a little bit, especially if the deposit growth continues to be a little bit ahead of loan growth?","Stephen D. Steinour","Well, the change reflected in the conversation earlier is that the investment portfolio reinvest decisions that we make -- we get roughly $100 million, $125 million of cash flow off the investment portfolio a month. We'll be -- instead of putting that back into securities, at this rate, with the outlook in volatility, we will put it the into the auto loans. We like a short duration, higher-yielding asset without the OCI, which is reflected in that substitution, if you will. There'll be -- perhaps, there will be a moment when there's a greater stability that we'll look at that investment portfolio maybe changing directions, but in the -- through this year, we'll stay with not reinvesting and putting it into the auto portfolio.","Operator","Your next question is from Brian Foran with Autonomous.","Brian Foran - Autonomous Research LLP","I guess just on your noninterest-bearing deposits and kind of the core growth in customer households. Can you remind us -- there's some concern there's a noninterest-bearing deposit bubble in the industry, you guys have had one of the biggest remixes, from kind of 15% of deposits precycled, around 29% now, but you're also still a little bit below average, and you've had some pretty clear strategies to grow that. So I guess when you put it all together, a, what are you assuming in terms of deposits when you kind of evaluate your asset sensitivity? And then, b, kind of any thoughts on how your noninterest-bearing deposits will hold up relative to the industry as rates eventually move someday?","Stephen D. Steinour","Well, as we -- when we launched the strategy in 2009 and expressed that in the Investor Conference in '10, it was with the view all along that we wanted to create long-term, relationship-based, low cost deposits, and thus, the emphasis on cross-sell and the reporting on 4-plus products per household. And so in line with that, we found in 2010, in part of that release, that there was a material difference in the stickiness of those deposits if they had 4-plus products or services with us. So having achieved substantial growth in the 4-plus, and now having shifted to 6-plus, it gives us -- and expecting to continue to grow the 6-plus penetration in the overall cross-sell distribution, we think we're going to get a fairly sticky consumer deposit base here, and expect that to be sustaining through a change in rates. We're -- although we've grown at a pace greater than many in the industry, we're still about 5% below the average. So we do expect -- we think we've got great product in Asterisk-Free and our premium checking product, both coming with 24-Hour Grace, unique feature, we think we've got tremendously differentiated loyalty in the base.","Brian Foran - Autonomous Research LLP","And then as a follow-up on capital with all the recent changes, I mean clearly, you come out in a better place. You were in a good place to begin with, but in a better place now. And I just wonder what are kind of the big puts and takes in terms of how it might affect balance sheet decisions going forward. It doesn't seem like it's changed any of your cautiousness around OCIs, I guess I kind of wanted to verify that. And then, also, it's kind of early to talk about next year's CCAR, but with the benefit of a 10% Basel III ratio, how are you thinking about your setup for capital in 2014 and beyond?","Stephen D. Steinour","Well, these -- the rules just came out. We'll have a lot of board discussion about '14. And of course, we'll get, late in the year, the scenario to review. So it'd be very premature to have any commentary on '14. As we've said before, we think our capital is robust. We were pleased this year to be able to increase the dividend. I like to say up 25%, others reflect it's up $0.01. But the 25% sounds good to me. And then the buyback increase year-over-year was helpful. Our capital priorities haven't changed. Our view of our capital being strong is something that, as an organization, we intend to keep strong capital, but we view the Basel III announcements as possibly creating more flexibility within the Fed. And we'll be reviewing that and try to ascertain that as we go forward.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question is from Bob Ramsey with FBR.","Bob Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Just wanted to touch a little bit more on expenses. I know you all said the expense outlook is consistent with prior expectations, and I think that was $10 million to $20 million above the first quarter run rates. You're talking about 4 52, 4 62 a quarter in the back half of the year. Is that right?","Stephen D. Steinour","Yes. You're in the right ZIP code.","Bob Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Okay. And I guess, going back to the questions about positive operating leverage. I mean, that sort of implies expenses are flat to higher year-over-year, and your fee income and net interest income pieces sort of implied that those items are flat to down year-over-year. I'm just kind of curious what I'm missing.","Stephen D. Steinour","Well, the fee income was flat to down. The net interest income, we expect balance sheet growth, modest balance sheet growth, and that will be additive. And we flagged with this pension and expense savings, there are other expense opportunities that we have been working on and will continue to work on that we expect to translate as well. So we tried to be cautious in our outlook, given the volatility that's just occurred with interest rates, as we think about the second half.","Bob Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Okay. So that sounds like you're hopeful to be at least at the low end of the expense guidance?","Stephen D. Steinour","Well, it depends on volumes, because we've got a fair amount of commission-related volume activities. So I don't mean to be cute on this in any way or hedging, but it does in fact reflect activity-based results.","Operator","Your next question is from Erika Penala with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Erika Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","My first question is a follow-up to Ken Usdin's question. You've often talked about your short duration securities portfolio as dry powder. And I heard your message loud and clear in terms of opting to retain auto loans instead. I guess, could you remind us on what your concentration sensitivity is in terms of auto loans, the percentage of your loan book? And would that be a signal that you may lever your balance sheet more aggressively if you reach that limit?","Daniel J. Neumeyer","Hey, Erika, this is Dan. We have plenty of capacity and we look at the auto book in several ways. We look at it as a percentage of capital. We also look at how much we want as a percentage of the loan book. And we have over $2 billion of capacity at this time. We can always revisit those guidelines later, but we feel very comfortable that we can continue to hold those on the sheet and not impinge on any of our guidelines.","Erika Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it. And this is for you as well, Dan. The charge-offs for the industry, and for Huntington specifically, have continued to trend at the low end of normal or even below normal. In your experience of past credit cycles, how long do you think the industry can enjoy sub-normal charge-offs for?","Daniel J. Neumeyer","Obviously, a hard question to answer. But we are -- we still see greater than, I would say, average recoveries. And while that will begin to dissipate a bit, they are still strong at this time. We're still enjoying improvement in the overall portfolio, so criticized and classified are still coming down. We've been very disciplined in our new originations, so I wouldn't expect to see lots of new inflows on the things that we've originated since 2009. So I think that there still is a period of time where we're going to experience pretty low levels of charge-offs. Now we're at a level now where the absolute level any quarter could move around, because in the commercial book at 4 basis points, any one deal is going to move that. But I think, in general, we are going to have -- we feel pretty good in the near-term outlook, and even the medium-term outlook, that there will be a fairly low level of charge-offs.","Operator","Your next question comes from Josh Levin with Citi.","Josh Levin - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","So earlier in the year, I think you and your peers sounded more confident about loan growth picking up in the second half the year. And now, it sounds like everyone's sort of dialed back their expectations a little bit about the second half the year. And a lot of this is being attributed to customer confidence. What's going on? I mean, what's really changed out there that's gotten sort of the customer to retrench a little bit? Or is it -- am I wrong, is there some other cause?","Stephen D. Steinour","Well, at least here at Huntington, so I'm talking on behalf of the industry, the expectation was always that the second half would be stronger than the first half. As we went into the year, we saw a scenario where we thought it would be weak, and it certainly was. Coming with a combination of sequestration, debt cliff, health care and tax reform, it just, in my opinion, stalled what typically would be early investment decisions. And that has continued, in part because of some global volatility, although the confidence is better today and has improved off the first quarter consistently. For us, we've remained disciplined. And you can see that in how the NIMs are holding in. And we're very return-focused. So as the competition has heated up, perhaps even more than we might have expected, it's had a bit of an impact as well. But we're -- we've made strategic decisions to be relationship-focused in 2009. We've maintained that discipline going forward. You can see on the commercial portfolio, as a whole, as we report 4-plus cross-sell, that continues to improve, and we'll maintain the course here. So there's perhaps a bit of frothiness that, with our discipline, we're not -- we're just not playing in. And that's having a marginal impact.","Josh Levin - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","What's the bull case for loan growth picking it up? Is it more like a slow ramp? Or is there potential for more like a coiled spring?","Stephen D. Steinour","I would describe it as a slow ramp and, therefore, consistent with our outlook.","Operator","Your next question is from Steven Alexopoulos with JPMorgan.","Steven A. Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I wanted to start -- I know you said you didn't expect a large ramp in regulatory costs this year like you saw last year. But as you prepare to become a CCAR bank now, how much incremental expense should we be thinking about for the back half of the year?","Stephen D. Steinour","Well, we were clear last year that, through the middle of the year, we expected to file a CCAR. It was only a midyear change. And we invested, I think we disclosed $10 million around regulatory issues. And you can assume quite a bit of that was related to CCAR preparations. So a lot of our investment is in, and we do not expect to have a disclosable level of further investment in the second half of this year.","Steven A. Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then just for a separate question. Regarding the bulletin that CFPB put out in March on dealer markup, at this stage have you seen a change in behavior at the dealer level? And have you implemented any new practices to limit dealers marking up loans selectively?","Stephen D. Steinour","Well, we haven't seen any change with the dealers. And there's been a further request for information. So this is still pending a review and, frankly, a clarification to the industry by the CFPB, but no change in behavior that we've noticed.","Operator","Your next question is from Jon Arfstrom with RBC Capital Markets.","Jon G. Arfstrom - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just a question, checking account question on that Slide 22. How much of that growth is coming from the new in-store branches versus the rest of the footprint?","Stephen D. Steinour","The in-stores are outproducing sort of -- as a percentage of total branches, they're outproducing. They're driving about 30% of the checking account production now. This is what we envisioned. We saw them as an acquisition machine when we announced Giant Eagle initially, being able to create dialogue, create hopefully relationship as a consequence of the dialogue to the [indiscernible] activity that our colleagues engage in, plus the 7-day a week, 80 hours of convenience that we offer in that setting. It has proven to work well for us, and we remain bullish on it.","Jon G. Arfstrom - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, and those are good numbers. And also just on top of that. Just curious how long do you think the runway is in terms of your ability to continue to put up those kinds of growth numbers. I mean, do you feel like you're getting saturated in some markets or are we just very early?","Stephen D. Steinour","Well, we've been -- the Meijer in-store relationship is still very, very early. It was just announced not even a year ago. And this year, we've got over 30 in-stores that are opening. We -- so we think we've got best product with Asterisk-Free Checking account. We've got unique feature with 24-Hour Grace. The Fair Play banking positioning is a big advantage, and we'll continue to invest in the products and the positioning to drive that growth. It's -- we have a denominator effect as we continue to have households in terms of the rate of growth. But we'll continue to add about 30,000 households a quarter, net to the base.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question is from Ryan Stevens [ph].","Unknown Analyst","Have you -- just a follow-up to Steve's questions. Have you changed your allowable yield spread premium for the dealers?","Stephen D. Steinour","No, we have not. We have not changed it this year. We made changes a couple of years ago.","Unknown Analyst","Okay. I mean how do you envision going forward? Do you want to move to sort of a flat fee? Do you want to move to sort of 2% caps? I mean, how do you think about that?","Stephen D. Steinour","Well, we're going to wait and let the CFPB's position become clear before we make a decision about which direction we're going to go, if any. We may in fact be well-positioned depending on their findings.","Operator","At this time, there are no further questions in queue. I'll turn the call back over to the presenters.","Todd Beekman","Thank you very much for your interest in Huntington. If you have additional questions, feel free to call Investor Relations at (614) 480-5676. Thank you very much, and have a good day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.","Mark Muth, you may begin your conference.","Mark Muth","Thank you, Jackie. Welcome. I\u2019m Mark Muth, Director of Investor Relations for Huntington. Copies of the slides we will be reviewing can be found on our IR website at www.huntington.com. This call is being recorded and will be available as a rebroadcast starting about one hour from the close of the call.","Slides one and two, notes several aspects of the basis of today\u2019s presentation. I encourage you to read these, but let me point out one key disclosure. This presentation will reference non-GAAP financial measures. And in that regard, I would direct you to the comparable GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation to the comparable GAAP financial measures within the presentation, the additional earnings-related material we released this morning and the related Form 8-K filed today, all of which can be found on our IR website.","Turning to slide three, today\u2019s discussion, including the Q&A period, will contain forward-looking statements. Such statements are based on information and assumptions available at this time and are subject to changes, risks and uncertainties, which may cause actual results to differ materially. We assume no obligation to update such statements.

Dan Neumeyer, our Chief Credit Officer and Rick Remiker, our Commercial Banking Director will also be participating in the Q&A portion of today's call.","Let\u2019s get started by turning to slide five. Steve?","Steve Steinour","Thanks Mark. I'd like to thank everyone for joining the call today. It's an exciting time for us at Huntington. Our first quarter results demonstrated the strength of our franchise and business model in a challenging external environment. We're very pleased with the results and believe that the first quarter sets us up well for the remainder of the year.","We're focused on finishing 2015 strong and positioning for continued success in 2016 and beyond. Our current focus is on improving our already strong competitive position in consumer banking, small business and middle market banking including the specialty lending verticals by improving sales execution, developing new products and deepening customer relationships through OCR.","Our commitment to smart accretive acquisitions was on display during the first quarter as we successfully completed the acquisition of Macquarie Equipment Finance. We also announced the continued enhancement of our full-service branch network in a cost-efficient manner with the addition of 43 new in-store branches in Michigan.","Slides six and seven show some of the financial highlights of the 2015 first quarter. Mac will discuss the details shortly, but I wanted to highlight a few of the items that I believe distinguish Huntington and illustrate our strategic execution. Good core balance sheet growth, along with strong performances from mortgage banking, and capital markets have set the tone for a solid quarter.","We reported net income of $166 million a 11% increase year-over-year, an EPS of $0.19 a 12% year-over-year increase resulted in a 102% return on assets and 12.2% return on average tangible common equity. Total revenue increased 2% year-over-year which includes the impact of $17 million in securities gains in the first quarter of 2014 driven by 7% increase in the net interest income tied to strong balance sheet growth.","Average loans and leases increased 10% from the year ago quarter and average total deposits increased 10% as well. The majority of deposit growth was due to an 8% increase in core deposits which we're very pleased with. Our focus on deepening relationships and earning primary banking status with our customers continues to benefit core deposit growth.","On that note, I'm turning attention to slide six, we continue to see industry leading customer acquisition with 9% growth in consumer checking households and 5% growth in commercial relationships over the past year. With respect to the commercial growth rate in 2014 we implemented changes to our business banking products which caused approximately 10,000 lower balanced accounts to be closed over the course of the year. So the underlying core fundamentals were even stronger.","We also continue to sell deeper across both our consumer and commercial relationships with more than half of our consumer relationships now have six or more products and services from Huntington and more than 42% of our commercial relationships have a cross-sell of 4% or higher.","Slide seven has a few additional highlights from the first quarter. First our 2015 CCAR capital plan received no objection from the Federal Reserve for the upcoming five quarters through the 2016 second quarter our Board of Directors has approved the repurchase of up to $366 million of common shares. We successfully completed the acquisition of Macquarie Equipment Finance, and look forward to transitioning to the Huntington Technology Finance brand.","We continue to be recognized for our focus on excellent customer service. For the second year in a row Greenwich Associates named Huntington one of the best commercial and business banks in the country. We also just received the 2014 TNS Choice Award for Consumer Banking in the Central Region which consists of 20 states in the middle of the country. So then this is the third time we've won this award and it's based on our strong performance in attracting new customers, satisfying and retaining customers and winning a larger share of the customers' total banking business.","Finally, we repurchased 4.9 million common shares at an average price of $10.45 per share thus completing our previous buyback authorization from our 2014 CCAR capital plan.","So with that, let me turn it over to Mac for a more detailed review of the numbers. Mac?","Mac McCullough","Thanks Steve and good morning everyone. Slide eight is a summary of our quarterly trends and key performance metrics. Steve touched on several of these, so let's move on to slide nine and drill on to the details.","Relative to last year's first quarter, total revenue increased 2% to $707 million. As Steve mentioned, this includes the impact of $70 million securities gains in last year's first quarter. Spread revenue accounted for the entire increase as net interest income grew by 7%. Driving net interest income growth was a 11% increase in average earning assets. Loans accounted for the majority of the balance sheet growth increasing 10% over the previous year.","Remainder of the balance sheet growth came in the securities portfolio as we continue our preparation for the upcoming Basel III liquidity coverage ratio requirement. The net interest margin compressed 12 basis points year-over-year to 3.15%. This decrease reflected a 15 basis points contraction and earning asset yields partially offset by 4 basis-point decline in funding costs.","On a linked quarter basis, the net interest margin compressed 3 basis points exclusively related to lower earning asset yields.","Fee income for the 2015 first quarter was $232 million a 7% decline from the year ago quarter. The decline was primarily driven by $17 million decrease in securities gains. The overall fee income decrease we continue to see the benefits of consumer and commercial customer growth as both electronic banking and capital markets income growth was strong year-over-year. Electronic banking increased 16% while capital markets fees increased 51%. Capital markets had a particularly strong quarter primarily driven by customer interest rate derivatives revenue.","I also want to highlight a particularly strong quarter for mortgage banking. Mortgage banking income grew 64% on a linked quarter basis and mortgage pipelines remained strong and have no signs of slowing down.","Reported noninterest expense in the 2015 first quarter was $459 million, a decrease of $1 million or less than 1% from a year ago quarter. Noninterest expense in the first quarter of 2014 did include $22 million in significant items. So on an adjusted year-over-year basis, noninterest expense increased 4%. Given the challenging interest rate environment, we are deeply focused on revenue generation and remain disciplined in managing expense in order to achieve positive operating leverage for the full year.","Slide 10 details the trend of our balance sheet mix. As Steve mentioned earlier, average loans increased $4 billion or 10% year-over-year. While pipelines remained strong we are becoming more selective as there were certain segments within C&I and COE where structure and price are not consistent with our risk and return expectations. As we continue to manage credit risk to achieve lower relative volatility through the cycle, we may expect to see some moderation in C&I and COE loan growth in the near term.","During the first quarter we experienced growth in every portfolio. However, indirect auto and C&I accounted for approximately three quarters of the growth. The indirect auto loan portfolio increased 29% from the year ago quarter. As shown on slide 54 in the appendix we continue to focus on the super prime space and have not sacrificed credit quality to drive volume.","Production remained strong even as we have increased pricing multiple times in recent quarters. Recent new money yields have been around 3.20%. We moved $1 billion of auto loans to held for sale in anticipation of an auto securitization during the second quarter as we managed loan concentrations. Average C&I loans increased 8% year-over-year, primarily rebuffing trade finance in support of our middle market and corporate banking customers. Asset finance related to our Equipment Finance business, auto dealership financing and corporate banking.","While growth and performance in the commercial real estate sector has been solid, we are exercising caution in this space as certain segments and geographies don\u2019t align well with our risk and return parameters.","Turning our attention to the funding side, average total deposits increased to 10% over the previous four quarters including an 8% increase in core deposits. We remain focused on remixing our deposit base, increasing low cost core deposits while reducing our dependence on higher cost CDs. Average noninterest bearing demand deposits increased 16% from the 2014 first quarter reflecting our focus on consumer checking and commercial relationship growth.","Average short and long-term borrowings increased by $1.4 billion year-over-year which includes $1 billion of bank level debt issued during the 2015 first quarter. Average brokered deposits increased $800 million during the same timeframe. Both of these funding sources provide a cost efficient means for funding balance sheet growth including LCR related securities growth while maintaining focus on managing core deposit expense.","Turning to slide 11, we see net interest margin barred against earning asset yield and interest bearing liability cost. The NIM compression continues due to the decreasing asset yields, strong loan growth more than offset the lower yields.","Slide 12 shows the trends in our capital ratios. Capital ratios trended down during the quarter driven by continued strong balance sheet growth and the Macquarie acquisition and our active capital management strategies. We repurchased 4.9 million commons shares over the quarter completing the authorized buyback from our 2014 CCAR plan.","One thing I want to highlight, starting this quarter we are showing our ratios on a Basel III basis including the standardized approach for calculating risk weighted assets.","Slide 13 provides an overview of our credit quality trends. Credit performance remained solid and in line with our expectations. Net charge-offs remained steady from last quarter at 20 basis points well below long-term expectations. Net charge-offs this quarter benefited from the sixth consecutive quarter of net recoveries within our commercial real estate portfolio as well as steady recoveries overall.","The level of nonperforming loans did increase in the quarter with the increased level of inflows compared to prior quarters due largely to one C&I credit. The criticized asset ratio was fairly stable compared to the prior quarter as new problem inflows fell from the previous quarter's level. The allowance for credit losses eased modestly with the ACL ratio falling from the 1.40 last quarter to 1.38 this quarter.","Slide 14 shows the trends of our nonperforming assets. The chart on the left demonstrates an uptick in the quarter to 0.84%. The chart on the right shows the NPA inflows which were largely from one C&I credit. The increase over what had been a more typical level of inflows exhibited over the past quarter was primarily due to one larger credit that migrated in the quarter. Our estimation of the potential loss exposure associated with this credit was recognized in the quarter and is reflected in the 20 basis points of charge-offs.","Turning to slide 15, the loan loss provision was $20.6 million in the first quarter compared to $24.4 million of charge-offs. The ratio of allowance to nonaccrual loans fell to 181% due to the increased level of nonaccrual loans in the quarter. However, this level coverage remains very strong. We believe the allowance is appropriate and reflects the underlying credit quality of our loan portfolio.","Let me now turn the presentation back over to Steve.","Steve Steinour","Thanks Mac. Turning to slide 16, as I alluded to in my opening remarks, our fair play banking philosophy, coupled with optimal customer relationship or OCR, continues to drive new customer growth and improve product penetration. This slide illustrates the continued upward trend in consumer checking account households and over the last year consumer checking account households grew by 9%.","The first quarter was up a little over 1% from the prior quarter. Our strategy is not just about market share gains, but also gains in share of wallet. We continue to focus on increasing the number of products and services we've provided customers knowing that this will translate into revenue growth. Our OCR cross-sell goal of six or more products and services crossed the 50% mark this quarter up 202 basis points from a year ago and that's on the entire book. Correspondingly our consumer checking account household revenue for the fourth quarter is up 9% year-over-year.","As you can see on slide 17, commercial relationship growth has returned as we work through the impact of the changes we made in our business banking checking products that impacted approximately 10,000 of lower balance accounts. Commercial relationships increased 5% year-over-year our four or more products OCR cross-sell for commercial relationships improved to almost 43% this quarter up more than 3% from a year ago.","Slide 18 shows our current year-to-date operating leverage results. As I noted during last quarter's earnings conference call, year-long positive operating leverage is the long-term strategic goal for Huntington and we remain committed to delivering on that goal for 2015. One thing I want to note in the 2014 first quarter we realized $17 million in securities gains as part of our efforts to reposition the portfolio in preparation for the upcoming Basel III LCR rule implementation.","On a year-over-year basis, the absence of these gains in the 2015 first quarter obviously hurt us from a comparison standpoint, but regardless we're confident in our ability to achieve positive operating leverage in 2015.","Now turning to slide 19, for some closing remarks and expectations. We remain optimistic about the ongoing economic improvement in our footprint as well as on the national level. And while our loan pipelines are strong, we continue to be selective in growing commercial real estate and C&I portfolios. We're committed to delivering strong results in a flat interest rate environment. Our current budget has been built around the current rate environment and our execution is not dependent on our rate increase.","We\u2019ll continue to reinvest cash flows of approximately $125 million to $150 million per month from the existing investment securities into LCR-compliant, high-quality liquid assets. The NIM pressure will remain a headwind until interest rates start moving up, but we expect to grow revenue despite this pressure. ","We are maintaining our credit structure and pricing discipline. We\u2019re not chasing growth where returns are inadequate or without regard to risk. Excluding significant items, net MSR activity and acquisitions, we\u2019re committed to positive operating leverage for the full year 2015 with revenue growth exceeding noninterest expense growth of 2% to 4%.","Finally, we expect to see asset quality metrics near current levels. We expect net charge-offs will remain in or below our long-term expected range of 35 to 55 basis points. Modest changes are anticipated quarter-to-quarter given the absolute low level of our credit metrics.","Longer-term we are managing the franchise to deliver consistent strong shareholder returns. We've built a strong consumer brand with differentiated products and superior customer service. We\u2019re executing our strategies and adjusting to our environment where necessary. ","In addition, there is a high level of alignment between employees and shareholders and we're highly focused on our commitment to be good stewards of shareholders' capital. ","So with that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Mark.","Mark Muth","Thanks Steve. Operator, we will now take questions and we ask that out of courtesy of your peers, each person ask only one question and one related follow-up question. And then if that person has additional questions, he or she can add themselves back into the queue. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Sandler O\u2019Neill. Your line is open.","Scott Siefers","I was hoping you could just spend a quick second expanding on just the sort of the nature of the One Credit slipped into non [indiscernible] that was commercial, but just any additional color that you could add? And then just sort of the follow up would be, but not kind of Steve you mentioned a couple times the more selective behavior on commercial and C&I growth, so just any additional color on the trends you\u2019re seeing what\u2019s causing there may be temper your growth there?","Dan Neumeyer","Sure, good morning Scott, this is Dan. So on the One Credit it was still steel related and so we brought it into NPA, we actually have recognized what we think is the potential of exposure, so that is included in the 20 basis points of charge-offs that we recognized this quarter, so we feel we have the risk in that credit behind us.","With regard to the portfolio more broadly and what we are seeing, clearly the market has as we've been saying for several quarters has been very comparative and so we still have a good deal pipeline, but we are being more selective. Our bankers understand our risk appetite. They are self selecting in certain cases to not bring deals forward, but we\u2019re looking at every deal very closely. We have our discipline in mind and so we\u2019re sticking to those disciplines and still it is achieving some pretty good growth rates. But overall the market continues to be very competitive in both structuring and pricing and that\u2019s really across the portfolio.","Scott Siefers","Okay and then so, there is not one for example specific segment geography that\u2019s worse than the rest, it is just a more, perhaps a more conservative posture overall.","Dan Neumeyer","Yes and I would say not more conservative, I mean we are sticking to our discipline. We've had our risk appetite and the corresponding parameters in place for long time and we're operating within those. So as the market gets more aggressive, it's going to be, there are going to be more cases, where we are going to opt out.","Scott Siefers","Yes, okay, all right that makes sense. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore. Your line is open.","John Pancari","I\u2019m John Pancari of Evercore. Quick question on back to the loan growth commentary that you just gave, how should we think about the peak of loan growth given the likely moderation as you step away from some of these transactions, is it fair to assume that we see mid single digits or even low single digits given that as we move through '15.","Mac McCullough","Hi, John, it\u2019s Mac. I would suggest that we will see some moderation in C&I and CRE going forward. I\u2019m not going to put a growth rate out there, but clearly this isn\u2019t a deal flow issue, this was just a risk appetiter discipline issue and we\u2019re still looking at same number of deals, but we\u2019re applying the same lens and the same filters to how we think about whether or we want to bring these deals into our book or not.","So, as Steve mentioned, we\u2019re comfortable. As it relates to our plan for 2015, we anticipated this environment and we are going to have positive operating leverage for 2015. So all these things factor into how we are going to perform and what we believe the expectations are for 2015.","John Pancari","Okay, great and then separately on the Auto, I was wanted to see if you could give us a little bit of color on the potential gain on sale margins that you are targeting on the pending auto securitization and do you still plan on pursuing two securitizations in \u201915? Thanks.","Mac McCullough","So we do think that gain on sale is probably going to be about 50% of this work level relative to the last deal that we did and it's in line with our expectations, it's in line with how we think about this from the budget or a forecast perspective. We are continuing to evaluate the need for a second securitization in 2015, we\u2019ve seen some decline in growth in the indirect space and we\u2019re evaluating whether we need to do that late in 2015 or early in 2016, so that is still under consideration.","John Pancari","Okay and then lastly just on the deposit service charges they were down 4% year-over-year, can you just I'm not sure if you gave any color on that, just assuming you'll give us some detail?","Mac McCullough","Yes, so we made a change in the third quarter of last year related to fair play strategy just giving customers more time to have their deposits account against their balance and that basically cost us about $6 million a quarter starting in the third quarter of 2014, so we haven\u2019t quite swum through that yet, but that is the impact.","John Pancari","Okay, thanks. Appreciate for taking my questions.","Mac McCullough","Thanks John.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mat O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Mathew O\u2019Connor","Good morning.","Steve Steinour","Good morning, Mat.","Mathew O\u2019Connor","I was wondering if you could provide any of the financial impact from the equipment finance deal that you did. I would assume that\u2019s accretive to earnings since your financing it with cash, but any metrics or figures around that would be helpful?","Mac McCullough","Yes, Mat it\u2019s Mac. So we haven\u2019t given a lot of details around the transaction. I will say that it is a very high quality, very nice growth rates and very high return on capital business. We have said that the yields on these assets are going to be the highest yields on our balance sheet and it's just an extremely well run business by people that we know and have a lot of respect for.","So the return on tangible common equity is at least double of what we report as a company, so extremely good fit with our existing business. We are going to be able to expand the product set into business banking, in the small business and in the healthcare vertical that Rick runs, so really nice complimentary business for us.","Mathew O\u2019Connor","And then are there any upfront costs in terms of the deal whether its retention or setting aside the loss reserves, anything that we should look for next quarter on that?","Mac McCullough","So we did recognize the $3.4 million in the quarter related to integration and deal process associated with Macquarie deal. We will see some additional expense the reminder of the year. It is not significantly material relative to the size of the transaction and really no reserve impact this quarter.","Mathew O\u2019Connor","Okay, alright so it is all in the run rate here.","Mac McCullough","It is.","Mathew O\u2019Connor","Okay, alright that\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","Mac McCullough","Thanks Mat.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Alexopoulos with JP Morgan. Your line is open.","Steven Alexopoulos","Hi, good morning guys.","Steve Steinour","Good morning Steven.","Steven Alexopoulos","Regarding the linked quarter decline in the professional services fees ex the Macquarie deal, could you help us think about is that a permanent step down just giving your experience and going through CCAR and how should we think about that ramping through the year?","Mac McCullough","Yes, I think it is a bit lumpy, as we think about some of the professional services we use for CCAR. I think that probably a pretty decent run rate as we think about going forward on average, but again there is going to be some volatility in that line.","Steven Alexopoulos","I mean, do you expect it to ramp the way it didn\u2019t the prior year, I think you were almost 16 million in the fourth quarter or should we be less than that would be\u2026?","Mac McCullough","It will be less than that. Remember, we had some expense associated with some strategy work that we did late last year that we\u2019re not going to repeat in this year.","Steven Alexopoulos","Okay and then I just wanted follow up on John\u2019s question, can you just remind us, are you, do you typically include the gain on auto securitizations in your calculation for positive operating leverage? Thanks.","Mac McCullough","We do include those gains in the operating leverage calculation, so that obviously will be in the second quarter fee income line and historically we included those gains in that calculation.","Steven Alexopoulos","Okay, thanks for the color.","Mac McCullough","Thanks Steve.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Ken Zerbe","Hi, great thanks. A question on expenses, just want to make sure that we are actually using the right base number, because I saw that you reiterated your 2% to 4% growth and back at the one time, as I get 2014 expenses at $1.818 billion is that the right number that you\u2019re growing 2% to 4% on ? And kind of the followup also is just, I think you said you exclude the Macquarie expenses from that, but what are the Macquarie expenses that we should add to that number? Thanks.","Mac McCullough","Yes, so I think the way to think about the 2014 base is, you should take 2014 reported and exclude the cyclical items that we identified for the full year, so remember we had acquisition integration expense associated with Camco and the Bank of America branches. ","And we also had some franchise repositioning expense in the third and fourth quarters last year, so I think that it's important to think about it from that perspective. We have not disclosed any expense or revenue around Macquarie. And we won't be doing that on this call, but obviously as we think about acquisitions going forward and what happens to us in 2015, but the 2% to 4% is based on 2014 excluding those acquisition items.","Ken Zerbe","Okay, so I guess if you\u2019re guiding to a number that we cannot replicate, meaning just with the Macquarie expenses we should basically start with the 2% to 4% and then add some more ambiguous number for other expenses, I mean is that the message that you are trying to convey with the guidance that is something more than the 2% to 4%?","Mac McCullough","It will be more than the 2% to 4% perhaps. I mean the 2% to 4% is the range that we're comfortable with in terms of growth for 2015 and we do need to add the Macquarie expenses on to it. Obviously we are getting revenue with Macquarie as well and Macquarie has positive operating leverage as we think about the business that we're bringing into - in the income.","So it should be additive to that when you think about positive operating leverage in 2015, I think the message that we\u2019re trying to convey is that even exclusive of an acquisition that could help us to achieve positive operating leverage. We are committed to positive operating leverage on the core, based upon the way we set the year up relative to the 2014 base.","Ken Zerbe","Got it and sorry, did you provide the revenue addition for Macquarie or is that and do we know that yet?","Mac McCullough","We didn\u2019t provide that no.","Ken Zerbe","Okay. Alright, thank you very much.","Mac McCullough","Thanks Ken.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bob Ramsey with FBR Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Bob Ramsey","Good morning guys. I know talking about Macquarie, you mentioned that the ROEs on our business are double with the standalone Huntington's ROE\u2019s are, just curious if that\u2019s also true on an ROE basis, if you kind take capitalization out of the equitation.","Mac McCullough","It\u2019s a great question. I\u2019m not quite sure I\u2019ve looked at it that way. Yes pretty robust on ROEs, but it is a very high ROE business. So I will say it\u2019s got to be pretty close to that.","Bob Ramsey","Okay is it I mean is \u2013 do you allocate a materially different amount of capital to that than your overall business or I guess it\u2019s in the same zip code?","Mac McCullough","Yes it's in the same zip code and the ROAs are definitely accretive to our ROAs, so it\u2019s a very high return business and part of that has to do with the deal, the leases themselves and certainly it\u2019s the credit quality.","Bob Ramsey","Okay and then thinking about that piece of it as well that the yield piece as you all put that $800 million of higher yielding loans on the balance sheet and $1 billion moves off of lower yielding auto loans that gets sold. How should we think about net interest margin in the second quarter?","Mac McCullough","We\u2019re going to continue to see some pressure on the margin if you take a look on a linked quarter basis we\u2019re down 3 basis points and 2 basis points of that was really due to adding securities during the quarter.","Where we think we need to be from an LCR perspective we\u2019re at about 90% right now. And so the incremental add in the securities book for LCR is going to be minimal. I will tell you that we\u2019re tracking the margin exactly as we expect it to see for 2015. So even though, we\u2019re seeing the contraction it will continue until we see some increase in interest rates. This is all within our expectations as it relates to the positive operating leverage, revenue growth and performance for 2015.","Bob Ramsey","Okay, so even with the Macquarie higher yielding loans coming on the second quarter you would expect contraction in the second quarter or you just mean from a bigger higher level you have 2015 the direction is now and outside of the deal?","Mac McCullough","I would say yes to both.","Bob Ramsey","Okay, all right thank you.","Mac McCullough","Great contraction Macquarie, second quarter, yeah.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with the Bank of America. Your line is open.","Erika Najarian","Hi good morning.","Steve Steinour","Good morning, Erika.","Mac McCullough","Good morning.","Erika Najarian","I just wanted to ask a follow-up question, I\u2019m sorry to ask another question on the guidance, but as I\u2019m thinking about the base for Steve, for 2014 and we think about revenue growth, it does include a $17 million in securities gains, but excludes that MSR activity?","Steve Steinour","That would be correct.","Erika Najarian","Got it and this is a follow-up question to what the bottom line of question. You mentioned Steve in your prepared remarks that you\u2019re going to invest the $125 million to $150 million per month in cash flows into HQLA and I think I thought that the incremental add beyond that is going to be minimum. Did I catch that right and if so that minimal add would be how much and what would it be funded by?","Steve Steinour","You did catch it right Erika. We added about $500 million in the first quarter. The monthly cash flow is going to give us between 125 and 150 that will substitute in as well. And net beyond that as Mac said was modest it\u2019s around $250 million. So we had started the year and reference a number of up to $1 billion. It looks like it\u2019s going to be at 750 now as we see the cash flows adjusting and 500 is already in. ","Erika Najarian","Got it and just as a follow-up to that would it be continue to fund by long-term debt and brokerage CDs and what would this split be?","Steve Steinour","Well the increment is not that large, so we got a variety of funding sources we certainly could do a debt issuance later this year, but not committed. We had very good core deposit growth through the first quarter and looking to obviously keep as much core funded growth in deposits as possible moving forward.","Erika Najarian","Got it, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you so much.","Steve Steinour","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","This is actually Josh in for Ken. Thanks for taking our questions. Could you just speak to the potential for continued asset acquisitions. And the extent to which you\u2019re seeing new opportunities out there?","Steve Steinour","Josh, this is Steve, we have \u2013 we continue to look at different opportunities and as we\u2019ve said over the years our preference would be to look at banks and non-banks in our footprint, but we\u2019re prepared to look at opportunities that sort of are on the shoulders of our existing footprint.","There\u2019s a level of discussion that\u2019s in line with what we saw last year and so don\u2019t see a huge spike in activity at this point.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay thanks, that\u2019s all we have.","Steve Steinour","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Carcache with Nomura. Your line is open.","Bill Carcache","Thank you good morning. Can you talk about the attractiveness of auto securitization market pricing here versus funding directly from your balance sheet and perhaps if you could also remind us of the primary factors that are underlying your decision to retain versus sell?","Mac McCullough","Yes hi, it\u2019s Mac. The primary factor driving us to consider securitization would just be concentration limits in our portfolio. We\u2019ve established these limits related to the amount of order that we run on our balance sheet and what\u2019s really driving this securitization in the second quarter is starting to bump up against the level that we just want to get back within I guess given us through to make further decisions later in the year.","So it\u2019s not really an economic decision. Obviously economics do play into it, but from a concentration perspective that would be the first filter we would take a look at and then from a liquidity perspective just taking a look at funding sources, and cost of funding and loan deposit ratio, those types of metrics would be a secondary consideration. And then I would put really economics as being the third consideration.","Bill Carcache","Okay and yes there\u2019s no retained interest the way that they are structured?","Mac McCullough","Well off balance sheet for treatment that\u2019s correct.","Bill Carcache","Right. Okay and I\u2019m sorry and then can you talk about still in terms of the relative attractiveness from a pricing perspective is there any kind of benefit versus funding directly from your balance sheet or is just overwhelmed by just a concentration limits that you described?","Mac McCullough","Yes, it really is been driven by the concentration issues.","Bill Carcache","Okay and then to the extent even where you would be willing to take perhaps what\u2019s a less attractive pricing, could you give a little bit of color on what the pricing looks like and that\u2019s my last question. Thanks.","Mac McCullough","Yes I mean, relative to keeping the loans on our balance sheet there certainly is an economic impact here it\u2019s fairly a reasonable number in terms of the trade off that we\u2019re making, but we\u2019re giving up revenue by going to the securitization. So again it\u2019s not the primary driver of why we\u2019re doing this. We certainly take that into consideration, but we made a commitment and we've got limits around probably thinking about concentration on the balance sheet.","Bill Carcache","Understood. Thank you.","Operator","So our next question comes from the line of Andy [indiscernible] Your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","All my questions have been answered. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous Research. Your line is open.","Geoffrey Elliott","Oh hello there, just a question on the credit side in the fourth quarter you talked about a couple large basis related to natural resources and manufacturers papers related to natural resources and manufacturers of commercial vehicles this quarter, there is large case in the is real i on a large case in the steel industry, how do you think about when you still try are identify this as trend both of them just being a series of isolated large incidents?","Dan Neumeyer","Yes well, we this is Dan, we evaluate the inflow of new criticize loans every quarter and we\u2019re looking at trends that might be developing in these larger cases they were kind idiosyncratic company specific, industry specific and one of the cases the natural resources credit we've actually already had a positive outcome on that deal. So, what we're trying to do is identify the credits very early in the process so that we have more options available to us for resolution and that has been to our advantage.","We're finding that we bring these things in early, assess our options and so we've been able to move these problem loans through the system very quickly generally with good outcomes. So we are seeing, I think a fairly steady flow of problem credits. I think part of that is driven by the fact that the market has been quite aggressive going on several years now, but we're very comfortable with what we're seeing. We do not see trends developing but I obviously watch that very closely.","Geoffrey Elliott","And how do you think about the health of the corporate sector more broadly I guess, your footprint is your exposure to lots of manufactures and exporters and I guess other macro kind of is conflicting and some obviously enterprises, but strong dollar they had been for exporters and how your discussions with those corporate clients are impacted by that going?","Steve Steinour","Well, we have those conversations with all of our customers. We've looked at our portfolio and done assessment of those that have good portion of their volumes which are export related. We've also looked at those companies that have a large portion of their cost of goods that they are getting from overseas and there is positive and negative done on both sides of that. But in total we remain comfortable.","We are obviously concentrated in the Midwest, so we have a big manufacturing concentration. But that's also what we know, and are very comfortable with and are close to the industries that we serve. So all-in-all I think on the whole we feel good about where our customer base is situated and many of them over the last few years have been working and bolstering their balance sheets and getting in good shape and so we're quite comfortable.","Geoffrey Elliott","Thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Chris Mutascio with KBW. Your line is open.","Chris Mutascio","I don\u2019t know if this question is for Mac or for Dan it is on the same lines on the credit quality. If I understand the released actually the one large credit that one to NPA that's roughly $35 million or majority of the $35 million to $37 million year-over-year increase in NPAs. But on a sequential quarter basis, I think NPAs were up more like $65 million.","I know it's all from a low base, but I wondered if I can get some more color on the residual, difference between that $35 million on a year-over-year basis and the $65 million versus other types of large credits within the sequential quarter increase and then just a one commercial credit you outlined or is it smaller once and if so, any specific industries?","Mac McCullough","Yes, so of the $65 million quarter-to-quarter increase this credit did represent the majority of that. We're not going to get specifics in terms of dollar amounts, but it did represent the majority of that increase and again we have recognized what we believe is the loss potential in that credit. We're always going to have a flow of additional deals, but there are no other large credits that drove that increase.","Chris Mutascio","Okay, thank you.","Dan Neumeyer","And no particular industry, so no emerging sort of industry risk.","Mac McCullough","Correct.","Steve Steinour","Thanks Chris.","Chris Mutascio","Thank you.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back over to the presenters.","Steve Steinour","So thank you, this is Steve. We're grateful for your attendance. We're obviously pleased with our performance in the first quarter. Results reflected the ongoing disciplined execution of our strategies and the strong competitive position that we enjoy today at Huntington. We've received ongoing recognition around superior customer service and that helps further separate our brand from our peers.","We continue to gain market share and we're improving our share of wallet in both of our customer segments. We produced revenue growth in a challenging environment. We remain focused on pricing and underwriting discipline as you heard. We've also completed the acquisition of Macquarie Equipment Finance and look forward to integrating their business into our franchise.","And finally, our Board and the management team, we're all long-term shareholders, so we remain focused on managing the risk, reducing volatility, while yet investing for top line growth and delivering positive operating leverage consistent with our expectations of long-term performance. So, thank you for your interest in Huntington. Have a great day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call.

Dan Neumeyer, Chief Credit Officer will also participate in Q&A portion of the call.","Let\u2019s get started by turning to slide six. Steve?","Steve Steinour","Thanks Todd. I\u2019d like to thank everyone on the call for joining us today. At Huntington, we enjoy a unique and advantaged position in the industry and we believe our future is bright. We\u2019re focused on executing our strategic plan and we\u2019re very pleased with results we are achieving. For the past several years, we\u2019ve invested in the company at a time when most of the industry\u2019s been pulling back. We\u2019ve expanded and optimized our distribution, both physical and digital. We\u2019ve invested in small business and commercial specialty lending verticals. We\u2019ve added new products such as our consumer and commercial credit cards and our new business in consumer checking accounts. And each represents just a handful of the investments we\u2019ve made. Our 2014 earnings reflected results from these investments, yet significant opportunity remains as none of these investments are mature. We have a strong outlook for the future.","Slides six and seven show some of the financial highlights of the full year and the fourth quarter. Mac will go through more of the detail shortly, but I wanted to highlight a few of these items that I believe distinguish Huntington and illustrate our strategic execution.","Huntington had a solid year in 2014, reporting net income of $632 million or $0.72 per common share while absorbing $0.06 per share of significant items. Return on assets for the year was 1.01% and the return on common tangible equity was 11.8%. Underlying fundamental trends were somewhat obscured by a net $75 million of significant items over the two years specifically.","In 2014, results were negatively impacted by a net $65 million of significant items, while 2013 results benefited from a net $10 million of significant items. So, these significant items were largely related to two acquisitions and other strategic decisions that we believe would better position franchise for improved efficiency and profitability going forward. There are additional details regarding significant items on slides 22 and 23.","For the full year, we reported a $3.6 billion or 9% in average loans and leases. Revenues increased to $100 million or 4% in 2014. Importantly, we delivered positive operating leverage for the second year in a row, a commitment we have renewed for 2015 and in fact installed in our updated long term financial goals.","We continue to post industry leading customer acquisition rates with 10% growth in consumer checking households and 3% growth in commercial relationships over the past year. Now, with respect to the commercial growth rate, like to remind you that early in 2014, we implemented some changes to our business banking products which caused approximately 10,000 lower balance accounts to be closed over the course of the year. So, the underlying core fundamentals were actually much stronger.","We also continued to sell deeper across both our consumer and commercial relationships. So, almost half of our consumer relationships now have six or more products and services from Huntington while 42% of the commercial relationships have a cross-sell of 4% or higher.","Fourth quarter net income of $164 million represented a 3% year-over-year increase while EPS of $0.19 was a penny higher than the year ago quarter. Return on assets for the fourth quarter 1% and return on tangible common equity was 11.9%. The 2014 fourth quarter included $20 million of significant items while the year ago quarter included $7 million of significant items.","Total revenues for the fourth quarter increased $25 million or 4% from the year ago quarter, despite a $10 million headwind in mortgage banking income. A 10% increase in net interest income drove the overall revenue growth as a 13% increase in average earning assets more than offset continued pressure on the net interest margin. Our NIM decreased 10 basis points year-over-year but only 2 basis points from the third quarter. We remain focused on minimizing this net interest margin compression to disciplined pricing of loans in the face of increasing competition for quality loans in our markets and through continued improvement in our funding mix via our focus on core checking account, relationship growth and balance growth.","While there is limited opportunity remaining in terms of the positive pricing levers, we still have significant opportunity remaining to increase non-interest bearing deposits and further improve our funding mix.","The increase in our securities portfolio related to compliance with the Basel III liquidity coverage rules -- ratio rules has also negatively impacted our margin. And we expect additional further pressure as we continue to add approximately $1 billion incremental assets to the portfolio in 2015.","We continue to enjoy improvements in our credit quality. We stated last quarter that we expect credit metrics will begin to stabilize given where we are in the credit cycle but this quarter exhibited particularly strong credit performance. Net charge-offs in the fourth quarter were 20 basis points, bringing net charge-offs for the full year to 27 basis points, both well below our long-term target of 35 basis points to 55 basis points. This quarter\u2019s net charge-offs benefited from some large recoveries within our C&I book as well as net recoveries in our commercial real estate portfolio. I should add, for the fifth consecutive quarter.","Capital rations remained strong. We continue to be good stewards of shareholder capital via disciplined balance sheet growth and capital return. At the end of the year, tangible common equity ratio was 8.17%, down 65 basis points from a year ago and 18 basis points from the last quarter. Tier 1 common risk-based capital ratio was 10.23%, down 67 basis points year-over-year and 8 basis points sequentially. Despite these declines, tangible book value per share increased 6% year-over-year to $6.62 due to our share repurchase program. For the full year, we repurchased almost 36 million shares at an average cost of $9.37 per share.","During 2014, we returned approximately 84% of earnings to common shareholders to the combination of dividend and buyback. Just to repeat, approximately 84% of earnings to common shareholders to the combination of dividend and buyback.","During the fourth quarter, our cash dividend increased to 20% and we repurchased 3.6 million shares. We have approximately $52 million of remaining share repurchase capacity through the end of the 2015 first quarter and we intend to complete this authorization.","Slide eight has a few additional highlights for the fourth quarter. First, as we continue optimize distribution to better reflect changes in customer behavior, we completed the consolidation of 26 branches at year end. We introduced our new Huntington 5 and Huntington 25 checking account products, as we continue to improve customer choice and value related to our industry leading checking account products.","Once again Huntington was recognized for our superior customer service, this time honored as the highest ranking in customer satisfaction with small business banking in the Midwest region by J.D. Power. And finally, in December, we disclosed our new long-term through the cycle financial goals.","You will not see what we consider material changes from our prior goals but rather refine them as we reexamine the franchise and banking environment. We have replaced our former ROA target with the goal of return on tangible common equity in order to bring focus on this measure of profitability while closely aligned with value creation for our shareholders. There is a slight increase in our efficiency ratio from the prior mid-50s level which is an acknowledgement of the higher inherent cost of today\u2019s banking industry from increased regulatory burdens.","Last, you will see that a new goal is positive operating leverage annually. We\u2019re committed to and delivered positive operating leverage in each of the past two years; we\u2019re committed to delivering positive operating leverage again in 2015. And this new goal formerly recognized as this is an integral for the company going forward.","So, with that let me turn it over to Mac for a more detailed review of the numbers. Mac?","Mac McCullough","Thanks Steve and good morning everyone. Slide nine is a summary of our quarterly trends and key performance metrics. Steve already touched on several of these, so let\u2019s move on to slide 10 and drill into the underlying details.","Relative to last year\u2019s fourth quarter, total revenue increased $25 million or 4% to $714 million. Spread revenue accounted for the entire increase as net interest income grew 10%. Driving net interest income growth was a $7 billion or 13% increase in average earning assets. Loans made up $4 billion of the increase with the remainder of the growth in the securities portfolio including $1.3 billion of direct purchase municipal instruments originated by our commercial lending teams. The net interest margin declined 10 basis points year-over-year to 3.18% in the fourth quarter of 2014. This decrease reflected a 17 basis-point contraction in earning asset yields including 4 basis points related to the increase in the size of the securities portfolio as we prepare for the upcoming Basel III liquidity coverage ratio requirement and a 3 basis-point decline in the benefit from the non-interest bearing funds. These reductions were partially offset by 10 basis points of improvement in funding costs.","On a linked quarter basis, the net interest margin compressed 2 basis points exclusively related to declining earning asset yields.","Fourth quarter fee income of $233 million which represented a $17 million or 7% decline from the year ago quarter. Lower mortgage banking income accounted for $10 million of the decline while the remainder of the decrease primarily related to lower fees associated with commercial customer activity in the other income line. Negative impacts to fee income during the fourth quarter included $6 million of net MSR hedging related activity and a full quarter\u2019s impact of July\u2019s changes to our consumer deposit accounts which were previously estimated as $5 million per quarter. On a positive note, we continue to see the benefits of consumer and commercial customer growth with both electronic banking and capital markets revenue increasing more than 10% year-over-year.","Reported non-interest expense in the fourth quarter was $483 million, an increase of $37 million or 8% from a year ago quarter. The current quarter included two significant items impacting non-interest expense. You might want to refer to table two in the press release or page 22 of the presentation as I walk through these items.","First, we incurred $9 million of franchise repositioning expense related to the consolidation of 26 branches at year-end and other organizational actions announced last year; second, we had a $12 million addition to the litigation reserve. After adjusting for significant items, non-interest expense increased $24 million or 5% from a year ago quarter. Of this increase, $4 million related to the incremental impacts from the Camco acquisition and the Bank of America branch transaction. Other contributing factors included an increase in healthcare cost, higher professional service expense and higher equipment expense related to technology investments. Table eight and nine in the press release provide more detail related to non-interest expense.","Compared to the third quarter and also adjusting for significant items in both quarters, adjusted expenses increased $5 million. The primary drivers of the linked quarter increase were higher healthcare cost and professional services expense.","Slide 11 displays the trends in our earning asset mix, net interest income and net interest margin. As I mentioned earlier, average loans increased $4 billion or 9% year-over-year. The indirect auto and commercial and industrial or C&I accounted for more than $3 billion of this loan growth, although we experienced growth in every portfolio. The indirect auto loan portfolio increased $2 or 31% from a year ago quarter as originations remain strong and we continue to portfolio all of our production.","As shown on slide 54 in the appendix, we continue to focus on the super prime space and have not sacrificed credit quality to drive volume. In addition, we continue to drive improvements in pricing. On last quarter\u2019s earnings call, we announced that we achieved price increases late in the quarter. Earlier this month we raised pricing again. As a result, new money yields averaged 3.08% during the fourth quarter and more recently, new money yields have been in the 3.10%. We continue to expect two auto loan securitizations during 2015 as we manage loan concentrations.","Average C&I loans increased more than $1 billion or 7% year-over-year, primarily reflecting trade finance in support of our middle market and corporate banking customers. The chart on the left side shows the net interest margin trend which we previously discussed.","Turning to slide 12, the right side of this slide shows quarterly trends in our deposit mix and average cost of deposits, while the left side illustrates the maturity schedule of our CD book. Average core deposits in the 2014 fourth quarter increased $2.9 billion or 6% year-over-year. This increase benefited from $1.1 billion of core deposits acquired in the Camco acquisition and the Bank of America branch transaction. We remain focused on remixing our deposit base by increasing low cost core deposits while reducing our dependence on higher cost CDs.","Average non-interest bearing demand deposits increased $1.8 billion or 14% as compared to the 2013 fourth quarter, while average money market deposits increased $1.6 billion or 9%. Growth in these categories more than offset the intentional $0.9 billion or 22% decline in average core certificates of deposit.","As show in the chart on the left side of the slide, the opportunity to reduce CD cost has diminished but remained focused on the opportunity to drive further improvement in the mix. There are two pieces of funding mix dynamic that you do not see on the slide. First, average short and long-term borrowings increased $2.9 billion or 78% year-over-year which includes $1.25 billion of bank debt issued during 2014. Second, average broker deposits increased $1 billion or 74% from the 2013 fourth quarter. Both of these funding sources provide a cost efficient means for funding balance sheet growth including LCR related securities growth while maintaining an intense focus on managing our core deposit expense.","Slide 13 shows the trends in our capital ratios. We remain well capitalized with reductions in our capital ratios throughout 2014 being driven by robust balance sheet growth as well as our active capital management strategies. We repurchased $334 million of our common stock over the course of the year including $35 million during the fourth quarter. At year-end, we had approximately $53 million of capacity remaining under our share repurchase authorization which we intend to complete in the first quarter of 2015.","Slide 14 provides an overview of our credit quality trends. Credit performance remains quite strong and in line with our expectations. Net charge-offs decreased to 20 26 basis points in the fourth quarter, an improvement over both the prior and year ago quarters and well below our long-term expectation of 35 basis points to 55 basis points.","Net charge-offs this quarter benefited from the fifth consecutive quarter of net recoveries within our commercial real estate portfolio as well as a couple large recoveries within the C&I book. Non-performing assets and non-performing loans also posted continued improvement. The allowance for credit losses eased modestly consistent with the improvements in the overall portfolio. Criticized assets represented one of the few credit metrics that increased sequentially with about half of the increase due to two large unrelated credits that moved into special mention this quarter.","Slide 15 shows the trends in our non-performing assets. The charts on the left demonstrate continued improvement, albeit at a reduced rate. The charts on the right show the NPA inflows which also improved modestly from the prior quarter.","Turning to slide 16, the loan loss provision decreased to $2.4 million in the fourth quarter, reflecting primarily continued improvement within the commercial real estate portfolio. The allowance-to-loan ratio decreased to 1.40%, down 7 basis points sequentially and 25 basis points year-over-year. The ratio of allowance to non-accrual loans improved to 222% up slightly from the prior quarter and roughly in line with the year ago. We believe the allowance is appropriate and reflects the continued improvement in the underlying credit quality of our loan portfolio.","Let me now turn the presentation back over to Steve.","Steve Steinour","Thank you, Mac. Turning to slide 17, as I alluded to in my opening remarks, our fair play banking philosophy, coupled with our optimal customer relationship or OCR continues to drive new customer growth and improved product penetration. This slide illustrates the continued upward trend in consumer checking account households. And over the last year, consumer checking account households grew by 129,000 households or 10%. And the fourth quarter was relatively unchanged from the prior quarter due to seasonality, costumer activity and a reduction of our marketing programs made earlier in the year.","If we exclude the impact of the Camco and Bank of America branch acquisitions, organic growth in consumer checking households was a healthy 6% for the year. Our strategy is not just about market share gains but also gains in share of wallet. We continue to focus on increasing the number of products and services we provide to the customers knowing that this will translate into revenue growth. Our OCR cross-sell goal of six or more products and services improved to almost 50% in our consumer account households this quarter, up more than 174 basis points from a year ago. Correspondingly, our consumer checking account household revenue for the fourth quarter is up 12% year-over-year.","You can see on slide 18, commercial relationship growth has returned as we\u2019ve worked through the impact to the changes made in our business banking checking products that impacted a number of lower balance accounts. Commercial relationships increased 3% year-over-year. Excluding the impacts of the Camco and Bank of America branch acquisitions, organic growth in commercial relationships was 2% for the year.","Our former product OCR cross-sell for commercial relationships improved almost 42% this quarter, up more than 4% from a year ago. Commercial relationship revenue for the fourth quarter grew 12% year-over-year.","Slide 19 shows that we once again delivered on our commitment for positive operating leverage for the full year 2014. We\u2019re recommitted to delivering positive operating leverage for the full year 2015. And as I noted earlier, positive operating leverage is now long-term goal for the company.","Turning to slide 20 for some closing remarks and expectations. As we enter 2015, we\u2019re bullish on the economy and our footprint, particularly for consumers with home prices rebounding, at least a near term opportunity for additional mortgage refinancing and the benefit as the dramatic recent decline in energy cost just starting to be appreciated. State governments in our footprint are all operating with surpluses and most municipalities are on solid footing.","Automobile sales were very strong last year and appear poised for another great if not even better year 2015. Our loan pipelines are stable; they are consistent with fourth quarter. And we remain optimistic regarding the outlook for continued growth.","We\u2019ll continue to reinvest cash flows of approximately $100 million to $125 million per month from existing investment securities into LCR-compliant, high-quality liquid assets. In addition, we expect to add another $1 billion of additional level one HQLA as we prepare for LCR. Our portion of portion of the commercial team\u2019s production also will continue to be placed in the securities book. We expect NIM pressure will remain a headwind until interest rates start moving back up but we expect to grow revenue despite this pressure. We are maintaining our pricing discipline.","We continue to monitor the securitization market and will look to use it as a tool to manage our overall concentration of indirect auto loans. We expect to do two securitizations in 2015. We will continue to invest in the franchise with expected expense growth of 2% to 4% for the full year.","Excluding significant items if any and net MSR activity, we\u2019re committed to positive operating leverage on an annual basis which means revenue growth exceeding expense growth. We will grow revenues in \u201815, both fee and net interest income. We will not change our underwriting standards. We are long-term shareholders in management and at the board level.","I\u2019m pleased to report we\u2019ve got good momentum in many of our business lines. And in my opinion this is the best entry position for a new year we\u2019ve had in my tenure here over the last six years.","Finally, we continue to expect to see stabilization in credit trends. We expect net charge-offs will remain at or below our long-term expected range of 35 basis points to 55 basis points. Provision was below our long-term expectations during this past quarter. Both are expected to continue to experience modest changes, given their absolute low levels. Longer term, we\u2019re managing the franchise to deliver consistent, strong shareholder returns. We\u2019ve built a strong consumer brand with differentiated products and superior customer service. And we\u2019re executing our strategies and adjusting to operating environments whenever necessary. And there is a high level of alignment between employees and shareholders. We are both cognizant of and highly focused on our commitment to being the stewards of shareholders\u2019 capital.","So, with that, let me turn it back to Todd.","Todd Beekman","Operator, we\u2019ll now take questions and ask for the courtesy of your peers, each person ask only one question and one related follow-up. And if that person has additional questions, we ask to add themselves back to the queue. Thank you. Anastasia?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Scott Siefers with Sandler O\u2019Neill. Your line is open.","Todd Beekman","Good morning, Scott.","Scott Siefers - Sandler O\u2019Neill","Good morning, guys. Actually Mac, maybe first one is for you. You talked about possibility of margin pressure and gave kind of the puts and takes. So, I wonder if you can spend -- expecting just talking about order of magnitude of margin pressure. I mean the funding remix that\u2019s an opportunity but the LCR, still bit of a headwind. You\u2019ve been doing maybe 1 or 2 basis points of core compression a quarter for a while. Is that still something seems fair going forward?","Mac McCullough","Well, thanks Scott, thanks for the question. I think the way to think about it, we continue to see compression in certain loan portfolios as we see the re-pricing take place. Certainly there are some portfolios where we\u2019ve already crossed that line but we\u2019re not seeing significant or any re-pricing. We will see some pressure as we add securities for LCR. We\u2019ll about 1 billion incremental along with kind of having to repurchase about 100 million to 130 million a month from maturities. So, those things will add the margin pressure as well.","Certainly there is not much room on the deposit side going forward. We do continue to grow demand deposits very nicely. And that is certainly going to help as we remix the deposits but continued pressure on the margin that will be outpaced by earning asset growth in 2015.","Scott Siefers - Sandler O\u2019Neill","Okay. Thank you. And maybe just separate question. So, I think we have a good sense for how you think on auto pricing, given your comments, Mac. But maybe Mac or Steve, just given the amount of attention that auto lending gets these days, if you could spend maybe another second, talking about sort of growth and credit prospects as you see from your position.","Steve Steinour","We have been very consistent with our auto lending we show to you every quarter. If you look back over the last five years, our FICO bands are credibly tight [ph] our loan to values, new use moves a little bit depending on the year and new production by the auto manufacturers. But we\u2019re very bullish on auto. We think we\u2019re going to come off a very good year and have an even better one. Certainly there is consumer benefit coming by a refinance potential that exists today compounded with the lower price of the pump for gas, should help drive auto to even -- to no worse than last year. We\u2019re optimistic it\u2019s going to be a better year on the whole. And our discipline will remain in place and we expect our performance to continue at or better than prior periods.","Scott Siefers - Sandler O\u2019Neill","All right. That\u2019s perfect. Thank you very much, guys.","Steve Steinour","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","Hey guys, this is actually Josh [ph] covering for Ken. Can you speak to what you saw in mortgage banking this quarter? We saw from other banks that this held up a little stronger and you guys saw a little more weakness.","Mac McCullough","What we saw on a year-over-year basis, we did have an MSR gain in the fourth quarter of 2013, we had MSR increase in the fourth quarter of 2014. So, I think that certainly impacted us quite a bit. Other than that, I think our production stats were in line with what we saw in the industry. And we certainly are seeing a pickup as we see what\u2019s happening today in the market. So, we do expect a better improvement in this line in 2015.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. And then just more generally, can you speak to the revenue drivers for fee income in \u201815 where you are expecting to see the most growth or less growth?","Mac McCullough","We certainly have seen a few areas in the fee income area that are showing strength due to our growth in households and also businesses as Steve mentioned earlier. We see capital markets increasing; we see the ATM and debit card fees increasing significantly both double-digit growth in the quarter. We do expect to see a better growth in non-interest income in 2015 relative to what we saw in 2014 as we probably bottomed out in mortgage. And again, as we discussed earlier, we are going to see good earning asset growth that will certainly offset any progression we see in 2015.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, great. Thanks for the time guys.","Todd Beekman","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mathew O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Mathew O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank","Good morning.","Todd Beekman","Good morning, Matt.","Mathew O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank","I was wondering if you could elaborate on the two credits that drove the increase in criticized assets. I guess first what industries were they in?","Dan Neumeyer","Hey Matt, this is Dan. Yes, one was in metals, the supplier to the auto industry and the other was in natural resources, both legacy credits, both we feel very positive about their ultimate disposition. But we\u2019re trying to call these things early and make sure that we leave all of our options open for resolution. So, that comprise the majority of what would be considered more than normal inflow. And then we also have throughout the fourth quarter taken a very deep dive into all portfolios as we attempt to stay in front of any development front and still again calling the credits early and giving ourselves every opportunity for rehabilitation.","Mathew O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank","And I know there are some moving pieces because most of the credit metrics were quite good in terms of charge-offs, non-performers. But as you think about the higher criticized assets and then the loan loss reserve release this quarter, I guess I\u2019m surprised how much reserve release there was given the increase in criticized assets.","Mac McCullough","Yes. So, there is a lot of components as to how we look at making sure we have an adequate and appropriate ACL. And most of the metrics as you know were very strong. So, we had a really low level of charge-offs, NPAs coming down and improving economy. And so, when you factor all those in and if we see a trend developing, we\u2019ll modify. But we don\u2019t believe we\u2019ve seen a trend here. We think this is one quarter phenomenon and the increase in criticized. So, we feel very good about the level of ACL today. And again, we continue to have improvements in the C&I portfolio, continued recoveries in CRE which drove a lot of the reduction. So, on the whole we think we\u2019re right where we need to be.","Mathew O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank","And as we think about the reserve levels going forward, we think of them being closer to charge-offs or you start building a little bit or\u2026?","Mac McCullough","Well clearly, we don\u2019t expect -- we\u2019re at our -- lower than where we expect to be on charge-offs, so I certainly don\u2019t see things getting better on that front from here. So, I think you can make you own assessment of that.","Mathew O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Bob Ramsey with FBR. Your line is open","Todd Beekman","Hey Bob.","Bob Ramsey - FBR","Hey, good morning guys. I was hoping you could just touch on the sort of some of the through the cycle long-term goals. You talked about specifically your new return on tangible common equity goal and the efficiency number. Are those numbers that you hope to be able to touch at some point in 2015 or are these numbers that you really need higher rates or some other catalysts or bring you into that zone?","Mac McCullough","Yes. Thanks Bob, it\u2019s Mac. So, you certainly touched on one variable that is going to impact how soon we achieve the bottom end of some of these ranges and that is the rate environment. But clearly we\u2019re doing other things to make sure that we move in that direction. We\u2019ve talked about positive operating leverage; we\u2019ve talked about making sure that we manage our expense base as it relates to the revenue opportunity that we have in any one year. And that certainly is going to continue to move us towards the efficiency ratio target. As it relates to tangible common equity, we are continuing to make the right investments in the businesses that we think have the best returns going forward. We are looking through opportunities to optimize the existing balance sheet and in some cases making sure that we are being efficient in how we\u2019re using our balance sheet and certainly investing in higher return on equity businesses.","So, this is going to be -- it\u2019s not going to happen overnight but certainly the things that we do every day, they head in the right direction are going to help us get there. And I would expect late 2015, 2016, we\u2019ll start to see the achievement of some of these ratios.","Bob Ramsey - FBR","And will you see them in late 2015 or 2016 even if rates don\u2019t move up as sort of as expected or do you really need that rate move? I know it is helpful but is it absolutely necessary I guess?","Mac McCullough","Yes. What I\u2019ll commit to is we\u2019re going to continue to make progress in the right direction and that rates will certainly help us get there but there are a lot of other things that we\u2019re doing that are going to help us achieve those ratios.","Bob Ramsey - FBR","Okay. And then I guess similarly as you\u2019ll talk about your revenue growth expectations and any outlook for this year, does it move materially if there is -- if you do get a 50 basis-point move in rates in the back half of 2015, does it materially move the revenue numbers for 2015 or is it more of an impact the year after?","Mac McCullough","Well clearly, it would be a larger impact for the year after, given any rate change later in the year really going to partial your benefit. Clearly, we\u2019ll get some pickup as rates increase. And certainly midyear or later seems to be what would be the best we can hope for. But the bigger impact would come in 2016.","Bob Ramsey - FBR","Okay, all right. Thank you guys.","Todd Beekman","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jon Arfstrom with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Jon Arfstrom - RBC Capital Markets","Hey, thanks. Good morning guys.","Todd Beekman","Good morning, Jon.","Jon Arfstrom - RBC Capital Markets","Just clarification, maybe for Dan or Mac on the provision. Are you saying you expect the provision to come back in line with charge-offs against during 2015?","Dan Neumeyer","Actually we didn\u2019t say that. We are at a low point in terms of charge-offs. So, provision was lower this quarter than we have seen. Much of it\u2019s going to depend on loan growth and the state of the economy. But I would say it\u2019s probably likely the provision is not going to remain at this level or lower on a go forward basis.","Mac McCullough","Yes. Jon, it\u2019s Mac. Obviously the provision is the outcome of how we think about we need from an appropriate reserve perspective and we just have a lot of very positive actions in the fourth quarter that in this provision number. I think the inflow of classified that we saw that\u2019s criticized that is obviously incorporated into the fourth quarter number. And we do feel comfortable with credit quality where it\u2019s out there. So, clearly we\u2019re at a low level relative to what we expect longer term. There could be some volatility as we move forward because we are at such a low level but I think a lot of things came together in the right direction this quarter to make that happen.","Jon Arfstrom - RBC Capital Markets","Okay, good. Just another clarification point on the operating leverage number. Are you assuming $1.8 billion expense base in terms of expense growth before we go to the expense number?","Mac McCullough","That\u2019s correct.","Jon Arfstrom - RBC Capital Markets","Okay. And then just one more if I can Steve, you talked a little bit about energy prices. You do have some Marcellus and Utica overlap; on the other hand you have a big consumer base. How do you think about the puts and takes of low energy prices?","Steve Steinour","I think it\u2019s tremendous for our region, both at the consumer but I\u2019d also say at a commercial level our businesses whether they are manufacturers, distributor services, they are going to benefit from lower energy costs, price of the pump whatever. Our energy exposure is very modest; it\u2019s part of strategy purposeful selection and a particularly slice in that market and if you will a go slow approach to make sure we are fully absorbing what we were -- and understanding what as we thought a little portfolio.","Jon Arfstrom - RBC Capital Markets","Okay, all right. Thank you.","Steve Steinour","Thank you.","Todd Beekman","Thanks Jon.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your next question comes from Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous Research. Your line is open.","Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research","Hi. It\u2019s Geoff Elliot from Autonomous. On the natural resources, you mentioned that one of the new criticized loans was in that sector. So, could you just give us a bit more of detail on what the total exposure to that sector looks like and kind of how it breaks down between oil and gas, mining other kind of components of natural resources?","Mac McCullough","Okay. Let\u2019s say that\u2019s a pretty broad category. When we talk about what we have; natural resources is the broadest of categories. Our E&P book which is how has been our energy vertical that has about 500 million of commitment and about 300 million or so in outstanding. And that is largely reserve base, syndicated deals that have broad geographic diversity. The entire energy category can define at a number of different ways but I think in terms of the oil and gas has primarily reserve based lending and\u2026","Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research","About oil versus gas and\u2026","Mac McCullough","Sure. And our energy book is weighted towards natural gas. We do have about half dozen of ores that are oil heavy but the majority of the book is weighted towards natural gas. And again, reserve base, for the most part we do have a few midstream names in there as well. And I should emphasize that in that portfolio none of that was in the -- moved to criticized.","Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research","Okay. So, in [indiscernible] natural resources?","Mac McCullough","Correct.","Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research","Great, thank you very much.","Todd Beekman","Thank you, Geoff.","Operator","Your next question comes from Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Your line is open.","Todd Beekman","Good morning, Erika.","Erika Najarian - Bank of America","Hi, everybody. I just had one follow-up question; I just wanted to make sure that I got the message clearly. And I think you are giving us so much detail for \u201815. The message that I\u2019m getting is regardless of the rate backdrop in the short end or long end, Huntington will grow revenues in \u201815 and post positive operating leverage.","Mac McCullough","Right Erika, it\u2019s Mac. So, we are going to manage the expense base based on a revenue environment to achieve positive operating leverage. So, we do continue to see good earning asset growth which we believe will overcome any NIM pressure that we have in 2015. And we are going to see better growth in fee income in 2015 as well. So, yes, I think the positive operating leverage comment is a strong comment that we are committed to.","Erika Najarian - Bank of America","Got it. Thank you.","Todd Beekman","Thanks Erika.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I turn the call back over to the presenters.","Steve Steinour","So, in summary, we\u2019re pleased with our performance for the full year 2014 and especially the fourth quarter. Results reflected the disciplined execution of our strategies and the strong competitive position of Huntington and our brand highlighted by superior customer service which is separating us from our peers. We continue to gain market share and improved share of wallet. We\u2019ve produced 4% annual revenue growth and positive operating leverage in a challenging. We also took demonstrable steps to improve efficiency and optimize the franchise.","And finally, our board and this management team, we are all long-term shareholders; we remain focused on actively managing risk, reducing volatility while investing for top line growth achieving positive operating leverage. We\u2019re here to drive long-term performance. So thank you for your interest in Huntington and have a great day.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s conference call.

As noted on Slide 5, participants are: Steve Steinour, Chairman, President and CEO; Dave Anderson, Interim Chief Financial Officer; and Dan Neumeyer, our Chief Credit Officer. Let's get started. Slide 6.","David S. Anderson","Thank you, Todd. I will review our 2013 fourth quarter and full year financial results. Then, Dan will provide an update on credit. Finally, Steve will give an update on household and commercial relationship growth, as well as expectations for 2014.","Turning to Slide 7. 2013 was a solid year for Huntington. For the full year, we reported net income of $639 million or $0.72 per common share. This resulted in a 1.13% return on average assets and a 12% return on average tangible common equity.","Fully tax equivalent revenue was $2.7 billion, a decrease of $99 million or 3% from last year. Net interest income increased $1 million. The net interest margin was 3.36% for 2013, which is consistent with our guidance that NIM would be in the mid-3.30s for the full year.","Total average loans grew by 4%, primarily due to growth in commercial and industrial loans, as well as auto. Average commercial and industrial loans grew by $1.2 billion or 8%. Average auto loans grew by $1.2 billion or 25% because we have kept more of these loans on our balance sheet instead of selling them through securitizations.","Commercial Real Estate loans declined $0.8 billion or 13%, but as we've been signaling for the last several quarters, the portfolio ended the year at just under $5 billion and is expected to stabilize.","Noninterest income declined $100 million or 9%. Mortgage banking income was down $64 million, and gains on sale of loans were down $40 million due to no auto securitizations in 2013. Service charges increased $10 million in 2013 despite a decrease of $28 million due to a change that we made in February on posting order for our consumer transaction accounts.","Noninterest expense declined $78 million or 4% from last year. If you adjust for the $34 million of significant items, noninterest expense declined by $44 million or 2%. This decrease was primarily due to lower marketing, deposit and other insurance, professional services and other expense. Other expense declined because of lower mortgage repurchase and warranty and OREO and foreclosure expenses. We continue to focus on controlling expenses as we make prudent investments for the future.","Steve will provide additional details later in the call, but you can see that our Optimal Customer Relationship, or OCR methodology, is working. Consumer household and commercial relationships continue to grow in 2013 at a pace well above that of our regional footprint. And importantly, customers are building deeper relationships with Huntington.","Let's turn to Slide 8. Dan will cover credit in more detail later in the call, but on Slide 8, you can see that credit quality improved in 2013. Nonaccrual loans decreased $86 million or 21% from the end of 2012. Net charge-offs were $189 million or 45 basis points in 2013 as compared to $342 million or 85 basis points in 2012.","Our capital continues to be strong. At the end of 2013, the Tier 1 common risk-based capital ratio was 10.90%, and tangible common equity ratio was 8.83%.","I will now discuss the 2013 fourth quarter financial results as compared to the 2013 third quarter. Net income for the fourth quarter was $158 million or $0.18 per common share as compared to $178 million or $0.20 per common share in the third quarter. As you may recall, the third quarter included 2 significant items: The pension curtailment gain of $34 million; and branch closure and other restructuring costs of $70 million. The fourth quarter also had $7 million of additional branch closure and other restructuring costs. If you adjust for these significant items, net income and earnings per share were very similar between the third and the fourth quarter.","Fully tax equivalent revenue for the fourth quarter was $685 million or an increase of $3 million compared to the third quarter. Net interest income increased $7 million. The increase in net interest income was due to a larger balance sheet. On a linked-quarter basis, average loans increased by 11%, while average core deposits at a linked-quarter basis increased by 9%. Loan growth accelerated in the second half of 2013 as compared to the first half. We've also increased average investment securities in the fourth quarter. The net interest margin declined 6 basis points to 3.28% in the fourth quarter.","Noninterest income declined $4 million, primarily due to lower deposit service charges. Mortgage banking income for the fourth quarter was $24 million, which was close to our expected quarterly revenue of $25 million for the mortgage business.","Noninterest expense increased $23 million in the fourth quarter. If you adjust noninterest expense for the $24 million of significant items across both quarters, which I previously discussed, noninterest expense was essentially flat for the last 2 quarters.","Noninterest expense in the fourth quarter was $446 million. As I previously mentioned, the fourth quarter included $7 million of branch closure and other restructuring costs. If you adjust for this significant item, noninterest expense was below $440 million in the fourth quarter.","Included on Slide 9 are some highlights that I would like to mention. In the fourth quarter, we purchased $1.9 billion of investment securities in advance of the Basel III liquidity coverage requirements. At the end of 2013, we reclassified $600 million of direct purchase municipal instruments from C&I loans to available-for-sale investment securities on our balance sheet.","Huntington was the second-largest SBA lender in the nation during the fourth quarter, moving up 1 spot from our #3 rating for the full year. There are a number of awards listed in the last bullet point on this slide, but the most recent was that Huntington was named the Top Performing Bank, over $50 billion in the nation by Bank Director Magazine.","One additional item that I would like to discuss is the impact of the Volcker Rule on our TruPS CDO portfolio. At December 31, 2013, we had investments in 10 different pools of trust-preferred securities. Eight of our pools are included on the nonexclusive list that are exempt from the Volcker Rule that the Federal Banking Agency released in an interim rule on Tuesday. We have analyzed the other 2 pools that were not included on the list and believe that we will be able to continue to own these investments under the Volcker Rule.","Slide 10 is a summary of our quarterly earnings trends and key performance metrics. While this is a great snapshot of our recent trends, many items were discussed elsewhere, so I will move on to the next slide.","On Slide 11, we show the breakdown of operating leverage for 2013. In this slide, we measure the percentage change in revenue and expenses, adjusted for significant items and for volatility for MSR, auto securitizations and last year's bargain purchase gain from the Fidelity acquisition. For 2013, we delivered on our commitment and recorded positive operating leverage. The economy started the year much weaker than we expected, so we made adjustments throughout the year. We continue to be committed to delivering positive operating leverage in 2014.","Slide 12 displays the trends of our net interest income and margin. The right side of this slide shows a 6-basis-point decline in our net interest margin in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter. There are a few items worth noting that drive this change. Beyond the regular pressure we have been experiencing on loan repricing due to the competitive environment, there are a number of items that reduced NIM by about 1 basis point each. We added $1.9 billion of investment securities in the fourth quarter. One-month LIBOR was lower in the fourth quarter, and derivative income was lower on our commercial book. NIM will be under pressure, but with a larger balance sheet, our outlook is for moderate increase in net interest income in 2014.","The right side of Slide 13 shows the improvement in our deposit mix. The improved deposit mix reflects the success of our Fair Play banking strategy on remixing and growing consumer and commercial, no and low-cost deposits. The improving mix has contributed to the 10-basis-point decline in the average rate paid on total deposits over the last 5 quarters. On the left side of the slide, you will see the maturity schedule of our CD book, which represents a potential opportunity for continuing to lower deposit costs, as about $2.6 billion of CDs are rolling off at an average rate of 95 basis points, and new CDs are coming out between 20 and 40 basis points. Related to these last 2 slides, please refer to Slide 40, which provides additional granularity on the breakout of fixed versus variable assets and liabilities.","Slide 14 provides a summary of the income statement for the last 5 quarters. I covered the quarterly changes in my previous comments. We will continue to focus on expenses and have changed the pace and level of investment to deliver on our positive operating leverage commitment.","Finally, Slide 15 shows the trends in capital. The tangible common equity ratio increased 7 basis points over the last year. Tier 1 common risk-based capital increased 42 basis points to 10.90%. We did not do any share repurchases in the fourth quarter.","Before we get to Q&A, let me remind you that we are not in a position to talk about our CCAR submission.","Let me turn the presentation over to Dan Neumeyer to review credit trends. Dan?","Daniel J. Neumeyer","Thanks, Dave. Slide 16 provides an overview of our credit quality trends. Credit quality showed continued improvement in the quarter, with positive results in all major areas. The net charge-off ratio fell to 43 basis points, well within our long-term target of 35 to 55 basis points. The 43 basis points includes $10.2 million or about 9 basis points related to Chapter 7 bankruptcy loans that were not identified in the 2012 fourth quarter implementation of the OCC's regulatory guidance.","During the course of the third and fourth quarters, we conducted a detailed review of all bankruptcy loans and are confident that existing charge-offs relating to the 2012 guidance have been recognized. On a go-forward basis, we expect modest additional charge-offs based on new bankruptcy flow activity.","Loans past due greater than 90 days and still accruing were lower at 18 basis points, down from 22 basis points the prior quarter. The nonaccrual loan ratio showed continued improvement in the quarter, falling to 75 basis points. The NPA ratio have showed similar improvement, falling from 88 basis points to 82 basis points. Also, the criticized asset ratio decreased from 4.31% to 3.91%. The allowance for loan and lease loss and the allowance for credit loss to loans ratio fell in the quarter from 1.5% and 1.65% respectively, down from 1.57% and 1.72% in the prior quarter, reflecting continued asset quality improvement. The ALLL and ACL coverage ratios both remain healthy.","Slide 17 shows the trends in our nonperforming assets. The chart on the left demonstrates a continued reduction in our NPAs falling another 6% in the fourth quarter. The chart on the right shows the NPA inflows, which were down modestly in the quarter to 26 basis points of beginning of period loans. We expect a continued positive trend going forward.","Slide 18 provides a reconciliation of our nonperforming asset flows. This quarter saw a reduction in inflows, which, combined with loans returning to accruing status, payments and charge-offs, led to a 6% reduction in NPAs in the quarter. For the year, NPAs fell by 21%.","Turning to Slide 19, we provide a similar flow analysis of commercial criticized loans. This quarter saw a sizable reduction in criticized inflows, a contrast to the 4% increase in the prior quarter. Given that we are at more normalized levels of criticized assets, some quarter-to-quarter volatility is likely. An increase in upgrades and paydowns combined for a 10% reduction in criticized loans for the quarter. For the year, commercial criticized loans fell 16%.","Moving to Slide 20, 30-day commercial loan delinquencies remain steady in the fourth quarter at 48 basis points. 90-day delinquencies fell modestly to 24 basis points and consists solely of Fidelity-purchased impaired loans, which were recorded at fair value upon acquisition and remain in accruing status.","Slide 21 outlines consumer loan delinquencies, which are in line with expectations. 30-day consumer delinquencies showed a modest decrease from the third quarter. Individual consumer categories were somewhat mixed, as home equity delinquencies were flat, residential delinquencies were down, while auto delinquencies showed an increase. 90-day delinquencies remain very well-controlled. Auto and home equity delinquencies were in line with the strong quarterly performance we had seen all year. Residential delinquencies were down noticeably to 5 basis points.","Reviewing Slide 22, the loan loss provision of $24.3 million was up from $11.4 million in the prior quarter and was $22.1 million less than net charge-offs. Overall, asset quality improvements resulted in a reduction in the ACL-to-loans ratio of 1.65% compared to 1.72% in the prior quarter. The ratio of ACL to nonaccrual loans was basically flat at 221%. We believe these coverage levels remain adequate and appropriate.","In summary, we had a solid credit quarter and are pleased with the results. We remain focused on quality and are disciplined in our new business originations in a very competitive environment. With regard to our metrics, we anticipate the possibility of some continued quarter-to-quarter volatility, but expect overall improvement, including lower criticized loans, lower NPAs, and charge-offs within our longer-term targets.","Let me turn the presentation over to Steve.","Stephen D. Steinour","Thanks, Dan. Turning to Slide 23. Our Fair Play banking philosophy, coupled with our Optimal Customer Relationship, or OCR, continues to drive new customer growth and strength in product penetration. This slide recaps the continued upward trend in consumer checking account households. For the quarter, consumer checking account households grew by 96,000 households or 8% over the last year. The fourth quarter experienced a normal seasonal slowdown in growth. And since we launched this strategy in 2010, fourth quarters have always been the slowest growth quarter of the year as customers' attentions are obviously elsewhere: Holidays, fewer home purchases, kids returning to schools, et cetera.","Because of this, we tend to spend less on marketing in the late fall and early winter, but you also will notice that the full year marketing expense is down $13 million or 20% as we continue to refine our marketing efforts and investments. Over this last year, we've meaningfully increased the number of products and services we provide to these customers. The chart that you're accustomed seeing is in the appendix, but the broader takeaway is the strategy continues to drive new customers and we are establishing deeper relationships. We now have enough managed data to see that our new customers, those that are 2 and 3 years after they have chosen Huntington, have meaningfully higher retention rates. Revenue is down slightly as we continue to see pressure from the operating environment.","Turning to Slide 24, commercial relationships grew at a rate of 6% and have increased by 9,000 commercial customers since this time last year. Very early in the year, we had a meaningful focus on growing small business relationships, most of which are handled through the branch network. You can see the impact in the first and second quarters. The second half of the year had more focus on product penetration and maturing these customers, and that's why you see the continued increase in 4-plus cross-sell and revenues up $14 million year-over-year.","Now turning to Slide 25. 2013 laid a solid foundation for 2014. The environment in 2013 was different than we thought it would be when we began this journey. The economic interest rate and political environments were more dour and volatile, but that also allowed some of Huntington's strengths to show through. This is a company that can execute.","Dave discussed briefly some of the commitments we made this time last year and how we delivered on those commitments. Many of you didn't think positive operating leverage was going to be possible at the mid-year mark, but we ran through our playbook and slowed the pace and scale of our investments. Going into 2014, we built a similar playbook and will, if necessary, adjust. Right now, we're seeing strong momentum as customers seem to have a slightly better mindset as troubles in Washington, D.C. seem to be less of an issue, and the general economic outlook and confidence is more positive. From our year-end customer calls and conversations with CEOs and business owners, there is now definitely more confidence going into 2014 than the prior year.","Modest loan growth is expected to continue and know that we will remain disciplined. C&I pipeline remains robust, and we continue to see increases in customer activity, which as you saw this past quarter, not only helps the balance sheet, but also fee income, like capital markets, SBA, loan sales and other income such as loan and leasing fees.","Auto loan originations remained strong. 2013 was the best year we've ever had. Originations grew 5%, granted the new car industry grew at nearly 10%, but the industry growth is expected to continue, and we should see a benefit in our originations. We know we will get back into the auto securitization market at some point. But at this time, we aren't expecting any securitizations in 2014, as we have a couple of billion dollars of additional balance sheet capacity.","The remainder of loan categories should reflect modest growth. The loan growth, coupled with higher start point for securities, will drive a bigger balance sheet. NIM is expected to be under pressure as competition remains aggressive. Compared to a year ago, we view the rate environment is adding even more pressure as the Fed expects to hold the short-end of the curve low for a while, and the net interest margin is being further diluted by the mix impact of holding additional Basel III Level 1 securities. Even with these negative pressures, the balance sheet growth we expect should result in moderate net interest income growth for the year.","Noninterest income is expected to decline slightly, much less than you saw this past year, as mortgage banking income was near-normal levels during the second half and within about $1 million of -- in the fourth quarter of what we expected it to be. We expected continued modest pressure on mortgage income, as we think 2014 will not be a normal year. There's just too much refi volume pulled forward, but we've seen a nice pickup in new purchase mix. The rest of the fee income areas continue to mature, although we may look for continued opportunities to refine our product set under our Fair Play philosophy.","Noninterest expense has some noise this year, but the underlying level was lower than the previous year, as we took an active stance around delivering on our commitment of positive operating leverage, a commitment we are extending into 2014. We will deliver positive operating leverage again in 2014.","From here, noninterest expense is expected to remain near current levels. The mix will change as we've increased depreciation for past and current investments, but we expect declines in other areas such as our insurance costs, our outside services, and actions we took in the third and fourth quarter will have continuing benefits.","On the credit front, NPAs are expected to experience continued improvement. Net charge-offs are in our long-term range of 35 to 50 basis points -- 55 basis points. But provision, while still experiencing credit dividend throughout the year, is likely to increase. And both are expected to continue to experience some volatility given the absolutely low levels.","At this point, I want to turn it back to Todd to open for Q&A.","Todd Beekman","Sarah, we'll now take a few questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Ken Zerbe of Morgan Stanley.","Ken A. Zerbe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Quick question, just in terms of the buybacks. Obviously, you didn't buy back any stock this quarter. I think you still have $136 million remaining on last year's CCAR approval. Can you just talk about why you chose not to buy back any stock? And should we expect all the $136 million all to be bought back in this current quarter?","David S. Anderson","Ken, this is Dave. Thank you for the question. We have a very disciplined approach to buying back shares. We look at a number of factors, including the effect on tangible book value. So we -- this is consistent with what we talked about in the third quarter. We didn't do a lot of share repurchases. We continue to look at our capital, and our priority is obviously our core growth, strong dividend, and then everything else, which includes share repurchase, merger acquisition, potential opportunities, as well as potentially also purchasing some of our trust -- higher cost trust-preferred securities back. So we still have $136 million of share repurchases in our original capital plan, and I really can't give you an outlook as to what we would expect in this quarter.","Ken A. Zerbe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. So -- and again, I'm trying not to nitpick on that. It's a statement just so I understand what you're saying. But with the comment like tangible book, I mean, I'd hate to say this, but I mean, are you not buying it back because you think your stock is expensive? I mean, I'm not trying to summarize what you just said, but a disciplined approach or maybe I'm thinking more of a consistent approach, because either you're going to use the $136 million by year end or the CCAR year end, or I don't know, maybe you can push it out to the year after that. I don't know.","David S. Anderson","So when we look at tangible book value, we obviously do not want to provide a significant dilution to that tangible book value.","Ken A. Zerbe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. Okay, and then just a follow-up question...","Stephen D. Steinour","Ken, there are a number of factors we look at, that's one of a number.","Ken A. Zerbe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Understood. And then just a follow-up question. Can you talk about the competitive environment in auto? We've been hearing it's getting a little more competitive. I love your thoughts on what you're seeing out there right now.","Stephen D. Steinour","It has not abated. It's been competitive for last couple of years, and we think it will stay competitive through '14. We've taken an approach that we're focused on returns and not market share or aggregate volume. We happen to be -- because we've been in this for a long time, and I think we're strong through the downturn. We've been able to generate growth, again, a record year in '13 for us. But we did not keep pace with the growth in new car sales.","Ken A. Zerbe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And do you find the credit boxes widening out a little bit in terms of being able to...","Stephen D. Steinour","No. Our credit boxes is very tight, and that's not against something we look at every week. And you got stats in the material -- the additional publishing -- our published documents, sorry, that we have here that will show a very tight cycle range and loan-to-value.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ken Usdin of Jefferies.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","I just want to ask, so just for a clarification, on the fee outlook. Steve, when you're talking about a slight decline, you're talking about year-over-year off of the adjusted fee level, so the $987 million [ph], excluding MSR hedging?","Stephen D. Steinour","Yes.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","And can you talk a little bit more about what other changes, what other tweaks do you have left to make on the service charges? Because I would have thought that you kind of would've been passed the adjustments you made several over the last couple of years. When should we -- how should we expect that to grow over time?","Stephen D. Steinour","So we -- when we adjusted in February of '13, we gave you a range of $25 million to $30 million of expected posting order impact. We can't be exactly precise with it because of behavioral changes. But the growth in our consumer checking households took us to, I think, a 4% year-over-year increase in that category. Now as we look at all of our consumer fees, and not just related to checking account, we continue to challenge ourselves internally about, do we have opportunities to distinguish? Do we have the ability to create better economics for us over time, consistent with our Fair Play philosophy? And when we did 24-Hour Grace, we thought it would have a payback in a couple of years, it turned out to be a couple of quarters. So that was a very healthy process that we did in '10, and we continue to do that. A consequence of that -- we don't have anything committed at this point for '14, but the consequence of that could be changes we make during the course of the year.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Right, okay. And then just one more quick clarification. Last year's operating leverage was with lower revenues but even lower expenses. And as you look forward to just the top line this year, do you think you can put up positive revenue growth and then still be controlling that with a very modest, if any, growth of expenses?","Stephen D. Steinour","We do. We try to give you guidance on net interest income growth, fueled by auto and commercial, largely, modest growth off the other categories despite NIM pressures. And that should help us translate with the tight expense management that you've seen in the last couple of quarters in particular.","David S. Anderson","So our outlook in NIE is that it will be fairly flat year-over-year, with the exception of the net one-time benefit of $10 million for the significant items.","Operator","Your next question comes from Steven Alexopoulos of JPMorgan.","Steven A. Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Can I start -- I'm trying to understand the line in the guidance, which basically calls for continued refinement of products under Fair Play. Are you looking to eliminate other fees on products, is that what that's saying?","Stephen D. Steinour","We're looking at all of our fees and we have been for the last few years. And from time to time, we'll make decisions on where we may want to adjust them and\/or eliminate them. But it's not a new activity per se for us.","Steven A. Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. But you're pointing out those at this point because we should expect some reduction in...","Stephen D. Steinour","We're challenging ourselves. We think there's a contrarian moment here and much like we thought there was in '09 and '10. And so we're pointing it out for that reason.","Steven A. Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And maybe just to follow up on that. Looking at the guidance for flat expenses, near $1.8 billion, how much do you plan on investing this year? Can you break out the dollars for us? I'm curious how much you really need to offset in terms of what you plan on investing.","Stephen D. Steinour","I don't think we provided that kind of specific guidance in the past and are not prepared to do that at this moment.","Steven A. Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. Steve, do you have the number of what you invested in 2013? We can use that as a base.","Stephen D. Steinour","Well, again, we have it, but I don't think we provided it historically. Okay? Don't mean to frustrate you. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Bob Ramsey of FBR.","Bob Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Just quickly on the C&I loan growth. I mean, if you adjust for the reclassification of these municipal loans under the securities portfolio, the end-of-period growth was really very strong this quarter, and the average growth was also pretty strong. I mean, I think on a quarterly basis, these are some of the strongest basis we have seen in a long time. Are those levels sustainable on a go-forward basis? I know you said the pipelines look really good, but do they look as good as this quarter?","Stephen D. Steinour","Well, we had across-the-board performance, and I'm not sure that necessarily came through or was picked up by your comments. So it wasn't like one of our verticals or a couple of verticals. We really felt fourth quarter, we were hitting on most cylinders on the commercial side. And as we stepped into the new year, that pipeline, that robust pipeline, commercial pipeline we referenced, is across the board as well.","Bob Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Okay. Okay. So I mean, if you say the similar pace, it would seem that C&I growth could be maybe in the low- to mid-double digits year-over-year, is that fair?","Stephen D. Steinour","Well, I don't think we've given guidance that specific at this point. But we did have a good fourth quarter that at least as we start the year continues with a strong pipeline.","Bob Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Okay, great. And then maybe if I could one more. I know you guys highlighted the security purchases as you prepare for the Basel III liquidity requirements. It looks like, on an average basis, only part of the purchases that you all made in the corner are factored into the average balance sheet. How should we think about, in the first quarter, without fully factored in, what the impact is on margin and earning assets?","Stephen D. Steinour","Well, the margin for us in the fourth quarter was down 6 bps, 3 of that was securities and some swap activity and the rest was -- the other 3 bps were related to the competitive pressures on loans and the inability to close it out over the deposit side. We tried to get ahead of the B III liquidity requirements, and we added about $1.9 billion of investment portfolio, and that came in during the quarter. So it's -- you don't have all of it factored into that 3.28% [ph] margin for the quarter. But there will be ongoing competitive pressures. We will take steps to respond to those pressures, including the $2.5 billion of CDs that repriced during the year and some other things that we were able to do.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Long of Raymond James.","David J. Long - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","In your outlook and how you're talking about your -- how you're looking out to 2014, sometimes, you use the term modest versus moderate. I was wondering if you can maybe help us understand modest versus moderate, how you define that.","Stephen D. Steinour","Let's see, what have we said in the past? Modest is maybe plus or minus 3%, and moderate would be up to 8%.","David J. Long - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Okay, that's helpful. And then the -- with the swap that you guys have, about $8 billion of the swap, I guess, my question is one, how did that impact net interest income this quarter? And then secondly, how do you expect to manage that going forward, and maybe remind us your expectations on when we may see that run down?","Stephen D. Steinour","Well, the swaps are on at a 3-year duration. It's a laddered approach. And we expect that, that will come in over time in aggregate, but there'll be some level of swaps on the books for us. We've got -- we made some decisions around Fed guidance that came out in the second half of the year around their interest in holding the short end of the curve low, notwithstanding the prior impact of the tapering comments in the second quarter. And that caused us to reassess a bit where we thought the trade-offs would be for returns and risks with the swap portfolio. So we moved up and moved out a little bit. Dave, do you want to answer the economic trade-offs?","David S. Anderson","For the quarter, the benefit of the derivatives was about $23 million, which is down from prior quarters. But -- I'm sorry, the -- yes, the benefit was about $23 million.","Stephen D. Steinour","That answered it?","David J. Long - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from Erika Najarian of Bank of America.","Ebrahim H. Poonawala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","This is Ebrahim on behalf of Erika. A quick question, going back to the earlier questioning on the operating leverage. Just trying to get a sense in terms of the -- if you can provide any color in terms of what the sort of magnitude of the operating leverage could be when you look at maybe the efficiency ratio, and what sort of improvement do you expect there to look out over the next year?","Stephen D. Steinour","We haven't been that specific. We do expect operating leverage, we've committed to that in '14, and we would expect that to translate into an improved deficiency ratio again on both fronts. But we're not going to be more specific than that over time. We've got a long-term shareholder alignment here as most of us are meaningful owners as well. And so as we said last year, we do intend to drive more to the bottom line by working that efficiency ratio, and we'll do that. We have investments that are maturing as well, and we've made a lot of investments in the last few years. You can see it in part on the commercial performance. Across the board, our newer verticals are contributing now with our traditional middle market and other areas for commercial. You can see it on auto, the expansions in different geography in a number of different ways. And we're not mature. We would expect them to continue to benefit from further seasoning and growth.","Ebrahim H. Poonawala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it. And just one other question in terms of -- I was just saying to tie in your guidance on loan growth and the comments you made around sort of the momentum looks strong, plans are feeling more confident. Should we expect the pace of loan growth to pick up, or is that still unknown?","Stephen D. Steinour","Well, it's an -- normally, fourth quarters are strong, so it would -- we wouldn't traditionally key the fourth quarter in and fully annualize that. But we had a strong quarter, and we have a robust pipeline. We had a strong fourth quarter in '12. Pipeline was a little lighter, certainly by comparison, was lighter, meaningfully different than how we start this year.","David S. Anderson","Well, we saw very good growth in middle-market. The different verticals we've been -- invested in over the last few years are really all contributing, as well as we saw good growth in equipment leasing.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Sameer Gokhale of Janney Capital.","Sameer Gokhale - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Just a couple. Again, just on in terms of C&I loans. One of your -- one of the other banks have reported today sort of they really hadn't seen any increase in their utilization rates on C&I loans. I was wondering if that's the same dynamic that you're seeing as well. And then in terms of the outlook for growth, I mean, C&I has been one of the strongest areas of loan growth, I think, across C&I lenders in general for the last couple of years. So I'm trying to reconcile that with the commentary about the pipeline being strong, because it seems like at some point, we should see a natural slowdown in C&I lending and borrowing, given the fact that there's been so much strength over the last couple of years. So I'm trying to just figure out if that's a function of pricing, banks willing to give up on pricing to drive growth? Or are you seeing kind of risk-adjusted returns remaining relatively constant in C&I loans? So if you could help us give us some color with that, that would be helpful.","Stephen D. Steinour","Certainly. Sameer, our utilization rates are flat. They're at or near all-time lows, by the way. So at some point, there'll be a pickup on utilization. We've made a number of investments in vertical businesses, specialty businesses, energy, ag, food and ag, international, most recently. But there were prior verticals as well. Those verticals, combined with our middle-market and other capabilities of a general nature, seem to be firing together on all cylinders. During the course of the year, we referenced that in some areas that we just weren't comfortable with structure or tenure that we actually backed away. There was a couple hundred million dollars of corporate lending, large corporate lending that frankly reduced balances year-over-year as a consequence of us trying to hold in. As you've seen over the last few years, when we published our portfolio yields, we've held in better than average and certainly, our NIM has held in better than average on a multi-year basis. But the -- so we don't think of ourselves as extraordinarily reaching for growth. You would have seen a wide variability last year in our commercial lending by quarter for -- as another proof point. But we are in a region of the economy that actually has outperformed over the last few years. And we benefited from that, the auto recovery, the gas play, but we were headquartered in Columbus. Columbus has a 6% -- sub-6% unemployment rate as an example. So we are benefiting from our geography perhaps in ways that might not be consistent with how you would have thought of the Midwest over time.","Sameer Gokhale - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","So just to clarify, it does sound then that you have -- like you haven't increased your leveraging deals in transactions. Your LTV ratios have remained relatively constant as well?","Daniel J. Neumeyer","Yes, this is Dan. That's absolutely correct. We have held very firm in our discipline around leverage lending in particular. It's very well controlled, have not stepped out on margin and also on structure. We don't do any of the covenant-lite transactions. But to Steve's point, I think the -- one of the issues is just the diversification with -- within the portfolio, that's been one of the advantages because the growth has been coming from more areas than what we've seen in the past. And I think last quarter was the first time where we saw all the verticals that we've invested in meaningfully contribute at the same time to the performance. So that's good. And so everything from small business and SBA lending, right up through large corporate. The other component is I think we will also see that we're no longer really going to shrink Commercial Real Estate, so that will be a boost to us in 2013 as that kind of levels out and it could possibly even grow a small amount.","Stephen D. Steinour","So Sameer, as you look at our commercial growth combined over time, you didn't think the -- that core growth in general commercial gets masked by the reduction in Commercial Real Estate. We've now got it -- Commercial Real Estate at a plateau, roughly 100% of capital where we intend to keep it in more or less at that level.","Sameer Gokhale - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","That's really helpful color and specifically, on the C&I loans, that was very helpful. Just another question, in terms of the auto business and dealer markups, I know that's been an area of focus for the CFPB. I was just trying to get a sense for where you were in that process. Have you already rolled out new policies? Has that somehow affected your relationship with dealerships? Has that really not been an issue for you? Any perspective on that will be helpful.","Stephen D. Steinour","Well, we made some changes in mid-2011 in how we approached price and frankly, the allowable variance in pricing. And my understanding is the industry, Sameer, is somewhere around 250 basis points of variable pricing to the dealers, and we are well inside that by policy as of the middle of 2011. So if we had volume adjustments, we've absorbed them over the last few years. But we like our approach. We're comfortable with how we originate and expect to continue on the basis that we're doing today.","Sameer Gokhale - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Okay. I know in 2013, it seems like the CFPB had come up with some new guidance, and it sounds like you're well below industry standards in terms of the markup. So that's helpful.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back over to Mr. Stephen Steinour for closing remarks.","Stephen D. Steinour","Well, thank you very much. We appreciate your interest. 2013 was a solid year for us at Huntington. And if the trend holds, our return on assets of 1.13% should put us in the top quartile of the largest 100 banks in the U.S. again. We delivered positive operating leverage as we dramatically managed the company to reflect how the environment changed, while having strong execution of our long-term strategy. We understand the need to improve our overall efficiency ratio, and in our investments and continuous improvement program are delivering and will continue to deliver sustainable results. And will not only come from the easier lever of expense, but the top line growth, as our investments continue to mature.","In 2013, we delivered positive operating leverage, and then we've said we will do that again. We will deliver positive operating leverage in 2014. And to shareholders and many of our colleagues, our shareholders, if you take nothing else away, remember that we, too, are shareholders, the management board and employees understand the need to balance the investments that drive long-term value-creation and returns.","So again, thanks for your interest. Have a great day.","Operator","And that concludes today's conference call.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Huntington Bancshares' Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to your host, Mr. Todd Beekman, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, please go ahead.","Todd Beekman","Thank you, Rob, and welcome. Copies of the slides of that we'll be reviewing can be found on our IR website at www.huntington-ir.com. This call is being recorded and will be available for rebroadcast starting about an hour after the closing of the call. Slides 2 and 3 note several aspects of the basis of today's presentation. I encourage you to read these, but let me point out one key disclosure. This presentation will reference non-GAAP financial measures, and in that regard, I direct you to the comparable GAAP financial measures in reconciliation to comparable GAAP financial measures within the presentation, the additional earnings material released today and related 8-K can also be found on our website.","Turning to Slide 4. Today's discussion, including the Q&A, may contain forward-looking statements. Such statements are based on information and assumptions available at this time, and are subject to change, risk and uncertainties, which may cause actual results to differ materially. We assume no obligation to update such statements. For a complete discussion of risks and uncertainties, please refer to this slide, the material filed with the SEC, including our most recent Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filings.","Now turning to today's presentation, as noted on Slide 5, participating today are Steve Steinour, Chairman, President and CEO; Dave Anderson, Interim Chief Financial Officer; and Dan Neumeyer, Chief Credit Officer. Let's get started. Dave?","David S. Anderson","Thank you, Todd. I will review our 2013 third quarter financial results then Dan will provide an update on credit; finally, Steve will give an update on household and commercial relationship growth, as well as expectations for the balance of 2013.","Turning to Slide 7, Huntington had a good third quarter. We reported net income of $178 million or $0.20 per share. This resulted in a 1.27% return on average assets and a 14% return on average tangible common equity. There were 2 significant items recorded in the third quarter that I will cover when I discuss noninterest expense.","Fully-tax equivalent revenue was $682 million, a decrease of $15 million or 2% from the year ago quarter. Net interest income declined $4 million or less than 1%. The net interest margin was 3.34%, down 4 basis points. Total average loans grew by 5%, primarily due to Automobile loan growth. Average Automobile loans grew by $2 billion or 49% because we have kept more of these loans on our balance sheet instead of selling them through securitizations. Commercial and industrial loans increased 4% even though we reduced our large corporate portfolio by over $200 million. Finally, Commercial Real Estate loans declined by 14%, but as we have been signaling over the last few quarters, the portfolio is stabilizing around $5 billion.","Noninterest income declined $11 million due to lower mortgage banking income. Mortgage banking income decreased $21 million or 47% from the year ago quarter. This decline was partially offset by increases in fees from commercial loan activity and service charges on deposits for both consumer and commercial accounts.","Expenses declined $35 million from the year ago quarter. Included in the current quarter were 2 significant items that impacted expenses. First, we recorded a $34 million gain due to the curtailment of our pension plan. Second, we recorded a $17 million charge for branch and facility consolidations and severance costs. If you adjust for these significant items, expenses declined $18 million, primarily due to lower consulting, marketing, insurance and other expenses. We continue to focus on controlling expenses as we make prudent investments for the future.","Steve will provide additional detail later in the call, but you can see that our Optimal Customer Relationship or OCR methodology is working. Consumer household and commercial relationships continue to grow at a pace well above that of our regional footprint, and importantly, customers are building deeper relationships with Huntington.","Dan will cover credit in more detail later in the call, but on Slide 8, you can see that credit quality continues to improve in the third quarter. Nonaccrual loans decreased $112 million or 25% from the 2012 third quarter and $30 million or 8% from the 2013 second quarter.","Our capital remains strong. Tier 1 common risk-based capital increased 50 basis -- 57 basis points over the last year to 10.85%. Our tangible common equity ratio was 9.02% at the end of September.","As we compare our results to the third quarter of 2013, the net interest margin of 3.34% was down 4 basis points from last quarter. Mortgage banking income was down $10 million. Despite this decline in mortgage banking income, noninterest income increased $2 million. Service charges on deposits increased $5 million and other income increased $8 million. The increase in other income was primarily due to commercial banking activities.","Noninterest expense in the third quarter was down $23 million. As I discussed earlier, $17 million of the decline was due to significant items. Net charge-offs for the current quarter were $56 million, or at an annualized rate of 53 basis points, up from 34 basis points in the previous quarter. Annualized net charge-offs for the current quarter were still within our long-term goal of 35 to 55 basis points.","We repurchased 2 million common shares in the third quarter at an average price of $8.18. We have the ability to repurchase up to an additional $136 million shares to the first quarter of 2014 as part of our capital plan. We will continue to be disciplined in our repurchase activity, which will vary based upon stock price. We do not anticipate that the pending transaction with Camco will materially impact our repurchase activities, except during the relatively limited time when we will be required to be out of the market under the SEC's Regulation M.","There are a few items on Slide 9 that I would like to highlight. First, we launched our Voice consumer credit card in the third quarter. Second, as I commented before, we are consolidating 22 branches but at the same time, we continue to invest with the opening of 3 in-store locations. Slide 68 has additional information on the in-store rollout. This slide shows a slightly delayed time until the location breaks even as we have modestly reduced growth expectations.","Third, last week, we announced the acquisition of Camco Financial. Camco has $0.8 billion in assets and $0.6 billion in deposits and is expected to be accretive to earnings per share in the first full year. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2014, subject to approval by the Camco shareholders and regulators.","Slide 10 is a summary of our quarterly earnings trends and key performance metrics. While this is a great snapshot of our recent trends, many items will be discussed elsewhere, so I will move on to Slide 11.","On Slide 11, we showed the breakdown of operating leverage for the first 9 months of 2013. In this slide, we measure the percentage change in revenue and expenses, adjusted for significant items and for both volatility from MSR, auto securitizations and last year's bargain purchase gain from the Fidelity acquisition. For the first 9 months of 2013, we recorded modest positive operating leverage of 0.1%. We continue to be committed to providing positive operating leverage for the full year.","Slide 12 displays trends of our net interest income and margin. The right side of the slide displays a 4-basis-point drop in our net interest margin over the last year to 3.34% for the current quarter, which reflected the impact of a 15-basis-point increase from the reduction of deposit rates, a 16-point decrease in the earning asset yield and 3 basis points of lower benefit from noninterest-bearing funding.","The right side of Slide 13 shows the improvement in our deposit mix. The improved deposit mix reflects the success of our Fair Play banking strategy on remixing and growing consumer and commercial no- and low-cost deposits. This improving mix has contributed to the 15-basis-point decline on the average rate paid on total deposits over the last 5 quarters. On the left side of this slide, you will see the maturity schedule of our CD book, which represents a potential opportunity for continuing to lower our deposit costs as new CDs are coming on between 20 and 40 basis points. Related to these last 2 slides, please refer to Slide 40, which provides some additional granularity on the breakout of fixed versus variable rate assets and liabilities.","Slide 14 provides a summary income statement for the last 5 quarters. I discussed the quarterly changes in my previous comments.","Finally, Slide 15 reflects the trends in capital. The tangible common equity ratio increased 24 basis points from the last quarter. Over the last year, the Tier 1 common risk-based capital ratio increased from 10.28% to 10.85%. Our capital ratios were also impacted by 30 million shares repurchased at an average price of $6.96 over the last 4 quarters.","Let me turn the presentation over to Dan Neumeyer to review credit trends. Dan?","Daniel J. Neumeyer","Thanks, Dave. Slide 16 provides an overview of our credit quality trends. Credit quality remained strong in the quarter, although it's modest upward movement in charge-offs and a slight increase in criticized assets. The net charge-off ratio increased to 53 basis points in the quarter. Although it remains within our long term target of 35 to 55 basis points, it is an increase from the prior quarter, which saw charge-off ratio that was actually below the targeted range. The increase was driven by the home equity and Commercial Real Estate portfolios. The home equity increase was due to the recognition of approximately $13 million of Chapter 7 bankruptcy loans that were not identified in the 2012 third quarter implementation of the OCC's regulatory guidance. The Commercial Real Estate increase related to 1 borrower relationship.","As I mentioned last quarter, we do expect there to be some quarter-to-quarter volatility but expect to continue to operate within our targeted charge-off range. Loans past due greater than 90 days and still accruing were essentially flat, and at 22 basis points, remain very well-controlled. The nonaccrual loan ratio showed continued improvement in the quarter falling to 0.78% of total loans. The NPA ratio showed similar improvement falling from 95 basis points to 88 basis points. The criticized asset ratio increased slightly from 4.24% to 4.31%.","The ALLL and ACL rate to loan ratios fell in the quarter to 1.57% and 1.72% respectively down from 1.76% and 1.86% in the prior quarter reflecting continued asset quality improvement. The ALLL and ACL coverage ratios both remain healthy.","Slide 17 shows the trends in our nonperforming assets. The chart on the left demonstrates a continued reduction in our NPAs, falling another 6% in the third quarter. The chart on the right shows the NPA inflows which were up modestly in the quarter to 33 basis points of beginning of period loans. We expect to continue positive trend going forward.","Slide 18 provides a reconciliation of our nonperforming asset flows. As mentioned, NPAs fell by 6% in the quarter. While inflows were up modestly over the previous quarter, returns to accruing status, payments and charge-offs combines results in a continuation of our steady reduction in NPAs.","Turning to Slide 19. We provide a similar flow analysis of commercial criticized loans. This quarter saw an increase in criticized inflows with the increase due largely to 2 larger unrelated C&I loans that move to criticized status during the quarter. The level of paydowns and criticized loans was also lower in the quarter, which, combined with the increase inflows resulted in the 4% increase.","Moving to Slide 20. 30-day commercial loan delinquencies fell noticeably in the third quarter to 47 basis points, the lowest level in 6 quarters. 90-day delinquencies also fell slightly and consist solely of Fidelity-purchased impaired loans which were recorded at fair value upon acquisition and remain in accruing status.","Slide 21 outlines consumer loan delinquencies which are in line with expectations. 30 day consumer delinquencies showed a decrease from the second quarter. Home equity and auto delinquencies showed very slight increases while residential exhibited a more substantial decline. 90-day delinquencies remain very well controlled and were flat quarter-over-quarter in all categories except residential real estate, which was up 16 basis points from the prior quarter.","Reviewing Slide 22. The loan loss provision of $11.4 million was down from $24.7 million in the prior quarter and was $44.3 million less than net charge-offs. This quarter we introduced an enhanced allowance methodology, which incorporates a more robust commercial risk rating system. The combination of the enhanced methodology along with continued improvement in overall asset quality resulted in a reduction in the ACL-to-loans ratio of 1.72% compared to 1.86% in the prior quarter. The ratio of ACL to nonaccrual loans rose from 214% to 220% due to the reduction in nonperformers. We believe these coverage levels remain adequate and appropriate.","In summary, we're very pleased with the quarter's credit results. We remain focused on quality and are disciplined in our new business originations in a very competitive environment. With regard to our metrics, we anticipate the possibility of some continued quarter-to-quarter volatility but expect overall improvement, including lower criticized loans, lower NPAs and charge-offs within our longer-term targets.","Let me turn the presentation over to Steve.","Stephen D. Steinour","Thank you, and good day, everyone. Fair Play banking philosophy, coupled with our Optimal Customer Relationship, or OCR, continues to drive new customer growth and strength in product penetration. This slide recaps, on 23, the continued strong upward trend in consumer checking account households. For the quarter, consumer checking account households grew at an annualized rate of 7% and have increased 9% in the last year. And as we have expected, percentage growth was slowing as the base grows, and we continue to focus our marketing efforts, but the number of new customers each quarter has remained fairly stable at about 25,000 new checking account households per quarter.","Since launching this strategy in the middle of 2010, we've increased our consumer checking household base by 37%. At the same time, we've meaningfully increased the number of products and services we provide to these customers. The chart that you're accustomed to seeing is in the appendix, but the broader takeaway is that the strategy is working. Linked quarter revenue experienced some of its normal seasonality and year-over-year revenue was driven by the first quarter posting order change. We are also taking market share and we're increasing share of wallet. The launch of our own consumer credit card this quarter is just one more example of the investments we're making to become the best consumer bank in the Midwest.","Now turning to Slide 24. Commercial relationships also grew at an annualized rate of 5% and have increased by 35,000 commercial customers since second quarter of 2010. At the end of the quarter, 37% of our commercial relationships utilized 4 or more products or services. This is a 3% increase from this time last year. The growth with deeper product cross-sell has been a strong revenue engine for Huntington. Commercial revenue of $194 million is up $15 million from the prior quarter as we continue to see commercial activity pick up from below normal levels and our investments are continuing to mature. Again to step back from the quarter-to-quarter noise, commercial-related revenue has increased by over $50 million per quarter or 36% since we began executing our strategy in the middle of 2010.","Turning to Slide 25. On expectations, the following is for the next several quarters as we are currently working on the full year 2014 budget. We continue to benefit from the strength in the Midwest and believe our strategies will continue to drive growth. Modest total loan growth is expected to continue and know that we will remain disciplined. C&I pipeline remains robust, and we continue to see increases in customer activity, which as you saw this past quarter, not only helps the balance sheet but also fee income like capital markets, SBA loan sales and other income such as loan and leasing fees.","Auto loan originations remain strong and all else being equal, we continue to like this asset relative to securities, given their short duration. 3 1\/8 effective yield and very clean credit quality. CRE balances, Commercial Real Estate balances, are stabilizing around the current $5 billion level and all other consumer loan categories should reflect modest growth.","With regard to interest rates, while the long end has seen a high level of volatility, the shorter end of the curve remains relatively low, and that's where movement needs to happen if we're going to see an impact on the income statement as our average balance sheet has about a 3-year duration and much of the floating loan portfolio is based on LIBOR.","As Dave showed earlier, the low short end debt provides continued opportunity for deposit repricing and mix shift. We do not expect net interest margin for the full year to fall below the mid 3.30%'s as we've said before, but we do expect continued pressure due to competitive loan pricing and growth in investment securities as we prepare for the new liquidity rules.","Noninterest income is expected to be relatively stable. The decline in mortgage banking income this quarter was a little sharper than expected, but we've seen a nice pickup in purchase volume, which now accounts for over 50% of total production. We expected continued modest pressure on mortgage income, but the rest of the fee income areas continue to mature and as they nearly did this quarter, should mostly offset these mortgage declines.","Noninterest expense had some noise this quarter, but the underlying level was lower than previously estimated as the actions we took helped to reset the bar. From here, noninterest expense is expected to increase slightly due to higher depreciation, personnel occupancy and equipment expense related to our continued modest pace of investments. With the branch consolidations, there's an additional $6 million of related onetime expenses that are expected to happen in the fourth quarter.","As part of our focus on continuous improvement, we will continue to evaluate additional cost-save opportunities as we remain committed to positive operating leverage. As we've said in the past, if the revenue doesn't materialize, we will deliver expense saves.","On the credit front, NPAs are expected to experience continued improvement. Net charge-offs are in our long-term expected range of 35 to 55 basis points, but provisions are likely to increase, and both are expected to continue to experience volatility, given their absolute low levels.","So at this point I'll turn it back over to Todd for Q&A.","Todd Beekman","Thank you. Operator, we'll now take questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from line of Erika Najarian from Merrill Lynch.","Erika Najarian - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","We hear you loud and clear in terms of your commitment to positive operating leverage and I know you're still in the middle of doing your 2014 budget, but as we think about 2014, should we expect this operating leverage progress to continue to widen positively? And should we expect that most of this is coming through the revenue side rather than the expense side?","Stephen D. Steinour","We are very cognizant of a desire or need to improve our efficiency ratio and, therefore, deliver operating leverage. We're -- it's just premature to comment with specificity about how that will happen as we go forward. And so we're going to defer that until we complete the 2014 budget at this point, Erika.","Erika Najarian - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, and my follow-up question to that is, your tone on loan growth has been more upbeat than the tone we've heard over the past few days from other regional banks. Could you give us a little bit more color in terms of the market share dynamics that are going on in your marketplace?","Stephen D. Steinour","Well, it's very competitive and that competition is reflected in pricing and structure. But as we've shown with our Automobile lending in particular, but have suggested across the board, we remain very disciplined. We have, on the C&I side on spot balances, had good growth quarter end to quarter end, and that's consistent with normal summer seasonality. So a nice pickup at quarter end. And we're sitting with a strong pipeline at this point on the commercial side. Some of that is attributable to the specialty banking groups that were formed over the last several years. Remember, we created 3 just late in the fourth quarter of last year that are starting to hit stride. Those 3 are food and agricultural lending, international and energy. And so our specialized areas are coming into a more mature phase, and that's helping deliver volume.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zerbe from Morgan Stanley.","Ken A. Zerbe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","First question, in terms of auto, the Morgan Stanley auto team has been fairly negative on what they're seeing in terms of aggressive underwriting practices in the -- across all the auto lenders. Could you just talk a little bit about what you're seeing? Is that a fair assessment just in terms of the aggressiveness of terms in auto?","Stephen D. Steinour","Well our auto's clearly gotten more aggressive over the last couple of years. We shared with you our quarterly production, and so you can see the book is -- what we're doing is very consistent quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year. FICO scores are actually up a little bit this quarter. And we're a super prime type -- a prime super prime type of originator, and we don't plan to change that. So some of the reported challenges are emerging in the subprime space. Dan, what would you like to add to that?","Daniel J. Neumeyer","Yes, Ken, this is Dan. I think our FICO scores remain very high, actually a little bit higher this quarter on average, and that includes in all of our newer markets where we have expanded. We have had as good or better FICO scores, the average LTVs are very strong. And when you look at the performance metrics, delinquencies are very, very well controlled. So we're really pleased with what we're adding to the book quarter after quarter.","Ken A. Zerbe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","All right, okay, that helps. And then from my completely unrelated follow-up question, when we think about buybacks, obviously, it's a lot slower this quarter. Is there any chance that you guys don't complete the $130 million-plus remaining authorization this year, or should we expect that to happen by first quarter?","Stephen D. Steinour","Well, we've said we're going to be disciplined in our repurchase and we'll continue to be so. It's hard to speculate. We're not going to speculate as to whether we fulfill all of it or how much at this point, Ken.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin from Jefferies.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Just a follow-on on loan growth and auto specifically, the proportion of the book from auto has gotten bigger now, especially that you've been retaining. And I understanding your point that you don't anticipate doing future securitizations, can you talk about the dynamics of whole versus self? And if there's any change to your comfort level on allowing that auto proportion to grow as a percentage of the book?","Daniel J. Neumeyer","This is Dan. I think, for now, we like the asset and like it versus our other options. And as we've said before, we do monitor this portfolio based on percentage of total loans, as well as a percentage of capital. We still have continued room there. And so for the time being, we like it, and we're going to continue to originate and keep on balance sheet. And as conditions change, we'll look at changing that viewpoint, but for now, that's where we're going to be.","David S. Anderson","We've said all along that we're in different -- when we originate, we're prepared to hold or securitize. So we're not trying to adjust credit underwriting depending on the holder of the asset.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Yes, okay, my second follow-up here, just a bigger picture question on operating leverage. Understanding that you're going to come back to us after budgeting, but just -- you held the line reasonably well on operating leverage this year. Just conceptually though, and especially now with this extra charge taken this quarter which presumably will have some help to expenses too, do we see a better gap next year, just all things equal between revenues and expenses, again, without having to rely on what happens with revenue to change your view of expense growth? But just, Steve, just from a big picture's perspective, how does the outlook for broader operating leverage look as it stands now?","Stephen D. Steinour","Well, you answered the question at the outset with it's -- you're not complete with your 2014 budget. So it would be premature for me to go beyond where we -- what we've commented on so far, Ken. It's -- again, we're highly focused on the efficiency ratio, very cognizant of driving that to a better level, and we're going to do that through operating leverage and our continuous improvement program that we started 1.5 years ago. Things are happening and getting translated. We had an expense reset coming, if you will, off the onetime charges reflected in the third quarter, $6 million of which get carried into the fourth quarter so that will provide some benefit as we go forward.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Can you at least try to quantify that for us like the benefit that you get off of these 2 quarters of charges?","Stephen D. Steinour","We're not prepared to do that at the moment. We will be back. Dave, is there anything you want to add?","David S. Anderson","Yes, I just like to add that if you look at our baseline NIE or net interest expense and quarterly it's about $440 million, and that's what we're kind of -- we're looking at this point as our base. Steve did mention that we have an additional $6 million in charges for onetime related to the branch consolidations in the fourth quarter. But that's kind of what we're looking at from a baseline perspective. And that's down from $450 million or $50 million so...","Stephen D. Steinour","So that should give you some help in terms of modeling as you think about us next year.","Operator","Your next question comes from Keith Murray from ISI.","Keith Murray - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Could you just touch on Commercial Real Estate for a second? You mentioned the balance is stabilizing at around the $5-billion-or-so level. What kind of pipeline are you guys looking at and sort of what's the mix of new deals that you're seeing?","Stephen D. Steinour","Well, there's a weekly review of pipeline that we do for all of our areas. It's part of the sales management, again, weekly process. Dan, do you want to comment further on the pipeline?","Daniel J. Neumeyer","Yes, I think the pipeline is growing and I think it's a good mix of -- we've got multi-family, we've got retail. We've got a REIT group that is quite active. So we like what we're seeing. And we think that we're going to be able to originate really high-quality assets and still kind of maintain the level where we want to be, which is right around the 100% of capital or in that $5 billion range.","Stephen D. Steinour","The primary flavors, so that's retail, industrial, multi and a little bit of office. It's not overly weighted in any one of those.","Keith Murray - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","And just on the Camco deal, it's not a huge deal, obviously, but from a M&A perspective and the regulatory thoughts around that for the fact that you guys will be a CCAR bank this year, you got the green light to do this, do you think the regulators were loosening the reins at all on M&A for banks?","Stephen D. Steinour","Well, it's hard to -- we're not in a position to talk about what they're doing generally, but as we've said over the years, in footprint on average, $500 million and $2.5 billion, good returns to our shareholders and understanding the risks involved, that we'd be prepared to acquire and this one met all the categories. So we think this is a nice deal for us, accretive in the first full year and helps us in both new market expansion a bit on the east side of Ohio, as well as gives us some opportunities to consolidate it and build our deposit base on the west side of Ohio.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So in the back on Slide 68, you actually provided an update on the in-store buildout, and it shows 11 new openings in 2014. And also the targeted break-even level is now 2 to 2.5 years. I think these are both revised upwards. I thought the old count was 4 branches next year and also you're profitable at 24 months. So I was just wondering if you could comment on the change and if there was a change, talk about the drivers there.","Stephen D. Steinour","The branch count is, in part, a function of store availability. We've got commitments, Craig, to file them. Sometimes the store owners will make adjustments to their plans, remodeling or other things, and then we have moved the breakeven, we set a target of breakeven between 18 and 24 months. We've moved it out a bit, and that's just a function of in this lower rate environment, lower FTP contributions assigned to -- on the deposit side. The underlying dynamics in terms of new accounts opened in the in-stores versus the other channels continues to be strong and in line with prior quarters. It's a function of us sort of -- again, in the budget process, looking forward, and in this case resetting a bit. We moved it out a quarter.","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And then just a follow-up, I heard some commentary around you're increasing your securities portfolio composition to prepare for the new liquidity rules. Can you give us some color on what the objective is here and what the changes you need to make really are?","David S. Anderson","Yes, this is Dave. We believe we're going to need to hold additional securities and at this point we're planning on purchasing additional Ginnie Mae securities so that will help meet that requirement. Obviously, the rules are not final, but based upon our interpretation at this point, we believe in 2014, it will start to add to that portfolio. That will be in loans held for sale -- I mean, investments held to maturity, I'm sorry, as opposed to available for sale.","Stephen D. Steinour","Craig, we're flagging it now because we've been expecting these regs any day, and currently, believe roughly at end of month. So that's why the timing on the comment.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Scott Siefers from Sandler O'Neill.","R. Scott Siefers - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","I guess, I wanted to -- I guess sort of follow-up on that last question on the branches. Steve, I was hoping you could maybe just update us sort of qualitatively with how you're thinking about the branch footprint. I mean, obviously you guys have undergone probably a bit more of a transformation in the last few years than others just with the heavier in-store piece. But I guess, on a net basis, I've tended to think of you guys more in kind of expansion mode over the last few years as opposed to most in the industry, which are cutting back more materially. So I think this quarter is at least the first in a while, I believe, that you had enough of closure to necessitate a special charge. So just curious about how you're thinking about the branch network overall and where you see things playing out over the next couple of years.","Stephen D. Steinour","Well, we continue to prune our distribution like any good retailer. We think it was 2 years ago there were 29 branches, Scott, just as a point of reference, so this is not a high watermark for us. Year-over-year, we will have net 32 incremental branches so that -- to dimension it. And we have further buildout commitments on the in-stores. We are seeing transactional behavioral shifts benefiting the in-stores just because of the extended hours and 7-day-a-week program. So on average, we're seeing our teller transactions continue to increase a bit, but more of that flowing into the in-store network again because of the convenience supplied. So those in-stores are meant to be sales and service, and as the transaction -- as the flow of our customers migrates, that may give us further opportunities in the future. But we'll look at repositioning the franchise over time based on lease roles and other things to -- and some of it will be in-store, some of it will be consolidations and some level of de novo branching as we've done before.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Alexopoulos from JPMorgan.","Steven A. Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just regarding the commitment to cut expenses of revenue didn't materialize, what are the levers that you're most likely to pull if you had to cut expenses in short order? Is it comp, is it marketing?","Stephen D. Steinour","We haven't committed to where we will go, but you've touched 2 of the areas that would generally be more readily available. So comp-related, not necessarily FTE, but it could include FTE. And when I say related, I mean, commissions and incentives and benefits and other things. And we had to do that in 2009. So there is some history of responding quickly. We don't anticipate that and -- but there are other categories. Marketing, we view as an investment, so while it's available to us, it does have implications around longer-term growth and positioning of the brand. So we'll be thoughtful about where we'll -- what we cut, but we do have a process of having contingent plans routinely available and updated so that if we need to make adjustments, we can do so timely.","Steven A. Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","That's helpful. And if I could follow up, Steve, if I look at Slides 22 and 23, which each showed really strong growth in the number of consumer and commercial relationships, and you're getting better product penetration, if we look at year-to-date, trends from a high level, why are these not translating into stronger revenue growth?","Stephen D. Steinour","Well, in the year-to-date, remember, we started in the first quarter with $25 million to $30 million adjustment to overdraft related income by changing our posting order. And so we have to come through that in terms of getting that overall contribution. When you look at electronic banking, some of the trust and investment revenue line items, you are seeing some levels of growth translated from this increase in customer base and penetration. The consumer side, it's a game of inches, and so we're looking for steady progress on share of wallet, on share of market, and frankly, on revenue. And we had some level of revenue give up in the past like Durbin, Reg E, et cetera, that masks what would be aggregate contribution, pre-regulatory or other impacts. Commercial, if you look at that, is -- which has not had any adjustments this year, is at a new high and that one has translated more cleanly for us.","Steven A. Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So is it safe to say you expect more revenue momentum carrying into next year, which I think is why you're getting all these questions on positive operating leverage.","Stephen D. Steinour","Yes. We do have -- we do expect revenue momentum from the cross-sell on the base.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bob Ramsey from FBR Capital Markets.","Bob Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Just sort of following along that line, yes, I know you all highlighted that you have particularly strong commercial loan fee-related activity. How much of that is related to the commercial relationship growth that you sort of highlighted on Slide 24, and how much might have been just sort of normal volatility, and it was a good quarter?","Stephen D. Steinour","I don't -- have we broken this out? I don't believe we've broken...","Bob Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","It's part of the other line. I think you highlighted it as the big driver of the increase, but you didn't exactly quantify it.","Stephen D. Steinour","Well, we haven't in the past been quantified, and we don't think of it, per se, as new versus existing customers because we have existing customers that will do FX trades or reposition derivatives or expand their treasury management and that's sort of routine in the commercial area. There's an element of activity that's tied to new customers, but it's not exclusive. And depending on syndication and other -- there are a variety of factors that contribute to that fee income line. And so it's not -- we haven't split it between new versus existing portfolio in the past. And we measure each new relationship and the contribution and the sources of it, but as we measure the pipelines, a lot of our capital markets activity flows through existing customers.","Bob Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Okay, I guess, maybe if I ask in a little bit different way, as I think about that other income line, is this a level that you guys think it will build from or is this sort of a really good quarter, and you would expect it to go back to something closer to, I don't know, maybe an average of the first 3 quarters of this year or something like that?","Stephen D. Steinour","Well, the first half of the year was very slow. And always from the outset of the, you'd thought, second half would be stronger than the first half. Third quarter was a strong quarter for us but as we come into the fourth quarter, we've got a good pipeline as we've said on the call. And we have to translate that and we're optimistic that, that will translate in the fourth quarter.","Bob Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Okay, great. And then one other question sort of shifting gears, I know you all said that you have no near-term plans for auto securitization. I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about the factors behind that decision. Is it a reflection of where market pricing is? Is it a question of the fact you'd rather have those assets on your balance sheet today, or how do you evaluate and make that decision?","Stephen D. Steinour","We've looked at the trade-off between alternative investments, duration and OCI risk, with an outlook of an increasing rate environment. So there's both a liquidity and capital component to that, as well as the income trade-off. And we did not think in the first half of the year, and continue to believe, that it's a good trade-off to securitize versus hold those assets. So we're currently planning to hold through this year and as we give further guidance on '14, we'll update that. But we have a concentration limit in place that would allow us, if we chose to, to continue to hold through most of, if not all of '14.","Bob Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","And remind me what that concentration limit is.","Daniel J. Neumeyer","It's about 20% of total loans and about 125% of capital.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jon Arfstrom from RBC Capital Markets.","Jon G. Arfstrom - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Dan, a question for you. Can you maybe touch on the methodology enhancements that you talked about and what change in terms of your approach and what it might mean going forward?","Daniel J. Neumeyer","Yes, and so -- and I think that the word, \"enhancement\" is deliberate because this was not a wholesale change in methodology. It was just improving our commercial risk rating system, which now provides for greater granularity, a wider distribution of probability default and loss given default. And just a very minor adjustment in our general reserve with how we're looking at economic and the risk profile portions of that reserve. So nothing -- no major changes. We just think it's just more focused. And I don't think long term, it is going to -- we think it's going to be more accurate and better, but we don't see any substantive changes. The reflection of the ACL coming down this quarter, that was going to come down based on improving credit quality, whether or not we enhance the methodology or not. But I think we have just -- the geography of some of the numbers changed a bit, but overall very much in line with where we've been and on a go-forward basis, maybe some better predictability, but nothing major.","Jon G. Arfstrom - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, that helps. And then Steve, I know it's early, but can you just comment on how the consumer card launch has gone?","Stephen D. Steinour","Well, the card was designed for customers, so it's not a broadly marketed card. It's off to a good start, but it is very early. We're ahead of where we thought we'd be at this point. But again it's 1.5 months or so.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Mutascio from KBW.","Christopher M. Mutascio - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","I want to kind of piggyback on the reserve question. You've got preface the question knowing that credit quality is actually quite good, so I don't want to take it the wrong way, but I'm trying to think of it in terms of going forward in reserve releases. And Dan, I'm looking at some of the numbers. So your criticized assets, you're up some -- your criticized inflows are up for 4 consecutive quarters it looks like, net charge-offs were up and NPA inflows were up. All off of low levels, I understand that. But the reserves came down by 20 basis points, which was probably the largest reserve release you had in a year. So what credit measure supersedes those inflow numbers that allows for the reserve release to this magnitude? Is it simply just a delinquency number that are improving?","Daniel J. Neumeyer","No, well, I think, generally speaking, I think all of the numbers are improving. And when you look at -- you can't take any specific number in any given quarter and look at it. You have to look at the trends over time. And we've had a few quarters where inflows have either criticized or NPAs have gone up but generally speaking, those have not been the beginning of trends, and you also have to look at the other components of those flows and how many payments are we getting, how many sales, what are we charging of, what's getting upgraded, et cetera. So when you look at our reserve releases, they've actually been very much in line with the reductions from quarter-to-quarter in the major metrics, whether it's charge-offs, criticized, classified, NPAs, et cetera. And we -- delinquencies have been very well-controlled. That's obviously the major forward-looking indicator. So I think on the whole, I think the reserve releases and the reduction in the allowance have been very much in line with the asset quality metrics that we look at.","Christopher M. Mutascio - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","And if I can follow up then, then when do you get concerned -- at what level do you get concerned on the criticized inflows, I mean, they've gone from $218 million to $328 million in the last 5 quarters. At what time does that start becoming a trend?","Daniel J. Neumeyer","Yes, well, look at -- we look very specifically beyond what is that inflow comprised of, is it broad-based? This quarter, we had 2 larger transactions that made up the majority of the increase over last quarter. So when we look at specifics, what's happening? How do we feel about those credits? That's a different analysis than periods of time where we see very broad-based early-stage migrations and we don't feel that we have that going on here. And so the analysis is done quarterly, and it's at a very granular level. So we feel comfortable in our numbers.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Marquardt from Evercore.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","I just wanted to follow up on credit quality, and can you guys just help me understand the home equity related losses from Chapter 7 from a year ago kind of the OCC regulatory guidance that was included for $13 million? How did that come up?","Daniel J. Neumeyer","Yes, and so during our review of the consumer portfolio this quarter, we recognized that there was a population, this 13 million, that should have been picked up and dealt with a year ago. Those regulations came towards the end of the quarter. We had to quickly make that assessment and there were -- some of these loans that should have been coded as non-reaffirmed Chapter 7s were not identified at that time. They were picked up this quarter and dealt with.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay, so that's a onetime thing.","Daniel J. Neumeyer","Yes.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","And that's not related to the tweaking or kind of the enhancement of the reserve methodology?","Daniel J. Neumeyer","No, absolutely not.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Only separate?","Daniel J. Neumeyer","Yes.","Stephen D. Steinour","The methodology -- to be clear, the methodology was commercial and it dealt with the risk rating system change that began in 2011. We've been doing a lot of work for a couple of years on this to implement it. And then the general reserve, it had nothing to do with the consumer reserve.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Great, that's helpful. And then lastly, in terms of fees, deposit service fees and a nice step up this quarter, and one of the things you had mentioned in the press release at least was a -- part of that obviously is ongoing consumer household build, but also consumer behavior changes and usage. Can you expand on what it is that you're seeing there?","Stephen D. Steinour","Throughout this year, we've seen a lot more debit card transaction volume off the same base than we had anticipated. And it looks like the consumers are spending again, so that the average tickets have changed, and that has balance implications and other things. So it's an indicator that the -- of consumer confidence and progress through the recovery. And so that's -- it's -- that's what we're implying.","Operator","And your final question comes from line of Terry McEvoy from Oppenheimer.","Terence J. McEvoy - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Just a follow-up question on OCR. Each quarter, you give us a number of households with 6-plus products and services. And with 20 -- maybe 21 now if you include the credit cards products out there, how do you think about the mix of those products and services, some I'm guessing are more profitable from your perspective and stickier than others? And have you been able to improve that mix and can that drive some growth going forward, assuming that, that it is correct?","Stephen D. Steinour","So, Terry, we watch the mix and what's going on with it. Some of the cross-sell menu items are revenue-related, others are expense-related. So online statements, things like that, what we're trying to both drive revenue and lower cost of servicing. And we're continuing to make progress. We also, I think earlier this year, talked about a new incentive system that has more variability and it gives us more capability to adjust our targeting than we had in the past. And we would expect to do that to enhance the performance, both of revenue and expense on the consumer side of the OCR process going forward.","Terence J. McEvoy - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","And just a follow-up, if you look at the FDIC data that recently came out, are you satisfied with your -- I think you call it your welcome culture and how that translated into certain market share gains and do you think the strategy was justified in terms of what we saw in the FDIC numbers?","Stephen D. Steinour","Well, the FDIC we don't actually spend a lot of time, spot in time, there's some window dressing that occurs around it. It doesn't reflect mix. So for us, we've been shifting the mix quite a bit from CD to other low-cost, no-cost. Also collateralized to government or commercial to non-collateralized. So we -- again, don't put a lot of weight into it. So it's not something we actually sit down and say we're pleased or other feeling, otherwise about it. We'll continue to adjust the mix as we go forward. Dave's comments reflected that. We've had CD maturities of a little over $3 billion over the next year at more than 1%. And that will be part of how we attempt to mitigate the pricing pressure on the asset side as it has been in the past.","So let me wrap up. Grateful for the interesting questions. The third quarter from our perspective was a solid quarter. We delivered positive operating leverage for the first 9 months, a commitment we made at the beginning of the year. Revenue from the -- our investments and everyday blocking and tackling has allowed us to offset some headwinds for the mortgage market and certainly the yield curve. We've taken meaningful actions to reset the bar on expenses, and while we continue to modestly invest, we understand the need to improve our overall efficiency ratio. The consumer commercial relationships continue to grow, cross-sell continues to get better and compared to the first half, customer activity has improved in the third quarter, and we believe will in the fourth as well. We've positioned ourselves to be able to grow the balance sheet, and above all else, we will remain disciplined in the use of our capital and deliver appropriate returns. So thanks for your interest in Huntington today, and have a great day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation.

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mark Muth, Director of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.","Mark Muth","Thank you, Sherri. Welcome. I'm Mark Muth, Director of Investor Relations for Huntington. Copies of the slides we'll be reviewing can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website, www.huntington.com.","This call is being recorded and will be available as a rebroadcast starting about one hour from the close of the call.","Today\u2019s presenters are Steve Steinour, Chairman, President and CEO; Mac McCullough, Chief Financial Officer; and Rich Pohle, Chief Credit Officer. As noted on Slide 2, today's discussion, including the Q&A period, will contain forward-looking statements. Such statements are based on information and assumptions available at this time and are subject to changes, risks and uncertainties, which may cause actual results to differ materially.","We assume no obligation to update such statements. For a complete discussion of risks and uncertainties, please refer to this slide and materials filed with the SEC, including our most recent Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filings.","Let me now turn it over to Steve and he will start on Slide 3.","Steve Steinour","Thanks, Mark. And thank you to everyone for joining the call today. As always, we appreciate your interest and support. We had a solid third quarter and we're pleased with the continued momentum across the bank despite a challenging operating environment.","Overall, our businesses are performing well with disciplined organic growth. Credit quality remains strong and we continue to build capital while supporting organic growth. We've been positioning the bank for a weaker economy and for a lower interest rate environment throughout the year.","Our efforts are consistent with our strategies of creating a high-performing regional bank delivering top quartile through the cycle shareholder returns. We were being cautious with our capital and liquidity given mixed global economic signals as well as increased global risks and volatility.","Please remember our board and management collectively are among the top 10 shareholders of the Company and we're required long-term shareholders. Across our footprint consumers continue to perform well with strong labor markets, driving wage inflation.","In the 12 months ending August 2019, unemployment rates declined in 14 of the 20 largest MSAs in Huntington's footprint states. Job openings exceeded unemployment levels in most of our markets. Home prices continue to appreciate with especially solid increases in Michigan, Indiana, and Ohio.","Additionally, consumer confidence in our region has generally stayed at the highest levels since 2000. On the business side, we've adopted a slightly more cautious view of the local economies recognizing that economic growth has slowed.","We've recently seen a slowdown in commercial loan activity consistent with the more measured tone from some of our commercial customers primarily in the manufacturing sector. Near-term uncertainty around trade and the national and global economic outlook has impacted investment. The uncertainty along with the tight labor markets is constraining economic growth in our footprint.","Our customers are generally confident about their performance this year. Fundamental long-term improvements are evident in virtually all footprint state economies. Michigan for example, is benefiting from a growing services sector with strong recent employment growth occurring in financial, business and professional services. Ohio has multiple industries in which long-term growth potential is high, including technology, financial services, healthcare and research.","The visibility in the pipeline for the fourth quarter commercial loan growth remains good, though we are more cautious about 2020. In light of the more challenging current operating environment and the prevailing outlook for additional interest rate cuts, we\u2019ve taken action in the fourth quarter to reduce our future expense growth.","We've recently completed an internal reorganization including the elimination of about 200 existing positions to better drive productivity. In addition, the build out of our agile development capabilities have allowed us to become more efficient and more effective in our technology investments, which are focused on enhancing customer experience.","These actions position the bank to continue to perform well and further invest in digital technology despite an expectation of additional rate reductions. We are projecting positive operating leverage in 2020. As we've stated several times this year, we do not foresee a recession in the near-term.","Our core earnings power, strong capital aggregate moderate-to-low risk appetite and our long-term strategies position us to withstand economic headwinds. Our strategies are designed to drive more consistent performance across economic cycles. And while we, as I've said, we do not foresee a near term recession, it's important to recognize the downturns do not only bring challenges, they also bring opportunities. And we have a strong record of taking advantage of these situations.","For example, in 2009 and 2010 when others were pulling back from auto and small business lending, we stepped in and expanded these businesses and 10-years later these two groups are key drivers of Huntington\u2019s success.","Huntington was the largest SBA, 7(NYSE:A) lender in the nation last year for the second year in a row and we've now been number one in our footprint for more than a decade. Similarly, our auto finance business now operates in 23 States and we're the tenth largest bank auto lender.","Also in 2010 we introduced Fair Play banking, which was quite controversial and disruptive at the time, but has fueled our consumer banking growth over the past decade. We're positioned for a more challenging economy and I'm confident in our ability to continue to build long-term shareholder value.","Now, before I turn it over to Mac, I want to highlight our announcement last week that Zach Wasserman will be joining us in early November from Visa as our next CFO. As you all know earlier this year Mac announced he'll be retiring at year-end. So this is Mac\u2019s final earnings conference call before his retirement. I wanted to take a moment to thank him for his many accomplishments and enormous contributions to Huntington.","Mac heightened the culture of financial discipline throughout the organization. He was instrumental in our acquisition of FirstMerit and was the executive co-lead for the integration which successfully delivered the largest acquisition in our history. Under Mac\u2019s strategic leadership, we've established our long-term financial metrics and exceeded the original set in 2014 and are now working on a current set.","He has positioned the bank to perform well through all economic cycles. So on behalf of our board, our shareholders and certainly our colleagues like to thank Mac as we're extremely grateful for his contributions to the company.","So Mac with that halo, let me now ask you to provide the overview of financial performance.","Mac McCullough","Very good. Well thank you for those kind words, Steve. And let me say, welcome to Zack, who I'm sure is listening to the call today. Good morning to everyone on the call. And I just want to let you know how much I've enjoyed the relationship with the investment community over the last three decades.","I've appreciated the friendships that we've developed and I appreciate the learning opportunities as well. So thank you very much. Let's turn to Slide 4 and take a look at the third quarter.","So we have reflected strong earnings momentum with solid growth of revenue and earnings per share and a double-digit growth rate in tangible book value per share. We recorded net income of $372 million, a decrease of 2% versus the year ago quarter. We reported earnings per common share of $0.34 up 3% year-over-year.","Tangible book value per common share was $8.25 a 17% year-over-year increase. Return on assets was 1.4%, return on common equity was 13% and return on tangible common equity was 17%.","Our efficiency ratio for the quarter was 54.7% down from 55.3% in the year ago quarter. Total revenue increased 4% year-over-year. Average loans increased 3% year-over-year and average core deposits increased 2% year-over-year. Net charge offs modestly increased this quarter as a result of two commercial credits, which Rich will provide more detail on later in the call.","Overall credit quality remains strong. Even with these items, net charge offs were near the low-end of our average through the cycle target range of 35 basis points to 55 basis points. As we have previously noted, we expect some quarter to quarter volatility given the very low loss in problem loans levels at which we are operating.","Turning now to Slide 5, average earning assets increased $2.9 billion or 3% compared to the year ago quarter. Average loans and leases increased to $2.3 billion or 3% year-over-year including a $1.5 billion or 4% increase in commercial loans and a $0.8 billion or 2% increase in consumer loans.","Average commercial and industrial loans increased 6% from the year ago quarter and reflected the largest component of our year-over-year loan growth. C&I loan growth has been well-diversified over the past year with notable growth in corporate banking, dealer floorplan and asset finance.","We also continue to see good traction in our new specialty lending verticals of mid corporate lending, technology, media and telecom and practice finance, which we announced as part of the 2018 strategic plan. Alternatively, we continue to actively manage our commercial real estate portfolio around current levels, with average CRE loans reflecting a 3% year-over-year decrease.","The decrease is an output of pay downs as well as our strategic tightening of CRE lending to ensure appropriate returns on capital and to manage risk. Consumer loan growth remain centered in the residential mortgage and RV and marine portfolios reflecting the well-managed expansion of these two businesses over the past two years.","Average residential mortgage loans increased 10% year-over-year. As we typically do, we sold the agency qualified mortgage production in the quarter and retained jumbo mortgages and specialty mortgage products.","Average RV and marine loans increased 17% year-over-year as we continue to gain traction and market share across the 34 state footprint for this business. Average auto loans decreased 2% year-over-year as a result of the auto loan pricing optimization strategy we executed in 2018 and the first half of 2019.","Pricing optimization has helped us maximize revenue while minimizing balance sheet impact. However, given the changes in the interest rate outlook, we intentionally lowered our auto pricing in the third quarter to drive increased production. We are locking in short term duration, fixed-rate assets that are current higher yields before anticipated future rate cuts push auto loan yields lower next year.","It is important to note that we are driving the increased production while maintaining our super prime customer focus and our consistent underwriting discipline. Auto originations in the quarter totaled $1.6 billion up 17% versus the year ago quarter and had an average FICO score above 770.","Turning now to Slide 6, average total deposits increased 1% year-over-year, while average core deposits increased 2% year-over-year. Note that we sold approximately $725 million of core deposits as part of the sale that was constant retail branch network in June of this year.","Average money market deposits increased 13% year-over-year, primarily reflecting the shift in promotional pricing away from CDs to consumer money market accounts in mid-2018.","Core certificates of deposits increased 15% from the year ago quarter, primarily reflecting the consumer CD growth initiatives during the third quarter of 2018. Average interest-bearing DDA deposits increased 1% year-over-year, while average noninterest-bearing DDA deposits decreased 2%. Average total demand deposits were flat year-over-year.","As shown on Slide 30 in the appendix, we are very pleased that our consumer noninterest-bearing deposits increased 3% year-over-year. We continue to see our commercial customers shift balances from noninterest-bearing DDA to interest-bearing products, primarily interest checking, hybrid checking and money market. Average savings and other domestic deposits decreased 15%, primarily reflecting a continued shift in consumer product mix.","Moving on to Slide 7. FTE net interest income decreased $5 million or 1% versus the year ago quarter, primarily driven by the 12 basis points decline in net interest margin, partially offset by the 3% increase in average earning assets. Net interest margin was 3.20% for the quarter, down 12 basis points from the year ago quarter and down 11 basis points linked-quarter.","Moving to Slide 8, our core net interest margin for the third quarter was 3.16%, down nine basis points from the year ago quarter. Purchase accounting accretion contributed four basis points to the net interest margin in the current quarter, compared to seven basis points in the year ago quarter. Slide 26 in the appendix provides information regarding the actual and scheduled impact of FirstMerit purchase accounting for 2019 and 2020.","Turning to the earning asset yields. Our commercial loan yields decreased five basis points year-over-year, while consumer loan yields increased 18 basis points. Security yields increased one basis point. Our deposit costs remained well contained with the rate paid on total interest-bearing deposits of 98 basis points for the quarter, up 25 basis points year-over-year and up only one basis point sequentially. Our total interest-bearing deposit costs peaks in July and have moved lower every month since.","Slide 9 summarizes the incremental hedging strategy we have implemented to reduce the downside risk from lower interest rates. The incremental hedges include both asset swaps and floors. We have now substantially completed implementation of the incremental hedges. However, as you should expect, we will continue to fine-tune the overall hedging program as the interest rate environment, balance sheet mix and other factors necessitate. It's also important to remember that the cost of the hedging program has been fully reflected in our guidance since late 2018.","The graphs on the bottom left of the slide provide detail and the mix of our loan portfolio as well as the significant consumer deposit balances with repricing events in the second half of 2019 and the first half of 2020. This provides an opportunity for the bank to reduce the cost of deposits as these well-timed, higher priced CDs and promotional money market accounts repriced lower.","Through September, the deposit repricing activity is on track, although the maturing balances pick up in the fourth quarter, given this timing, we expect to see the impact of the lower consumer deposit costs beginning in the fourth quarter of 2019. On the commercial side of the business, we've developed tactics to quickly react to any rate cuts with client-specific rate reductions, particularly among our highest cost deposits. We were very pleased with the results following the July and September rate cuts and are ready to implement the same strategy for any future rate cuts.","Slide 10 provides detail on our noninterest income which increased 14% from the year ago quarter. Mortgage banking income increased 74%, primarily reflecting higher secondary market spreads and favorable origination volume as well as an $8 million gain on net mortgage servicing rate, risk managements in the current quarter.","Capital markets fees increased 38% versus the year ago quarter, primarily reflecting the acquisition of Hutchinson, Shockey and Erley in the fourth quarter of 2018 and continued core business growth. We continue to see positive momentum within our two largest contributors to noninterest income as deposit service charges and card and payment processing fees both posted year-over-year growth.","Slide 11 provides the components of the 2% year-over-year growth in noninterest expense. Personnel costs increased 5%, primarily reflecting a shift in the composition of colleagues, including the addition of nearly 200 colleagues in our digital and technology areas related to the 2018 strategic plan initiatives and the hiring of experienced bankers in our new lending verticals.","Further increasing personnel expense year-over-year with the implementation of annual merit increases in May of 2019 and increased benefit costs. Outside data processing and other services increased 26% year-over-year, driven by ongoing technology investment costs. Partially offsetting these increases, deposit and other insurance expense decreased 56% due to the discontinuation of the FDIC surcharge in the fourth quarter of 2018, while other expense decreased 16%.","We remain focused on driving positive operating leverage in 2019 and 2020. Slide 12 illustrates the continued strength of our capital ratios, the tangible common equity ratio or TCE ended the quarter at 8%, up 75 basis points from a year ago quarter. For the common equity Tier 1 ratio ended the quarter at 10.02%, up 13 basis points year-over-year and up 14 basis points linked-quarter. We continue to manage CET1 to the high-end of our 9% to 10% operating guidelines. During the third quarter of 2019, we repurchased 5.2 million common shares at an average cost of $13.02 per share or a total of $68 million of common stock.","Slide 13 provides a look at our current thinking around CECL. We continue to progress towards CECL implementation in 2020. At this time, we estimate our allowance for credit losses or ACL will increase in a range of 40% to 50% from current levels. Given our 50% mix of relatively longer dated consumer loans, the CECL lifetime loss methodology results in a much higher allowance than the current expected loss methodology. The increase in reserves has predominantly correlated to the consumer loan portfolio.","We reduced our buyback this quarter as we worked through the expected impact of CECL. Going forward, we plan to use the share repurchase to manage our capital costs, our capital post-CECL back to 10% CET1 level, but a fully implemented basis by the end of next year. These actions reinforce our commitment to maintaining our strong capital ratios which we see as a position of strength for the organization.","As we have previously communicated on many instances our capital priorities are: first, to fund organic growth; second, to support the cash dividends and finally, all other capital uses including the buyback and selective acquisitions. These capital priorities have not changed.","Let me now turn it over to Rich to cover the credit trends for the quarter. Rich?","Rich Pohle","Thanks Mac. Slide 14 provides a snapshot of key credit quality metrics for the quarter which remains strong. Consistent prudent credit underwriting is one of Huntington's core principles and our financial results continue to reflect our disciplined approach to risk management and our aggregate moderate-to-low risk appetite.","We booked loan loss provision expense of $82 million in the third quarter and net charge-offs of $73 million. Net charge-offs represented an annualized 39 basis points of average loans and leases in the current quarter, up from 25 basis points in the prior quarter and up from 16 basis points in the year ago quarter. The increase was centered on two specific energy credit relationships which made up nearly three-fourth of the total commercial net charge-offs.","These relationships were upstream companies operating in the same reserve basin. One of the credits was moved to held-for-sale, which accounts for the increase in other NPAs for the quarter. We expect the sale to close in the next couple of weeks. The loss exposure in these two credits was completely recognized in the third quarter.","We have a relatively small energy portfolio representing less than 2% of total loans. Consumer charge-offs have remained consistent over the past year. There is additional granularity on charge-offs by portfolio in the analyst package and the slides. The allowance for loan and lease losses or ALLL, as a percentage of loans remained relatively stable at 1.05%, up two basis points linked-quarter. The nonperforming asset ratio increased three basis points linked-quarter and nine basis points year-over-year to 0.64%. The year-over-year increases was centered in the C&I portfolio and other NPAs, partially offset by decreases in the residential mortgage, commercial real estate and home equity portfolios.","Note that these metrics include the results from the most recent shared national credit exam. The increase in commercial delinquencies this quarter as seen in the appendix on Slide 54 was related to a leasing system conversion, not underlying credit deterioration. Overall, asset quality metrics remain near cyclical lows. And as we have noted previously, some quarterly volatility is expected given the absolute low level of problem loans.","Let me turn it back over to Mac.","Mac McCullough","Thank you, Rich. Slide 15 illustrates our updated expectations for full year 2019. We expect full year average loan growth of approximately 4% with continued growth in our consumer business, including home lending and auto finance. We expect more measured commercial loan growth consistent with recent economic data.","Full year average deposit growth is expected to be approximately 3% as we remain focused on acquiring core checking accounts and deepening customer relationships. A number of you have asked for us to provide guidance on net interest income as opposed to NIM, which we are now providing on the slide.","We expect full year fully taxable equivalent net interest income growth of approximately 1% for 2019. This is consistent with a full year 2019 margin guidance we provided at the Barclays conference and includes the impact from purchase accounting and the cost of our hedging strategy.","Also, as I mentioned at the Barclays conference, we remain comfortable with current Street consensus expectation for full year 2020 NIM of 3.21%. We expect full year noninterest income growth of 9% to 12% on a GAAP basis. As we have told you previously and are demonstrating with our actions, we've remained committed to delivering annual positive operating leverage. Full year noninterest expenses are expected to increase 2% to 2.5%.","This includes approximately net $15 million to $20 million of unusual expense resulting from the previously mentioned expense actions we are taking in the fourth quarter. As we have done in the past, we are also evaluating our branches and other real estate. We anticipate that full year 2019 net charge-offs will remain below or average through the cycle target range of 35 to 55 basis points. Our expectation for the effective tax rate for the remainder of the year is in the 15.5% to 16.5% range.","So with that Sherri, we will now take questions. We ask that as a courtesy to your peers each person ask only one question and one related follow-up. And then if that person has additional questions, he or she can add themselves back into the queue. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Please proceed.","Erika Najarian","Hi, good morning.","Mac McCullough","Hi Erika.","Erika Najarian","Thank you so much for reiterating your outlook on that net interest margin for next year. And I'm wondering if we could put it in context of balance sheet growth as well. The loan growth momentum continues to be solid. And I'm wondering, how should we think about, how you're thinking about A, your resi growth strategy in a post-CECL world and B, how earning asset growth will trend relative to loan growth from here?","Mac McCullough","Yes, thanks, Erika. We're not going to give 2020 guidance until later this year at a conference in December. But happy to answer your questions around resi growth and how we're thinking about going forward. We will be cautious with resi growth on the balance sheet. I mean, obviously we have a number of our customers who have the need for that product. A number of the balances that we've been putting on in 2019 have been private plan relationship that we have a deep relationship with and that's how we're thinking about mortgage product going forward.","Just given some of the changes in CECL work, we're looking for that to be more of a relationship product from a relationship pricing perspective. But still like the asset class but that might be the one change that we think about going forward.","Erika Najarian","I guess just in net-net, if we take a step back, unless you tell us something more dramatic in terms of how you're managing the securities portfolio. If I combine your outlook on margin with, let's call it 3% to 4% loan growth, then it seems as if the net interest income growth would be sort of greater than the flat trend than what consensus is expecting.","Mac McCullough","Clearly, the net interest income growth in 2020 will be driven by earning asset growth. We are seeing growth switch from the commercial categories to the consumer categories in the fourth quarter. We will likely continue to be more aggressive of consumer lending in 2020 as we like the dynamics of those portfolios, if you think about some of the fixed rate nature of the portfolios as well as the credit quality. We continue to super-prime consumer portfolio, so that's one change, just given some of the comments we made about the outlook for commercial lending and what we're seeing now that you could expect to see in 2020.","Erika Najarian","Got it. Thank you and congratulations, Mac.","Mac McCullough","Okay. Thank you, Erika.","Operator","Our next question is from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please proceed.","Mac McCullough","Hi Ken.","Ken Usdin","Hi good morning. Hey, good morning and then best of luck to you again, Mac. On the deposit side, you mentioned that you'd expect the deposits to start coming down in the fourth. They were up a touch in the quarter. Can you just walk us through the dynamics of the rolling off legacy CDs and how much impact you can see that have on total interest-bearing cost as you do roll forward? Thanks. And beta \u2013 just kind of your underlying beta expectations. Thank you.","Mac McCullough","Yes, thanks Ken. So the opportunities we have with the CD book that\u2019s repricing and some of the money market specials that are also coming up for re-evaluation. I mean, it actually presents a really nice opportunity for us. I think Slide 9 actually has the mix of what's repricing from a deposit perspective and you can see that we're actually entering into some of the bigger balance changes in the fourth quarter into the first quarter of 2020.","As I mentioned in my opening comments, we've seen really good execution against being able to reprice those deposits. I would say, it's ahead of our expectations. We are seeing some of the CDs move into money market, because of just some late specials that we have in the money market space. But we still like that activity as it retains those deposits and allows us to reprice lower.","The one good trend that continues to play out well for us is the continued growth in noninterest-bearing on the consumer side, still really good activity there. And we don't see that slowing down. So, all in all, I think the timing of when we put some of these deposits on our books in 2018 and the opportunity as we see the declining rate environment is what really gives us some confidence as we move into the fourth quarter with our ability to reprice these deposits and help to stabilize the NIM.","Ken Usdin","Got it.","Steve Steinour","I think the sale of Wisconsin was little over $100 million of DDA as well, so the year-over-year numbers even more impressive.","Mac McCullough","Yes, good point. So the $725 million that we sold with Wisconsin those were our core deposits as Steve called out the DDA portion. So our performance needs to take into consideration that $725 million that we sold as a part of the Wisconsin branch sale.","Ken Usdin","Yes. And just one clarification, you always do guide on GAAP. So I'm presuming that the $15 million to $20 million of non-core stuff in the fourth quarter, that's in the full-year guidance?","Mac McCullough","Absolutely Ken. That's a good call-out and a good margin of what the guidance\u2026","Ken Usdin","All right. And we should see the benefits of that next year then?","Mac McCullough","That's correct.","Ken Usdin","All right, thank you.","Mac McCullough","Okay. Thanks Ken.","Operator","Our next question is from Jon Arfstrom with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.","Jon Arfstrom","Good morning.","Mac McCullough","Good morning, Jon.","Jon Arfstrom","Mac, I wonder what you\u2019re going to be doing in mid-January not thinking about margin guidance?","Mac McCullough","I will be lonely.","Jon Arfstrom","Your last chance to do what\u2019s right.","Mac McCullough","Now what does that imply, Jon?","Jon Arfstrom","Yes. Noninterest income growth, it's a pretty wide range that you have for the full year. And I'm thinking if mortgage is the variance there but can you just help us understand the wide range and what would drive us \u2013 drive you to the lower, higher end of the range?","Mac McCullough","Yes, that's absolutely correct, Jon. I mean, we continue to see good mortgage origination volume and the favorable spreads are holding up nicely. So we don't know exactly how strong the quarter is going to be, but we do think there could be some upside there. And that's why we gave it.","Jon Arfstrom","Okay. And is the origination strategy I understand a lot of it is this quarter was MSR and maybe some refinance, but the origination strategy is still more Chicago focused or is there something more than that driving it?","Mac McCullough","Well, it is broadly across the franchise, but I do think some of the changes that we made in Chicago and particular as we acquired FirstMerit and built out the mortgage origination capabilities in the Chicago market, a lot of the growth has been coming out of Chicago since FirstMerit.","Jon Arfstrom","Okay, all right. Thank you.","Mark Muth","We also do a lot of strengthen both here in Michigan \u2013 in Ohio and Michigan post-FirstMerit. So don't want to downplay that impact either.","Jon Arfstrom","But it's safe to say that it's just \u2013 it's refinancing volume that's going to drive you to the higher end or lower end that's really it?","Mark Muth","Yes, that's exactly a way to look at it.","Jon Arfstrom","Okay, thank you.","Mark Muth","Okay, thanks Jon.","Operator","Our next question is from Brian Foran with Autonomous Research. Please proceed.","Brian Foran","Hi, good morning everyone.","Mac McCullough","Good morning, Brian.","Brian Foran","I guess, Steve, you mentioned you don't see a recession on the horizon, but you also kind of made some cautious comments on the commercial side. I mean, you've seen several cycles. I'm just wondering, is that something that can persist or is it kind of like one or the other has to win, i.e., can we have a prolonged period of a slump in commercial lending without a recession or is it kind of like if C&I stays weaker for longer eventually that tips in a recession, and if we don't tip in recession, then eventually C&I recovers?","Steve Steinour","Right. In the commercial context, there are a lot of avenues for financing in addition to banking. Historically, it would have said reduced bank lending would naturally translate into slower economic growth, but you do have many other options out there today for different levels of commercial customers.","I think what we're trying to suggest is that the combination of factors that have occurred somewhat more in the late first half and certainly the second half of the year have compounded the outlook a bit. So whether it's global slowdown, trade and tariffs, we have a big manufacturing sector and an export sector here in the Midwest states we're in.","Just as we mentioned in the last call, we're almost talking ourselves into this. So I think a number of factors are contributing to a slowdown and we still see it as a slowdown. Many of our customers continue to suggest their number one issue is they can get qualified employees. And so this is a labor constrained recovery that has lost a little steam but we think it continues.","Brian Foran","And then maybe one follow-up on the expense side. Can you remind us in kind of a normal year, how much expense flexibility do you have? So I'm not trying to get into a number for 2020. But just if you're trying to ramp up or ramp down expenses based on the environment, but also trying to make the core investments you want to make in the franchise. As the year progresses, is the range plus or minus 2% or 200 basis points, 400 basis points? How much ability do you have to react in a typical year?","Mac McCullough","Yes, Brian, this is Mac. So we do believe that we have expense flexibility and I think we've proven that as we move through what's important with the economy and the interest rate outlook. We still have some flexibility. We go through the process every year of taking a look at just different levels of productivity improvements that we put in place before the year ends, so that we know where we're going to go in case we have to think through some changes in the environments and how we want to manage things like operating leverage or EPS or investment back into the franchise.","So it's important that as we think about what opportunities we have on the expense side in 2020, as we manage for positive operating leverage. We're also investing back into the franchise. And I think that's really important for us to recognize in terms of the activities that we're going through and some of the important investments that Steve has spoken to that we're going to continue to make in 2020.","So confident that we've got flexibility, in addition to what we've already done. But we're going to be careful about the overall health of the franchise and we're going to continue to make those important investments that we think will drive the top line and our competitive position going forward.","Brian Foran","Thank you both, and Mac, congratulations.","Mac McCullough","Yes. Thank you, Brian.","Steve Steinour","Thanks Brian.","Operator","Our next question is from Scott Siefers with Sandler O'Neill & Partners. Please proceed.","Scott Siefers","Good morning, guys. How are you?","Mark Muth","Good morning, Scott.","Scott Siefers","Hey, Mac, I guess first question, just sort of on kind of a qualitative one on the balance between the margin and the overall dollars of NII. Do you guys sort of have one that you kind of prefer to manage to over the other? So I think in the past as you guys have looked at some of the levers you have to pull on the margin, you've alluded to some of the \u2013 some marginality in the securities portfolio for example. How do you sort of weigh that balance between preserving the dollars and preserving the margin rate?","And then I guess, along those lines, as we look at the mix shift into next year, relatively more consumer-driven vis-\u00e0-vis commercial. Is that going to have any discernible impact on the margin trajectory from you guys' standpoint?","Mac McCullough","Yes. Thanks, Scott. So in this environment and just based upon feedback we've gotten from analysts and investors, we did make the switch over to net interest income in terms of providing guidance in this quarter. Obviously, with some of the volatility in the marketplace as well as some of the actions that we can take to drive net interest income that will have an impact on NIM, that might necessarily tell the whole story by us just giving you the NIM guidance.","Yes. So to your point, Scott, you alluded to the levers that we have in terms of how we think about driving net interest income and that would be things like the securities portfolio, optimization of the balance sheet. There are many players that we've run over the years that we still have in our pocket that we can take a look at and those actions have an impact on NIM obviously.","So going forward, we're managing net interest income and we're managing the revenue profile of the company. NIM is a bit of an output from that as we move through what is increasingly more volatile period. But we think that gives you the best information you need to understand where we think the organization is going.","Scott Siefers","Okay, perfect. Thank you for that. And then I think I'm effectively going to repeat one of the other questions here but just so I understand it perfectly. On the cost side, all of that difference in the guidance today versus what you gave a month or so ago at the Barclays conference, that's simply a function of the sort of one-time costs that we're going to have in the fourth quarter as opposed to any change in the core trajectory, right?","Mac McCullough","Yes. That is exactly correct.","Scott Siefers","Okay, terrific. All right. Well, thank you again. And then Mac, good luck and congratulations.","Mac McCullough","Thank you, Scott.","Operator","Our next question is from John Pancari with Evercore ISI. Please proceed.","Mark Muth","Good morning, John.","John Pancari","Good morning. On the expense topic again for, I know you're not giving formal guidance for 2020, but you did indicate that you're confident and positive operating leverage or you're projecting it for 2020 as well. Is there any way you can help us with the magnitude and \u2013 or at least a little bit of color that \u2013 could operating leverage actually accelerate off of the 2019 amount that you're going to see because of the headcount reductions in the hedging that's in place? Thanks.","Mark Muth","Yes. Thanks for the question, John. So the way we think about expense growth and what we're trying to accomplish is we understand the revenue environment that we're moving into. And once we get some confidence around a range of revenue expectations then we decide what we can do from an expense perspective including investment back into the franchise.","So, well, I can't and won't give you any guidance around expense for 2020. We are targeting positive operating leverage as Steve mentioned in his comments. We're also looking to reinvest back in the franchise as I mentioned in my comments and Steve's comments.","So the activity is underway and what we've done up to this point in time, give us a path to both of those objectives, making the right investments back into the franchise and achieving positive operating leverage.","If we get ahead in 2020, it's more likely we're going to invest back in the franchise taking everything else into consideration, the revenue outlook obviously where the economy is and where we think its heading and what we think our performance is going to be in those scenarios. But we've got some investments underway that we think are differentiating and important and we're going to continue to make those investments.","John Pancari","Got it. Okay, that's helpful. And then separately on the credit side, I know you mentioned that you implied that one of the energy credits had impacted other NPAs, so that accounted for some of the increased in non-accruals, but \u2013 in NPAs. But non-accruals also saw, it looks like an additional increase. So I just want to get a little bit of color about what may have driven that and also your criticized assets were up a bunch. Is that all the NPA increase or is there something else there that's driving them higher? Thanks.","Mac McCullough","Yes, I mean the quick class number is up. It's not at a level that, we haven\u2019t operated at before, we've been back at this level in the 2016, 2017 timeframe. The current quarter does have some energy impacts in there as well. As it relates to the NPAs, we did move the one deal into held-for-sale and then we had a couple of additional NPAs added, one in energy and then one, a couple of others outside of energy more on the C&I side.","John Pancari","Okay. Thank you. And the other stuff on the C&I side, was that in any specific sector outside of energy?","Rich Pohle","No, it was pretty broad based, a couple of middle market credits and we're in there.","John Pancari","Okay. So no other deterioration non-energy to flag that you're starting to see developed in the portfolio?","Rich Pohle","No, I mean, the energy represented a significant amount of the charge-offs for the quarter. If you were to exclude the energy losses, which you can't do, but the rest of the book on the commercial side, the charge offs were pretty de minimis.","John Pancari","Got it. All right. Thanks Rich, and Mac good luck.","Mac McCullough","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Matt O\u2019Conner with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.","Matt O\u2019Conner","Hey guys.","Steve Steinour","Good morning Matt.","Matt O\u2019Conner","I was wondering if you could talk as far as you could talk a bit more about the drivers of the good growth in both service charges and card fees as we look year-over-year. I mean, you addressed kind of continued growth from a more activity, but they're obviously both for us, rates are quite high and maybe give us a little color on, on the service charges, how much is commercial or consumer and again, the sustainability of both of those growth rates. Thanks.","Mac McCullough","Yes. Thanks, Matt. So the good news here is that I can't really call it anything unusual that's driving the growth, other than just good execution and organic growth. When you take a look at deposit service charges, we are seeing growth in consumer because we continue to add new households to the organization.","Commercial is probably being driven by treasury management to a large degree and some of the new products and services that we've implemented. In particular, we've added some new capabilities in the business banking, our small business side, that have had a nice lift and kind of a pipeline for treasury management revenue as well as close one referrals.","So that is a very, very nice developing trend that we think is going to continue into 2020. And payment processing, I would just tell you that's a good core organic growth in terms of new customers coming into the bank, new card, debit and credit opportunities, And it's just basically the growth of our customers organically.","Capital Markets is another item to call out, which again we continue to see really, really good growth, good execution. We continue to add up the products out there. We bought the broker dealer, municipal broker dealer last year and that has really been very complementary to our Capital Markets business. We've been able to leverage that acquisition into some of our other capabilities and business lines to actually see additional growth coming out of that opportunity.","So we've got some good performance in fee products in 2019. I think there are some good reasons to believe that's going to continue in 2020.","Matt O\u2019Conner","Just back on the service charges. Have you guys disclosed what the mix is between the consumer and commercial? And I guess does a commercial benefit from the declining rate environment here on the earnings credits the way it works versus your fees versus your earnings credit on deposits?","Mac McCullough","Yes. So the mix is probably slightly more toward the consumer side, but we haven't really disclosed the exact breakout between the two. And I'm sorry, the second part of your question?","Matt O\u2019Conner","Just the outlook on the commercial. Is there some benefit from the lower rates there as the earnings credit on deposits are less and you've picked up in fees that one is the driver as you think about next year?","Mac McCullough","Yes, I wouldn't think that earnings credit is going to be a big addition to that line going forward in 2020. I mean we manage earnings credit pretty tightly. But I don't think that's going to be a big driver.","Matt O\u2019Conner","Okay, all right. Thank you.","Mac McCullough","Okay. Thanks, Matt.","Operator","Our next question is from Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.","MarkMuth","Morning, Ken.","Ken Zerbe","Great, thanks. I guess maybe Steve, I know in your initial comments, it sounds like you're pretty negative on commercial loan growth. I just want make sure we get the right message that is it that commercial loan growth in 2020 could slow, but you're going to more or at least make up the slowness with better consumer growth, is that the right message?","Steve Steinour","Well, I want to imply a cautiousness. The economy has slowed significantly year-over-year. We were running around 3.5% to 1.5% most recently. We've done 6% year-over-year commercial growth, and I think we need to be a little more cautious. We're just trying to flag that for you in line with the outlook that we're hearing from our customers. We expect to be able to grow commercial next year and at the same time, we will grow the consumer side as well.","Ken Zerbe","Got you. Okay. And then I guess just one small question in terms of your guidance for positive operating leverage in 2019, is that on a full GAAP basis? Are you excluding the unusually high expenses in fourth quarter?","Steve Steinour","Yes. It's all on a GAAP basis.","Ken Zerbe","Okay, all right, great. Thank you.","Steve Steinour","Thanks, Ken.","Operator","Our next question is from Steven Alexopoulos with JPMorgan. Please proceed.","Steven Alexopoulos","Good morning, everybody.","Steve Steinour","Hi, Steve.","Steven Alexopoulos","I wanted to drill down a little bit on CECL. How much is the reserve for auto loans expected to change under CECL?","Mac McCullough","So Steve, we're not going to give that level of guidance at this point in time. We'll disclose those stats, obviously in the future, but I'm not going to disclose them here.","Steven Alexopoulos","Okay. Is it material enough to change your appetite to want to add auto loans in 2020?","Mac McCullough","No.","Steven Alexopoulos","No. Okay. And then separately for Steve. In terms of the tone-shift you're talking about from your manufacturing customers, is this more coming from the macro noise right trade wars, etcetera. Are you starting to actually see pressure start to show up in financial statements for these customers?","Steve Steinour","We're total at this point, Steven we, again, I think there is an element of we're talking ourselves into something but certainly for these manufacturers, the trade tariff issues are real, for some of them.","Steven Alexopoulos","Okay. And what percent of your loans are to manufacturing companies?","Mac McCullough","Commercial loans of about 25% to ballpark.","Steven Alexopoulos","That's of commercial.","Mac McCullough","Yes.","Steven Alexopoulos","Okay, thanks and best of luck, Mac. Thanks very much.","Mac McCullough","Yes. Thank you. Take care.","Operator","Our next question is from David Long with Raymond James. Please proceed.","Mark Muth","Hi, Dave.","David Long","Good morning everyone. Mac, I think you said that you were comfortable just maybe confirm if this is accurate, but I thought I heard you say you're comfortable with the Street NIM forecast of 321 for 2020. Is that accurate?","Mac McCullough","That is correct.","David Long","Okay, just when you say that, what type of rate backdrop do you have in mind? How many rate cuts do you have in or what are your expectations when making that comment?","Mac McCullough","Yes, it's great, great question, Dave. So we have a assumption of three rate cuts, October, January and September.","David Long","Got it, got it. Okay, great, that's all that I had.","Mac McCullough","Okay, thanks Dave. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please proceed.","Marty Mosby","Thanks.","MarkMuth","Good morning, Marty.","Marty Mosby","I wanted to ask \u2013 hey, good morning. I wanted to ask a question about the return on tangible common equity and how you're looking at the different stacks of capital. Your CET1 ratio is relatively flat but your TCE to TA ratio has been increasing over the last year pretty substantially.","I know that some of that's related to mark-to-market on the securities portfolio. But I wouldn't think that all of that was the difference there. So, we're just curious because that increase in TCE to TA ratio was causing the ROTCE to fall off a little bit.","Mac McCullough","Yes, Marty. It's a great, great question. So we're up about $1 billion year-over-year in tangible common equity. About 75% of it is OCI related to the securities portfolio and other pension, things like that. So that is the primary driver of the improvement in TCE.","Marty Mosby","And then could you give us a little bit of color on the mortgage servicing rights? We've had several banks report these gains in the mortgage servicing rights with the hedging given that interest rates were coming down and prepayments were kicking in. It's one of two things. Either the assumption on the prepays was over exaggerated, which I think is built into the models all the time in the or you are over-hedged. So I'm just curious how the dynamics were playing out. So this particular quarter, we had these gains on mortgage servicing rights hedging.","Mac McCullough","Yes, Marty. It's obviously been a pretty volatile environment. Then I would say it's a little of both in terms of the two suspects you threw out there. But volatility has been pretty, pretty high as you, as you know, but I think the team has done a great job of making sure that we are hedged appropriately and some of that volatility is going to mean that you are over hedged, under hedged at any point of time.","But it's obviously something we look at very carefully, spend a lot of time with and I think we've done a good job.","Marty Mosby","Well, thanks and best of luck where you'd go forward, it's been great working with you.","Mac McCullough","I appreciate it Marty. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Brock Vandervliet with UBS. Please proceed.","Mark Muth","Hi, Brock.","Brock Vandervliet","Great, good morning. On the credit picture and I know you provide a lifetime net charge-off over the cycle guide, I guess over the cycle guide. I'm a little surprised that some of the credit friction this quarter, what kind of confidence do you have based on what you can see right now that you can hold net charge-offs and kind of the level that we saw this quarter as opposed to having them move higher in the intermediate term?","Rich Pohle","This is Rich. Like I said, the charge-offs in this quarter were really isolated to the energy book. The balance of the portfolio, we believe is performing well and we have expectations that it will continue to perform well. So if you're trying to, are you trying to tie that into the CECL estimate or \u2026","Brock Vandervliet","Not so much around CECL, just trying to get a sense of, I felt like Huntington has been kind of battened down for quite a while on credit and just it sounds like there is more a tone of slowing and I just want to make sure I'm attuned to that. That's all.","Mac McCullough","Yes. So I think it's important to differentiate the slowing with the credit discussion. We talked about energy be less than 2% of our loan portfolio and that really is where the problems have been centered. Outside of that, we really don't see anything of concern as we take a look at the portfolios on the outlooks.","So it's different, I think a different, different discussion on what we see in the economy and what we hear from our customers and a little bit of caution around some of the feedback we're getting in, some of what we're seeing take place on the ground. But that's how I would think about the credit question versus what we see it and from a growth perspective.","Rich Pohle","And to be clear Brock, we're not making a call on a recession, we don't see it. I think we reiterated that twice in the prepared comments. So this is a 1.5% which, you roll the clock back six years ago would have been a reasonably good year. So we're just coming off of 3.5% and it's a percent GDP growth. So we think this we could be, we could be running at this level for a while.","Mac McCullough","And to your earlier point Brock, I mean, look, we're not going to put question of assets on the balance sheet at this point of the cycle. So we've been consistent in talking about the discipline of our underwriting process. I think we're even more cautious in environments like this based on what we're hearing from our customers. So we put a note of caution out there and we've talked about the pipeline still being higher than they were at this time last year, but we're just reflecting what we hear from our customers and letting you know what we're thinking.","Brock Vandervliet","Okay. I appreciate the color.","Mac McCullough","Okay, thanks Brock.","Operator","And our final question is from Peter Winter with Wedbush Securities. Please proceed.","Peter Winter","Good morning.","Mac McCullough","Hey Peter.","Peter Winter","I had a question on capital. And I heard you with the share buybacks being at the bottom of your packing order. But I'm just curious, are you planning on completing the share authorization under the 2019 CCAR?","Mac McCullough","Peter, it's going to depend on balance sheet growth from here and outlook for 2020. We are committed to getting our capital levels back to the pre-CECL levels by the end of 2020 which could mean that we curtail the 2019 share repurchase authorization a bit but it's all going to come down to a balance sheet growth and what it's going to take you back to those levels at the end of 2020.","Peter Winter","Got it, okay. Thanks and Mac I've enjoyed working with you over the year. So, best of luck.","Mac McCullough","Thank you, Peter.","Operator","I would like to now turn the conference back over to Steve for closing comments.","Steve Steinour","So, I'm pleased with our solid results through the first three quarters of 2019, particularly given the significant movement in the yield curve and the amount of market volatility we've witnessed. I remain confident about our prospects for the remainder of the year in 2020 as we manage through what we expect to be a challenging environment.","Our top priorities are executing our strategic plan and thoughtfully investing in our businesses for continued prudent organic growth while delivering the annual positive operating leverage. We're building long-term shareholder value by focusing on customers and top quartile financial performance with consistently disciplined risk management.","And finally, we always like to end with a reminder to our shareholders that there is a high level of alignment between the Board, management, our colleagues and our shareholders. The Board and our colleagues are collectively at top 10 shareholder of Huntington and all of us are appropriately focused on driving sustained long-term performance.","So with that, thank you for your interest in Huntington. Mac many thanks to you, and congratulations. We appreciate all of you joining us today. Have a great day.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and thank you for your participation."],"11606":["Huntington Bancshares Incorporated (NASDAQ:HBAN) Q4 2012 Earnings Call January 17, 2013 10:00 AM ET","Executives","Todd Beekman - Director of Investor Relations","Stephen D.

My name is Kyle, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the Huntington National Bank Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Beekman, you may begin your conference.","Todd Beekman","Thank you, Kyle, and welcome. I'm Todd Beekman, the Director of Investor Relations for Huntington. A copy of the slides that we will be reviewing can be found on our website at huntington.com This call is also being recorded and will be made available for rebroadcast starting about 1 hour after the close of the call. Please call Investor Relations at (614) 480-5676 if you have difficulties receiving the slides or more information on the replay. Slides 2 and 3 note several aspects of the basis of today's presentation. I encourage you to read these, but let me point out 1 key disclosure. This presentation will reference non-GAAP financial measures. And in that regard, I will direct you to the comparable GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to comparable GAAP financial measures within the presentation, the additional earnings-related material we released this morning and related 8-K filed today, all of which can be found on our website.","Turning to Slide 4. Today's discussion, including the Q&A period, may contain forward-looking statements. Such statements are based on information and assumptions available at this time and are subject to change, risks and uncertainties, which may cause actual results to differ materially. We assume no obligation to update such statements. For a complete discussion of risks and uncertainties, please refer to this slide, the material filed with the SEC and our most recent 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filings.","Now turning to today's presentation. As showed on Slide 5, participating today are Steve Steinour, our Chairman, CEO and President; Don Kimble, Chief Financial Officer; and Dan Neumeyer, Chief Credit Officer. Steve?","Stephen D. Steinour","Thank you. Welcome. I'll begin with a review of some of the quarter's and full year highlights, Don will review the financial performance, and we'll be followed by Dan, who will provide a brief update on credit. Don will then provide you with an update on our continued household and commercial relationship growth and then close with a discussion of our 2013 expectations.","Turning to Slide 7. The fourth quarter, like all of 2012, was a very solid quarter for Huntington. For the second quarter in a row, we earned just over $167 million or $0.19 per share, which is up from $0.14 in the fourth quarter of 2011. This equates to a 1.19% return on assets and a 13.5% return on tangible common equity. This quarter's performance was driven by a $41 million or 6% increase in revenue as we continued to manage our balance sheet in this difficult yield curve environment. Loans increased an average of 3% annualized, and net interest margin expanded 7 basis points, 5 of which we view as temporary benefits, which mostly relate to the Fidelity acquisition earlier in the year. Our mortgage business continues to prosper and had a very strong quarter, growing revenue by $17 million. As we announced earlier in the quarter, we completed our second auto loan securitization in 2012.","Turning to the full year, we're pleased with our year's financial results. At September of 2010, when our year-to-date ROA was just 49 basis points, we told you that our long-term goal for ROA was 1.1% to 1.35%. For 2012, Huntington earned 1.15% on ROA and EPS of $0.71, a 20% increase from the previous year. This has been achieved through a significant amount of hard work by all of my Huntington colleagues as we've continued to execute our long-term strategic plan.","In 2012, we were able to grow revenue by over $204 million. The cornerstone of our strategy has been to invest in the franchise, to grow market share and grow share of wallet. This has led to a steady loan growth and a significant improvement in our overall deposit mix. Average core deposits increased 8%, and total demand deposits, which we view as critical relationship accounts, increased 27%. This growth resulted in a 3-basis point NIM expansion and a 5% increase in net interest income. Noninterest income increased by $117 million as mortgage banking posted a record year. We completed 2 auto loan securitizations, and our expanded customer base drove growth in service charges on deposits, as well as allowing us to make up nearly 1\/2 of the electronic banking income lost to the Durbin Amendment.","Noninterest expense increased $107 million. Much of that investment has been in people. Since the end of 2011, we added over 550 full-time equivalent employees, a 5% increase, as we opened 37 net new branches, expanded our infrastructure, particularly in risk management, and continued to round out our product offerings with the launch of several new commercial verticals. Don will go into additional detail later, but I want to take a moment to state that as we've seen the economy slow from our previously expected base, we've moderated our pace of planned investment in 2013 so that we can drive positive operating leverage in 2013 as we did in 2012.","Turning to Slide 8. Don will provide additional detail later in the call, but you can see that our OCR methodology is continuing to drive success throughout the company. Consumer households and commercial relationships continue to grow at a pace well above that of our Midwest footprint, and, importantly, customers are building deeper relationships with Huntington.","Turning to credit quality. Net charge-offs decreased by $95 million this year, which included the third quarter's $33 million of Chapter 7-related loans. The full year net charge-off ratio was 85 basis points, down from 1.12 in 2011, not quite at our long-term goal of 33 to 55 basis points, but another year of progress like this one will nearly get us there. Even with the addition of $63 million related to Chapter 7 consumer loans, nonaccrual loans were down $133.5 million or 25% over the course of the year, and our allowance for credit losses as a percentage of nonaccrual loans increased 12 percentage points to 199%.","With regard to capital, 2012 was the first year we participated in the Federal Reserve's capital program. Over the course of the year, we actively managed our capital within the restrictions they set forth, redeeming $230 million of higher cost TruPS and buying back over 23 million or over 2.5% of our total shares. Both our tangible common equity ratio and Tier 1 common risk-based capital ratio increased, 46 and 47 basis points, respectively.","Turning to Slide 9 for other highlights. The backbone of our strategy is convenience and service. This year, we were recognized by 2 prominent names in the business for just that. MONEY Magazine named Huntington as one of the best banks in America, and this is the second year in a row that we receive this recognition from MONEY Magazine. And more recently, J.D. Power ranked us highest in small business banking satisfaction in their 2012 study.","We've continued to look for opportunities to optimize the balance sheet and improve the franchise. In 2012, we completed the securitization of $2.3 billion in auto loans, successfully acquired and integrated Fidelity Bank and opened 37 net new branches, which includes the consolidation of nearly 5% of our traditional branch network. And while we expect the environment to be difficult, we have and will continue to actively manage and to drive growth and deliver solid profitability.","Let me turn the presentation over to Don Kimble to review the detailed financial performance. Don?","Donald R. Kimble","Thanks, Steve. Slide 10 provides a summary of our quarterly earnings trends. Many of these performance metrics will be discussed later in the presentation. Turning to Slide 11, we show a summary income statement for the full year and for the recent quarters. We adjust the revenue and expenses for items like the gain on the Fidelity acquisition and the first quarter's additional litigation reserve. We also show the impact of the tax benefit recognized last quarter.","As shown, we produced positive operating leverage for both the full year and linked quarter. On a reported basis, revenues for the full year were up $200 million or 8%. Expenses were up $107 million or 6%. On the adjusted basis, revenues increased by $181 million or 7%, and expenses increased by $91 million or 5%, resulting in a positive operating leverage of 1.6%.","Slide 12 displays the trends of our net interest income and margin. The right side displays a 7 basis point increase in our net interest margin to 3.45% for the quarter, which reflected the impact of a 1 basis point improvement in earning asset yield. This includes about 5 basis points of temporary benefits primarily related to the purchase accounting accretion. It also includes a 6 basis point increase resulting from the reduction of deposit rates and the improvement in deposit mix.","On to Slide 13. On the right, we have shown continued improvement in our deposit mix. The improved deposit mix reflects the success of Fair Play banking on growing consumer DDA, as well as our focus on growing commercial demand deposits. This improving mix has contributed to the 19 basis point decline in the average rate paid on total deposits over the last 5 quarters. On the left side of the slide, you can see the maturity schedule of our CD portfolio and that another wave of higher cost CDs are expected to mature in the second quarter of 2013.","Slide 14 provides a summary income statement and some color on items impacting linked quarter performance. Items of note included $17.1 million linked quarter improvement in mortgage banking revenue. This improvement reflected better secondary marketing gains as origination volumes remain relatively stable at about $1.2 billion for the quarter. We also recorded a $10 million positive net MSR benefit this quarter compared to a $4 million net MSR cost last quarter. This quarter also included $17 million of securitization gains as we completed the $1 billion auto loan sale earlier in the fourth quarter.","Noninterest expenses increased by $12 million this quarter, reflecting a $5 million increase in professional services related to temporary regulatory costs. We would expect these costs to decline significantly in 2013. Our personnel costs were up $6 million this quarter. Much of this related to increases in commission expense. Head count also increased by about 1% this quarter, primarily related to our in-store expansion. Other expenses increased $3 million linked quarter, which reflects increased litigation operating losses for the current quarter.","Slide 15 reflects trends in capital. The tangible common equity ratio increased slightly to 8.76%. The Tier 1 common risk-based capital ratio increased to 10.47% from 10.28% in the end of the last quarter. These ratios reflected the impact of repurchasing 13.2 million common shares this quarter for $83 million. The Tier 1 and total risk-based capital ratios increased by 13 and 15 basis points, respectively.","Now let me turn the presentation over to Dan for credit trends. Dan?","Daniel J. Neumeyer","Thanks, Don. Slides 16 provides an overview of our credit quality trends. Credit quality trends in the fourth quarter were very positive, led by the net charge-off ratio, which fell to 69 basis points on an annualized basis compared to 105 basis points in the prior quarter. The prior quarter did include the 33 basis point effect of the regulatory guidance related to Chapter 7 bankruptcy consumer loans. Loans past due greater than 90 days and still accruing were stable in the quarter and remain very well controlled. You'll recall that the second quarter uptick in past dues were caused by the acquired Fidelity portfolio. Fidelity loans include accruing purchased impaired loans, which were recorded at fair value upon acquisition and will remain in accruing status. The nonaccrual loan ratio showed continued modest improvement in the quarter, falling to 1% of total loans. The NPA ratio showed similar improvement due to a sizable reduction in commercial OREO balances in the quarter. The criticized asset ratio also showed fairly significant improvement, falling from 5.45% to 4.79%. The allowance per loan and lease loss and the allowance for credit loss to loan ratios fell in the quarter to 1.89% and 1.99%, respectively, down from 1.96% and 2.09% in the prior quarter, reflecting continued asset quality improvement. The ALLL and ACL coverage ratios both increased modestly due to the healthy reduction in nonperforming assets in the quarter.","Slide 17 shows the trends in our nonperforming assets. The chart on the left demonstrates continued reduction in our NPAs, falling 13% in the quarter. The chart on the right shows the nonperforming asset inflows, which fell in the quarter to 43 basis points of beginning-of-period loans. Slide 18 provides a reconciliation of our nonperforming asset flows. NPAs fell by 13% in the quarter compared to a 3% reduction in the prior quarter. This represents the largest quarterly reduction in the past year, and it was a result of lower inflows along with healthy payments and asset sales, which included a meaningful reduction in commercial OREO.","Turning to Slide 19. We provide a similar analysis of commercial criticized loan flows. This quarter saw a similar level of inflow as the prior quarter with upgrades, paydowns and charge-offs contributing to a 12% reduction for the quarter. Moving to Slide 20. Commercial loan delinquencies remain elevated in both the 30- and 90-day categories over what we had shown from the second quarter of 2011 through the first quarter of 2012. The increase is due to the addition of the Fidelity portfolio. All of the 90-day delinquencies are related to the Fidelity purchased impaired loans, which again are recorded at fair value upon acquisition and remain in accruing status. However, delinquencies remain very well controlled in the aggregate.","Slide 21 outlines consumer loan delinquencies, which are in line with expectations and reveal a generally improving trend. In aggregate, 30-day consumer delinquencies showed modest improvement quarter-over-quarter, as depicted in the chart on the left. The residential portfolio showed noticeable improvement in the quarter, while auto and home equity were up very modestly. 90-day delinquencies continued their overall decline, with auto flat quarter-to-quarter and residential and home equity both down.","Reviewing Slide 22. The loan-loss provision of $39.5 million was up $2.5 million from the prior quarter and was less than net charge-offs by $30.6 million. The ratio of the allowance for credit loss to non-accrual loans rose from 189% to 199% due to the previously noted reduction in nonperformers. The ACL to loans was lower at 1.99% compared to 2.09% last quarter. Most of the major credit metrics showed continued improvement, and therefore, we believe these coverage levels remain adequate and appropriate. In summary, we remain very pleased with this quarter's results, we expect continued improvement in our credit metrics and expect to move towards normalized charge-off levels by the end of 2013.","Let me turn the presentation back over to Don.","Donald R. Kimble","Thanks, Dan. And turning to Slide 23, our Fair Play banking philosophy, coupled with our optimal customer relationship, or OCR, approach is driving continued new customer growth and strength in product penetration. This slide recaps the continued strong upward trend in consumer checking account households.","For the year, consumer checking account households grew at a rate of 12.2%, while our 4+ products or services penetration grew to 78.3%, an increase of almost 5 percentage points since this time last year. For the fourth quarter, related revenue was $251 million, up $5 million from the third quarter of 2012. The current quarter is also up $21 million or 9% from a year ago, clearly demonstrating the connection between the household growth and driving our top line revenue.","Turning to Slide 24, commercial relationships grew 9% from a year ago. At the end of the fourth quarter, 35% of our commercial relationships utilized 4 or more products or services. This is 1.5% higher than last quarter and almost a 4% increase from a year ago. Related commercial revenue is up $14 million or 9% from last year.","Now turning to Slide 25, we provide our first look at 2013 expectations. While we expect to see strong growth in the Midwest economy compared to the broader country, we do believe customer sentiment is negatively influenced by uncertainty that continues in Washington. And this will weigh heavily on the overall U.S. economy. Nevertheless, we continue to benefit from the strength in the Midwest and believe our strategy will continue to drive and improve profitability. With regard to interest rates, we expect the interest rate environment will remain relatively stable. With the opportunities for deposit repricing and mix shift, we expect net interest margin to remain fairly stable and we do not expect it to fall below the mid-3.30s. Modest total loan growth, excluding any future impacts of additional auto securitization, is expected to continue. The C&I pipeline is robust, yet with the uncertainty, we do not expect this to translate to strong growth until the second half of the year. Auto loan originations remain strong, and with the relative impact of securitizations coming closer to its full phase-in impact, this should translate to absolute growth in the indirect portfolio.","Commercial Real Estate balances should stabilize in 2013 between the $5 billion and $5.5 billion level. Other consumer loan categories should reflect modest growth as we've started to substitute some shorter duration mortgage loan balances for securities purchases. Deposit balances will reflect continued growth in low-cost deposits, resulting in total deposit growth in line with to slightly less than total loan growth. Noninterest income is expected to be relatively stable as the expected slowdown in mortgage banking will be offset by the benefit of our growth in new relationships and increased cross-sell successes.","For 2013, we continue to anticipate positive operating leverage and modest improvement in our overall expense efficiency ratio. We continue to focus on efficiencies, and as a result of our expectations for the economy, we have moderated the pace and size of our planned investments. On the credit front, we expect to see improvement from current levels and there could be some quarterly volatility given the uncertain and uneven nature of the economic recovery. The level of provision expense for 2012 is at the lower level of our long-term expectation. With the outlook for continued improvement, this should keep the provision levels relatively low. 2013 presents a number of challenges for Huntington and the banking industry overall. We believe we are positioned for measured growth and improvement in sustainable, long-term profitability. Despite these challenges, we are committed to our strategy and believe this will drive long-term differentiated performance. Thanks for your interest in Huntington.","Todd Beekman","Operator, we will now take questions. [Operator Instructions]","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So do you expect total loan balances to grow in 2013 if we include your estimates for 2 auto securitizations?","Donald R. Kimble","Our outlook would have modest growth including the impact of the auto securitizations. Keep in mind that we are getting closer to that 2 years of doing the auto securitizations, and so it should start to plateau the impact of those sales.","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Got it. Then, if loan demand this year, let's say, is a little weaker in C&I and Commercial Real Estate than you planned, would you consider holding more residential mortgages and more indirect auto loans to temporary support higher earning asset growth versus buying more securities?","Stephen D. Steinour","We would, but you caveated your question, Craig. This is Steve. We're optimistic that the economy will perform reasonably well but could in fact pop if we can get through this set of issues in Washington. And so we're -- we think we're well positioned to participate in an expansion should we be able to get into that mode.","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Got it. And Steve, my only point is it appears you may have a sort of loan growth hedge that some of your competitors might not to actually have decent loan growth in a difficult environment if things don't work out great this year.","Stephen D. Steinour","Well, we've tried to be realistic, but on the conservative side, as we've given guidance, there's a wide range of GDP estimates out there given the current Washington uncertainties. And so you can go from a negative to a strong positive 3-plus percent, and that's why we're hedging.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Alexopoulos from JPMorgan.","Steven A. Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","On the expenses, if we looked at 2012, core expenses were up around $90 million, just above that. When we think about 2013 and your comments to moderate the pace of investments, how much of an increase in operating expenses should we be thinking about based on what you know at this point, including your contractual obligations to open new branches, et cetera?","Donald R. Kimble","This is Don. And we currently expect our quarterly expense run rate to be relatively flat or modestly below the fourth quarter level, excluding any unusual one-time items or unforeseen regulatory or legal issues. And this does reflect the decision we have to moderate the size and pace of some of our previously planned investments in light of the challenging economic outlook. We will continue to invest in our franchise but just at a little slower pace.","Steven A. Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And Don, should we expect you guys to cut maybe a little more deeper into variable expenses early in the year to match some of the revenue pressure you might see, given your outlook on the economy?","Donald R. Kimble","We really haven't commented on timing. There are several areas of seasonal changes to expenses. And for instance, there are some payroll tax issues that hit in the first quarter, and we tend to see some seasonal fluctuations in marketing and other expenses, but what we're focused on is the longer-term guidance and outlook.","Steven A. Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And just to follow up on the guidance. You were talking about the margin not falling below the mid-3.30s. Most banks here are talking about running out of room to further lower deposit costs, that being a cause of incremental pressure as we move through the year. Why is that dynamic any different for you guys?","Donald R. Kimble","It is a challenge, but I would say that we are getting a lot of benefit from our change in our mix in our deposits. And we still believe that we have some room to pull down our overall deposit costs. We have about $4.1 billion of CDs that have an average rate today of 1.2%. The current go-to rate is in the 20 basis point range, and so we think that there is a lot of opportunity there as well. Historically, our average cost of funds for deposits are higher than our peers, and we think that we have a little bit more of a lever to pull as a result of that.","Stephen D. Steinour","We probably have a bit less pressure on the investment portfolio. Do you want to comment on that, Don?","Donald R. Kimble","Yes, Steve usually teases me about having the lowest yielding investment portfolio in my peer group, but we try to keep the duration fairly short there. And so we think we will have less falloff from our current yield there than many of our peers as well, which will be a relative benefit for us compared to our peers.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bob Ramsey.","Bob Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","I was hoping maybe you could just give a little bit more clarity around the net interest income expectation. I know you all said in the guidance that you expect the benefits of growth to be largely offset by NIM pressure. But you also talked about net interest income growing over 2013 after a seasonal weakness in the first quarter. So does that mean that in the first quarter, you'll be a bit lower then build from that level, but in total, in 2013, you expect to be roughly in line with 2012? Is that the right way to interpret that?","Donald R. Kimble","As far as the overall net interest income that we gave, we expect that to show an increase for the full year, year-over-year. And as far as the seasonal trends, we do note that, with the shorter day count in the first quarter, that we tend to see a slight reduction then. But on a full year basis, it should be up year-over-year.","Bob Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Okay. So up on -- so how are you getting up year-over-year if the benefits of growth are mitigated by the margin pressure?","Donald R. Kimble","We're saying that they do mitigate but they don't eliminate. So we would have a slightly lower margin than what our current run rate is, but we still expect the asset growth to more than offset that impact.","Bob Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Got you. And then the 5 benefits of temporary benefits that you all highlighted, does that disappear in full in the first quarter or is there any -- does it take a little bit longer for those to phase out, and sort of where are you entering the first quarter?","Donald R. Kimble","We would expect to see about 1 basis point of contribution throughout 2013 from that accretion.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin.","Bryan Batory - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","This is actually Bryan from Ken's team. I was wondering if you could comment on your near-term outlook for mortgage banking revenues. So obviously, a pretty strong quarter, even x the hedging results. Can they continue to run at the $45 million to $50 million level per quarter in the first half of '13?","Donald R. Kimble","We haven't commented specifically as far as the range. We do think there is opportunity near term. We expect the first half of 2013 to be strong, maybe not quite as strong as the fourth quarter of this year, but we are continuing to see that we can get net flows plus the benefit from our servicing portfolio as well. So we think that we have a few more quarters left as far as higher than normalized production.","Bryan Batory - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And can you just comment on how gain on sale margins trended during the current quarter, and just how the pipeline also trended in close of the year?","Donald R. Kimble","Yes. The margins themselves were in line with prior quarters. And as rates did increase at the end of the year, we did see some pressure on secondary gains associated with that, and pipelines continued to remain strong for us.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Josh Levin.","Josh Levin - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","You talked about, you think the economy could pop. So in that sort of bullish scenario where the economy pops, maybe rates move up sooner rather than later. If that were to happen, how do you think about how your deposits are going to behave in that environment and what that means for asset sensitivity? I mean do you feel like you have a good handle on modeling how deposits will behave, or is it just -- are we just in uncharted waters here?","Donald R. Kimble","We do believe that we have a handle around our deposit levels and inflows that we have -- we've spent a lot of time and effort in deepening the relationships with both our commercial and consumer customers, and so that resulted in some strong growth for us from a deposit perspective. We know that there will be some excess liquidity that our customers are maintaining in the form of deposits today that we'll see some pressure when the economy does start to pick up. But we do believe that our liquidity position and overall deposit outlook is consistent with our expectations for the economic growth occurring in the second half of the year.","Stephen D. Steinour","Why don't you comment on our position vis-a-vis outgo? Slightly asset sensitive.","Donald R. Kimble","Yes. And from an outgo perspective or asset liability management perspective, we continue to maintain our interest rate sensitivity position as slightly asset sensitive. So if we do see a pop in rates, we think that we are positioned to benefit slightly from that change. But our outlook today assumes that rates will remain flat and very low throughout 2013.","Josh Levin - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. My second question is you've talked about the fiscal cliff and lingering uncertainty as inhibiting loan growth, but do you have a sense when you talk to your customers, what specifically do they need to see from Washington to give them confidence to start actually investing and thus borrowing?","Stephen D. Steinour","There's a -- we look at our pipelines and our sales activity weekly. So we have a, we think, reasonably good insight, we have very strong activities, we have strong pipelines. But we've seen for now, a number of months, deferrals on closing loans, on fundings and reflecting restraint on investment and expansion by a number of businesses. And it ranged from things like fiscal cliff a couple of weeks ago, now sequestration has been pushed out for 2 months. So there needs to be some confidence around a plan before I think there's this potential for robust growth to pop, if you will.","Donald R. Kimble","And I think just to highlight that, too, as far as our C&I portfolio, we saw an increase as of period end balances compared to the last quarter of over $400 million. And so I think that's starting to show that there was some sense of getting some closure on some of those transactions at the end of the year, maybe for tax reasons or others. But I think that does position us well going into the first quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Long.","David J. Long - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","My question is regarding Commercial Real Estate. Looking at some of your peers, they started growing that part of their business. The federal data has showed growth in the fourth quarter. I just want to see where you guys stand. It looks like your guidance is for it to be relatively flat through the year, and I know you guys have added a lot of resources to C&I. Would you be looking to do that in CRE here at this point?","Stephen D. Steinour","We would not expect to add a lot of resources. And at the end of 2009, we bisected the Commercial Real Estate book between the core and the non-core, and we indicated then and continue -- it's in the broader investor pack, that breakout. We've got about $1.6 billion or so of non-core remaining as of year end. But we had fairly high paydowns of non-core in the fourth quarter. We had about $250 million, when you get into the investor pack. So there was actually reasonably good underlying core activity because of the balances reducing less than the non-core payoffs. This is an area that the bank experienced significant problems with in '08 and '09, and therefore, we've put a hard cap in, in terms of how much exposure and concentration we want to manage. And therefore, the $5 billion to $5.5 billion range is where we expect to be in '13, and it's roughly 100% of capital.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Erika Penala.","Russell Gunther - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","It's Russell Gunther, on for Erika. I have a quick question, just back to the securitizations. You mentioned an expectation to complete 2 of them in '13. Any sense for the magnitude relative to the level you saw in '12?","Donald R. Kimble","We haven't provided any specific guidance as far as the size and the timing. We're still working through some of those issues as we walk through our plans. But our outlook does assume the continuation of 2 securitization transactions in 2013.","Russell Gunther - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, great. And then just circling back to the normalized charge-off levels you expect to approach in the fourth quarter. I think, previously, you have said that's around 35 basis points, is that still a good range?","Daniel J. Neumeyer","Actually it's 35 to 55, and so by the end of the year, we expect to be at the upper range of that and continued progress after that. But by the fourth quarter, we're pretty confident in our ability to hit the upper end of that range.","Russell Gunther - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, great. That helps. And then just last question, on the expenses, could you give us a sense for the type of investments, the planned investments, that you were making that you're pulling back. What specifically are you scaling back?","Donald R. Kimble","It's more in just the timing and size of some of those investments. And so we have a number of strategic initiatives that we have been investing in, and we've just been slowing the pace and nature of those.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Moran.","John V. Moran - Macquarie Research","So Ohio continues to kind of attract a lot of talk or attention for being a particularly competitive market. Any comments anecdotally that you guys care to share on pricing structure competition in the market?","Stephen D. Steinour","Well, the -- we are in 6 states. There's no difference in any of the 6 states to Ohio, or for that matter, the other ones. We're in competitive markets, for sure, but that would be true in all of them, all of the states.","Donald R. Kimble","Maybe if I can just add a little color to that as well. As Steve said, we continue to remain very disciplined as far as pricing, and it's very consistent across all states. I think one area that reaffirms that is just taking a look at our C&I yields absent the impact of the hedging, and you can see for instance this last quarter, our C&I yields declined by 2 basis points despite the fact that LIBOR was down by 2 or 3 basis points during that time, same time period. And the temporary benefits that we had talked about really didn't impact the C&I yields that much. More of the portfolio from Fidelity was related to residential real estate and commercial real estate as opposed to C&I. And so we are and continue to remain very disciplined and believe that will be something we'll maintain prospectively.","John V. Moran - Macquarie Research","That's helpful. And just a second one if I could. On the rate of sort of customer acquisition household growth on the consumer side, and also on commercial, the pace of sort of new acquisitions seems to be slowing here as we went through '12. Would you guys attribute that to sort of broader uncertainty, and would it be reasonable to expect that, that will pick back up if we sort of get past some of the stuff down in Washington that you alluded to? Or do you think that kind of the initial thrust here with OCR and some of the different approaches that you guys took led to real rapid acquisition that now is sort of naturally sort of dwindling a bit here in terms of growth rate?","Stephen D. Steinour","Well, when we unveiled our Fair Play strategy in late 2010, we didn't project double-digit growth rates. So we've exceeded expectations significantly in terms of what we've been able to deliver. There is seasonality to the consumer side, and we think to a certain extent, as we shared, the business side has also been impacted somewhat in terms of deferred decisions. So we expect to maintain strong relationship growth and continue with what we think is a successful strategy.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time.","Todd Beekman","Thank you very much for your interest in Huntington.

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference call over to your host, Mark Muth, Director of Investor Relations.","Mark Muth - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.","Thank you, Michelle, and welcome. I'm Mark Muth, Director of Investor Relations for Huntington. Copies of the slides we'll be reviewing can be found on the IR section of the Huntington website, www.huntington.com. This call is being recorded and will be available as a rebroadcast starting about one hour from the close of the call. Our presenters today are Steve Steinour, Chairman, President and CEO; and Mac McCullough, Chief Financial Officer. Dan Neumeyer, our Chief Credit Officer, will also be participating in the Q&A portion of the call.","As noted on slide 2, today's discussion, including the Q&A period, will contain forward-looking statements. Such statements are based on the information and assumptions available at this time and are subject to changes, risks and uncertainties, which may cause actual results to differ materially. We assume no obligation to update such statements. For a complete discussion of the risks and uncertainties, please refer to this slide and material filed with the SEC, including our most recent Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filings.","Let's get started by turning to slide 3 and an overview of the financials. Mac?","Howell D. McCullough III - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.","Thanks, Mark, and thanks to everyone for joining the call today. As always, we appreciate your interest and support. We are pleased with our third quarter financial performance including record net income for the second consecutive quarter, completion of the fiscal integration of FirstMerit, and substantial progress in the cultural integration of the two organizations. In addition, we incurred the final charge for the integration of FirstMerit in the third quarter of 2017. So, let's get started by turning to slide 3 to review third quarter results. Please keep in mind that year-over-year comparisons are impacted by the inclusion of FirstMerit as the acquisition closed during the third quarter of 2016.","Huntington reported earnings per common share of $0.23 for the third quarter of 2017, up 109% over the year-ago quarter. This is inclusive of $0.02 per share of significant items related to the FirstMerit acquisition. Also including the impact of the significant items, return on assets was 1.08%; return on common equity was 10.5%; and return on tangible common equity was 14.1%. Our reported efficiency ratio for the quarter was 60.5%. However, net acquisition related expense added 2.8 percentage points to the ratio. Adjusting for the significant items, the adjusted efficiency ratio was 57.7%, and this reconciliation can be found on slide 20.","Tangible book value per share increased 6% from the year-ago quarter to $6.85, and was up 2% sequentially from the second quarter. Consistent with our 2017 CCAR submission, last week, the board declared a dividend of $0.11 per share, a $0.03 or 38% increase from the $0.08 per share in the prior quarter. During the third quarter, we also repurchased $123 million of common stock, representing 9.6 million shares at an average cost of $12.75 per share. Turning to slide 4, which shows a summary of the income statement, total revenue was up 17% from the year-ago quarter. Net interest income was up 21% year-over-year due to the 17% increase in average earning assets primarily reflecting the addition of FirstMerit, and an 11 basis point increase in the net interest margin.","Noninterest income increased 9% year-over-year. We continue to see good growth in service charges on deposit accounts and card and payment processing revenue, both of which reflect the impact of FirstMerit as well as organic customer acquisition and increased debit and credit card activity from existing customers. A record quarter in capital markets fees was driven by strong execution of our strategic focus on expanding the business and deepening commercial relationships.","Noninterest expense decreased 4% year-over-year. Significant items both for 2017 and 2016 third quarter expenses. For the third quarter of 2017, acquisition-related expense totaled $31 million. Adjusted noninterest expense in the third quarter grew $97 million or 18% from the year-ago quarter, primarily from the inclusion of FirstMerit. Compared to the second quarter of 2017, adjusted noninterest expense increased $6 million or 1%.","The third quarter of 2017 included approximately $12 million of nonrecurring expense not included in the significant items for the quarter. This $12 million of expense related to personnel, operational and efficiency improvement efforts, and certain expenses associated with the previously announced consolidation of 38 traditional branches, seven drive-through locations, and three corporate offices late in the third quarter of 2017. For a closer look at the details behind these calculations, please refer to the reconciliations contained on page 19 of the presentation slides or in the release. Slide 5 illustrates that we are well on our way to delivering positive operating leverage again in 2017. You are accustomed to hearing us talk about this every quarter stressing how important annual positive operating leverage is to us as a company. We remain confident that 2017 will be the fifth consecutive year of positive operating leverage.","Slide 6 illustrates our balance sheet trends. Average earning assets grew 17% from the year-ago quarter. This increase was driven primarily by a 31% increase in average securities and a 12% year-over-year increase in average loans and leases. The increase in average securities reflected the addition of FirstMerit's portfolio; the reinvestment of cash flows, including the proceeds of the auto securitization in the 2016 fourth quarter; and additional investments in LCR ratio Level 1 qualifying securities. During the third quarter, average loans increased 1% compared to the prior quarter.","As you have come to expect from us, we remain disciplined in our approach to the extension of credit. To emphasize this point, loan originations for each of the last three quarters were lower than our 2017 budget expectation. However, we more than made up for lower loan volumes through disciplined pricing, resulting in net favorability to year-to-date core net interest income. As Steve will elaborate on later in the presentation, we have reduced our period-end loan growth guidance for 2017 to a range of 3% to 4%. This new guidance assumes that we will not execute an auto securitization in 2017.","As competition for loan growth continues to intensify, particularly on the commercial side, we are very pleased that the option to retain more of our high-quality auto loan origination volume as an earning asset substitute until we see competition in the commercial space become more rational. At quarter end, our indirect auto portfolio concentration represented 123% of Tier 1 capital plus ACL. This is just below our operating guideline of 125%, but still well below our concentration limit of 150%.","Based on our current expectations, we have capacity for continued growth of the portfolio into mid-2018 while remaining below our 125% operating guideline. As you know, our auto loans are the best-performing loan category in our CCAR stress testing, and we originate the hold. So, we are very comfortable carrying on our balance sheet as opposed to chasing riskier loan growth elsewhere. We also like the effective duration and the risk return profile of these loans relative to alternative investment securities.","Average C&I loans increased 11% year-over-year, primarily reflecting the FirstMerit acquisition as well as increases in core middle market, the specialty lending verticals, business banking, and auto floor plan. As we have seen throughout 2017, we continue to face headwinds in corporate banking as companies access the debt markets in order to lock-in current low rates. C&I balances were further impacted by payoffs and pay downs of certain nonperforming loans, helping to drive a 7% sequential decline in nonperforming assets.","Average commercial real estate loans increased 13% year-over-year as a result of the FirstMerit acquisition. On a period-end basis, commercial real estate loans decreased 1% year-over-year. We have strategically pulled back in CRE lending, specifically in multifamily, retail and construction to remain consistent with our aggregate moderate to low risk appetite and to ensure appropriate returns on capital. Average auto loans increased 3% year-over-year, with the third quarter representing another solid quarter of consistent disciplined loan production. Originations totaled $1.6 billion for the third quarter of 2017, up 7% year-over-year. Average new money yields on our auto originations were 3.62% in the third quarter, up from 3.58% in the prior quarter, and up more than 40 basis points from the year-ago quarter.","Average residential mortgage loans increased 20% year-over-year reflecting the addition of FirstMerit and continued strong demand from mortgages across our footprint. As typical, we sold the agency qualified mortgage production in the quarter and retained the jumbo (10:05) mortgages and specialty mortgage products. Turning our attention to the chart on the right side of slide 7, average total deposits increased 17% from the year-ago quarter, including a 19% increase in average core deposits. Average demand deposits increased 22% year-over-year. We remain pleased with the trend in funding mix, particularly the increase in low-cost DDA. This reflects the addition of FirstMerit's low-cost deposit base, as well as our continuing focus on checking account relationship acquisition.","Moving to slide 7, our net interest margin was 3.29% for the third quarter, up 11 basis points from the year-ago quarter. The increase reflected a 26 basis point increase in earning asset yields and a 4 basis point increase in the benefit of noninterest-bearing funds balanced against a 19 basis point increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities. On a link-quarter basis, the net interest margin decreased by 2 basis points driven by a 3 basis point improvement in earning asset yields and a 2 basis point increase in the benefit of noninterest-bearing funds, partially offset by a 7 basis point increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities. The increase in funding cost was more heavily weighted to wholesale funding as we continue to remain pleased with our ability to successfully lag deposit pricing, especially on consumer core deposits where the rate increased 1 basis point sequentially.","Purchase accounting contributed 12 basis points to the net interest margin in the third quarter, down from 15 basis points in the prior quarter. After adjusting for this impact in all quarters, the Core NIM was 3.18% compared to 3.16% in the prior quarter and 3.06% in the third quarter of 2016. As I just mentioned and calling your attention to the orange line, at the bottom of the graph on the left, our cost of consumer core deposits was 22 basis points for the third quarter. This represents a 4 basis point increase over the year ago quarter and a 1 basis point increase sequentially, illustrating the strong consumer core deposit base we enjoy and our ability to successfully lag deposit pricing. We have seen consumer and small business deposit pricing remain relatively steady in the face of recent fed interest rate hikes. While the majority of pricing pressure has been limited to government banking, corporate banking and the upper end of middle market commercial.","In the quarter, we selectively increased rates to grow and retain core deposit balances on certain corporate relationships providing better economics for the bank relative to the cost of wholesale funding. On an earning asset side, our commercial loan yields increased 41 basis points year-over-year, while consumer loan yields increased 35 basis points. On a linked-quarter basis, commercial loan yields increased 3 basis points while consumer loan yields increased 5 basis points. Security yields were up 8 basis points year-over-year and were flat for the prior quarter. Slide 8 shows the expected pre-tax impacts of purchase accounting adjustments on an annual forward-looking basis. We introduced this slide last fall and believes it is useful when helping you think about purchase accounting accretion going forward.","It is important to note that the purchase accounting accretion estimates on this slide are based on current scheduled accretion and except for what we've experienced in the first three quarters of 2017, do not include in the accelerated accretion from the recapture through early payoffs or extensions in the projected periods. As we have stated previously, and it's been proven out in our result for the past five quarters, in reality, we are likely to experience loan extensions and early payoffs resulting in accelerated accretion. Therefore, you are likely to see the accretion revenue in the green bars continue to be pulled forward as modifications and early payoffs occur.","Turning to slide 9, this illustrates our long-term financial goals, which were set by the board in the fall of 2014 as part of our strategic planning process. These goals were originally set with a five-year time horizon in mind, but we expect the economic benefits of the FirstMerit acquisition will allow us to achieve these long-term financial goals in the fourth quarter of 2017 run rate and for the full year 2018 both on a GAAP basis, two-plus years ahead of schedule.","Year-to-date 2017 results on a reported GAAP basis reflect the cost of the ongoing integration. Adjusting for these costs, as shown on the reconciliation slides 23 and 24 in the appendix, we are already realizing the scale and financial benefits of the deal. The fourth column depicts our current expectations for these metrics for the full year 2017 also on a non-GAAP adjusted basis. I would point you in particular to our full-year expectations for the efficiency ratio and return on tangible common equity. We believe these results will distinguish our performance from our peers. We celebrated the one year anniversary of the closing of the FirstMerit acquisition in August, and slide 10 provides additional details on the cost savings and revenue synergies from the transaction. We have now fully implemented all of the $255 million of originally planned cost saves, and the primary focus of the organization is now executing on more than $100 million of revenue enhancement opportunities.","Turning to slide 11. You should recognize this slide as well from our second quarter earnings call, which reiterates our $639 million noninterest expense target for the fourth quarter of 2017. With all cost savings implemented, we will deliver on our cost save commitment in the fourth quarter of 2017. The chart on the upper right details the fourth quarter run rate. The chart on the bottom of this page details the expense from implementing the revenue initiatives, specifically $37 million this year and an incremental $13 million in 2018. As I mentioned during last quarter's conference call, we expect the revenue initiatives to have an incremental efficiency ratio of approximately 50% in 2018. The incremental efficiency ratio was higher in 2017 as the ramp in revenues will naturally lag some of the up-front expense.","You've also seen slide 12 before, which provides additional detail on the FirstMerit-related revenue enhancement opportunities. The bar chart on top of the slide displays our current targets for additional revenue from the initiatives. In 2017, the revenue ramp corresponds with the hiring that is necessary to increase production and grow the portfolios. For 2018, we are targeting at least $100 million of total revenue enhancements. This is a $52 million increase from the $48 million expected in 2017. Slide 13 illustrates the continued progress we've made in rebuilding our capital ratios following the FirstMerit acquisition. Common equity Tier 1 ended the quarter at 9.94%, up 85 basis points year-over-year. We have previously mentioned that our operating guideline for common equity Tier 1 is in the range of 9% to 10%. Tangible common equity ended the quarter at 7.42%, up 28 basis points year-over-year.","Moving to slide 14. Credit quality remains strong in the quarter. Consistent prudent credit underwriting is one of Huntington's core principles, and our financial results continue to reflect our disciplined approach to risk management and our aggregate moderate to low risk appetite. We booked provision expense of $44 million in the third quarter compared to net charge-offs of $43 million. Net charge-offs represented an annualized 25 basis points of average loans and leases, which remained below our long-term target of 35 to 55 basis points. Net charge-offs were up 4 basis points from the prior quarter and down 1 basis point from the year-ago quarter. As usual, there is additional granularity on charge-offs by portfolio in the analyst package and the slides.","The allowance for credit losses as a percentage of loans decreased 1 basis point linked-quarter to 1.10%, but the nonaccrual loan coverage ratio increased to 223% as a result of the 7% linked-quarter decline in nonaccrual loans. Overall asset quality metrics remained strong. Nonperforming assets decreased to $28 million or 7% linked-quarter. The nonperforming asset ratio eased 5 basis points sequentially to 56 basis points. The criticized asset ratio increased 14 basis points from 3.66% to 3.80%. And our 90-day-plus delinquencies declined slightly. We also continue to expect \u2013 to experience lower nonperforming asset inflows for the fourth quarter in a row.","Let me now turn the presentation over to Steve.","Stephen D. Steinour - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.","Thanks, Mac. Moving to the economy, slide 16 illustrates selective key economic indicators for our footprint. As we've noted previously, our footprint has outperformed the rest of the nation during the economic recovery of the last several years, and I remain optimistic on the outlook for the local economies across our eight states. The bottom left chart illustrates trends in the unemployment rates across our footprint, and as you can see, unemployment rates across the majority of our footprint remain near historical lows. Slide 17 illustrates trends in unemployment rates for our 10 largest deposit markets. Many of the large MSAs in the footprint remain at or near 15-year lows for unemployment at the end of August.","The labor market in our footprint has proven to be strong with several markets such as here in Columbus and in Indianapolis and Grand Rapids, where we see meaningful labor shortages. We have noted previously that we're seeing wage inflation in our expense base, and our customers are too. Housing markets across the footprint continue to display broad-based home price inflation while remaining some of the most affordable markets in the U.S. Finally, we continue to see optimism across our consumer and business customer base with the consumer confidence score in our region at its highest since 2000. These economic factors support our expectation for continued economic growth across our footprint through the \u2013 though the recent translation into business investment has been somewhat uneven.","Let's now turn to slide 18 for some closing remarks and important messages. With another good quarter in the third quarter, including record net income, the core franchise continues to perform very well on many fronts, and we have completed the remaining necessary integration actions for us to achieve the economics of the FirstMerit deal. We were pleased to significantly increase our cash dividend for the fourth consecutive year, and to reinstitute our buyback program. We remain focused on delivering consistent, through-the-cycle shareholder returns. This strategy entails reducing short-term volatility, achieving top-tier performance over the long term, and maintaining our aggregate moderate to low risk profile throughout. As Mac noted, the FirstMerit acquisition accelerated our ability to achieve our long-term financial goals. And with the integration substantially complete, we expect to deliver against the goal in this year as well as next year.","We are set to realize our targeted $255 million of annual cost savings from the acquisition with all remaining cost savings implemented during the third quarter as originally communicated. We also continue to execute on the significant revenue enhancement opportunities including the SBA lending, home lending, and RV and marine lending expansions. Our 2017 full year outlook continues to expect total revenue growth of 23% on a GAAP basis. Consistent with our long-term financial goal, we are targeting annual positive operating leverage. Importantly, we continue to appropriately manage our expenses within our revenue outlook. We expect average balance sheet growth also in excess of 20%. We expect period end loan growth of 3% to 4% for the full-year 2017.","Consumer loan growth has remained steady throughout 2017. Consistent with our experience over the past several years, we expect commercial loan growth for the remainder of the year to outpace what we experienced year-to-date. However, our commercial pipelines remained strong. However, the commercial lending environment is extremely competitive on both structures and rate. We've reduced our overall 2017 loan growth expectations from previous guidance. We're remaining discipline with our aggregate moderate to low-risk appetite, ensuring appropriate returns on capital. Finally, we expect asset quality metrics to remain near current levels including net charge-offs remaining below our long-term target of 35 to 55 basis points.","Now, I'll turn it back over to Mark, so we can get to your questions. Mark?","Mark Muth - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.","Michelle, we will now take questions. We ask that as a courtesy to your peers, each person ask only one question and one related follow-up. And then if that person has additional questions, he or she can add themselves back into the queue. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Sandler O'Neill & Partners. Please proceed with your question.","R. Scott Siefers - Sandler O\u2019Neill + Partners LP","Good morning, guys.","Stephen D. Steinour - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.","Hi, Scott.","Howell D. McCullough III - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.","Hi, Scott.","R. Scott Siefers - Sandler O\u2019Neill + Partners LP","Mac, I had a quick question, just on the \u2013 holding relatively more auto than you might have, where the commercial environment not as it is. So, just first, can you walk through any margin ramifications of putting on auto versus what it would been had C&I been playing out as expected? And then, did pricing in the \u2013 either sale or securitization market, did that have anything to do with the decision to keep on balance sheet?","Howell D. McCullough III - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks, Scott. So, yeah, I would tell you that there really wasn't any consideration given the pricing and the securitization market. As I've said historically, I do think we always give up economics when we securitize, like having these assets on our balance sheet because of their performance through the CCAR process, as well as the risk adjusted yield that we get on the auto book. I would tell you that any margin impact on a go-forward basis is immaterial relative to C&I loan growth. We feel comfortable with the returns that we get on the auto book, and we are well within the operating guideline even through mid-2018. So, we're prepared to be able to do that, and we're very comfortable keeping the assets.","R. Scott Siefers - Sandler O\u2019Neill + Partners LP","Okay. Perfect. Thanks. And then, can you just remind me, you guys don't pop the marine and RV into the concentration limits, right, like your limit is auto specifically as opposed to all indirect. And then, along those lines, what is the opportunity you guys see on like marine and RV and how's the pricing there vis-\u00e0-vis auto or other indirect portfolios?","Daniel J. Neumeyer - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.","Okay. Hey, Scott. This is Dan. So, you're correct. The auto concentration limit is just for auto. We have a separate limit for boat and RV. And we really like the boat and RV book. We think that is a real plus that we picked up through the acquisition, a business model and a team that are very skilled. We've supplemented that with external hires who have experience in the business. The profile of our customer there is very strong, FICOs of 790 to 795. The asset size of the boats and RVs that they're purchasing is in a range we're very comfortable with. We're talking $75,000 average size of the vehicle. These tend to be experienced boat and RV owners. And given that profile, the returns are strong as well. So, just on the whole, very nice asset class for us.","R. Scott Siefers - Sandler O\u2019Neill + Partners LP","Okay. All right. That sounds great. Thank you, guys, very much.","Stephen D. Steinour - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.","Thanks, Scott.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies LLC","Thanks, guys. Thanks for clarifying that $12 million in the third quarter. So, the question about forward expenses, the $639 million run rate that you've held to now, can you just help us think about what that means as a starting point going forward? And is there anything else that you're contemplating to continue to hold up a gap on operating leverage in addition to the cost saves you've seen already?","Howell D. McCullough III - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.","So Ken, it's Mac. So, as we've stated in the press release and in the scripts, we're very comfortable achieving the $639 million target in the fourth quarter. I think if you adjust for the $12 million in the third quarter, you can see that, pretty much already there. And we've talked about what that means on a go-forward basis. Clearly, we've got opportunity to recognize the full amount of the cost save in 2018 because we did not recognize the full cost save for full year 2017. So we do expect to recognize some of that benefit going forward as well.","And back on operating leverage, we are committed to positive operating leverage. This will be the fifth year in a row that we're going to achieve it. This is an important goal for us, and we build our plan every year understanding what the revenue opportunity is, thinking about basically a flat rate environment and then building our expense base to provide positive operating leverage on a go-forward basis. So, very committed to that objective and feel confident that we're going to deliver that.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies LLC","Okay. And my second question is, this is the second quarter in a row where you have not built the provision on top of charge-offs. As you had indicated, you would've been doing post-merger as loans move from the FirstMerit book into the regular way book. Is that now a thing of the past or are we now matching from here provisions and charge-offs? And what would change from here, if not?","Daniel J. Neumeyer - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.","Yeah. This is Dan. So, I think what you've seen the last couple of quarters is not what you would expect on a go-forward basis. There are a lot of factors at play when we look at the ACL in a given quarter. We have been aided recently by a big reduction sequentially in our NPAs. I don't expect that type of reduction to continue. So, that has certainly contributed. Those are loans that would have large reserves attached to them. And I think at 49 basis points of non-accrual loans, that certainly is below what we would expect even in these times.","And so, I think that's a factor we have to take into account. So, as I referenced last quarter, I think the way to think about provision on a go-forward basis is covering charge-offs plus some addition for growth. So, I think what you've seen the last couple of quarters is not \u2013 that is not the norm and not what you should expect on a go-forward basis.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies LLC","Just a quick clarification there then, Dan. NPAs might not be going down, but what would be replacing the charge-offs in terms of what's underlying? There's positive trends in delinquencies and all the back stuff. So, why would you see any inflection on even the charge-off side?","Daniel J. Neumeyer - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.","Yeah. Well, I think there's going to be movement from quarter-to-quarter, and I think we've had some very positive movements. We've said \u2013 over time, we do expect \u2013 we've been operating below our long-term goal on charge-offs for quite some time, and I think very gradually we are going to see that drift upwards. So, I think that's another element at work here.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jon Arfstrom with RBC. Please proceed with your question.","Jon Arfstrom - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey. Thanks. Good morning.","Stephen D. Steinour - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.","Hi, Jon.","Howell D. McCullough III - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.","Hey, Jon.","Jon Arfstrom - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey. Maybe, Steve or Dan, a question for you on some of your commercial lending comments. Can you just maybe give us an idea of where and what is bothering you, is it large corporate middle market, is it linked into small business and then what you think might change that environment? Is that something you expect to improve at all next year?","Stephen D. Steinour - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.","Thanks, Jon. This is Steve. We have had a good year in terms of consumer loans, mortgage, home equity, RV\/marine, auto, across the board. So, we're running sort of spot year-to-date, 7% to 8% on that combination of the portfolio. So, that has shown a consistency quarter-to-quarter and good performance. Our middle market lending has grown year-to-date, up 2% to 3%. So, what we've been fighting is headwinds coming off of our large corporate. And it's essentially a combination of fixed income activity, and there's a little bit of upsizing on a dynamic that's been new this year where the number of banks involved in certain relationships are being reduced just so the cross-sell can be provided. I'd add to that that market in particular has gotten extraordinarily competitive, terms, rates, et cetera.","And so, to some extent, we have backed out of that in ways that we might not have \u2013 in ways we wouldn't have previously. Finally, commercial real estate market also is frothy. And we have, as you heard from Mac, we actually have pulled back a percent year-over-year and we have constrained it in a couple of lending types, property types, on purpose. And we're a bit cautious in some of our markets, in particular in those asset categories. So, again, we're long-term shareholders. We're locked in. We have this discipline around aggregate moderate-to-low. If we don't like to return risk profile, we're just not going to go-forward with it. We'll look to do other things, hold the capital or asset substitute, whatever we think is more prudent than just follow the parade.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.","Erika Penala Najarian - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Good morning.","Stephen D. Steinour - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.","Hi, Erika.","Howell D. McCullough III - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.","Hey, Erika.","Erika Penala Najarian - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Just wanted to ask about the other side of the balance sheet. You've been able to keep core deposits very low through this rate tightening cycle. And I'm wondering as we look into next year, how is competition in your footprint shaping up in terms of pricing competition for retail and SME versus larger or middle market corporate?","Howell D. McCullough III - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.","Yeah. Erika, so we're very, very pleased with what we've been able to accomplish in the \u2013 with core deposits in particular from a repricing perspective. I think the slide 7 actually shows some really good trends in terms of what we've done with our core commercial and core consumer deposits. And I think, you just have to go back and think about the strategy that we put in place around fair play and, I think, some of the benefits that we have with our customers around the experience that we deliver, and the number of awards that we've won that I think illustrate the loyalty and satisfaction that our customers have for us.","Having said that, we do see a very rational environment in our footprint. We certainly see competitors doing testing of different products and different pricing. And you see pilots or test take place and you see them pull back. So, I would say that what we see is very rational, and we do expect that to continue. Everyone is in good shape from a liquidity perspective. I think the lack of asset growth is also not requiring that excessive price be paid to raise deposits. And I think that we'll just monitor and make sure that we're testing and piloting different products and different pricing opportunities as well, so that we're ready in case something does change, but we see what is happening in our footprint to be very rational.","Erika Penala Najarian - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you for that. And as a follow-up, I heard you loud and clear, Steve, about commercial real estate concern, and I think a lot of investors share that concern with you. I'm wondering, as we try to benchmark the industry for commercial real estate credit next year, Dan, is it possible for you to share some of your underwriting standards really sort of origination debt service coverage ratio minimums, and at what interest rate you set that debt service coverage ratio to?","Daniel J. Neumeyer - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.","Sure. So, one, our underwriting standards haven't really changed, although, recently we probably have tightened up a little bit in terms of some of the equity requirements going in. but generally, you're going to be looking at a 75% to 80% type LTV. In multifamily, we've actually gone lower in some instances particularly in those markets where we think there may have been over building, but we're looking at a debt-service coverage ratio in the 125 range. We stress those rates at about 6.25%, 30-year amortization. And then on top of that, with the vast majority of our \u2013 once we have personal recourse. And so, very \u2013 very stable underwriting requirements, that as I said, have either maintained or tightened modestly over the last couple of years.","Stephen D. Steinour - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.","Our core customer base still is less than 300 relationships in commercial real estate to give you a sense of the granularity of it and the consistency of strategy.","Daniel J. Neumeyer - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.","Yeah. And, Erika, I would also add that one thing, this is all built on what we call our Tier 1 developers is the majority of who we're lending to. So, we're looking very closely at their global cash flow, their liquidity, and their net worth because in addition to underwriting the individual properties, we are counting on the fact that they have the wherewithal to support our loans in a downturn.","Erika Penala Najarian - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks. I guess when you think about loan growth, obviously, you did take your guidance down, and it sounds like commercial is pretty challenging broadly speaking. But when we think about the factors that are driving this sort of low single-digit growth this year, are there any changes or what do you expect to change next year in terms of the same factors? Like, would you expect the commercial environment to get better or auto to accelerate or vice versa? I'm just trying to get a sense of like what changes the longer term growth outlook for the best? Thanks.","Stephen D. Steinour - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.","This has been a very unusual year, I think, for commercial lending. At least in my career, I haven't seen one where you have GDP expansion sort of increasing over the course of the year and commercial loan activity, for an extended period, being flat to down as you look at that HA data. So, we believe that a combination of factors, but principally related to uncertainty around policy issues and timing are having an impact on marginal investment. And so, as we think about the next year and beyond, we're optimistic that these policy issues are going to get addressed, and that will be stimulative on the whole.","And we like what we see in terms of the activity and planning in our footprint. There's a lot of investment contemplated. We've never had as much foreign direct inquiry in most of the markets we're in as we're experiencing today. The diversification of the economy here sets up I think a series of opportunities as we think about 2018 and beyond. So, we're bullish in terms of outlook, Ken, and think that once these policy issues get addressed, the clarity will help unlock some of what's been restrained this year.","Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. Okay. I will definitely keep my fingers crossed about policy clarity going forward. So, thank you very much.","Stephen D. Steinour - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.","Thanks.","Howell D. McCullough III - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.","Thanks, Ken.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore. Please proceed with your question.","John Pancari - Evercore Group LLC","Good morning.","Stephen D. Steinour - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.","Good morning, John.","John Pancari - Evercore Group LLC","On that same topic, given what you just mentioned about the policy reticence that some borrowers may have, how much of this pullback in your loan growth expectation is it all influenced by some softening on the front-end side, on demand? So, is that apprehension of borrowers changing? Is it getting worse and that influence some of your pullback in your growth expectation or is it primarily the things you already flagged in terms of CRE and cap markets and competitive pressures? Thanks.","Stephen D. Steinour - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.","Well, we think much of the cap market activity has occurred so that, we believe, is abating. But we do see while the tax code revisions are pending, the range of deferred activities. If you're going to sell a business, trying to figure out how to (41:35) this year or next, et cetera, for example. So, we consciously pulled back on commercial real estate this year and especially this past quarter. We just did not like the risk return profiles as we were looking out into 2019 and beyond when a number of these loans would be coming out of construction and leasing. So, that was our decision, but there are broader market impacts that are much more policy-related at this point, John.","John Pancari - Evercore Group LLC","Okay. And then, I guess another way to get \u2013 to dig there is do you have updated line utilization data for the quarter?","Howell D. McCullough III - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.","Basically flat on the commercial side for the quarter.","John Pancari - Evercore Group LLC","Okay. All right.","Stephen D. Steinour - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.","So, auto is typically at a seasonal low with model change-out. So, we have this every year but, overall, on a flat.","John Pancari - Evercore Group LLC","Okay. Got it. Got it. And then, one last thing also to beat the loan growth dead horse. On 2018, how do you think about the pace of where loan growth could go? Is it going to \u2013 if you think of it is in this low 3% to 4% range, is it \u2013 should we think about it in terms of GDP or multiple of GDP? How should we think about that?","Stephen D. Steinour - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.","We think of it as a low multiple of GDP. We got consumer going up 7% to 8% year-to-date, middle market up 2% to 3% year-to-date on spots. A lot of the corporate bond activity we think has occurred, so we think it's stabilizing now. Pipeline looks \u2013 actually, commercial pipeline looks good in this quarter. So, if we can get the tax policy issue addressed, I think that opens up the spigot to some extent, this deferral we hope will spur incremental activity, almost like a burst of activity, John.","John Pancari - Evercore Group LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Stephen D. Steinour - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.","Thank you.","Howell D. McCullough III - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.","Thanks, John.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining-Sparks. Please proceed with your question.","Marty Mosby III - Vining-Sparks IBG L.P.","Thanks.","Stephen D. Steinour - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.","Hi, Marty.","Marty Mosby III - Vining-Sparks IBG L.P.","Hey. Good morning. Slide 8 is \u2013 I've told you several times, I don't like the way that that presents the results. When you look at the decline in the net benefit from $73 million to $19 million, that's about a $50 million decline, that when you're just looking at this one slide by itself, but when you roll over and you look at slides 11 and 12, what you're then showing is that the synergies of the deal, the revenue side generates about $50 million and if you take about $100 million of net spillover into next year from what you get on the expense synergies, that $50 million really gets just kind of like a prepayment to the positives that you're getting out of the synergies. So, am I thinking of that right in a sense of netting out those two things when you really get to the bottom-line impact as you go from 2017 into 2018?","Howell D. McCullough III - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.","Yeah, Marty. I think you're absolutely right on that point. We like slide 8 because it does give some visibility into what's happening with the margin in particular. And obviously fighting through some of the noise in the margin is important as we communicate the message, and I think slide 8 has been effective. But I do appreciate, you continue to point out the fact that the synergies are definitely offsetting that impact.","Marty Mosby III - Vining-Sparks IBG L.P.","And the other thing that I was thinking about was, when you show the revenue enhancements, you're leaving out one of the bigger pieces which is, when you actually made the acquisition you weren't really paying for or anticipating that rates were going to go up. And as rates have now started to move higher, there is a benefit of the margin on the FirstMerit deposits was something that you really weren't counting on, which is a revenue enhancement. And I think the end result of that is when you look at your return on tangible common equity target it was 13% to 15%. You're saying you're already going to be at 15% and you kind of roll these net benefits into 2018, I think you're kind of rounding up to around 16% as you look into next year. So, I think some of that delta on the favorable could just be out of the deposits that you're being able to get the profitability from.","Howell D. McCullough III - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.","That's another great point. I think one of the real benefits of the FirstMerit acquisition was the quality of the core deposit base. On the retail side, in particular, but also in the commercial side. And tremendous value creation, if you think about that, that deposit base and where the rate environment is going. So clearly, a big benefit to the value of the transaction, and we probably should talk about that more.","Marty Mosby III - Vining-Sparks IBG L.P.","And just humor one last question, if you think of the credit, your guidance kind of assumes the \u2013 kind of just a general deterioration, but there's really nothing in the portfolio that suggest charge-offs in the low 20 should be mid-30s until we kind of get some deterioration. So, is this really just kind of a general over the cycle, we're going to be somewhere in this 35 basis points to 55 basis points? And really if you look at where we're at and that this current environment sustains itself, isn't there an opportunity to remain below that guided range for a period of time?","Daniel J. Neumeyer - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.","Yeah. Marty, this is Dan. I do believe that we will remain below the range. Although, one thing to keep in mind is even if gross charge-offs don't increase materially, the recoveries that we have available to us are shrinking just because we have not had significant charge-offs over the last few years. So, I think that's one component, that again, I think the increase will be modest and gradual. But nonetheless, I don't think it's reasonable to anticipate that we're going to sustain these levels long term.","Marty Mosby III - Vining-Sparks IBG L.P.","Thanks.","Stephen D. Steinour - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.","Thanks, Marty.","Howell D. McCullough III - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.","Thanks, Marty.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Emlen Harmon with JMP Securities. Please proceed with your question.","Emlen Harmon - JMP Securities LLC","Good morning. Steve, could you \u2013 hey \u2013 Steve, could you talk a little bit about your appetite for M&A with FirstMerit effectively kind of fully integrated here? And what kind of opportunity you would need to see to be interested?","Stephen D. Steinour - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.","Well, let's back up, we completed the expense side of this. But as we have been sharing, we have a lot of revenue synergy, and that is not complete. And there's also the full assimilation, the culture getting the company set, so we're very, very focused. Our first priority is to get that FirstMerit revenue as we go through 2018.","Emlen Harmon - JMP Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks. And then if John kind of beat the dead horse on loan demand, I'm going to maybe kick it a little bit. But you mentioned a few times tax reform as a hang-up on demand. Seems like we've also got just kind of building uncertainty regarding the country status in NAFTA at least as far as the headlines are concerned. I guess, with Michigan and Ohio, two of the bigger exporters to North America, have you guys kind of \u2013 are you guys talking to your borrower base at all just in terms of how that's impacting demand for those borrowers and if you thought about just on exposure there of the exporting community?","Stephen D. Steinour - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.","That's a great point. There's clearly an impact in our footprint. There's a sense of optimism that the NAFTA negotiations are going to get to a rational conclusion. So, I would start with that. And I think I mentioned this earlier, auto is going to have its fifth best year, we believe, in history. So, there's a stability on some of the engines here as we think about going forward. And then, the diversification of the economy, just the sheer scale of the economies in our footprint are huge factors that help contribute to our optimism in terms of going forward.","Emlen Harmon - JMP Securities LLC","Great. Thanks. Thanks for taking the questions.","Stephen D. Steinour - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.","Thanks, Emlen.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Moss with FBR Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Kyle Peterson - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Hey. Good morning, guys. This is actually Kyle Peterson on for Steve today.","Stephen D. Steinour - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.","Hi, Kyle.","Kyle Peterson - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","I wondered if you could touch on the NIM outlook, both kind of the core and the GAAP in the fourth quarter given that it looks like accretion will take a leg down here. I guess are we looking at maybe a stable-ish core NIM, and then kind of GAAP goes down with the \u2013 given the accretion or how should we think about that?","Howell D. McCullough III - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.","Yeah. I would say that we're going to continue to see the reported NIM decline because accretion is going to change or decline from here. But I think the core NIM is going to continue to expand even in a flat rate environment assumption that we're making. So, really, fourth quarter will fall into that trend, I believe. And as we move into 2018 even in the unchanged rate scenario, I think we see expansion in the core.","Kyle Peterson - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Okay. So, I guess to follow up on that, is the core expansion, is that mix shift or are you guys seeing favorable pricing, or kind of what's driving the core NIM expansion in a flat rate environment?","Howell D. McCullough III - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.","Yeah. So, we basically just have asset portfolios being replaced at higher yields as we see runoff and replacement, so we're originating at higher yields relative to where we were a year ago. So, I think that's the primary driver in what we're seeing.","Kyle Peterson - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Okay. And is that \u2013 that's both on the loans and securities or just one or the other?","Howell D. McCullough III - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.","Both categories, loans and securities.","Kyle Peterson - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","All right. Great. Thank you, guys.","Howell D. McCullough III - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.","Thanks.","Stephen D. Steinour - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.","Thanks, Kyle.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Long with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.","David J. Long - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Good morning, everyone.","Stephen D. Steinour - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.","Good morning, Dave.","David J. Long - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Moving to liability side of the balance sheet, looking at deposits, you guys had a very good quarter there on the deposit growth. And I wanted to see if you could talk about any promotions or changes in pricing that may have impacted the growth there, and then given the slowdown in loan expectations, what you'd expect out of that deposit growth going forward.","Howell D. McCullough III - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.","Yeah. Dave, it's Mac. So, I would say nothing really in the way of promotions we did, and I mentioned this in the script. We did look at some pricing on the commercial side in order to grow some of our balances there and retain some balances that we thought was a good tradeoff relative to wholesale funding. So, I would tell you that, on the margin, we probably did increase price on the commercial side in the quarter. But we saw a nice benefit from doing that relative to the cost of wholesale funding. And going forward, I would tell you that I think it's stable and steady in terms of what we've seen, and how we think about the funding from a core perspective on both the consumer and the commercial side going forward. That will depend, of course, on what happens with the Fed and when we see rate increases, if we see rate increases, but as I mentioned earlier, we see our market being very rational from a pricing perspective, and not a lot of pressure on the liquidity side right now.","David J. Long - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Excellent. Thanks for the color, Mac. That's all I have.","Howell D. McCullough III - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks, Dave.","Stephen D. Steinour - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.","Thanks, Dave.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Terry McEvoy with Stephens, Inc. Please proceed with your question.","Terry J. McEvoy - Stephens, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning.","Stephen D. Steinour - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.","Hey, Terry.","Terry J. McEvoy - Stephens, Inc.","Hi. Within the original FirstMerit merger model, you assumed a 3%, call it, core increase in annual operating expenses, and as we think about 2018, is that still a good number to use as it relates to just core growth? And then, could you help me understand the seasonality on the expense line next year? Will there be a bump up in maybe the first half of the year, and then drift lower implying maybe 4Q 2018 would be below that of the earlier quarters of the year?","Howell D. McCullough III - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.","Yeah, Terry. So, we're working through 2018 right now, and I think the way we think about building a budget we start with an unchanged rate environment, and we get the revenue side of the equation right based upon where we see loan growth coming in, and obviously, some of the investments we've made in FirstMerit and fee income categories. And then, we determine what we can spend from an expense perspective based on the investments that we want to make. And we do continue to make the right investments in the business. And of course, we go the normal cost associated with our colleagues in infrastructure and the whole nine yards. So we did assume 3% in the FirstMerit merger model.","That's not a bad number to think about on a long-term basis. As I mentioned earlier, we do get additional benefits from the cost take-outs on a full-year basis in 2018. So that should be considered as well. On a seasonality basis, we typically see higher expenses in the second quarter and that has to do with a couple of things. We have the Merit change for our colleagues in the second quarter. We also have some onetime impacts from compensation, equity compensation hitting in the second quarter as well. And then, typically, the first quarter is a little bit lower than the third and the fourth quarters. So, it's, I would say, lower in the first, higher in the second, and then, from a seasonality perspective, probably drifting down in the third and fourth, this is the way to think about it.","Terry J. McEvoy - Stephens, Inc.","Great. Thank you. And then just one question \u2013 follow-up question. The 38 branches and drive-through locations that were consolidated in the third quarter. Was that originally part of the FirstMerit transaction in the $255 million of cost saves. And I guess the reason I ask is, I didn't see those expenses taken out in the press release in terms of call them a merger and acquisition-related expense.","Howell D. McCullough III - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.","Yeah, Terry. Those were not a part of the original $255 million. When we announced this, we did disclose that we're reinvesting a good portion of the savings there back into digital and our colleagues. So, I wouldn't expect that you would see a material impact in the run rate from that transaction.","Terry J. McEvoy - Stephens, Inc.","Great. Thanks again.","Howell D. McCullough III - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Stephen D. Steinour - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.","Thanks, Terry.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Barker with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed with your question.","Kevin J. Barker - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Thanks. You brought up the net charge-off guidance, 1 basis point, not a big deal, but you also saw your classified loans to move higher a bit here. Could you just talk about the overall environment for credit and your expectations into 4Q and then into 2018?","Daniel J. Neumeyer - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.","Yes. So, I think \u2013 this is Dan. I think expectations are fairly stable. We've seen, as you noted, criticized did go up in the quarter, but that didn't incorporate the SNC (57:48) results from the most recent review. We continue to feel we have a very proactive and conservative risk rating. And I think that's underscored by the fact that you haven't seen the migration into nonaccruals, and then ultimately into charge-offs. So, while the criticized loans were up, still feel that the portfolio is in really good shape, although we're at historic lows in many of our metrics. And I think that, as I mentioned earlier with less recoveries on the charge-off front, that is \u2013 we're going to see a mild and gradual increase there. But, overall, we feel very good about the portfolio and look for stability in the quarters to come.","Kevin J. Barker - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Okay. And then, a follow-up on some of the revenue growth numbers or at least in the loan growth that questions have been asked. In regards to your ability to continue to generate operating leverage going into 2018, do you still require some type of loan growth in the mid-single digits or can you continue to generate that operating leverage given the expense saving programs that you have in place even if loan growth comes in at the lower end of your expectations?","Howell D. McCullough III - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.","Yeah. Kevin, I believe we can continue to generate positive operating leverage. And in particular, in 2018, you have to consider the revenue synergies that we're getting out of FirstMerit. Investments we've made in the fee income businesses in particular on the Huntington side there that are taking hold. And we do continue to have good consumer loan growth of very high quality and attractive growth rates. So, feel confident that we'll see positive operating leverage.","Kevin J. Barker - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Thank you.","Howell D. McCullough III - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.","Thank you.","Stephen D. Steinour - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.","Thanks, Kevin.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Peter Winter with Wedbush Securities. Please proceed with your question.","Peter J. Winter - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Good morning.","Stephen D. Steinour - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.","Good morning, Peter.","Peter J. Winter - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Just given the comments that you're a little bit more cautious on commercial real estate and you've had good success expanding the indirect auto into other markets. Is that something that you would \u2013 you think about ramping up that expansion of the indirect auto going to newer markets?","Stephen D. Steinour - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.","Peter, it's Steve Steinour. We like the footprint presence we have. We do not anticipate expanding into any new markets at this time.","Peter J. Winter - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then, just very quickly, follow-up. Can you talk about how it's going in the newer markets of Chicago and Wisconsin, and are you seeing more potential revenue opportunities there?","Stephen D. Steinour - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.","Well, we do see growth and revenue opportunities. We've had a very good start to small business lending, SBA lending, in particular, we're number two in Chicago, on units and dollars, and number two and three in Wisconsin on units and dollars, and that's from a zero start. So that has ramped up quickly. Our residential mortgage lending is ramping up. We'll be adding to the team, including in the fourth quarter on resi mortgage. We like what we have seen from the commercial teams. We had some great talent joining us from FirstMerit, so feel really pleased with how that team is performing, the commercial teams, how they're performing. And then the branches themselves, the consumer businesses, are doing well and holding deposits and growing our customer base. So, pleased with the positions we've inherited in both states.","Peter J. Winter - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Stephen D. Steinour - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.","Thanks, Peter.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back over to Steve Steinour for any closing remarks.","Stephen D. Steinour - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.","So, we produced solid results in the third quarter and I'm confident we're going to finish the year strong. Our strategies are working and the execution of our goals continue to drive positive results. We expect to continue to gain market share and grow share of wallet. Our top priorities are growing our core businesses and realizing the revenue synergies from FirstMerit. The integration of FirstMerit is substantially complete with the announced expense reductions fully implemented. We expect the fourth quarter run rate to demonstrate these benefits, and we expect to achieve all of our long-term financial goals in the fourth quarter of 2017 and into 2018.","Finally, I always like to include a reminder that there's high level of alignment between the board, management and our colleagues, and our shareholders. The board and our colleagues are collectively one of the largest shareholders of Huntington. We have hold the retirement requirements on certain shares, so we will continue to proactively manage risks and volatility and are appropriately focused on driving sustained long-term performance.

At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the Huntington National Bank Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Todd Beekman, Director of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference.","Todd Beekman","Thank you, Martina, and welcome. A copy of the slides that we will be reviewing can be found on our website, www.huntington.com. This call is being recorded and will be available as a rebroadcast starting about an hour after the close of the call.","Slides 2 and 3 note several aspects of the basis of today's presentation. I encourage you to read these, but let me point out one key disclosure. This presentation will reference non-GAAP financial measures. In that regard, I will direct you to the comparable GAAP financials and the reconciliation to the comparable GAAP financial measures within the presentation, the additional earnings-related material we released this morning and related 8-K filed today, all of which can be found on our website.","Turning to Slide 4. Today's discussion, including the Q&A period, may contain forward-looking statements. Such statements are based on information and assumption available at this time and are subject to change, risk and uncertainties, which may cause actual results to differ materially. We assume no obligation to update such statements. For a complete discussion of risks and uncertainties, please refer to this slide and the material we filed with the SEC, including our most recent 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filings.","Now turning to Slide 5 in our presentation. Participating today is Steve Steinour, Chairman, President and CEO; Don Kimble, our CFO; and Dan Neumeyer, our Chief Credit Officer. Let's get started and turning to Slide 6. Don?","Donald R. Kimble","Thank you, Todd, and welcome, everyone. We'll begin with a review of our third quarter performance highlights. Dan will provide an update on credit, Steve will then provide you with an update on our strategy and then close with a discussion of our expectations.","Turning to Slide 7. We reported net income of $167.8 million or $0.19 per share, up from $0.17 per share last quarter and $0.16 in the year-ago quarter. Total revenues increased $8.1 million or an annualized 5% from the second quarter. Most of the improvement came from our noninterest income. Noninterest income increased $7.2 million, with a $6.3 million improvement in mortgage banking revenues driving most of this change. Our net interest income increased $0.8 million, reflecting a 4 basis point decrease in the margin and a $0.3 billion increase in earning assets. Total loans declined by $1 billion reflecting the impact of transferring $1.3 billion of auto loans to held for sale at the end of the second quarter.","Average total core deposits were up 9% annualized from the second quarter led by strong growth in commercial deposits. Noninterest expense increased $14 million. The current quarter reflected a $4.7 million increase in personnel costs, almost entirely related to higher health care costs, a $4.4 million increase in the cost of extinguishment of debt related to loss on our trust redemption this quarter and a gain last quarter.","And the quarter also included $4.5 million of cost related to our capital plan and stress test model development during the current quarter. The quarter also included one significant item, which was a $19.5 million state deferred tax valuation allowance benefit.","Turning to Slide 8. Steve will provide additional detail later in the call, but you can see that our OCR methodology is continuing to drive success throughout the company. Turning to credit quality, net charge-offs increased $20.9 million this quarter. Of this quarter's net charge-offs, $33 million or 3 -- 33 basis points were related to regulatory guidance requiring consumer loans discharged under Chapter 7 bankruptcy to be charged down to collateral value. Over 90% continue to make payments as scheduled. Despite an additional $63 million of nonaccrual loans related to Chapter 7 bankruptcy, nonaccrual loans were down $29.1 million or 6%. Our allowance for credit losses as a percentage of nonaccrual loans decreased 3 percentage points to 189%.","With regard to capital, our tangible common equity ratio rose 33 basis points to 8.74%. The Tier 1 common also increased, up 20 basis points from last quarter. Our Tier 1 and our total risk-based capital ratios declined by 5 basis points and 6 basis points, respectively, reflecting the impact of our trust preferred redemption.","Turning to Slide 9 and other highlights for the quarter. We were recognized by MONEY Magazine this year as one of the best banks in America. This is the second year in a row that we've received recognition from this magazine. Another periodical, Bank Director Magazine, ranked Huntington as the second best bank in the country. Our capital management actions continued in the current quarter with an additional 3.7 million shares purchased and the previously announced redemptions of our trust-preferred securities. Our wealth area launched 2 new ETFs, and we entered into 2 new sponsorships in the state of Michigan.","Slide 10 provides a summary of our quarterly earnings trends. Many of the performance metrics will be discussed later in the presentation.","So turning to Slide 11. We show a summary income statement for the quarter and also on a year-to-date basis. We adjust the revenue and expenses for items like the gain on the Fidelity acquisition and the first quarter's addition to litigation reserve. We also show the impact of adjusting for our tax benefit, recognized this quarter. While we did not have positive operating leverage in the third quarter, we continue to see modest positive operating leverage on a year-to-date basis. This performance was despite the negative quarterly impact of approximately $17 million related to the Durbin Amendment effective in the fourth quarter of last year. We continue to expect positive operating leverage for the full year.","Slide 12 provides trends in the net interest income and margin. The right-hand side of the slide provides a 4 basis point -- it displays a 4 basis point decrease to our net interest margin to 3.38%, which reflected 6 basis points of reduction related to the impact of the extended low-rate environment on asset, yields and mix, a 4 basis point decline from the balance sheet management changes. And these were offset by 6 basis points of increase from the reduction in deposit rates and improvement in deposit mix.","Turning to Slide 13. On the right side, you can see that we've shown continued improvement in our deposit mix over the last 5 quarters, as noninterest-bearing DDA balances increased to 27% from 21% of total average deposits. The improved deposit mix reflects the success of Fair Play banking on growing consumer DDAs, as well as our treasury management and OCR focus on growing commercial demand deposits. This improving mix has contributed to the 29 basis point decline in our average rate paid on total deposits over the last 5 quarters. On the left-hand side of the slide, you can see that the maturity schedule of our CD portfolio and another wave of higher-cost CDs are expected to mature in the middle of 2013.","Slide 14 provides a summary income statement and some color on items impacted linked quarter performance. Items of note included $6.3 million of improvement in mortgage banking revenues. This improvement reflected the higher secondary marketing gains, as origination volumes remained fairly stable at about $1.2 billion for the quarter. This quarter also included $4 million of security gains as we repositioned our portfolio by increasing our Held-to-Maturity securities portfolio by $0.9 billion to $1.6 billion.","Noninterest expenses increased by $14 million this quarter, reflecting $4.5 million of regulatory costs related to this year's capital plan. We would expect these costs to continue at this level for the next quarter but do not -- not to continue into 2013. Our personnel costs were up $4.7 million for this quarter, primarily related to health care costs up 37% from last quarter. This increase reflects both the impact of a few large claims, along with seasonal trends. As we've announced earlier in the quarter, we continue to redeem our higher cost trust-preferred securities. We have $300 million of trust-preferred securities remaining, with an average rate of LIBOR plus 102 basis points.","Slide 15 reflects the trends in capital. Intangible common equity ratio increased to 8.74%, up from 8.41% at the end of the prior quarter. The Tier 1 common risk-based capital ratio increased to 10.28% from 10.08% at the end of the prior quarter. These ratios reflect the impact of repurchasing 3.7 million common shares for approximately $25 million. The Tier 1 and total risk-based capital ratios declined by 5 and 6 basis points, respectively, reflecting the impact of $114 million of trust-preferred securities redemption.","Slide 16 provides an update on the performance of our in-store strategy. We currently have 83 stores open under the Giant Eagle and Meijer partnership. We'll open another 44 stores by the end of 2013. We have stated our expectation for a 2-year breakeven for these stores. During the fourth quarter, we'll have 4 in-store branches that have been opened for this 2-year time period, 3 of which are already at breakeven or better. The impact of this strategy has reduced our pretax, pre-provision earnings by approximately $20 million in 2012. This proactive pretax pre-provision earnings is expected to continue into 2013, as the estimated $25 million increase to total expenses should be offset over the course of the year by the revenue generated from maturing branches. The total in-store strategy is expected to be breakeven in 2014.","We continue to be pleased with the performance of this initiative and the value of the partnerships and the financial results, especially when considering the negative impact of this low-rate environment. Now let me turn the presentation over to Dan.","Daniel J. Neumeyer","Thanks, Don. Slide 17 provides an overview of our credit quality trends. The third quarter charge-off ratio reflects an increase to 105 basis points, up from 82 basis points 1 quarter earlier. However, the ratio was impacted by $33 million, or 33 basis points, by the regulatory guidance related to Chapter 7 bankruptcy, consumer loans. Looking through this impact, both the commercial and consumer portfolios experienced improvement. Loans past due, greater than 90 days and still accruing, were relatively stable in the quarter and very well-controlled. You may recall that the second quarter uptick in past dues were caused by the acquired Fidelity portfolio. Fidelity loans include accruing, purchased impaired loans which were recorded at fair value upon acquisition and will remain in accruing status. The NPA ratio showed modest improvement in the quarter despite the addition of $63 million of new non-accruals due to the related impact of the previously referenced Chapter 7 loans. The criticized asset ratio also showed improvement, falling from 6.01% to 5.45%. The allowance for loan and leased loss and the allowance for credit loss to loans ratios fell in the quarter to 1.96% and 2.09%, respectively, reflecting continued asset quality improvement. The ALLL and ACL coverage ratios both fell modestly, although they remain healthy and appropriate given the generally improving loan portfolio, including lower nonperforming loans.","Slide 18 shows the trends in our nonperforming assets. The chart on the left demonstrates a modest but sustained reduction in our nonperforming assets. The improvement in the quarter is impacted by the addition of the $63 million referenced earlier. Similarly, the chart on the right shows the NPA inflows, which also includes the additional $63 million. That $63 million accounts for 16 basis points of the 53 basis points of inflows.","Slide 19 provides a reconciliation of our nonperforming asset flows. NPAs fell by 3% in the quarter, compared to 1% reduction in the prior quarter. As already mentioned, inflows increased in the third quarter due to the Chapter 7-related loans. Payments and return to accruing status were both up in the quarter and contributed to the quarter-over-quarter reduction.","Turning to Slide 20. We provide a similar flow analysis of commercial criticized loans. This quarter saw a sizable reduction in criticized inflows as the previous quarter included $213 million of inflows related to the folding in of the Fidelity portfolio. Upgrades of previously criticized loans, along with increased paydowns, resulted in an 11% decrease in criticized commercial loans for the quarter, the largest reduction experienced in the last year.","Moving to Slide 21. Commercial loan delinquencies remain elevated in both the 30- and 90-day categories, or over what we had shown from the second quarter of '11 through the first quarter of '12. This increase is due to the addition of the Fidelity portfolio. All of the 90-day delinquencies are related to the Fidelity purchased impaired loans, which were recorded at fair value upon acquisition and remain in accruing status. However, delinquencies remain very well-controlled.","Slide 22 outlines consumer loan delinquencies, which are in line with expectations and reveal a generally improving trend. In aggregate, 30-day consumer delinquencies showed modest improvement quarter-over-quarter as depicted in the chart on the left. Both residential and auto loans showed improvement quarter-over-quarter, while home equity delinquencies were up slightly. 90-day delinquencies continued their overall decline, with auto flat quarter-to-quarter, residential down, and home equity up 3 basis points.","Reviewing Slide 23. The loan-loss provision of $37 million was relatively flat from the prior quarter and was less than charge-offs by $68 million. The ratio of ACL to NALs continued the modest decline, from 192% to 189%. The ACL to loans was lower at 2.09%, compared with 2.28% last quarter. Most of the major credit metrics continued to show a continued improvement and therefore, we believe these coverage levels remain adequate and appropriate. In summary, we remain pleased with the quarter's results and expect continued positive movement in the coming quarters despite ongoing economic concerns. And now, I'll turn it back to Steve.","Stephen D. Steinour","Thank you, Dan. Turning to Slide 24. As mentioned in Don's opening comments, our Fair Play banking philosophy, coupled with our optimal customer relationship or OCR process, continues to drive significant new customer acquisitions and increasing share of wallet. This slide recaps the continued strong upward trend in consumer checking account households. In the third quarter, consumer checking account households grew at an annualized rate of 12.7% to 1,204,000. We've grown households at a 12% rate over the last year, and since we've launched our new consumer strategy in the middle of 2010, we've added over 240,000 households. 4+ products and services penetration is relatively similar to last quarter at 75.9%, an increase over 3% since this time last year. The pause in the 4+ growth looks to be related to the timing of ACH payments that look to have cleared in early October versus month-end September for approximately 6% of the households.","For the third quarter, related revenue was $246 million, down $4 million from the second quarter of 2012. However, it was $6 million lower than a year ago. As you may recall, the fourth quarter negative impact of Durban was $17 million, so when you compare just our consumer household revenue year-over-year, we've already made up over 65% of the mandated reduction in debit card interchange fees.","Slides 31 and 32 in the appendix provide additional details regarding consumer quarterly OCR trends.","Turning to Slide 25. Commercial relationship growth remained strong, but as we commented in the release, customer sentiment changed late in the quarter and this directly impacted growth. Commercial relationships in the third quarter grew at an annualized rate of 7.9% and were up nearly 10% from a year ago. While there was a slowdown in new relationship acquisition, we continue to increase cross-sell. At the end of the third quarter, 33.5% of our commercial relationships utilized 4 or more products or services, this was nearly 1% higher than last quarter and over a 4% increase from a year ago. Related commercial revenue, just like LIBOR and capital markets activities, continued to be volatile, decreasing $13 million, and it is a similar level from the third quarter of 2011. Slides 33 and 34 in the appendix provide additional details.","Turning to Slide 26. Our strategy of investing in the business to grow the customer base, coupled with our OCR sales process to drive additional cross-sell and improve customer retention, is positively impacting the company's financial performance. The local Midwest economy plays an important role on our customer needs for additional financial services.","Consumer sentiment has changed little and the pipeline of new commercial customers remains robust, but there has been a clear hesitation with commercial customers given the uncertainties surrounding the election and fiscal cliff. Nevertheless, we continue to benefit from the strength in the Midwest and our ability -- and the ability of our strategy will continue to drive growth and improve profitability. With regard to net interest income, we anticipate it will be relatively stable, modest total loan growth. Excluding any future impacts of additional auto securitizations, it is expected to continue, as is growth in low-cost deposits. So the benefit from this growth is expected be offset by net interest margin pressure.","C&I loans are expected to show a steady growth reflecting the benefits of our strategic initiatives to expand our business in commercial and the expertise in the related verticals. Commercial Real Estate loans are expected to modestly decline from current levels. Residential mortgages and home equity loan growth is expected to be relatively flat. We continue to expect to see strong automobile loan origination, so on balance sheet, growth will be muted due to expectations of completing occasional securitizations.","Growth in no- and low-cost deposits remains our focus. Growth in overall total deposits, however, is expected to be slightly less than growth in total loans. Noninterest income is expected to be relatively stable from this quarter's level, when you exclude any auto securitizations and security gains and net impact from the MSR. We expect our growth in new relationships and increased cross-sell success to be offset by a slowdown in mortgage banking activity.","For 2012, we continue to anticipate positive operating leverage and modest improvement in our expense efficiency ratio. This will likely reflect more the benefit of revenue growth as expenses could increase slightly. While we continue our focus on improving expense efficiency throughout the company, we anticipate additional regulatory costs and expenses associated with strategic actions. On the credit front, we can expect to see continued improvement from current levels. There could be some quarterly volatility given the uncertain and uneven nature of the economic recovery. The level of provision expense, as mentioned earlier, is at the low end of our long-term expectations. We will remain disciplined in our growth and pricing of loans and deposits, and there's still some leverage there. We continue to believe 2012 will be another year of marked progress in positioning Huntington for measured growth and improvement in sustainable long-term profitability.","Thanks for your interest in Huntington.","Todd Beekman","Operator, we'll now take questions. [Operator Instructions]","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Erika Penala from Bank of America.","Leanne Erika Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","My question is just sort of clarity on some of the expectations that you laid out for us, which we appreciate. As the top line is expected to be relatively stable and you're expecting some expense growth, some modest expense growth, what is going to fuel EPS growth for 2013? Should we count on the provision staying at the low end of the range? Or am I thinking of it too simplistically?","Donald R. Kimble","Yes. Erika, this is Don, and I don't know that we provided explicit guidance yet for '13, but we're very focused on improving the operating earnings of the company that in the near term, we will have some challenges because of the impact of some of our initiatives, namely the in-store branches, and so the addition of $25 million of expenses there we believe will be offset by other expense initiatives to help minimize that. We don't expect to have a significant positive operating leverage, but we are very focused on trying to drive that. As far as the credit outlook, we expect to continue to see improvement in the overall credit metrics and the provision will reflect the immediate reserves and the establishment of the provision for that.","Leanne Erika Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And my follow-up question is for Steve. Steve, I think you have a very clear message to the investor community that you're looking to invest in this franchise over the long term. I'm curious as to -- if the operating environment lengthens some of your -- some of -- how long it takes, for example, to break even with some of your initiatives, how quickly will you look for expense rationalization elsewhere? For example, if the in-store branch network, not because of your efforts, but let's say because of the operating environment, takes longer than you think to break even, how quickly can you pull expense levers elsewhere?","Stephen D. Steinour","Well, we're continuing to work expenses throughout the company and we will do so next year, and so we're offsetting some of the investments with reductions in a variety of other areas and that will continue. We're going to be paced about further expansions at this point, and I think we've got enough momentum and opportunities to absorb what we've already committed and still drive the company in the fashion we want to, Erika.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zerbe from Morgan Stanley.","Ken A. Zerbe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","My question's on capital deployment. If I remember right, you had about $180 million that you could have bought back through first quarter of 2013, but it looks like buybacks slowed a lot this quarter. I was wondering if you can just provide a little more detail on kind of what your buyback strategy is and should we expect an acceleration in buybacks over the next couple of quarters just to get you up to the CCAR level? Or is there something else that we should be considering?","Donald R. Kimble","Ken, this is Don. And as far as the capital deployment, you're right that our approval for our capital plan included the ability to buy back over $180 million worth of common stock, that our strategy, as far as executing against that, has really had a couple of components, one is more of a recurring-based approach and another is to be more price-sensitive. And so this past quarter, we didn't see the same number of opportunities that we would have had in the second quarter to execute against that more price-sensitive type of strategy and we'll continue to reassess that as we work through the year.","Ken A. Zerbe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Does your commentary on slowing loan growth play a part into just the lack of other options you have for that capital? I mean, with all things equal, with the same price, would you buy more stock because of the lack of loan growth opportunities?","Donald R. Kimble","Well, we do see loan growth slowing some, but it might just change the mix of business a little bit. I don't know that, that would have a direct impact on our share buyback approach or timing.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bob Ramsey from FBR.","Bob Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Along those same lines, if the market doesn't give you more attractive opportunities for buybacks and as you have highlighted, you do have a good deal of excess capital. How do you think about deploying that to the dividend and dividend increases potentially?","Donald R. Kimble","As far as dividend increases that -- we really are constrained based on the capital plan that we submitted last year, then we'll be reassessing that for the current plan that we'll be submitting in January to see if there's other opportunities in connection with return of capital. But now, we don't have any flexibility through the first quarter of next year as far as assessing that.","Bob Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Well, as you, I guess, think about the plan for next year, I mean, do you have a payout ratio in mind that you guys would ideally like to work towards? Or how do you think about what the right level of dividend could be?","Donald R. Kimble","We're still working through that strategy now. We have a lot of thoughts and opinions on that and we'll be working that into our recommended plan and reviewing that with the regulators. So I wouldn't want to comment or provide any expectation at this point in time as far as any changes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Siefers from Sandler O'Neill.","R. Scott Siefers - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","I guess on the theme of overall growth and then kind of tying it back into some of these capital deployment questions. If the loan growth environment is kind of getting a little tougher, does this change at all the way you would think about potentially doing M&A? I mean, Steve, you've been, I think, pretty clear about what kinds of banks you'd like to buy, but if the longer-term growth profile is maybe slowing a little bit, does that have any ramification on the way you think about looking externally for growth?","Stephen D. Steinour","No, the answer to your question, definitely. We're -- we've established some criteria. We're going to be disciplined about the use of capital. If we find the right situation, we have the capacity to do things and -- but as you've seen throughout the year, we're going to retain the discipline. Despite -- the loan growth is only part of the story, Scott. We're getting extraordinarily strong, deposit household, consumer deposit household growth. And while the attractiveness of DDA in this interest rate environment is muted, it is contributing to our ability to actually manage a NIM expansion year-over-year in a meaningful way. So we like what's going on with our acquisition on the deposit side, and our cross-sell to those households, and we'll be working that very, very diligently, and then acquisition has the potential to create a bit of a distraction. So to that, like the fundamentals of the business in a number of respects, but we clearly will need to be driving at even a higher level, going forward, given this new interest rate environment.","R. Scott Siefers - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay, I appreciate that. And then I guess, Don, kind of a follow-on on the idea of growth and specifically with regards to the auto portfolio. I guess I've looked at the securitizations that you've been doing the last couple of years, as in part, just a way to help cap auto's contribution to the overall loan portfolio. But by the same token, it has generated some fee income. Have you guys given any thought, given that originations are still pretty strong, to maybe making those securitizations a little more frequent or regular, such that it could become a more consistent fee contributor?","Donald R. Kimble","Scott, as far as that question, we understand the value of having more frequent securitizations. The challenge we have is that there are costs associated with each transaction and we want to make sure that we're economic and efficient as far as execution on those. And so we do believe that we'll probably continue at, say, 2 a year, and the size of those securitizations might be changed slightly. We announced earlier this month that we closed a transaction of $1 billion, which was down from the previous securitization transaction, and also reflects the impact of the partial loan sale we had during the third quarter. So I think you might see a little bit more flexibility as far as the size of future transactions as opposed to the frequency.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So just isolating the C&I loan growth rate, and you're kind of more conservative comments today on the forward trend, I'm wondering, what was the impact from floor plan seasonality and any other items that may have been unusual or any other loan segments that might have been negatively seasonal in the third quarter? Was there anything else?","Donald R. Kimble","There really wasn't much else as far as seasonality and floor plan loans generally were fairly stable. So we didn't see much increase. What we really did see though was, in the month of September, commercial loan balances were fairly stable and we would tend to see a little bit of a step-up at the end of each quarter. And so that's why we showed a little bit slower growth in general than what we had in previous quarters.","Stephen D. Steinour","Craig, the pipeline going into the third quarter was strong and currently is strong. What we saw, more deferred decision-making throughout the quarter, and that may be the environment until we get beyond this fiscal cliff uncertainty, which is why we're trying to just adjust expectation. I don't think the fundamentals have changed and our activities haven't changed. So I think we're in a moment of pause, but we're trying to be conservative and\/or realistic depending on what happens with the upcoming election and the cliff.","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And Steve, if you look at last quarter's, fourth quarter growth rate in C&I, it was very strong for almost every bank out there, very strong. A lot of that did then go away in January, but with that seasonal trend in the past, I guess your guess is the negative decision-making related to the fiscal cliff and election will more than offset that, sort of keeping C&I loan growth well below where it's even been in the nonseasonal quarters.","Stephen D. Steinour","We do have that outlook. Obviously, there's a lot at play over the next 4 months here. And the fundamentals, however, remain encouraging, but a lot of our business, and it may be unique to us, compared to some of the other banks you're looking at, is with privately-held businesses. And put yourself in their shoes, you've got tremendous levels of uncertainty and I think that's causing a pullback, a deferral.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin from Jefferies.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Don, I was wondering if you can just give us a little bit more color on the earning asset yield side. Number one, understanding the volume comments that you guys have all made, can you just talk us through what you're seeing in terms of the incremental pricing on the loan side? And then secondly, it does look like you're allowing some of the securities portfolio to run down a little bit. Can you talk about cash flows and your kind of from and to rates as far as how you're thinking about the tough rate environment with regards to securities and reinvestments?","Donald R. Kimble","Sure. As far as the loan yields, the C&I loan yields for the current quarter, really remained in line with what we've seen in previous quarters, that there is tough competition out there, but I think we've been doing a good job of remaining fairly disciplined as far as that price, that the yields will change over time as it reflects the improving underlying credit quality of the originations compared to the existing portfolio. Commercial Real Estate really did not have a lot of originations in the current quarter, and so I wouldn't want to comment on any changes there as far as pricing because there really wasn't sufficient volume to make that differentiation. On the Indirect Auto side, we continue to target our 2% type of credit-adjusted spread. We're maintaining that. We did see volumes come down just ever so slightly from second quarter to third quarter and that probably reflected a little bit more aggressive pricing from some of the competitors, but we want to make sure that we maintain that discipline there and you may see ongoing changes as far as volumes, based on that. And then on the consumer portfolios, we did see some price increases that we initiated on some of the consumer loan portfolios in anticipation of the new capital standards. And so we started to price some of those portfolios a little bit higher to reflect that. On the securities portfolio, in aggregate, if you add both the Held-to-Maturity and available for sale, the balance really stayed relatively stable from quarter-to-quarter. The challenge we're seeing now, though, that you probably heard from others, is with the effect of QE3, the primary asset class we put in that investment portfolios, are agency CMOs, and so that yield has come down. And so what we're seeing for the reinvestment of cash flows that are sourced from that, which tend to run about $140 million a month, are probably about 30 basis points lower today than where they were last quarter, and so we're seeing yields there in the $150 million to $170 million range as far as new purchases.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay, got it. And then my second question, I just want to ask you about mortgage banking because I know in kind your outlook, you're talking about it being a little bit lower, but you seem to have really still strong strength this quarter and that was even with the -- an MSR-net write-down. So I wanted to just ask you about your pipeline for mortgage banking, how you feel about the kind of production fees, and then if you could also just make a comment on what, if anything, you're changing with related to MSR hedging, and how that flows through the income statement?","Donald R. Kimble","Great. As far as the mortgage volume, we would agree that we think the fourth quarter is still going to be strong as far as origination volume for us in mortgage lending, that application flows are still very strong for us. So our outlook comment is more referencing over the longer-term horizon that we do think that will come down from the current levels. We expect to continue to see strong spreads from those secondary marketing gains on sale of those loans as well. As far as the MSR assets, we really have 2 components of our MSR, and the hedging strategy is different for each. For our fair value portion of our hedge, which is -- now represents about 1\/3 of the total MSR asset, we try to hedge that so we can protect volatility against the overall impact from changes in interest rates. For the low-comp portion of the portfolio, we don't do a 100% hedge and what we do there is try to evaluate what the impact is to the total mortgage banking income line item as opposed to just the MSR asset. And so we're looking at that as far as the rate impact on current origination volumes and pricing to see if that's an organic hedge against a portion of it, so you might see continued volatility in that plus or minus $4 million range on a quarter-to-quarter basis based on that overall position.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then Don, just the last thing. As we hear the outlook, it seems like some of the outlook is very consistent with near term and then some of the outlook is more about the longer term, right? And I guess maybe can you just spend a second and kind of just discern the 2?","Donald R. Kimble","Yes, we tend not to give a specific guidance on the next quarter, but I would say the majority of the observations or expectations are for the medium-term horizon, the next couple -- the 3 quarters or so. And so our guidance on loan growth, on margin, on fee income, tend to be more of that over the medium term as opposed to the immediate quarter.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Scinicariello from UBS.","Stephen Scinicariello - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just with regard to the expenses, we know that the in-store strategy poses a bit of a headwind over the medium term here. But just curious if you could talk about some of the potential sources of operating leverage that you see both over the medium term and longer term as well.","Donald R. Kimble","As far as additional efficiencies, we continue to look at a number of areas, including both frontline and back-office type efficiencies. And so we put in a number of changes that will help drive better efficiency in some of our branches and how we are providing service and how we process transactions from that perspective. We've done a number of things on the back-office side to consolidate and streamline and provide more efficiencies throughout the servicing side of it. This last year, we've really adopted more of a continuous improvement type of value throughout the entire company, and encouraging our colleagues to identify other opportunities for us to provide more efficient and effective service to both our internal customers, as well as our external customers. And so each one of those, while they may not be large initiatives and you probably won't see an announcement of a significant adjustment of staffing levels or one-time charges, but we do believe that each of them will be incremental and additive to help result in additional efficiencies that can help fund some of the investments we're making in in-store and other initiatives.","Stephen Scinicariello - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Great, that's very helpful. And then just the last question I had for you was, just as you look at that Michigan marketplace, some of the competitive dynamics may be in the process of changing, given the acquisition in that marketplace, just kind of wondering if you're seeing that as a potential opportunity or as a possible threat?","Stephen D. Steinour","Well, Michigan has been a terrific market for us to operate in and we've been in it for decades now. We have significantly expanded the team in -- the teams, I should say, in Michigan. The Meijer announcement earlier this year reflects confidence, based on performance over the last few years, of our ability to grow in Michigan. And we certainly expect to continue to grow. Our deposit share went up a notch this year, I think, 8 to 7, and so we're going to continue to invest in Michigan and expect it to grow, and I haven't given thought to competitive dynamic change. There's a -- we like where we're positioned. We believe we can compete, win and grow, and we expect to continue to do that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joshua Sherwin from [indiscernible].","Joshua M. Sherwin - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","This is Josh, actually from Jack Micenko's team. Just a quick question on the deposit composition. I saw that your MMDAs ticked up significantly in the quarter. Is there anything in particular driving that?","Donald R. Kimble","We did see some increases there, especially on the commercial side, that as part of our treasury management services, for our commercial customers, we've been able to identify some customers that we've been able to attract their money market deposits. We've also had some concerted efforts as far as retention on the consumer side related to the money market balances as well, and that provided a change in the trend compared to previous quarters.","Operator","There are no further questions. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation today. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."],"11536":["Huntington Bancshares Incorporated (NASDAQ:HBAN) Q2 2019 Earnings Conference Call July 25, 2019  9:00 AM ET","Company Participants","Mark Muth - Director, IR","Mac McCullough - CFO","Rich Pohle - Chief Credit Officer","Conference Call Participants","Scott Siefers - Sandler O'Neill","Jon Arfstrom - RBC Capital Markets","Brian Foran - Autonomous Research","John Pancari - Evercore","Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley","Peter Winter - Wedbush Securities","Steven Alexopoulos - JPMorgan","Kevin St. Pierre - KSP Research","Ken Usdin - Jefferies","Brock Vandervliet - UBS","Operator","Greetings and welcome to the Huntington Bancshares second quarter earnings call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mark Muth, Director of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.","Mark Muth","Thank you, Sherri. Welcome. I'm Mark Muth, Director of Investor Relations for Huntington. Copies of the slides we'll be reviewing can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website, www.huntington.com. This call is being recorded and will be available as a rebroadcast starting about 1 hour from the close of the call. Our presenters today are Mac McCullough, Chief Financial Officer; and Rich Pohle, Chief Credit Officer. Unfortunately, Huntington's Chairman, President and CEO, Steve Steinour, is unable to join us today.","Earlier this week, while training for the upcoming Pelotonia charity bike ride, Steve injured his shoulder, requiring surgery, and that has prevented his participation in our second quarter earnings call today. He's already on the mend and expected to return to work in the coming days.","As noted on slide two, today's discussion, including the Q&A period, will contain forward-looking statements. Such statements are based on information and assumptions available at this time and are subject to changes, risks and uncertainties, which may cause actual results to differ materially. We assume no obligation to update such statements. For a complete discussion of risks and uncertainties, please refer to this slide and materials filed with the SEC, including our most recent Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filings. Let me now turn it over to Mac.","Mac McCullough","Thanks, Mark, and thank you to everyone for joining the call today. As always, we appreciate your interest and support. We had a solid second quarter, reporting net income of $364 million, an increase of 3% from the year ago quarter. Earnings per common share were up $0.33, up 10% from the year ago quarter. Tangible book value per share ended the quarter at $7.97, also a 10% year-over-year increase. Our profitability ratios remain strong as our return on tangible common equity was 18%, and our return on assets was 1.36%. Total revenue increased 6% year-over-year.","Average loans increased 4% year-over-year, including a 5% increase in consumer loans and a 4% increase in commercial loans. Average core deposits increased 4% year-over-year as we continue to fully fund loan growth with core deposits. Overall asset quality remained strong as most credit ratios remained near cyclical lows.","As we guided to on the first quarter earnings conference call, net charge-offs declined this quarter back to a level below the low end of our average through-the-cycle target range of 35 to 55 basis points. As we have noted previously, we expect some quarter-to-quarter volatility given the very low loss and problem loan levels at which we are operating. Our ratios for nonperforming assets, delinquencies and criticized loans all remain very good.","As briefly outlined on slide three, we developed Huntington strategies with a vision of creating a high-performing regional bank and delivering top quartile through-the-cycle shareholder returns. We continue to make profitable and meaningful long-term investments in our business, particularly around customer experience, to drive organic growth. This quarter, we were pleased to receive an important independent confirmation of our digital technology investments and our customer experience focused strategy with two awards from J.D. Power, the gold standard of customer satisfaction surveys in the U.S. Huntington received the highest scores in both the J.D.","Power 2019 U.S. online banking and mobile app satisfaction studies. While some expressed skepticism that regional banks will be able to keep up with the large money center banks and a technology-driven economy, we believe this provides evidence that our focused technology investments and our strategy provide Huntington not just the opportunity to keep up but to remain industry-leading in our client acquisition and our customer satisfaction. We also prudently allocate our capital to ensure we are earning adequate returns and taking appropriate risk, consistent with our aggregate moderate-to-low risk appetite.","This quarter, we took several actions to better position the balance sheet from an interest rate management perspective but also with respect to overall risk and return. We exited certain loans and high-cost deposit relationships which no longer met our return hurdles, and we repositioned a portion of the securities portfolio.","I will discuss these actions in more detail in a few minutes. We are very pleased with how we are positioned. We have built sustainable competitive advantages in our key businesses that we believe are delivering and will continue to deliver top quartile financial performance in the future. We remain focused on driving sustained, long-term financial performance for our shareholders.","Slide four illustrates our updated expectations for full year 2019 compared to our prior expectations. As you know, we previously provided our expectations assuming no change in short-term interest rates. However, this quarter, we are transitioning to provide our expectations based on the implied forward curve, which are provided in the column on the right side.","Given the high likelihood that the Fed will reduce the Fed funds target rate at their meeting next week and the market expectations for multiple additional rate cuts over the coming year, we thought it was more conservative to adopt this interest rate outlook in our planning and forecasting process internally as well as externally in the expectations we communicate to you. We also have provided an unchanged rate view in the middle column on the slide.","This quarter, we provided both interest rate scenarios so you can see the incremental steps between the two but do not plan to provide both views going forward. For the remainder of 2019, we intend to only provide expectations based on the implied forward rate scenario. Our view of the economy has not changed since last quarter's earnings call. We continue to have a constructive view of the local economies in our footprint, which we expect will translate into continued organic growth this year.","While the volatility in the debt markets has signaled street concerns regarding the broader economy, what we are hearing from our customers remains positive. Businesses in our local markets generally continue to deliver good performance, and our commercial pipelines remain strong.","Businesses in our footprint are investing in capital expenditures and expansions while the tight labor markets continue to constrain economic growth. Our commercial customers continue to tell us that finding employees is their biggest challenge. The job openings rate for the Midwest is the highest in the nation. Some of these businesses also have weathered the headwinds of ongoing tariff and trade disputes. Despite a slowing world economy and these headwinds, the data shows that exports have continued to grow in Ohio and other areas of our region. Across our footprint, consumers also remain upbeat with strong labor markets driving wage inflation, particularly at the lower compensation levels.","In the 3 months ending May of 2019 and the 12 months ending May of 2019, unemployment rates declined in 18 of 20 of the largest MSAs in Huntington's footprint states. Additionally, consumer confidence in our regions generally stayed at the highest levels since 2000. Job openings continue to exceed unemployment levels in most of our markets. I would summarize by saying that we remain bullish in the economy and our footprint.","As I have stated on several occasions this year, we do not see signs of a near-term economic downturn. Nonetheless, we are cognizant of the recent market volatility and global economic data that does not share the optimism of what we are seeing here in the Midwest. These ultimately could drive the Fed to adjust short-term interest rates lower.","As we communicated on the last earnings call, we have taken steps to prepare for a more challenging interest rate outlook. We do not foresee a recession in the near term. However, our core earnings power, strong capital, aggregate moderate-to-low risk appetite and our long-term strategic alignment position us to withstand economic headwinds. Our strategy is designed to drive more consistent performance across economic cycles. Let's turn to our revised full year 2019 expectations. We have modestly reduced our balance sheet growth expectations reflecting the balance sheet optimization efforts from the second quarter and a more competitive operating environment at the margin.","We expect full year average loan growth in the range of 4% to 5% and full year average deposit growth in the range of 2% to 3%. We remain particularly focused on growing core deposits through acquiring core checking accounts and deepening customer relationships. We expect full year revenue growth of 3% to 4.5%. On a GAAP basis, full year 2018 NIM -- sorry, 2019 NIM is expected to be 3.25% to 3.30% range.","This includes the negative impacts from the anticipated reduction in the benefit of purchase accounting and the cost of the incremental hedging strategy we implemented in the second quarter. Looking further out, our current modeling suggests that NIM will bottom out during the second half of 2019. As a result, we currently expect full year 2020 NIM should relatively consistent with full year 2019, allowing net interest income to grow in tandem with earning asset growth next year.","As we have told you previously and are demonstrating with our actions, we remain committed to delivering positive operating leverage this year. We have moderated the expense growth outlook for 2019 in conjunction with the reduced revenue growth outlook. We have achieved this with a combination of reductions to discretionary spending and with the repacing of planned investments.","Full year 2019 noninterest expense is now expected to increase 1% to 2.5%. We anticipate that full year 2019 net charge-offs will remain below our average through-the-cycle target range of 35 to 55 basis points. Our expectation for the effective tax rate for the remainder of the year is in the 15.5% to 16.5% range. Slide five provides the highlights for the 2019 second quarter.","Results reflected strong earnings momentum with double-digit growth rates in earnings per common share and tangible book value per share along with continuing improvement in our profitability ratios. We recorded net income of $364 million, an increase of 3% versus the year ago quarter. We reported earnings per common share of $0.33, up 10% year-over-year and tangible book value per common share ended the quarter at $7.97, a 10% year-over-year increase. Return on assets was 1.36%, return on common equity, 14% and return on tangible common equity was 18%. Our efficiency ratio for the quarter was 57.6%, up from 56.6% in the year ago quarter.","And again, we reminded you in the first quarter call that the second quarter would be the peak efficiency ratio for the year. This modest increase reflects continued thoughtful investments in our colleagues and technology. For the full year, we continue to expect modest year-over-year improvement in our efficiency ratio consistent with driving annual positive operating leverage. Turning now to slide six. Average earning assets increased to $2.8 billion or 3% compared to the year ago quarter. Loan growth accounted for more than the entire increase as average loans and leases increased $3 billion or 4% year-over-year including a $1.7 billion or 5% increase in consumer loans and a $1.3 billion or 4% increase in commercial loans.","Average commercial and industrial loans grew 6% from the year ago quarter and reflected the largest component of our year-over-year loan growth. C&I loan growth has been well diversified over the past year with notable growth in corporate banking, asset finance, dealer floor plan and middle market banking. We also continue to see good early traction in our new specialty lending verticals that were announced as part of the 2018 strategic plan. Alternatively, we continue to actively manage our commercial real estate portfolio around current levels with average CRE loans reflecting a 6% year-over-year decline.","This reflects both anticipated and unanticipated pay downs as well as our strategic tightening of commercial real estate lending to ensure appropriate returns on capital and to manage risk. During the second quarter, we exited approximately $400 million of our commercial loans at renewal or through loan sales as part of our balance sheet optimization efforts.","These loans no longer met our return hurdles and their exit allowed us to redeploy the associated funding into more attractive opportunities. Consumer loan growth remained centered in the residential mortgage and RV and marine portfolios, reflecting the well-managed expansion of these 2 businesses since the FirstMerit parent acquisition. Average residential mortgage loans increased 14% year-over-year.","As we typically do, we sold agency-qualified mortgage production in the quarter and generally retained jumbo mortgages and specialty mortgage products. Average RV and marine loans increased 28% year-over-year as we continue to gain traction and market share across the 34-state footprint for this business. Average auto loans were flat year-over-year. Originations totaled $1.3 billion for the second quarter, down 19% year-over-year. As we have previously mentioned, we are executing a pricing strategy to optimize revenue via increased auto loan pricing that has resulted in lower production volumes, but that is a trade-off we like.","New money yields on our auto originations averaged 4.63% during the second quarter, up 41 basis points from the year ago quarter. Over the past few weeks, new money yields in both auto and RV\/marine have come under some pressure due to the year-to-date movements in the 2- the 5-year portion of the yield curve and increased competition. Finally, securities were down 4% year-over-year as we let the portfolio run off and utilized the cash flow to fund higher-yielding loans during 2019.","During the 2019 second quarter, we sold 1 billion of securities as part of the balance sheet optimization efforts to reduce our reliance on short-term wholesale funding, repurchased $600 million of securities related to the hedging program, and late in the quarter, we remixed approximately $500 million of securities at a net benefit of approximately 20 basis points.","Turning to slide seven. Average total deposits grew 3% year-over-year while average core deposits grew 4% year-over-year. Average money market deposits increased 11% year-over-year reflecting the shift in promotional pricing away from CDs to consumer money market accounts in mid-2018. Core certificates of deposit were up 54% from the year ago quarter primarily reflecting the consumer CD growth initiatives during the first 3 quarters of 2018. Average interest-bearing DDA deposits increased 3% year-over-year while average noninterest-bearing DDA deposits decreased 3%. Average total demand deposits were flat year-over-year.","As shown on slide 32 in the appendix, we are very pleased that our consumer noninterest-bearing deposits increased 5% year-over-year as we continue to grow households and deepen relationships. We continue to see our commercial customers shift balances from noninterest-bearing DDA to interest-bearing products, primarily interest checking, hybrid checking and money market.","Average savings and other domestic deposits decreased 9% primarily reflecting a continued shift in consumer product mix, particularly among legacy FirstMerit accounts as FirstMerit's promotional pricing strategy is focused on savings accounts compared to our primary focus on money market accounts. Importantly, our continued focus on core funding allowed for a 23% year-over-year reduction in noncore deposits.","Moving down to slide eight. FTE net interest income increased $28 million or 4% versus the year ago quarter primarily driven by the 3% increase in average earning assets. We saw net interest margin expansion of 2 basis points to 3.31% compared to the 2018 second quarter as a result of disciplined asset and deposit pricing and the benefit of interest rate increases partially offset by the continued runoff of purchase accounting accretion. Moving to slide nine. Our core net interest margin for the second quarter was 3.26%, up 4 basis points from the year ago quarter. Purchase accounting accretion contributed 5 basis points to the net interest margin in the current quarter compared to 8 basis points in the year ago quarter.","Slide 28 in the appendix provides information regarding the actual and scheduled impact of the FirstMerit purchase accounting accretion for 2019 and 2020. Turning to the earning asset yields. Our commercial loan yields increased 30 basis points year-over-year while consumer loan yields increased 33 basis points. Securities yields increased eight basis points. Our deposit costs remained well contained with the rate paid on total interest-bearing deposits of 97 basis points for the quarter, up 38 basis points year-over-year and up just three basis points sequentially. I might add that we expect total interest-bearing deposit costs to decline in both the third and the fourth quarters of 2019.","Turning to slide 10. On a sequential basis, the GAAP NIM compressed 8 basis points and the core NIM compressed 7 basis points. The lower and inverted yield curve included the impact on LIBOR rates, accounted for approximately 3 basis points of the NIM compression, while the continued lift in deposit cost drove 2 basis points. The incremental hedging strategy implemented in the second quarter compressed the NIM by 1 basis point and is also expected to have a negative 1 basis point impact on the full year 2019 NIM, modestly better than the guidance we provided at an industry conference in May.","Turning to slide 11. Slide 11 provides an update to a slide we presented at an industry conference during the second quarter that summarizes the incremental hedging strategy to reduce the downside risk from lower interest rates. The incremental hedges include both asset swaps and floors. We have now substantially completed implementation of the incremental hedges. However, as you should expect, we will continue to fine-tune the overall hedging program as the interest rate environment, balance sheet mix and other factors necessitate. It's also important to remember that we've had the cost of the hedging program, including the incremental hedging executed in the second quarter, in our guidance since late 2018.","Turning to slide 12. Slide 12 illustrates our cycle-to-date interest-bearing deposit beta compared to peers. Our cumulative deposit beta remains low at 33%. We have been communicating that we believe the consumer core CD strategies we utilized over the first three quarters of 2018 would serve us well over time, effectively front-loading some of the deposit beta. You can see those benefits over the past 3 quarters as our cumulative data has not increased as quickly as peers and is now below the peer average. This quarter, the peer group's average cumulative beta increased 4% while we saw a 1% increase in our cumulative beta.","Overall, commercial deposit competition was elevated throughout the second quarter, and competition for consumer deposits to date has not yet retrenched as much as expected despite the likely Fed rate cuts next week. Given this competitive environment and the near-term rate outlook, we've maintained our pricing discipline and shortened our promotional pricing terms such as utilizing a 6-month money market promotional rate compared to a 12-month promotion common in the marketplace. We also chose to fund loan growth through the securities sales that I mentioned earlier rather than paying up for high-cost commercial deposits.","Looking forward, we have developed strategies down to the customer level to quickly react, particularly along our highest-cost deposits should the Fed cut rates next year -- next week as expected. We have also approximately $3 billion of securities in excess of what is needed for LCR that we could use as a funding source should market deposit pricing become unattractive. Slide 13 provides detail on our noninterest income, which increased 11% from the year ago quarter. Other noninterest income increased 48% year-over-year primarily due to the $15 million gain on the sale of our Wisconsin retail branches as well as the $5 million mark-to-market adjustment on economic hedges.","Subsequent to quarter end, we redesignated all the economic hedges as cash flow hedges. So beginning in 3Q of '19, all the swaps and floors will be accounted for as cash flow hedges. Capital market fees were up 31% versus the year ago quarter primarily reflecting the acquisition of Hutchinson, Shockey and Erley in the 2018 fourth quarter. Mortgage banking income increased 21% primarily reflecting higher secondary market spreads. On a linked quarter basis, mortgage banking income also benefited from seasonality and, to a lesser extent, lower mortgage interest rates during the quarter.","Slide 14 provides the components of the 7% year-over-year growth in noninterest expense. As we mentioned on the last earnings call, we expected noninterest expense to increase $40 million to $50 million linked quarter, with 2\/3 of that coming from normal seasonality and compensation expense as a result of the annual grant of our long-term incentive compensation in May as well as the May implementation of annual merit increases. Personnel expense increased 8% year-over-year primarily reflecting these actions. Further increasing personnel expense year-over-year was the continued hiring of experienced bankers in our new lending verticals as well as adding colleagues in our digital and technology areas related to the 2018 strategic plan initiatives.","Outside data processing and other services increased 29% year-over-year driven by ongoing technology investment costs. Other noninterest expense increased 24% primarily reflecting a $5 million donation to the Columbus Foundation and the impact of new lease accounting standards on personal property tax expense. Partially offsetting these increases, deposit and other insurance expense decreased 56% due to the discontinuation of the FDI surcharge in the 2018 fourth quarter. Slide 15 illustrates the continued strength of our capital ratios. The tangible common equity ratio ended the quarter at 7.80%, up 2 basis points from the year ago quarter.","The common equity Tier 1 ratio ended the quarter at 9.88%, down 65% year-over-year but up 4 basis points linked quarter. We continue to manage CET1 within our 9% to 10% operating guideline with a bias towards the operating end of the range. We repurchased 71.8 million common shares over the last 4 quarters. During the 2019 second quarter, we repurchased 11.3 million common shares at an average cost of $13.40 per share, representing the remaining $152 million of common stock repurchase authorization in the 2018 capital plan.","As we announced last month, our 2019 capital plan reflects our previously articulated priorities to fund organic growth first; to support the cash dividend second; and third, to pursue all other capital uses including buybacks. These capital priorities have not changed. The 2019 capital plan includes a 7% increase in the quarterly dividend rate to $0.15 per share beginning with the dividend that the Board declared last week and payable in October. Last week, the Board also approved a new authorization for the repurchase of up to 513 million of common shares over the next 4 quarters.","Let me now turn it over to Rich to cover slide 16 with the credit trends for the quarter. Rich?","Rich Pohle","Thanks, Mac. Slide 16 provides a snapshot of key quality metrics for the quarter, which remain strong. Consistent prudent credit underwriting is one of Huntington's core principles, and our financial results continue to reflect our disciplined approach to risk management and our aggregate moderate-to-low risk appetite. We booked loan loss provision expense of $58 million in the second quarter and net charge-offs of $48 million. Our provision expense has not exceeded net charge-offs in 6 of the past 7 quarters, illustrating our high-quality earnings.","Net charge-offs represented an annualized 25 basis points of average loans and leases in the current quarter, up from 16 basis points in the year ago quarter and, as expected, down from 38 basis points in the prior quarter. There is additional granularity on charge-offs by portfolio in the analyst package on the slides, and there was no industry concentration to speak of. The allowance for loan and lease losses, or ALLL, as a percentage of loans remained relatively stable at 1.03%, up 1 basis point linked quarter.","The nonperforming asset ratio remained flat linked quarter and increased 4 basis points year-over-year to 61 basis points. The year-over-year increases was centered in the C&I portfolio partially offset by decreases in the commercial real estate, residential mortgage and home equity portfolios. There was also a year-over-year increase in other NPAs associated with the investment portfolio. Overall, asset quality metrics remain near cyclical bests. And as we have noted previously, some quarterly volatility is expected given the absolute low level of problem loans.","I'll now turn it back to Mac for some closing remarks.","Mac McCullough","Thanks, Rich. Slide 17 highlights the actions we have taken since 2009 resulting in our current industry-leading profitability metrics. Our 14% return on common equity and 18% return on tangible common equity positions Huntington as a top-performing regional bank. We are building a best-in-class return profile at Huntington, and we are excited about the opportunities that this creates.","Let me turn it back over to Mark so we can get to your questions.","Mark Muth","Thanks, Mac. Sherri. We will now take questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Scott Siefers with Sandler O'Neill. Please proceed.","Scott Siefers","Hey, good morning guys. Thanks for taking the question. Mac, I just wanted to ask a little about the margin guidance. So I guess first of all, just appreciate the commentary with both the just the flat rate and the implied forward curve. That's helpful, so thank you for that.","But then just as you look at the anticipated contraction in the margin for the second half of the year, just given that it implies some severe contraction in the back half, I wonder if you could just walk through what the main nuances would be that would allow you to come in toward the higher end versus the lower end. In other words, how do we get to the median part of the range?","Mac McCullough","Yes, Scott. I think the wild card of the mix is going to be what happens with core deposit growth and the cost of core deposits. Right now, we're very pleased with the growth that we're seeing. We're being selective in terms of the commercial deposits and paying up for commercial deposits, but we're seeing good growth on the consumer side. And I would tell you that competition in our region is rational. As I mentioned in the script, we have taken our deposit strategy and tactics to a different place relative to the peers.","We've become, I think, less aggressive in terms of incremental pricing as we enter this lower-rate environment, but we're comfortable with that just given some of the strength we see on the consumer deposit side but also the excess liquidity that we have in terms of being able to release securities and use that funding to basically put higher-margin loans on the balance sheet. So it's really the cost of deposits and the deposits got a growth in the second half, but I'm confident that we're well positioned for that.","Scott Siefers","Okay. Perfect. And then just separately, so expenses will have to come down fairly meaningfully in the second half of the year. I know there was a lot of seasonality that hit the second quarter numbers. So presumably, there's some relief in sight. But just wondering if you could talk for a second about kind of the puts and takes on the cost side as we enter the second half of the year, please.","Mac McCullough","Yes. Sure. So we've been, I think, pretty transparent around the opportunities that we have to adjust our expense growth in 2019 for the revenue environments and what we see happening with interest rates going forward. We've started to take those actions. A lot of the expense growth in 2019 has come out of strategic initiatives that we put in place in 2018 through the strategic planning process. We've deferred some of those investments.","However, we are continuing to make investments and the initiatives that we think are most beneficial from our revenue growth or risk perspective or just thinking about what we need to do from technology development, particularly in digital.","Those investments are still on the table. So we've been, I think, appropriately prudent in terms of the investments that we're continuing with, and there's always the likelihood that the rate environment turns out better than what is being foreshadowed right now that we would put more of those investments back on the table. So we believe we've got the capability to manage the positive operating leverage in 2019. And certainly for 2020, it's going to depend on where the revenue environment goes, but we still have expense levers that we can pull.","Scott Siefers","Okay that's perfect. Thank you very much Mac, I appreciate it.","Operator","Our next question is from Jon Arfstrom with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.","Jon Arfstrom","Thanks, good morning guys.","Mac McCullough","Good morning Jon.","Jon Arfstrom","The question a little bit about commercial lending. You talked about the exit of 400 million commercial balances. I don't know if it's for you, Rich, but curious, can we expect more of that? And can you maybe talk about some of the primary reasons behind some of those decisions?","Rich Pohle","Yes. Jon, it's Rich. I think a lot of the decision on the 400 million was just around rate and yield. And as we looked to optimize the balance sheet, I think we focused on low-yielding assets that may not have been part of the primary bank relationship that really just didn't make sense to continue moving forward on. So I would say that we're going to continue to look at customer profitability going forward.","And to the extent that we have borrowers that don't meet our relationships, we'll look to make adjustments, either try to strengthen that relationship and make it more profitable or look to exit. So I think Q2 had a fair number exits in there, and I would say it's just a continuing process going forward as we focus on the balance sheet and where we can be most profitable.","Mac McCullough","Yes. Jon, it's Mac. So I might add, this is the play that we ran in 2017 with great success. We -- I think when we did this in 2017, we picked up about 41 basis points of CET1. So we do this on a regular basis. We're always looking at the balance sheet at a very granular level. And in this environment, we just think it's a prudent thing to do to make sure that our capital is working hard and that we're putting ourselves in the position to fund the balance sheet and get the right returns in this environment.","Jon Arfstrom","Okay. It make sense. And I guess that goes to my next follow-up here is just the loan growth numbers. You took in the -- it's very subtle and modest, but you took in a higher range of loan growth range and also deposits, and can you just maybe talk a little bit about that, the purpose of that?","Mac McCullough","Yes. So part of it is the -- what we continue to do from an auto perspective. We continue to price for profitability as opposed to the volume, so that continues to be the play that we're running. And I think we just became on the margin a bit more conservative in terms of what we would expect from growth on the loan side in 2019, not because the pipelines are in worse shape because they're actually in really good shape, but I think the mood here is just one of caution and just making sure that we're careful and we put on the balance sheet what we feel comfortable with.","But from a deposit perspective, it has everything to do with the tactics that we're taking in the marketplace where we're leading the market down from a CD perspective -- CD pricing perspective and also the tactics that we're using to raise money market deposits. We're using a 6-month guaranteed term on rate, and the market is still at a 12-month. So we do expect that this will have some incremental impact on deposit growth, but we're fine with that. As I mentioned, we've got the excess liquidity that we can always fall back on.","And I guess the other part of that is just commercial deposit pricing and not wanting to pay up for deposits in this environment. We certainly take a look at the relationships, as Rich mentioned. And to the extent it's a deep relationship or a potential for a deep relationship, we certainly work with the client. But I have no interest in $100 million with no other relationship and paying up for that deposit at this point in time. So the growth rates reflect those tactics and strategies.","Jon Arfstrom","Okay, all right, thanks guys.","Operator","Our next question is from Brian Foran with Autonomous Research. Please proceed.","Brian Foran","Hey, good morning. I wish I had $100 million deposit, to give you.","Mac McCullough","The largely you brought other products along with that we'd be fine.","Brian Foran","The, so on the NIM, you kind of talked about the bottoming in the second half of '19 and I think you said stable in 2020. And I just wanted to clarify are you talking the stable relative to the 3.25% to 3.30% full year range? Or are you thinking more stable to whatever the fourth quarter exit run rate NIM is?","Mac McCullough","Yes. Brian, that's a great question. This was full year 2019 NIM of 3.25% to 3.30%. We expect it to be stable in 2020 in that range.","Brian Foran","And I mean I guess that seems to imply a little bit of a bounce back up in 2020. Is it deposit pricing catch-up? Or what would kind of make the 2020 NIM maybe slightly higher than the fourth quarter exit for the year?","Mac McCullough","Yes. As you might expect, deposit pricing is going to have a bit of a lag to it. So we actually see the largest benefit from -- well, we expect from a deposit pricing perspective in the fourth quarter of 2019, and that will continue into 2020 along with the impacts of the hedge program. Assuming we get the implied forward curve the way it is currently forecast, the hedge program will kick in and give us some incremental margin to help offset what's happened in the rate environment.","Mark Muth","Brian, this is Mark. Remember, the CD campaign last year and the first 3 quarters, those all mature beginning in the third quarter. So as those roll off, we're assuming they'll reprice down nicely.","Brian Foran","And if I could sneak in one less clarification or expansion, I think you mentioned July auto pricing competition might have picked up a little bit. Can you just maybe give a little bit more color on what you saw there?","Mac McCullough","Yes. We've been pretty consistent in terms of raising pricing in the marketplace. It's been a good play for us. We typically see the competition follow. But in this environment, as we had some of the higher rates out, we felt that maybe we weren't getting the right type of customer, maybe a slight deterioration in some of the credit metrics. And so we quickly changed the pricing strategy, and everything fell back into place the way we would expect to see it. But that is the barometer that we use.","I mean we have a box for credit on the auto book that we don't move outside of. And we change pricing based upon what we see happening, and that, of course, takes into consideration many factors, what's happening in the marketplace, what's happening with competition, what's happening with interest rates, but the one variable that we hold constant when thinking about pricing in the auto book is where we're at from a credit perspective.","Mark Muth","And on the boat and RV side, we've seen a couple of new entrants into the market and one legacy participant expand nationally, and the combination of those 3 has significantly increased pricing competition for boat and RV loans here over the last few months.","Operator","Our next question is from John Pancari with Evercore. Please proceed.","John Pancari","Morning, regarding your 2019 to 2021 longer-term goals -- or medium-term goals, should we call it, I noticed you didn't include them in the -- in your slides or mention them. So I just wanted to see if you have any updated thoughts on those targets, particularly around the efficiency guidance of 53% to 56% and also in the ROTCE outlook for 17% to 20%.","Mac McCullough","Yes. No, we're still comfortable with those long-term targets. Didn't mean to signal anything by not including them in the slide deck or the presentation. So those are our targets for the next 3 to 5 years.","John Pancari","Okay. Great. And then separately on the 2019 revenue outlook of 3% to 4.5%, can you give us a little bit more detail how that would break out between spread revenue and fees? And then also, has your fee income outlook changed at all? And if so, what is changing that view?","Mac McCullough","Yes. So we're having a really good year on the fee side. Capital markets continues to perform very well. We're making smart investments in that business. We've got a terrific team and a really good opportunity across the franchise, in particular when you think about the FirstMerit legacy customers and some of the capabilities that we bring to that customer base. We still have opportunities as it relates to capital markets products and being able to have deeper relationships with those customers. We got a good product set, and we feel very good about the outlook for that business. It's going to continuing to grow, assuming the economy cooperates.","Treasury management is another place for us that we feel very good with the momentum and what we're seeing in the field. In particular, we're seeing some new product capabilities in the business banking space that is actually producing some incremental growth that we expected and excited to see developing. So that's a category that works for us as well. And then mortgage, we do expect that we're going to have continued good results in 2019. We're going to continue to see good refinance opportunities, and the secondary marketing spread has actually improved as well so that helps.","And then we continue to grow households. I mean we're continuing to grow consumer households. We're continuing to see deposit service charges increase in conjunction with that household growth, and we're getting good deposit growth out of that expansion in households as well. So the growth in 2019 is going to be weighted more on a percentage basis to fee income, which is partially some of the strength in the categories that I mentioned but also the rate environment and what's happening to the -- for the NIM. But very excited about the momentum we have on the fee side.","John Pancari","Okay. So that 3% to 4.5% revenue outlook for '19, that did come down, but that was mainly all spread income then, correct?","Mac McCullough","That would be correct, yes.","John Pancari","Got it. All right, thanks, Mac.","Operator","Our next question is from Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.","Ken Zerbe","Thank you. Hi, guys I guess my first question is in terms of the hedging that you did this quarter, accelerating your hedging. We've heard from some other banks this quarter that they did not do hedging or that they thought because the curve was pricing in a significant decline in rates, the hedging was not the right decision for them. Can you just talk about why accelerating your hedging was the right decision for Huntington and maybe differ from other banks? And what are you assuming in terms of the rate outlook from here that makes it the right choice?","Mac McCullough","So our implied outlook has the Fed decreasing in July and September of this year and May and October of 2020. So basically, we began the hedge program, I think, at a time when we felt the economics of putting the hedge on made sense relative to the outlook we had for the environment and what was going to happen to interest rates going forward. There certainly came a time when I would say that the benefit was fully reflected in the price of those hedges and we pulled back, but we felt that we got the program in place to the extent that it stabilized the margin going forward, which is what we were trying to accomplish.","So clearly, different of every bank in terms of where you're at from an asset liability position and the mix of your balance sheet and what you expect from growth going forward, but we feel that we kind of hit it right in terms of what we did and the impact that it's going to have on the margin going forward.","Ken Zerbe","Okay. Great. And then just as a follow-up, maybe just a clarification for us, I think you mentioned all your swaps and floors next quarter are going to be considered cash flow hedges. Can you just remind us what that means and why it's better than something else?","Mac McCullough","So the economic hedges that we have running through fee income at this point as they get mark-to-market, we did not set those up to qualify for hedge accounting. So basically, we would match them up with, say, a commercial loan portfolio, and through that, we would get hedge accounting that would allow us to reflect the benefit or the detriment of those derivatives through the margin.","The economic hedges that we moved up into the category to get hedge accounting, they did flow through the fee income in the second quarter and I think a little bit in the first quarter as well. But basically, I'd rather have the impact in the margin. And we have the capacity to basically reflect those as qualifying for hedge accounting, and we did that actually early in the third quarter.","Mark Muth","Yes. Ken, so that $5 million mark-to-market that hit fee income this quarter, going forward, that would run through OCI instead of through the P&L.","Operator","Our next question is from Peter Winter with Wedbush Securities. Please proceed.","Peter Winter","I was looking at the loan-to-deposit ratio and it's been creeping up a little bit, and I'm just wondering is there a certain level that you wouldn't want to see it go above.","Mac McCullough","Yes. Peter, we don't want that to go above 100%. That's the view that we have on that. It has been creeping up a bit. We've continued to see good asset growth. And as I've mentioned, we've been a bit more conservative in terms of pricing deposits, particularly on the commercial side. So we manage that very carefully. We obviously have levers that we can pull to manage that ratio, but that would be the limit that we would have in mind.","Peter Winter","Okay. And then just on the borrowing side, I guess, the $12 billion in borrowings, I was just curious, how much is floating versus fixed rate? I just want to get an idea how much could come down in cost if -- when the Fed starts cutting rates.","Mac McCullough","Yes. We typically swap our debt to the floating rates, and I believe we have all the swaps to floating at this point in time.","Peter Winter","Got it. That's great. Thanks, Mac.","Mac McCullough","Okay. Thanks, Peter.","Operator","Our next question is from Steven Alexopoulos with JPMorgan. Please proceed.","Steven Alexopoulos","Given, I wanted to follow up on the NIM questions. So given how meaningful you increased the hedges in the quarter, the NIM kind of feels worse than expected. Even looking at the midpoint of the guidance implies considerable pressure in the back half. Mac, with the hedges in place what do you estimate the impact to NIM from every 25 basis point cut? I mean what's a reasonable range?","Mac McCullough","Yes. So 25 basis point shock would be about a $24 million annual impact, so that would be a 12-month impact after a 25 basis point shock.","Steven Alexopoulos","Okay. That's helpful. We could work that out. Okay. And then in terms of deciding how much downward pressure to place on expense growth, is there a minimum level of positive operating leverage that you're targeting for 2019?","Mac McCullough","Steven, I would say that there's not a minimum level. We're -- our target is to achieve positive operating leverage. We're very cognizant and aware of the environment, and we're very careful in terms of how we think about expense opportunities. We're continuing to invest for growth even in the metrics and the numbers that I've communicated to you today, and we feel that's an important component of being able to really create value going forward as driving the top line. We're long-term shareholders.","The management team and the Board of Huntington would be in the top 10 shareholders of the company without a doubt, probably a little bit higher. So yes, they're -- it probably doesn't have the impact that you might expect to see simply because rates dropped very quickly and expectations changed very quickly. And it would've been obviously much more lucrative to put the positions on earlier, but again, we're comfortable with what we got done and feel good about how the margin is going to perform going forward.","Steven Alexopoulos","Okay. Thanks for taking my questions.","Operator","Our next question is from Kevin St. Pierre with KSP Research. Please proceed.","Kevin St. Pierre","Hi, good morning. how are you doing.","Mac McCullough","Good.","Kevin St. Pierre","So Mac, I wanted to follow up on your comments on the customer experience and the J.D. Power awards, and THAT all sounds great. I just was wondering if you could speak to your overall mobile digital strategy. What you do in-house? What you outsource? And how that fits in with your overall branching strategy.","Mac McCullough","Yes, Kevin. So we've got a real focus on making sure that from a customer experience perspective, we are investing really across many different areas of the bank, but in particular digital technology, to just improve customer experience. So we view investments like this as really driving improved customer experience, customer satisfaction and trust, that's the scorecard.","We don't try to build every capability that some of the larger banks have, but we build the capabilities that we think we need that are going to drive the experience that we want for our customers. So I think that's the way we approach it, and we've allocated more and more expense every year to -- or investment every year to the digital technology and what we need to do there.","So when you think about maybe a proof point for that, we rolled The Hub out, which is our new online banking platform, probably about 8 or 9 months ago. And we believe that there's a direct correlation between the vision that we have for what we wanted to try to accomplish, which was all focused on customer experience and customer satisfaction, and what we delivered with The Hub we feel actually resulted in the J.D. Power awards that we just won.","So again, we don't invest in technology for technology's sake. We invest in technology to make sure that we further our strategy and our differentiation around customer experience, and I think we got a good proof point this quarter with the J.D. Power award.","Kevin St. Pierre","Great. And then do you have any sense how you're doing with millennials versus older customers?","Mac McCullough","We believe that we're making progress there, and I will tell you it is a real focus of ours. Clearly, we have some proof points that we believe the millennials enjoy The Hub in terms of what we deliver, and it is a focus for us. I mean, clearly, when you think about who is more likely to be changing accounts or changing banks, it's likely going to be the younger generation. And we need to have the digital capabilities that will attract them and make them feel like we're the bank for them, and that is exactly what we're trying to accomplish. So I think we continue to make good progress there.","Kevin St. Pierre","Great, thank you.","Mac McCullough","Thanks Kevin.","Operator","Our next question is from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please proceed.","Ken Usdin","Hi, thanks, good morning guys. Mac, on the optimization that you've been doing in the loan and securities portfolio, how much more work do you still have ahead there that you're aiming to accomplish? Or did you get effectively what you wanted to do done in the second quarter? And how do you think about, like, what buckets that would still come from if there's more?","Mac McCullough","Yes. So clearly, we still have opportunity on the securities portfolio if we decided to go down that path. We think we have up to $3 billion of securities that we could take off the sheet to provide incremental funding if we go down that path. What I would tell you on the loan side is that we likely still have opportunity there. We do a lot of the work today on Excel spreadsheets and some other tools that we have to help us understand relationship profitability, but we're implementing a new application later this year that will allow us to do this in real time and actually start to have better information for relationship managers around the depth of their relationship and the profitability of their relationship and their efficiency around capital usage.","So I do expect that we're going to continue to get better at this. I do think we're going to find additional opportunities. Our first preference is always to deepen the relationship and make sure that we get to a level of profitability that reflects the capital that we're allocating to that customer. But we're going to manage this appropriately, and we're going to get the right returns for our shareholders.","Ken Usdin","Okay. And then just one on credit to follow up on that. So you had previously mentioned a need to rebuild the reserve. Credit is remaining very good. You're slowing loan growth in part because of the rationalization and a little bit on the competition, as you mentioned. Do you need to -- does that change the need to build the reserve at all in terms of just what you're putting on versus what you're not and the optimization underneath?","Yes. Well...","Mac McCullough","Yes. Go ahead.","Mark Muth","I mean I think when we look at the reserve and where that is and what we do on a quarterly basis, I mean, there are things that we look at just beyond loan growth. I mean, certainly, that's a part of it. We look at the composition and the mix of the portfolio. There's a number of factors that go into the provision. Certainly, we have an eye towards keeping the provision level at a certain percentage of loans and NPAs and other criticized measurements. So I think we want to continue to look at the reserve quarterly and make sure that it's sufficient for today and going forward.","Ken Usdin","Okay, thanks guys.","Operator","Our next question is from Brock Vandervliet with UBS. Please proceed.","Brock Vandervliet","Hi, Good morning. Great. I just wanted to actually follow on that question just to kind of square the circle here. End-of-period growth -- loan growth is virtually flat. It sounds like you're cautious going forward. You've done a bit of repositioning. Should loan growth pick up a bit in the second half? Or shouldn't we expect that?","Mac McCullough","No. I think you'll see loan growth pick up in the second half. I mean you have to remember when you're looking at period end, we did say 400 million off the sheet during the quarter Right?","Brock Vandervliet","Yes.","Mac McCullough","And -- but again, the thing that I've communicated time and time again about 2019 is the fact that we have a lot of flexibility in terms of how we manage our financials in 2019. The growth that we were expecting from the loan portfolio was not heroic on a period end to period end basis. And again, some of the liquidity that we have on the balance sheet gave us flexibility in terms of how we manage deposit pricing.","And then on the expense side, we had appropriate flexibility to be able to manage the positive operating leverage for 2019. So you will see continued loan growth. The pipelines are in good shape. We're going to be cautious as we move through 2019 and understand what's going to happen from an economy perspective, but you just need to take some of those factors into consideration when you take a look at the period end numbers.","Brock Vandervliet","Okay. Great. And just quickly on hedging. Earlier in the year, you had mentioned a goal of down 1% and a down 100 basis point ramp. You're 1.8% now. Obviously, the market has changed. Hedges are much more expensive. It sounds like you're not anticipating adding much more there based on the cost and based on your view of the forward curve. Is that accurate?","Mac McCullough","That would be correct. We will optimize our current position, but optimize is optimize. And I would tell you that we're in good shape in terms of how we're positioned right now with our hedges.","Brock Vandervliet","Great, thank you very much.","Operator","That concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back over to Mac for closing remarks.","Mac McCullough","Thank you, Sherri. I'm pleased with our solid results in the first half of the year, particularly given the significant amount of market volatility and the movement in the yield curve we have witnessed. I'm really confident about our prospects for the full year as we manage through what we expect to be a changing -- a challenging environment.","Our top priorities are executing our strategic plan to prudently grow revenue and to thoughtfully invest in our businesses for continued organic growth while also delivering annual positive operating leverage. We are building long-term shareholder value through a diligent focus on top quartile financial performance and consistently disciplined risk management.","And finally, as always, we'd like to end with a reminder to our shareholders that there's a high level of alignment between the Board, management, our colleagues and our shareholders. The Board and our colleagues are collectively a top 10 shareholder of Huntington, and all of us are appropriately focused on driving sustained long-term performance. Thank you for your interest in Huntington. We appreciate you joining the call today. Have a great day.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s conference.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, we will have a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions].","I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Mark Muth, Director of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference.","Mark Muth","Thank you and welcome. I\u2019m Mark Muth, Director of Investor Relations for Huntington. Copies of the slides we will be reviewing can be found on our IR website at www.huntington.com. This call is being recorded and will be available as a rebroadcast starting about an hour from the close of the call.","Slides 1 and 2 note several aspects of the basis of today\u2019s presentation. I encourage you to read these but let me point out one key disclosure. This presentation will reference non-GAAP financial measures. And in that regard, I would direct you to the comparable GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations of the comparable GAAP financial measures within the presentation, the additional earnings related material we released this morning and the related Form 8-K filed today, all of which can be found on our website.","Turning to Slide 3, today\u2019s discussion, including the Q&A period, will contain forward-looking statements. Such statements are based on information and assumptions available at this time and are subject to changes, risks and uncertainties, which may cause actual results to differ materially. We assume no obligation to update such statements.

Dan Neumeyer, our Chief Credit Officer will also be participating in the Q&A portion of the call.","Let\u2019s get started by turning to Slide 5. Mac?","Mac McCullough","Thanks Mark. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. We appreciate your interest in Huntington. Since 2009, we\u2019ve executed a well-defined strategy designed to grow market share and share-of-wallet. We introduced our fair play philosophy, our welcome culture and became known for our strong recognized whole brand, differentiated product set and industry leading customer service. In addition we invested in our franchise, building and expanding at a time when others were focused fairly on cost cutting. We plan to continue to invest on our business, although as we have stated before we will pace our investments to manage proportion of operating leverage on an annual basis.","Our third quarter results again provide proof that our strategies are working and the investments we\u2019ve undertaken over the past few years are continuing to pay off. We produced solid revenue growth despite the challenging interest rate environment. Our investments none of which are mature continue to drive future performance in revenue growth. We remain focused on disciplined execution.","For the second quarter in a row we closed the GAAP on year-to-date operating leverage and we\u2019re well positioned to deliver on our commitment for positive operating leverage for the third consecutive year.","Slide 5 shows some of the financial highlights for the quarter. Earnings per common share of $0.18 was flat with the year ago quarter, while tangible book value per share increased 5% year-over-year to $6.88. As we disclosed in 8K filed on September 29, we received an unfavorable ruling on a decade old legal matter resulting in a $38 million or $0.03 per share charge in the quarter as noted in the significant items disclosure. We\u2019re fully reserved on the matter and we will be appealing the ruling.","Year-over-year revenue growth was 5%, with both the net interest income and noninterest income contributing to the increase. High quality balance sheet growth including 6% year-over-year increase in average loans and leases and 10% increase in average core deposits. As we noted last quarter, while the value of core deposits may not be fully appreciated by the market in the current rate environment, we believe that our strong core deposit franchise will prove to be a key differentiator once interest rates begin to rise.","Our credit quality remains very strong with only 13 basis points of net charge offs and 77 basis points of non-performing assets. Our capital ratios remain strong as well. Tangible common equity ended the quarter at 7.89% while common equity Tier 1 was 9.72%.","Slide 6 provides the summary of income statement including some additional details on our noninterest income and noninterest expense for the quarter. Relative to last year\u2019s third quarter, total revenue increased 5% to 757 million. Spread revenues accounted for the majority of the increase as we benefited from 8% average earning asset growth partially offset by 4 basis points of net interest margin compression.","We continue to manage the net interest margin. We had disciplined pricing of both loans and deposits. Noninterest income increased 2% from the year ago quarter. Highlights from the quarter included a 9% increase in service charges on deposit accounts and 13% increase in electronic banking income, both reflecting continuous strong consumer and business acquisition.","Recall that the year ago quarter included a 6 million per quarter negative impact of deposit service charges from changes to our consumer deposit products including all day deposit implemented in July of last year. As this quarter\u2019s results demonstrate, we have now more than overcome that step down.","Capital market fees increased 24% year-over-year reflecting the ongoing benefit of past investment and is key revenue capability for our commercial customers. Mortgage banking income declined 24% from the year ago quarter as 8 million MSR impairment more than offset 5 million increase in mortgage origination in secondary marketing revenues.","Our wealth businesses were negatively impacted by the planned product substitution in our broker dealer following our 2014 transition to an open architectural platform and our strategy to move to more predictable revenue streams within the business. Trust services income decreased 11%, while brokerage income decreased 12%.","During the quarter we announced agreements the transition are remaining equity and money market funds to our\u2013to other fund families and to sell Huntington asset advisors, the current advisor for the funds. We expect these transactions will close during the fourth quarter with an immaterial impact on our 2016 run rate. Recall that we previously transitioned our fixed income funds during the second quarter of 2014.","Reported noninterest expense in the third quarter was 527 million, an increase of 46 million or 10% from the year ago quarter. This quarter\u2019s noninterest expense included two significant items, the previously mentioned 38 million addition to litigation reserves and 5 million of merger related expense from the Huntington Technology Finance acquisition earlier this year, the pending transition of the Huntington funds and the sale of Huntington Asset Advisors. Noninterest expense adjusted for significant items, increased 26 million or 6%.","Slide 7 details the trends in our balance sheet mix. Average loans and leases increased 2.9 billion or 6% year-over-year as we experienced year-over-year growth in every portfolio. Average commercial and industrial loans grew 1.2 billion or 7%, while average automobile loans grew 0.9 billion or 11%. The year-over-year growth in the C&I portfolio primarily reflected growth in asset finance including the Huntington Technology Finance acquisition, corporate banking and auto dealer floorplan lending.","The 2015 third quarter represented the seventh consecutive quarter of indirect auto loan originations in excess of 1 billion. Auto finance remains a core component to Huntington and is detailed on the slides and the appendix. We\u2019ve remained consistent in our strategy which is built around a dealer centric model and focused on prime borrowers. Our underwriting has not changed and the portfolio continues to perform very well.","Average securities increased 1.6 billion or 13% year-over-year. Approximately 600 million of this increase related to direct purchase of small of municipal instruments originated by our Commercial lending team. Turning attention to the right side of the balance sheet, average deposits increased 5.4 billion or 11% over the year ago quarter including 4.8 billion or 10% increase in core deposits.","Average noninterest bearing demand deposits increased 21% year-over-year and average interest bearing demand deposits increased 12%. These increases reflect our continued focus on consumer checking, household and commercial relationship growth. Other core deposit categories continue to benefit from our efforts to deepen banking relationships and to increase our share of wallet.","Average money market deposits increased 9% year-over-year and average savings increased 4%. We continue to remix the consumer deposit base out of higher cost CDs and to other less expensive deposit products. Average core CDs decreased 20% year-over-year. Importantly the year-over-year growth in total core deposits more than fully funded our earning asset growth over this period.","The strong core deposit growth also allowed us to pay down some short-term wholesale funding as average short-term borrowings and federal home loan bank advances decreased 2.7 billion year-over-year. Average long-term debt increased 2.5 billion as a result of three bank level senior debt issuances this year including 500 million increase - issued during the 2015 third quarter. Average broker deposits increased 500 million. These wholesale funding sources provided a cost efficient means of funding balance sheet growth including LCR related securities growth for maintaining brokers on managing core deposit expense.","Slide 8 shows our net interest margin plotted against earning asset yields and interest bearing liability cost. The net interest margin decreased 4 basis points year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter to 3.16%. Recall the 2015 second quarter, net interest margin benefited from $3 million of prepayment penalties within the securities portfolio which added 2 basis points, similarly the 2015 third quarter net interest margin benefited from $3 million as well, again 2 basis points from interest recoveries on nonaccrual loans.","We continue to experience pricing pressure across most asset classes in the quarter in addition the bank level senior debt issuances have increased our cost of funds on the margin. Going forward we expect net interest margin pressure to remain a headwind consistent with recent experience.","Slide 9 provides some details on our current asset sensitivity positioning and how we manage interest rate risk. For the past several years we have run a more neutral balance sheet in many of our peers, in part related to our swap portfolio. The swaps were added in light of the outlook for prolonged low rates and helped us support our net interest margin over this period.","As shown on the chart on the top, our modeling estimates that net interest income would benefit by 0.3% if interest rates were to gradually ramp 200 basis points in addition to increases already reflected in the current implied forward curve. This is consistent with estimates of the past several quarters. In a hypothetical scenario with 9 billion of asset swaps - without the 9 billion on asset swaps, the estimated benefit would approximate positive 3.9% in the up 200 basis point ramp scenario.","The chart at the bottom of the slide illustrates the weighted average life of our asset and liabilities swap portfolios as well as the net impact of the swaps and our net interest income, including an incremental 28 million in the 2015 third quarter. As you can see in the green line, the asset swap portfolio continues to age in and had a weighted average life of 1.3 years at quarter end.","As we stated previously, our asset swap portfolio is a laddered portfolio. There are no cliffs looming on the horizon. During the 2015 fourth quarter an additional 800 million of these asset swaps will mature and at an additional 3.6 billion will mature during 2016. LLC for these swap maturities would increase our estimated asset sensitivity.","Slide 10 shows the trends in our capital ratios. Our risk based regulatory capital ratios improved modestly from the prior quarter end, while transfer common equity or TCE remained relatively flat. We repurchased 6.8 million common shares during the third quarter at an average price of $10.66 per share, effectively returning more than 72 million of capital to shareholders. We have about 195 million of authorized capacity remaining for the next three quarters under 366 million share repurchase authorization.","Slide 11 provides an overview of our provision, charge offs and allowance for credit losses. Credit performance remain solid and in line with our expectations. The loan loss provision was 22.5 million in the third quarter compared to 16.2 million of net charge offs. Net charge offs were well controlled at 13 basis points, remaining well below our long-term expectations of 35 to 55 basis points. The ACL ration fell modestly to 1.32% of loans and leases from 1.34% of the prior quarter end, in line with modest overall improvements in credit metrics. The ratio of loans to nonaccrual loans increased to 184% compared to 180% a quarter ago. We believe the allowance is appropriate and reflects the underlying credit quality of our loan portfolio.","Slide 12 highlights trends and criticized assets, non-performing assets and delinquencies. The chart in the upper left shows a slight decrease in the non-performing asset ratio for the quarter to 77 basis points. The NPA ratio is slightly for the second quarter in a row due primarily for higher payments on existing problem loans. The chart on the upper right reflects [indiscernible] improvement on our 90 day delinquencies with the improvement driven by the consumer loan portfolios. The bottom left shows the criticized asset ratio which also improved for the second consecutive quarter due to a noticeable reduction in the amount of new criticized inflows in the quarter. Finally, the chart in the bottom right shows NPA inflows as a percentage of beginning period loans increasing slightly to 29 basis points from 26 basis points last quarter.","I mean, I\u2019ll turn the presentation over to Steve.","Steve Steinour","Thank you, Mac. Slide 14 provides the snapshot of the long-term trends in our consumer and commercial customer acquisition. Our fair play banking philosophy coupled with our optimal customer relationship or OCR focus continues to drive, we believe industry leading customer acquisition. We\u2019ve increased our consumer checking, households and business relationships by almost 9% and 6% compound annual growth rates since 2010. These robust customer growth rates have allowed us to post the associated revenue growth you can see in the two lower charts on the slide.","A particular note, the last two quarters have shown improved momentum in the consumer household revenue metrics as we\u2019ve lapped the last fee change we implemented under our fair play philosophy last August and realized the benefit of the underlying customer growth. We remain focused revenues and we continue to grow revenues despite the headwinds of the interest rate environment.","As we have stated before, our strategy is not just about gaining market share but also gaining share-of-wallet, slides 14 and 15 illustrate the success of our LCR strategy in deepening our consumer and commercial relationships. As we\u2019ve shared with you previously the corner stone of our LCR strategy is based around increasing the number of products and services we provide to our customers, knowing that this will translate both into more loyal, satisfied and stickier customers as well as revenue growth.","During the first quarter of this year our LCR crossed our goal of six or more consumer products and services, crossed over the 50% mark for the first time. At the end of the third quarter this figure improved to more than 51% of our entire consumer checking households using six or more products or services. Correspondingly our consumer checking account household revenue is up 11% year-over-year.","Turning attention to the commercial slide on fifth - on slide 15, our percentage of commercial customers with four or more accounts was 43.7%, up 30 basis points from the prior quarter and up 250 basis points from the year ago quarter. Again, this is translated directly to revenue growth, as commercial revenue increased 8% year-over-year.","During conferences the past few quarters and during calls with our investor relation team, many of you have expressed the desire to better understand the economic strength and underlying trends in our footprint and so we\u2019ve added slides 16 and 17 this quarter to help address those questions. We hope you find this beneficial.","Since the economic recovery began, 2008 or 2009, economic activity in the key states of Ohio, Michigan and Indiana which account for approximately 90% of our business as measured by deposits, has grown faster than the national average. This outperformance has persisted through the past three months and based on the Philadelphia\u2019s edge state [ph] leading indexes is expected to persist for the next six months.","Chart on the bottom of slide 16 shows the unemployment rates in most of our footprint states continue to trend positively and most are in line with or better than the national average. One out layer is the state of West Virginia which continues to struggle with the impact of lower coal prices. Slide 17 shows the current and year ago unemployment rates for our ten largest deposit markets. These MSAs account for more than 80% of our total deposit franchise. As detailed in the chart, all of these markets continue to trend favorably.","Slide 18 shows our year-to-date operating leverage results. Full year positive operating leverage is a long-term strategic goal for Huntington and a commitment we\u2019ve made again for 2015. For the second quarter in a row, we narrow the gap on operating leverage, moving from 1.7% negative at the end of the first quarter to negative 40 basis points at the midpoint of the year and now to negative 10 basis points at the end of the third quarter. We\u2019ve strong revenue momentum and we\u2019ll pace or continue to investment to franchise appropriately for the revenue outlook. Therefore we remain confident in our ability to achieve positive operating leverage for the full year, both inclusive and exclusive of the impact of Huntington Technology Finance.","Turning to slide 19 for some closing remarks and expectations, we remain optimistic about ongoing economic improvements in our foot print. While we\u2019re monitoring certain industries or sectors potentially impacted by global macroeconomic developments, we remain bullish on the mid west economy as a whole. Customer sediment is positive, loan pipelines are encouraging, loan mutualization rates showed a slight increase for the second consecutive quarter. While competition remains intense, we\u2019ll continue to be disciplined in growing our commercial real estate and our C&I portfolios along with our consumer portfolios.","We\u2019re committed to delivering strong results regardless of the interest rate environment. A 2015 budget was built around the current rate environment and the achievement of our goals is not dependant on a rate increase. We will follow a similarly prudent approach as we plan and budget for 2016. We control our own destiny and our focus and execution will deliver results. The relative stability of our net interest margin has been a key component in our revenue growth and maintaining our pricing discipline remains a key focus for Huntington going forward. While we expect pressure will remain a headwind until interest rates start moving back up, we expect to grow revenue despite this pressure.","The benefit of our robust customer acquisition and OCR cross sale strategy was apparent as fee revenue improved this quarter with service charges on deposit accounts, electronic banking, treasury management, capital markets all contributing to the performance. We continue to invest in our businesses for the future, resulting in projected noninterest expense growth of 2% to 4% for the year excluding significant item that MSR activity and acquisition. We expect fourth quarter noninterest expenses excluding significant items will remain consistent with the adjusted noninterest expense levels of the prior two quarters.","We expect full year 2015 revenue growth in excess of expense growth with committed positive operating leverage for the full year of 2015, again both inclusive and exclusive of Huntington Technology Finance. We believe the asset quality metrics will remain near current levels. We expect net charge offs will remain in or below our long-term expected range of 35 to 55 basis points. Modest changes are anticipated given the absolute low levels of our credit metrics. While we try and continue to be as a franchise with an emphasis on consistent shareholder returns, we build a strong and recognizable consumer brand with differentiated products and superior customer service.","We\u2019re executing our strategies and adjusting to our environment were necessary. While past investments continue to pay off, we continue to move forward with further investments and enhance sales management, digital technology, data and analytics in optimizing our retail distribution network. None of our investments are matured. There\u2019s a high level of alignment between the board, management and all of our employees and shareholders and we\u2019re highly focused on our commitments to being good stewards of shareholder capital.","With that I\u2019ll turn it back over to Mark.","Mark Muth","Thanks, Steve. Operator we\u2019ll now take questions. We ask that as a courtesy of your peers each person ask only one question and one related follow-up. And then if that person has additional questions, he or she can add themselves back into the queue. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of John Pancari from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","John Pancari","Good morning.","Steve Steinour","Good morning, John.","John Pancari","Just on the margin front. Just wanted to get a little bit color on the loan, this quarter they seemed they\u2019ve head up [ph] really well and then you indicated the margins should remain under pressure here. Should we expect a similar pace of compression like you saw this quarter about the 3 to 4 basis point range?","Steve Steinour","Yes, John. So we\u2019re very deliberately focused on making sure that we appraise loans appropriately, so we\u2019re very focused on making sure that we go through the right process internally and maximize pricing on both the asset and liability sides of the balance sheet. That\u2019s really helping; I think the margin performance is some of the stability that you\u2019re seeing. We will continue to see the pressure going forward. We\u2019ve been pretty consistent in talking about 2 to 4 basis points. Some of the longer term debts that we are putting on the balance sheet at this point to fund 2016 growth and related to some of the rating agency changes will increase the margin or increase the funding cost on the margin. So I think the higher end of the range is probably what I would think about for the fourth quarter but again I think managing the margin for consistent stable performance.","John Pancari","Okay, all right. Thank you. And then certainly I guess I was going to hop over to capital, just wanted to ask you about your updated thoughts on deployment priorities when it comes to the buyback, dividend and also in - importantly on M&A and if there\u2019s been any change to those priorities given the stubborn interest environment. Thanks.","Steve Steinour","Yeah, our priorities have remained consistent with everything we\u2019ve disclosed historically. We\u2019re of course focused on the dividend and return of capital to our shareholders, organic growth and - but the buyback I think, certainly if Macquarie or Huntington Technology Finances agreed, example of the type of acquisition that we think is very advantageous for our shareholders performing better than we expected and when you think about it from an acquisition like Macquarie versus the share repurchase, I would do an acquisition like Macquarie any day.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bob Ramsey. Your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","Good morning, this is Martin Turskin [ph] for Bob Ramsey.","Steve Steinour","Hi, Martin.","Unidentified Analyst","I had a question, so auto loans were up almost 800 million in the quarter and there was - this morning was a general article about OCC Director Cary [ph] being concerned about the activity in the market, are you seeing anything that concerns you?","Dan Neumeyer","Yeah, Martin, this is Dan Neumeyer. No and industry wide I think his observations are spot on but we have said repeatedly when you look at our strategy on auto loans we\u2019ve been very consistent. Our numbers are rock solid in terms of what\u2019s originating [indiscernible], LTBs, the term of our loans, there is no risk layering within our portfolio, so we feel extremely confident in the performance of our book today.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, thank you.","Steve Steinour","Martin, this is a sort of industry I think of the control or the control of credit is done the industry and investors of service, pointing out where they have concerns, let\u2019s issues get addressed so we don\u2019t - as Dan said, we\u2019re in great shape, we don\u2019t see us sitting with any concerns right now but obviously they must be existing at that subprime space.","Unidentified Analyst","Got it, thank you. And then moving on to plant [ph] sale of Huntington asset division advisors, what do you expect to be the impact on revenues and expenses and what\u2019s the timing in the sale?","Steve Steinour","It will basically have a non-material impact on revenue and expense and it will take place in the fourth quarter.","Unidentified Analyst","Got it, thank you very much.","Steve Steinour","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Carcache from Nomura. Your line is open.","Bill Carcache","Thank you, good morning.","Dan Neumeyer","Hi, Bill.","Bill Carcache","Hi, you guys talked about your commitment to achieving positive operating leverage and pacing your investments to make that happen. Can you walk through for us your tucking order of investment opportunities and perhaps give a little bit of color around whether those investment opportunities are revenue generating versus compliance related, just to give us a flavor of what some of those opportunities are?","Dan Neumeyer","Yeah, so the opportunities that we\u2019re looking at are very consistent with what we\u2019ve been doing over the last two or three years and we are investing in distribution. You\u2019ve seen us bring online a number of in-store branches which we think are going to be very advantageous for us in the future in terms of optimizing the cost of distribution. Our customers are migrating to those branches for their transactions and we actually sell very, very well in those facilities. So that clearly has been one area. Investments in technology has been another significant area for us. You\u2019ve seen us do a number of things with image enabled [ph] ATMs with new teller platform, with our deposit image [ph] capabilities on mobile phones and we make - continue to make strong investments in the digital capabilities that we need to go forward. So these are the types of investments that we are making and we continue to make and as it relates to positive operating leverage in 2016, we\u2019re going to make these investments as appropriate, we\u2019re going to manage the expense base based upon the revenue environment. Steve mentioned that we are budgeting 2016 assuming an unchanged rate scenario, which means that we\u2019re going into the year with a very conservative expense outlook based upon an unchanged rate scenario. So again we\u2019re going to continue to manage for positive operating leverage on an annual basis and we\u2019re going to do that by making sure that we manage the expense based upon the revenue environment that we\u2019re in, so very confident that we\u2019re going to be able to achieve that in 2016.","Bill Carcache","It\u2019s helpful, thank you. Circling back on auto, can you talk about what\u2019s happening with your participation within auto and speak to any changes and practices that you\u2019re seeing? Yes, at the industry level as well as potentially how those could impact Huntington? I\u2019m really just trying to, I guess assess the risk of disruption to the flow of auto loans that you get from your dealer relationships?","Dan Neumeyer","Yeah, this is Dan again. We don\u2019t expect any disruption, we have a niche that we play on which is prime and super prime - we have great dealer relationships that\u2019s been established by Nick [inaudible 0:31:32]and his team over a long period of time, so while there may be disruption in the industry as a whole, we really think that we have a value proposition that we\u2019ve been very consistent. We know what our target market is and we really don\u2019t expect any disruption to that.","Steve Steinour","Last time there were disruptions was \u201809 and \u201810 and we used it as an opportunity to expand. We\u2019ve been in the business for 60 plus years and we got multi-generational relationships particularly in our corporate brand. So we feel very bullish about the business.","Bill Carcache","So the flow of auto loans that you guys get from your dealer relationships aren\u2019t really a function of dealer participation or be more function of the long-term relationships that you\u2019ve had?","Steve Steinour","Yeah, I would say that\u2019s accurate. Our dealers know that they have a consistent source that has been there through every cycle and I think that dealer relationship is what drives the volumes.","Bill Carcache","That\u2019s r very helpful. Thank you for taking my questions.","Steve Steinour","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Elliott from Autonomous Research. Your line is open.","Geoffrey Elliott","Hello, there. Thank you for taking the question. Following up on also and mark up[inaudible 0:32:47]. How do you expect the industry to evolve do you think over the next few years going to be going to the elimination mark ups, you mark ups just come down, do you think it\u2019s kind of different with different players. If you could kind of think a few years out, what do you think the industry is going to be?","Steve Steinour","Geoff, the industry is trending towards a tighter range of pricing and we think a couple of years out it will be tighter but there will be a range, it won\u2019t be flat pricing. And we\u2019re basing that on the recent announcements with some banks and the safety B [ph] where those pricing discretion allowed and that discretion may be an important part of delivering sales to some segments of the market place and the population as a whole.","Geoffrey Elliott","And then just to follow up, it looked like this quarter also was responsible for the bulk of increases in average loan balances. How do you see that changing over future quarters? When do you think the mix will shift away from also towards commercial and other categories driving loan growth?","Steve Steinour","Geoff, it\u2019s really hard to say. I mean the - obviously the auto industry is very strong right now, record volumes and as we pointed out in our comments earlier, we\u2019ve had seven quarters of a billion dollars or more in production. So I think it comes down to - in this environment we think the way we run this business, the quality of our portfolio from risk return perspective this is a good asset to have on our balance sheet. So we\u2019re extremely comfortable with that. We certainly hope it continues long into 2016 and we think it will.","Geoffrey Elliott","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Huston from Jeffries. Your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","Thanks, good morning. On the C&I side, you guys had been very clear about watching your growth and so you\u2019ve seen kind of a flatness over the last couple of quarters. I\u2019m just wondering if you can help us understand what\u2019s happening on the HTF side, within that and then what other pockets of C&I are either growing or shrinking and how do you see that planning out forward?","Dan Neumeyer","Yeah, Ken, this is Dan. The market remains competitive but we are seeing a nice growth in many of the segments, equipment finance continues to be a driver and Huntington Technology Finance as a part of that has macro [indiscernible] actually beating expectations, so we\u2019re happy with what\u2019s going on there. We had good growth in the quarter and in core middle markets, large corporate and our protocols continue to - each individual one is not huge but collectively healthcare franchise, AVL [ph] are all good contributors in the quarter. So it\u2019s really a matter of picking our slots and which ones align best with our risk appetite. Overall, our backlogs are actually quite healthy, a little bit better even than a year ago at this time.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay and then on the credit side this is the first quarter we\u2019ve seen a provision build from you guys in quite a long time, I know you did have some recoveries in CRE but is this a flip over here, what are you guys seeing as far as the macro that\u2019s leading to that kind of decent delta from releasing to provisioning and should we expect builds going forward?","Dan Neumeyer","I don\u2019t think there\u2019s really. The numbers we\u2019re talking about are kind of smaller side. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s been any dramatic shift. We did over provide a bit this quarter. I think we\u2019ve been thinking for some time that the conversion of charge offs and provision would be more closely aligned and I think we continue - we\u2019ll continue to operate in that general range.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, thanks guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Alexopoulos from JP Morgan. Your line is open.","Steven Alexopoulos","Good morning everybody.","Mac McCullough","Good morning.","Mac McCullough","On the expenses, if I look at the year-to-date adjusted expenses of 1.4 billion and then I use your guidance for there\u2019s a [ph] consistent with the last two quarters for fourth quarter, that will imply somewhere around 1.9 billion adjusted for the year, which according to my math is 5.5% increase over the 2014 adjusted level of 1.8 billion. What am I missing there regarding to expenses in the 2% to 4% range?","Steve Steinour","Yeah, so it comes down to the fact that we added Macquarie this year. So that guidance is excluding HTF.","Steven Alexopoulos","The guidance is excluding that transaction. So what base should we be using for 2014 then with this 2% to 4% full year adjusted guidance?","Mac McCullough","So it should be the 2014 adjusted and then 2015adjusted excluding HTF. The reason that we did that is because we gave this guidance originally before the HTF transaction and we just felt it was important to continue to give consistent guidance here. So that\u2019s the way to think about the math, that\u2019s the way it works.","Steven Alexopoulos","Okay, got you. Okay. Separately given such strong growth that you\u2019ve been having in auto are you guys planning for a securitization in the fourth quarter or may be just what\u2019s on timing for your next one?","Mac McCullough","Yeah, we continue to look at kind of the efficiency of the securitization market and the need for us to actually that either from a risk concentration or funding perspective, we don\u2019t see a need to do that in the near future. We have talked about perhaps doing some funding transactions in 2016 but again we don\u2019t see that as being required at this point in time.","Steven Alexopoulos","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And Mac may be if I could just go back to the prior question I had, so what is the dollar of expenses assuming the numbers right that wish that were attributable to the deal that we should be excluding?","Mac McCullough","So we gave guidance on that last quarter. Macquarie expenses were about $15 million a quarter and very consistent in terms of what we see in this quarter as well.","Steven Alexopoulos","Okay, perfect. Thanks, guys.","Mac McCullough","Okay, thanks a lot.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zerbe from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Ken Zerbe","Okay, good morning.","Steve Steinour","Hi, Ken.","Ken Zerbe","Just take off with interest rates, yearly margin in particular, obviously we heard it should go down from here but when we think about sort of the new money rates that you are putting on new business versus portfolio rates, how far off are the two, right? Is it really asset yields coming down that\u2019s still causing all the pressure or is more the liability cost going up? And the reason I want to compare that to some of the other banks in the industry who\u2019ve been talking a lot more about NIM stability even in this environment? Thanks.","Steve Steinour","So you know up until this point in time if it really has been on the asset side of the equation, so we still are seeing as new assets come on the balance sheet. They\u2019re actually replacing assets that are coming off at a higher yield. You know we\u2019re starting to see because of some of the debt issuance that we\u2019re doing a bit of a change of the liability side as well not significant. But I would tell you that we\u2019re probably pretty close to the assets life kind of neutralizing and I would think about maybe the second half of 2016 seeing some stabilization there.","Unidentified Analyst","On total NIM or just the asset side?","Steve Steinour","I would say probably both, given the current rate - given the current rate environment the current competitive environment lots of factors go into that of course but second half of \u201816 probably looks reasonable.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, great. And then second question I had, just on the swaps, are you guys planning to let those continue to runoff each quarter from here or just given sort of the low rate expectations about rate hikes, would you consider putting additional swaps on?","Steve Steinour","No, we do evaluate that frequently and I would tell that right now we\u2019re comfortable with the current trajectory of how they are coming off. So again we spend a fair amount of time in ALCO, sub-ALCO reviewing the swap position and our overall asset liability position of course. And but I will stay that we\u2019re staying of course.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, what would have to happen to change your view on that in terms of rate expectations or is that something else?","Steve Steinour","Yeah, I think - I think rate expectations length of still lay perhaps in seeing any changes coming out of the fed. I think we\u2019re just, just at a process the information that\u2019s available to us and make decisions on that.","Unidentified Analyst","Alright, thank you very much.","Steve Steinour","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Erika Najarian from Bank of America. Your line is open.","Erika Najarian","Good morning.","Steve Steinour","Good morning, Erika.","Erika Najarian","It\u2019s my first question, is just on credit quality, I did notice that on the auto side that both NPLs in auto and late stage delinquencies did go up year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter and I am wondering if that\u2019s just normal seasoning of that or there something else going on there? And relative to your normal range for charge offs overall 35 to 55 basis points, where do you think auto losses would normalize to relative to the 20ish basis points that we\u2019ve been seeing recently?","Mac McCullough","Yeah, so Erika first of all I would say that you know when we get down the performance metrics we have today are very, very well so any change from quarter-to-quarter even year-over-year at this point you know a tick up might noticeable but it\u2019s still of a very low base. So I don\u2019t read anything into the any quarterly variance or year-over-year grants, but there is some seasonality and we do tend to be a little bit of an uptick in the third quarter and there might be a very small impact from some of the TCPA charges ability to call on customers therefore why was impacted but only very slightly, so that might be a part of it. But overall we\u2019re very pleased with these metrics. Obviously, overtime we could see an uptick in charge off as we move to the cycle, although we continue to originate very consistently. And so I think it would be in line with historical performance.","Erika Najarian","Got it. And my follow-up question is - a follow-up to John\u2019s question earlier. This quarter we saw headlines that Huntington was part of shooter, so to speak for a regional that would be a large portion of the bank. And given sort of your priority list in terms of capital allocation that you listed in terms of dividend buybacks and asset, is that in our part if the equation in terms of capital allocation in terms of buying a relatively lager deposit?","Steve Steinour","You know Erika, we\u2019ve lost you, can\u2019t really hear the last part of the question.","Erika Najarian","Oh, I am sorry, I don\u2019t know where I cutoff that, you know given that Huntington is boiled in rumor, so as it possible shooter for the large northeast depository, but relative to your priority list of capital allocation dividends, buybacks and asset purchases like Macquarie, should we eliminate Huntington as a potential shooter for large depository deals like that over the next year or two?","Steve Steinour","So you know first we don\u2019t respond rumors in the marketplace, so that\u2019s the answer of on the specific question that you asked. But the way we think about acquisition is does not changed. We\u2019re extremely consistent; we\u2019ve been consistent before a number of years in terms of thinking about the fixed footprint. Core depository is looking in the contiguous states is something we talked about as well. So we\u2019ve been very consistent in how we talk about our M&A strategy.","Erika Najarian","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Samir Kafity [ph]. Your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, thanks for talking my questions. I just wanted to follow-up a little bit about on the slops that you mentioned earlier, I might have missed it, but in terms of the outlook for the NIM going forward, what have you taken to your expectation as far as replacing that swap book as those mature because it seems like based on the benefit you\u2019ve been receiving from those as those slops mature on this, they were pleased if the negative impact on your margin and then to the extend you enter into a new swaps, you know could it be - possibility that those are maybe less economical than your current ones, so again that causes some downward impact on the NIM where you\u2019ve been. So if you could just help us kind of clarifying thing to the impact on the NIM from the reduction in your swap that would be helpful?","Steve Steinour","Yeah, so the - the guidance that we\u2019ve given on our NIM historically and continue to give on our NIM assumes that we can change the assets swaps for loss, so there is no replacement in that work as we give guidance and think about the future. So again we\u2019ve been consistent in that approach and that guidance overtime.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, thank you for the clarification. The other thing I was looking to just clarify also was in terms of again the dealer market issue, just kind of flush out a little bit in terms of settlements some of your peers have had with regulators, are you saying that you haven\u2019t needed to unsecured any sort of pricing changes or caps in terms of your relationships with the dealers given your focus on prime and super prime customers and therefore you don\u2019t see an impact or have you already unsecured those changes and still aren\u2019t seeing any impact on your business again because of the quality plus the account are going after? Just a clarify would be helpful.","Steve Steinour","So I don\u2019t think that we are anticipating any changes from what was happening in the marketplace today. We\u2019ve made changes back in 2010 around the way we think about pricing and what we\u2019ve allowed the dealer to do. So we think that what we are doing today is very consistent with what we done sometime and that waiting time and don\u2019t see any issues there.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. And then just a quick one if I may, in terms of your digital investment, could you help us, how much you are planning to invest in 2016 and the used in vision also investing on the digital side not only on the - for consumer loans and consumer relate activities but also any potential opportunities to invest related to your commercial businesses? Thank you.","Steve Steinour","So we don\u2019t really disclose the size of investment that we make in various aspects of the business from a technologic perspective. You know I will say that the investment they were making is broad across all segments and all lines of business and that we are accelerating that investment in digital. But again that\u2019s something that we don\u2019t disclose.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. Thank you for talking my questions.","Steve Steinour","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby. Your line is open.","Marty Mosby","Thanks. Steve I wanted to ask -","Steve Steinour","Good morning.","Marty Mosby","Well, yeah, same here.","Steve Steinour","Okay.","Marty Mosby","I wanted to ask you about the, when you look at the average customer relationships. As you are adding customers so quickly, but you are also being able to increase the pool that have six plus products, are you being able to just convert new customers with significant amount of products or is there just a wholesale change in the banker relationship and is that why you are being able to accomplish both those goals at the same time?","Steve Steinour","Marty, we have invested in our brand and in our products to make them very attractive with unique, in some cases unique features. We talked in prior earnings releases about an investment we\u2019ve made last year in date and analytics and creating the capacity to better understand our customer base and their needs and desires and our capital to fulfill with them in different channels and the combination of those investments with our ongoing efforts to provide better sales execution is leading to growth in both new customers but growth in product penetration with the entire book. And we think we\u2019re - while we\u2019re better, we have opportunity to further improve.","Marty Mosby","And it usually just takes a little time for the new customers to kind of rollup and add their relationships, so it\u2019s a very positive story to build you both at same time. And then Mac, I wanted to ask you about hedging in the mortgage banking unit. If you look at the volatility that you are getting just in the last you know two quarter, you had 6 million write-up, net write-up last quarter, you got a 8 million net write down this quarter. The volatility in your results is about 50% of your average mortgage banking revenue line, if you look Wells Fargo for incidence, their volatility is around 10%, is there any way that you can try to hedge out some of that volatility in the servicing portfolio with a change in interest rate? So just wanted to see if you had a philosophy that you all had or way to adopt maybe limit that volatility a little bit more?","Mac McCullough","Yeah, Marty, we\u2019re taking to look at that. Obviously, I think the hedges are very efficient in last couple of quarters with just given some of the volatility and rate changes and kind of that market place. So we\u2019re talking to look at it, a strategy is there but we do feel confident in what we are doing. I just think the market has been a little, little volatile last few quarters.","Marty Mosby","Okay, we could probably just talk offline a little bit about that because we have done in the past, so we could talk about few things, so we\u2019ve been able to do to help me on minimize some of that volatility.","Steve Steinour","That\u2019s great. Thanks Marty.","Marty Mosby","Alright, talk to you later. Thanks.","Steve Steinour","Okay.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bob Ramsey. Your line is open.","Bob Ramsey","Hi, just couple of question on fees. Given the mortgage, I am thinking weakness this quarter, could you give us some color around that and what\u2019s your outlook going forward?","Steve Steinour","Yeah, so keep in mind that the MSR impairment that we mentioned earlier on the call is embedded in that mortgage banking line, so that\u2019s $8.4 million in the mortgage banking line, excluding that year-over-year, I think we\u2019re up $5 million in growth. So clearly we are seeing some reduction in volume relative to where we were earlier on the year, we do see revives like everyone else in the industry dropping off and purchases becoming more important, but I do think both the volumes are solid, but that as far as they weren\u2019t earlier in the year.","Bob Ramsey","Got it. And service charges were up 5 million quarter, which kind of seems particularly strong and could you give me some color on what\u2019s driving that up?","Mac McCullough","So this actually is the first quarter on a year-over-year basis where we no longer have the impact of changes that we made for fair play. Back in July of 2014 was the last adjustment that we made that actually impacted us by $6 million a quarter. So we\u2019re through that now and what you are actually seeing come true on that line is more reflective of the strength household growth that we\u2019ve able to drive really since we introduced fair play. So that I think I think is a very positive sign around the success of the strategy and what we would expect going forward.","Bob Ramsey","Got it. Thank you very much.","Mac McCullough","Thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Peter Winter from Sterne Agee. Your line is open.","Peter Winter","Thanks. Good morning. I appreciate the new slides on the economic date. But just curious with the global slowdown, the strong dollar, have you guys seen any impact to your businesses or is it just so much new account that you are able to growth through that?","Dan Neumeyer","Hey Peter, this is Dan. I would say that, yeah, we watch the dollar China commodity, but I think for our local economy, the strength of the auto industry, the strength of the housing market and the fact that low energy prices well that\u2019s a negative for the energy businesses for many of our customers, you know energy costs are major input and to our consumers. So I think those factors combined actually have been a net positive and we\u2019re still seeing strong demand and strong - pretty strong in our region.","Peter Winter","Is that contracting, I know you talked about it, but is it having a little bit of an impact of the C&I side?","Dan Neumeyer","You know I would say it\u2019s only epithetic, we\u2019re not seeing any trends in any industry. You know we\u2019re seeing you know case here and there of somebody being particularly affected but on the whole, we\u2019ve not seen any kind of industry level that impacts, we though at this point.","Peter Winter","Got it. Thank you.","Dan Neumeyer","Thanks Peter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Spahr. Your line is open.","Chris Spahr","Hi, good morning. I just have a question on deposit trends, I see that most accounts and the peers are down. I was wondering if we should read into that for the next few quarters?","Mac McCullough","Hi Chris, see now, I don\u2019t think if there is anything you should really read into that. I think we continue to see very positive growth on both consumer households and on the commercial side of the business, you know some really good growth on the commercial side. So I really don\u2019t think there is anything you should read into that.","Chris Spahr","Right, thank you.","Mac McCullough","Thanks Chris.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","Steve Steinour","Okay, hearing no further questions. This is Steve, I want to just -","Operator","Excuse me. We did have one more question from the David Darst from Guggenheim. Your line is open.","David Darst","Good morning.","Steve Steinour","Hi David.","Mac McCullough","Good morning, David.","David Darst","Thanks for including me. So I just wanted to ask about the HT of fee income and then I believe you got some operating leases with that portfolio as well, so should we see that the fee income contribution grow or is that going to betide overtime?","Steve Steinour","Yeah, the operating lease income will betide overtime along with the operating lease expense. So we\u2019re not going to do operating leases going forward as we renew that business or bringing additional lease on and all end up in the margin going forward. So you will see both the income and the expense related operating leases are trying to come.","David Darst","Okay, great, thanks a lot.","Steve Steinour","Thank you. Any other questions, operator?","Operator","There are not further questions at this time. I\u2019ll turn the call back over to the presenters.","Steve Steinour","So we\u2019re pleased with our third quarter results. And our strategies are working, our investments are positively contributing to results and our execution is focused and strong. We continued to gain market share and improve share wallet. We produced 5% year-over-year revenue growth in a challenging environment and we\u2019ve remained focused on pricing and underwriting discipline. We continued to invest in our businesses but we pace those investments to assure positive operating leverage. We continued to work toward out long term corporate goals including becoming more efficient and boosting returns.","And finally, I want to close by reiterating that our Board and this management team are all long term shareholders. Our top priorities include managing risk, reducing volatility, achieving positive operating leverage and driving solid, consistent long term performance. We are well aligned on these priorities.","So thank you for your interest in Huntington. We appreciate you joining us today. Have a great day.","Operator","This concludes today conference call.

My name is Steve, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Huntington Bancshares Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]","I'll now turn the call over to Todd Beekman, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Todd Beekman","Thanks, Steve. Welcome. I'm Todd Beekman, Director of Investor Relations for Huntington Banc. Copies of the slides that we will be reviewing can be found on our website at www.huntington.com. This call is being recorded and will be available for rebroadcast starting about an hour after the close of the call. Please call Investor Relations department at (614) 480-5676 for more information on how to access the recording of playback or should you have difficulty getting copies of the slides.","Slides 2 and 3 note several aspects of the basis of today's presentation. I encourage you to read these, but let me point out one key disclosure. The presentation contains both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures, where we believe it is helpful to understand Huntington's results of operations or financial position. Where non-GAAP financial measures are used, the comparable GAAP financial measure as well as the reconciliation of the comparable GAAP financial measure can be found in the slide presentation, its appendix, in the earnings press release, in the quarterly financial review, the quarterly performance discussion or in the latest 8-K filed today, all of which can be found on our website.","Turning to Slide 4. Today's discussion, including the Q&A period, may contain forward-looking statements. Such statements are based on information and assumptions available at this time and are subject to change, risks and uncertainties, which may cause the results to differ materially. We assume no obligation to update such statements. For a complete discussion of risks and uncertainties, please refer to the slide and material we filed with SEC, including our 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filings.","Now turning to today's presentation. As noted on Slide 5, participating in today's call are Steve Steinour, Chairman, President and CEO; Don Kimble, Senior Executive Vice President and CFO; Dan Neumeyer, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Credit Officer.","Turning to Slide 6. Steve?","Stephen D. Steinour","Thank you, Todd. Welcome, everyone. I'll begin with the review of our fourth quarter performance highlights. After my overview, Don will follow with his recap of our financial performance. Dan will provide an update on credit. I will then return with an update on our Fair Play and OCR or Optimal Customer Relationship strategy and close with the discussion of our expectations for this year.","Before we get started, for those of you who are regulars on this call, there's a notable absence on today's call. After over a decade of service to Huntington in over 30 years in the field of Investor Relations, Jay Gould had decided to retire. He will be with the company until the middle of the year. I wanted to take a moment to thank Jay for his counsel during what have been some turbulent times and his tireless efforts in communicating the Huntington message. In particular, Jay helped Don and I provide insight and industry-leading levels of disclosure about Huntington over the last several years.","Now getting to the topic at hand and turning to Slide 7. We report a net income of $126.9 million or $0.14 per share, up 3% from a year ago but down 12% or $0.02 from the third quarter. There were 2 factors that impacted this quarter's results. First was the anticipated impact of the reduction of electronic banking income due to the implementation of the Durbin Amendment related to a debit card fee reduction. The total impact for the quarter was $17.3 million.","The second was the absence of an automobile loan securitization gain as the third quarter included a $15.5 million gain. As we noted last quarter, we intend to use automobile loan securitizations to manage our overall balance sheet risk exposure to automobile loans and expect to have such securitization gains from time to time but not likely every quarter. In that regard, at the end of the year, we transferred $1.3 billion of automobile loans to held for sale in anticipation of another securitization during the first half of 2012.","The combined impact was nearly $33 million, which accounted for more than $20.8 million or a 3% decrease in total fully taxable equivalent revenue. This total revenue decline included a $29.2 million or 11% decline in noninterest income. This reflected the impact of the 2 items I mentioned previously.","Revenue was also negatively impacted by a $6.4 million Visa-related derivative loss. These negatives were partially offset by an $11.3 million increase in mortgage banking income.","Fully taxable equivalent net interest income increased $8.4 million or 2%. For the quarter, our NIM increased by 4 basis points as we continue to lower deposit and other funding cost. We also had a 2% annualized growth in average total loans. Now the total loan growth rate is partially understated due to the third quarter's $1 billion automobile loan securitization.","Another highlight for the quarter was strong commercial growth -- loan growth, which increased at a 16% annualized rate. Average total core deposits increased at a 14% annualized growth rate with the mix continuing its shift to lower-cost demand deposits. Total demand deposits increased $2 billion. This reflected core organic growth as well as $600 million of what we consider as short-term commercial deposits that were previously collateralized short-term borrowings.","Noninterest expense declined $8.8 million or 2% as the quarter included a $9.7 million gain on the extinguishment of debt related to our trust exchange.","Turning to Slide 8. Our OCR methodology continued to deliver strong success. On the consumer side, we finished the year well above our initial target of 7.5% growth as consumer checking account households grew 10.3%. This is nearly 4x the rate of growth in 2009 and more than 50% higher than last year. More importantly, our cross-sell performance also continued to improve. At the end of the year, 73.5% of our consumer checking account households have over 4 products or services. This compares with 69.4% a year ago.","We are seeing similar success on the commercial side. Growth in commercial relationships was 8.4% for the full year. We're also winning the cross-sell game here. At the end of the year, 31.4% of our commercial relationships used 4 products or services -- 4 or more products or services, up from 24.2% a year ago.","Our Fair Play philosophy, coupled with an increasing effective OCR focus while positively impacting current period results, is also positioning us for better long-term performance. We all know that in today's low interest rate environment that the value of deposits could be at an all-time low. What Fair Play combined with OCR is giving us is not only higher customer growth and cross-sell revenue, but increased customer loyalty. When rates eventually rise, we believe our demand deposits will prove to be very sticky.","Turning to credit quality. Our metrics continued to improve as expected. Net charge-offs declined 7% to an annualized rate of 85 basis points. Nonaccrual loans dropped 4%. Our allowance for credit losses as a percentage of nonaccrual loans remained at 187%, which we believe will continue to compare favorably to our peers.","Our capital position remains strong. Our tangible common equity ratio rose 8 basis points to 8.3%. Our regulatory capital ratios remained strong but declined from the third quarter due to an increase in risk-weighted assets.","While not noted on this slide, our fourth quarter pretax preprovision earnings were $227.8 million, down $12.8 million from the third quarter. The details can be found on Slide 37 in the appendix. But going forward, we no longer plan to report pretax preprovision metrics. We consider our provision expense now to be at levels consistent with our longer-term expectations and believe that it's time to return to tracking net income as the primary metric of overall financial performance.","Now let me turn the presentation over to Don to review the financial details. Don?","Donald R. Kimble","Thanks, Steve. Slide 9 provides a summary of our quarterly earnings trends. Many of the performance metrics will be discussed later in the presentation. But turning to Slide 10, our net income for the third quarter was $126.9 million or $0.14 per share, down from $0.16 per share from last quarter. The primary driver for this decrease was a $29.2 million or 11% decrease in noninterest income, partially offset by an $8.8 million or 2% decrease in noninterest expense and an $8.5 million or 2% increase in net interest income. The decrease in noninterest income reflected the $17.3 million impact from the Durbin Amendment that Steve mentioned earlier.","Slide 11 depicts the trends of our net interest income and margin. During the fourth quarter, our fully taxable equivalent net interest income increased $8.4 million, reflecting the benefit of a $0.4 billion increase to our average earnings assets and a 4-basis point increase in our net interest margin to 3.38%. The 4-basis point increase in our net interest margin reflected the impact of 4 primary factors. First, a 15-basis point increase from a reduction in deposit rates and improvement in deposit mix, resulting in a 16-basis point reduction in the average cost of funds. The benefit was partially offset by a 4-basis point reduction related to the impact of the extended low rate environment on loan yields. Also, a 4-basis point reduction related to the items -- other items, including last quarter's auto securitization. And finally, a 3-basis point reduction coming from the yields on investment securities and the continuation of the high liquidity levels.","Continuing on to Slide 12. We have shown continued improvement on our deposit mix over the last 5 quarters as we reduced our noncore and core CDs from 21% -- to 21% from 28% of total average deposits. Perhaps more important was the increase in DDA balances over the same 5-quarter period as this category has increased to 38% from 30% of total average deposits. The improved deposit mix reflects the efforts of Fair Play banking for the consumer category and our treasury management focus for our commercial businesses.","Turning to Slide 13. We showed a $1.4 billion or 3% increase in average core deposits. This increase reflected the efforts to drive core checking household growth on both the consumer and commercial side. On the consumer side, our checking account households increased at 10.3% and consumer noninterest-bearing demand deposits grew 35% from the fourth quarter of 2010. We have shown significant progress in transitioning our liabilities from what was a thrift-like deposit mix toward levels of high performing commercial banks. The strong growth in commercial deposits primarily reflected the results of our treasury management efforts and our OCR program to deepen the relationships with our customers. About $600 million of the commercial growth reflect the movement of previously collateralized short-term borrowings and the demand deposits. These deposits are of a similar nature to the $300 million to $400 million of commercial deposits we called out last quarter, which we view as temporary balances and expect to decline over the next several quarters.","Slide 14 shows trends in our loan and lease portfolio. Average total loans and leases increased $0.2 billion or 1% from the 2011 third quarter, primarily reflecting $0.6 billion or 4% growth in average commercial industrial loans, reflecting increased activity from multiple business lines, including equipment finance, large corporate and dealer services. C&I utilization rates were down slightly from the prior quarter due to an increase in unfunded loan commitments. This was partially offset by a $0.6 billion or 9% decline in the average automobile loans. The decline in the fourth quarter average balances reflected a full quarter's impact of $1 billion securitization completed on September 15. On December 31, as Steve mentioned earlier, we reclassified $1.3 billion of auto loans to loans held for sale, which is roughly 1 to 2 quarters of origination as we plan to complete another securitization in the first half of 2012.","Slide 15 shows the trends in our noninterest income, which decreased $29.2 million or 11% from the prior quarter. This decline reflected $16.2 million of lower gains on loan sales as the prior quarter included the $15.5 million gain associated with last quarter\u2019s auto loan securitization. In addition, the current quarter was negatively impacted by a $14.6 million or 44% decline on electronic banking income, primarily driven by the $17.3 million reduction related to implementing the lower debit card interchange fee structure mandated by the Durbin Amendment. These decreases were partially offset by an $11.3 million or 88% increase in mortgage banking income, driven by a $5.6 million increase in origination and secondary marketing income, as well as a $5.2 million reduction in the net mortgage servicing rights or MSR loss for the quarter. The $4 million MSR loss recognized in the current quarter primarily reflects the model value adjustments that allowed us to show an accelerated prepayment expectation. Other income included a $7.5 million increase in mezzanine investment gains that were partially offset by the $6.4 million negative impact related to an increase on the liability associated with the sale of our Visa Class B shares in 2009. While many of our market-based fee income categories were down from the third quarter, several of these categories, including brokerage and capital markets, were up double-digit growth rates over the prior year.","The next slide is a summary of expense trends. Noninterest expense decreased by $8.8 million or 2%. This included the benefit of the $9.7 million gain on the early extinguishment of debt related to our trust preferred securities exchange, a $5.9 million seasonal decrease in marketing expenses. But these reductions were partially offset by a $3.8 million or 8% increase in outside data processing and other services, primarily due to the cost associated with the conversion to a new debit card processor. These costs should not continue into the future quarters. We also had $3.6 million or 16% increase in equipment expenses, partially driven by accelerated depreciation associated with the planned consolidation of 29 branches in the first quarter of 2012.","Slide 17 reflects the trends in capital. Our tangible common equity ratio increased to 8.3%, up from 8.22% at the end of the prior quarter. The Tier 1 common risk-based capital ratio at December 31 was 10%, down from 10.17% at the end of the prior quarter and was negatively impacted by the increase in our risk-weighted assets.","For 2012, we are part of the Federal Reserve's Capital Plan Review or CapPR stress test process and made our capital plan submission earlier this month. While we can give no assurances as to the outcome or any specific details in the interactions with the regulators, we believe we have a strong capital position.","Let met turn the presentation over to Dan Neumeyer to review the credit terms. Dan?","Daniel J. Neumeyer","Thanks, Don. Slide 18 provides an overview of our credit quality trends. The third quarter continued to show improvement in our credit quality metrics despite continued economic challenges. Notably, the net charge-off ratio fell from 92 basis points annualized in the third quarter to 85 basis points annualized in the fourth quarter. This represented the 8th consecutive quarter of lower net charge-offs. Both commercial and consumer loan charge-offs were lower in the quarter. We would expect the continued improvement in net charge-offs will be realized in 2012 although the pace of improvement will likely be more modest as we approach normal levels.","Loans of 90-plus days, delinquent and accruing were up modestly in the quarter from 16 basis points to 19 basis points. As we saw with the 30-day category last quarter, this reflected normal seasonal patterns but remained lower than the fourth quarter of 2010. We continue to have no commercial delinquencies in the 90-day plus category. The nonaccrual loan ratio of 1.39% as well as the nonperforming asset and criticized asset ratios all showed modest but continuing improvement in the quarter. The allowance for loan and lease loss and allowance for credit loss to loan ratios fell modestly to 2.48% and 2.6% from 2.61% and 2.71%, respectively. The coverage ratios remain very strong, however, as lower allowance levels were offset with lower nonaccruing loans and nonperforming assets. The allowance for loan loss and the allowance for credit loss to nonperformers were basically flat quarter-over-quarter. We believe that the combination of the net charge-off ratio, the nonaccrual loan ratio and the allowance for credit loss to nonperformer coverage ratios continue to be best in class among our peers.","Slide 19 shows the trends in our nonaccrual loans and nonperforming assets. The chart on the left demonstrates the continued reduction in the level of both nonaccrual loans and nonperforming assets. Nonaccrual loans and nonperforming assets fell 4% in the quarter. With regard to nonaccrual inflows depicted on the right-hand slide, we saw an increase in new inflows in the quarter although still lower than the inflows experienced in the first and second quarters of the year. The general trend of inflows throughout the year continued to show improvement. However, the activity tends to be uneven from quarter-to-quarter. Commercial nonperformers were down in the quarter while home equity and residential mortgages saw a slight increase. Both home equity and residential mortgage nonaccrual loans have been written down to net realizable values less anticipated selling cost which substantially limit any significant future risk of loss.","Slide 20 provides the reconciliation of our nonperforming asset flows. Nonperforming assets fell by 4% in the quarter compared to a 6% reduction in the prior quarter. Although inflows were up in the quarter, payments and loans returning to accrual status were up as well and along with the impact of charge-offs and modest loan sales, the overall level of nonperforming assets declined.","Turning to Slide 21, we provide a similar flow analysis of commercial criticized loans. The inflow of new criticized loans was lower than the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter although the inflows remained elevated given the still relatively weak economic conditions. In combination with an increase in paydowns, the result was a 6% reduction in criticized loans compared to the 4% reduction experienced in the fourth -- in the third quarter.","Moving to Slide 22. Commercial loan delinquencies fell from 43 basis points in the third quarter to 27 basis points in the fourth quarter. Both commercial and industrial and commercial real estate had lower delinquency levels in the quarter. We continue to have no 90-day-plus commercial accruing delinquencies, which is consistent with prior quarters and as a result of our early identification and treatment of problem loans.","Slide 23 outlines consumer loan delinquencies, which were up modestly in the third quarter in both the 30- and 90-day categories. This is consistent with typical seasonal patterns. Year-over-year performance continued to show a positive trend in both the 30- and 90-day categories. The black line on the left side of the slide exclude government-guaranteed loans and shows an uptick from 1.95% to 2.06% quarter-over-quarter. Residential delinquencies accounted for the majority of the increase. On the right side, you see the 90-day delinquencies rose from 32 basis points to 40 basis points. The dotted line shows the estimated impact of the third quarter $1 billion asset securitization and the fourth quarter movement of $1.3 billion of auto loans to held for sale. This estimate allows for an analysis of delinquencies on a comparable basis and shows a less pronounced increase in delinquencies and a greater pace of improvement on a year-over-year basis.","Reviewing Slide 24. The loan loss provision of $45.3 million was slightly higher than the prior quarter and was less than net charge-offs by $38.6 million. The ratio of the ACL to the nonaccrual loans remains steady at 187%, representing a very healthy coverage level. The ACL to loans is lower at 2.6% compared to 2.71% last quarter, although we believe this to be a very solid ratio given the continued improvement in the risk of the portfolio.","Overall, despite continued challenges presented by the economic environment, we remain pleased with the direction of credit quality across the portfolio and expect continued improvement in 2012. We believe that the combination of our performance metrics again puts us in a very good position relative to our peer group.","Now let me turn the presentation back to Steve.","Stephen D. Steinour","Thank you, Dan. Turning to Slide 25. As I mentioned in my opening comments, our Fair Play banking philosophy coupled with our Optimal Customer Relationship or OCR is driving accelerated new customer growth and cross-sell share of wallet. This slide recaps trends in consumer checking account households. For the full year, we grew consumer checking account households by 10.3%. Importantly, 73.5% of our households use over 4 products or services, a significant improvement from 69.4% at the end of last year. For the fourth quarter, related revenue was $231 million, down 4.1% from the prior year and $21 million lower than in Durbin -- lower than the third quarter. The decline in revenue largely reflected the impact of the Durbin Amendment and a reduction in debit card interchange fees. Slides 32 and 33 in the appendix detail these quarterly trends.","We believe what we are developing is a competitive advantage. When rates rise, and they will eventually, we believe we will have a deeply cross-sold and loyal customer base. Our market positioning is resonating strongly with customers and prospects. It's gaining a national following. MONEY Magazine recently named Huntington the best bank in the Midwest.","We're seeing similar trends in our commercial relationships as shown on Slide 26. Commercial relationship growth was also strong. After growing 4.9% in 2010, commercial relationships in 2011 grew at an 8.4% rate, a 71% increase. And at the end of the fourth quarter, 31.4% of our commercial relationships utilized 4 or more products or services, up from 24.2% a year ago, and related revenue is also increasing. Related revenue for the quarter fourth quarter was $175 million, up over 9% from a year ago. Slides 34 and 35 in the appendix provide additional details.","Now Slide 27 is our last slide and recaps our expectations for 2012. With regard to the economic environment, while we have recently seen some encouraging signs, we do not anticipate much change. It remains uncertain and the Federal Reserve's intention to maintain low interest rates through 2013 provides a significant revenue headwind for banks. In addition, consumer and business confidence remains fragile.","With regard to net interest income, we anticipate modest growth from 2011 fourth quarter levels. The momentum we are seeing in total loan growth is expected to continue as growth in low cost deposits, although the benefit from this growth is expected to be mostly offset by net interest margin pressure.","C&I loans are expected to show meaningful growth, reflecting the benefits of our strategic initiatives to expand our business and commercial lending expertise into related verticals like healthcare, asset-based lending and equipment finance in addition to our middle market lending. Commercial real estate loans are expected to continue to decline but at a slowing place as we begin to approach a level that is more in line with our overall aggregate moderate- to low-risk profile.","Residential mortgages and home equity loan growth is expected to remain modest. We continue to expect to see strong automobile loan origination although on balance sheet, growth will be muted due to the expectation of completing occasional securitizations.","Growth in low- and no-cost deposits will remain our focus. Growth in overall total deposits, however, is expected to be slightly less than growth in total loans.","Fee income is expected to show modest growth throughout 2012 from the fourth quarter level now that it fully reflects the debit card interchange impact, the last significant mandated fee reduction of which we are aware. This modest growth we expect will be driven by increased cross-sell success, growth in key activities related to customer growth, as well as an increased contribution from our capital markets activities, treasury management, insurance and brokerage business.","Noninterest expense is expected to increase slightly. While we will continue to focus on extracting further expense efficiencies, that benefit is anticipated to be partially offset by continued strategic investments, such as opening 40-plus new in-store branches this year and the cost associated with consolidating 29 traditional branches along with higher regulatory cost.","From the credit front, nonaccrual loans and net charge-offs are expected to continue to decline.","The level of provision expense, as mentioned earlier, is pretty much in line with our long-term expectations, but there could be some quarterly volatility given the uncertain and uneven nature of the economic recovery.","As we've done for the last 2 years, our focus is on continuing to execute our core strategy. We will make selective investments and initiatives to grow long-term profitability. We will also remain disciplined in our growth and pricing of loans and deposits where we believe there is still some leverage from the existing book. Our Fair Play coupled with OCR is proving to be absolutely the right strategy and market positioning for us. We'll remain focused on improving cross-sell. We believe 2012 will be another year of marked progress in positioning Huntington for better sustained long-term earnings growth and profitability.","So thank you for your interest in Huntington. Operator, we'll now take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Brian Foran with Nomura.","Brian Foran - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","I guess as I think about the guidance in the quarter, one of the concerns I hear a lot is you're making $0.14 right now, the guidance implies stable provision, maybe modest preprovision earnings growth. So maybe next year you're in that $0.60 to $0.65 range, but people kind of struggle with where the next leg of earnings growth would come from that base given that the credit story is kind of reaching a steady state, as you put it. So is it capital management that provides that next leg? Or is it just slow and steady preprovision earnings growth? Or are we kind of building a coiled spring here where maybe earnings don't grow very much for a while but you keep building the customer base and someday when rates are higher and the environment is a little bit better, the value of that embedded base you've built really starts to show through?","Donald R. Kimble","That's a long question, Brian. This is Don. I'll go ahead and take a first crack at it. I think you're hitting on one of the long-term things for us. We are building a customer base that we think will be worth much more to us and to our shareholders as the normal rate environment recovers. But more importantly than just the balance sheet aspects of it, it's the ability to cross-sell and deepen that relationship. We've been talking about OCR for a couple of years now, and we are seeing positive trends there. We do believe that, that will allow us to continue to grow our bottom line. We've faced a lot of headwinds last year, with Reg E this year, with Durbin and throughout the time period with this very low rate environment, and we think that we're just continuing to position the company to benefit from that in the long term. Stephen, do you have additional thoughts you like to add there?","Stephen D. Steinour","Yes. Brian, I think the spring analogy in a different rate environment may have some accuracy, but we're trying to provide a steady level of growth and we're conscious of the rate of investment in order to achieve that growth but intend to make what we think are prudent long-term investments as we continue.","Brian Foran - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","And just a follow-up on auto securitization environment. Is the gain on sales percentage that you generated last year -- I realize the environment can change, but as you look at the market right now, is that a good base for us to think about in terms of what the gains could be going forward? Or has anything changed in terms of the environment?","Donald R. Kimble","I think that you're right, that it will depend on the market environment. But I'd say that when we did our last securitization transactions, rates had come down dramatically prior to that time period. So that would've influenced the gain a little bit, but it's not going to be markedly different than what we showed on a proportional basis.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley.","Ken A. Zerbe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","The question I have was just on the margin a little bit. Embedded in your guidance, obviously, is higher NII but it looks like NIM compression. I totally understand, but if there -- can you quantify kind of the level of NIM compression that you're thinking about through 2012? And I guess I'm looking at Slide 11 here, and it looks like the negative aspects of the change in margin added up to about 11 basis points. Aside from what you can get on the deposit repricing side, is 11 basis points on the asset side every quarter a reasonable number?","Donald R. Kimble","Ken, as far as our guidance, we would say that generally, margin is fairly stable or within a fairly narrow range with where we are in the fourth quarter. I'd say the negative items there that you have, as far as the 11 basis points that while we are continuing to see some pressure on loan yield as the loans mature and are replaced, some of the other items that we had there as far as the hit from the investments, the liquidity and even some of the derivative impacts we've experienced over previous quarters are going to continue to be minimized compared to what we're showing here in the fourth quarter trend. And so we continue to believe the deposit rates and mix will continue to help offset those negatives or drag and allow us to maintain a fairly stable margin prospectively.","Ken A. Zerbe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","All right, that helps. And then maybe just a follow-up to Brian's question. It'll be a little more direct. Is there any reason -- what does it take to get your ROA up from 90 basis points back up to the 130? Does it simply take higher rates or better loan spreads? And if that's the case, is it then just a matter of waiting for rates to rise?","Donald R. Kimble","I don't think we're going to be dependent on just the rate environment. I think it's going to be continuing to show some positive operating leverage given the challenges we've had here as far as Reg E and Durbin and allowing some of that organic revenue growth to exceed the expense growth prospectively, and that will help drive that ROA up.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Erika Penala with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Leanne Erika Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","My first question is just a clarity on the expense guidance. If I'm backing out the gain on the debt extinguishment, I'm looking at a run rate at about $440 million, but I understand there are some debit card conversion expenses in there of $3.8 million and some branch conversion cost of $3.6 million. What is the run rate upon which we should look at higher expenses for 2012?","Donald R. Kimble","I think there are a lot of puts and takes and you've outlined most of those, Erika. And generally, that would bring it to more at the core level based on what you had talked about. Now there is seasonality in some of the trends. So as we go into the first quarter of next year, you would see the normal employer tax and other seasonal cost to hit us that would drive those expenses up. But as we've said before, from that base that you talked about, we would expect the core expenses to come down, but we will see the impact of investments resulting in a slight increase in expenses prospectively from that core base that you mentioned.","Stephen D. Steinour","And obviously, Don meant this year, not next year.","Donald R. Kimble","Okay. Good.","Leanne Erika Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And just a question on credit. We saw an uptick in resi real estate and on home equity late stage delinquencies and also an uptick in overall NPL inflows. Is that to the seasonality that was talked about during prepared remarks? Or is the consumer in your footprint really continuing to struggle and that lends to some of more conservatism in terms of your provision outlook for next year -- this year?","Daniel J. Neumeyer","Yes. So 2 things there, Erika. Obviously, on the commercial inflows, that is not seasonality. That's just kind of the choppiness of the market and as we look back over the last year, there's been some unevenness. But generally, the trends have been in the right direction. So even though inflows are elevated over what we would like to see, we still think they're going in the right direction and will continue to reduce. On the consumer side, when you really look at the trends and cut through all the numbers, it's really the residential that are off in the 90-day category and we've shown you the adjustment on the overall consumer for the securitization effect, and so the overall impact really is not as great as what it would appear. So really, I think we're doing fine in auto. Home equity's flat. But at residential, what we're really seeing is the effects of the market. There are borrower delays, the bankruptcy, filing process and the whole foreclosure timeline has been extended and that has resulted in the higher late stage delinquencies. So part of it is just seasonality, which we do see every year and will expect to see improvement in the first quarter there. But the whole timeline of the residential has been extended and that accounts for a piece of it. Now as I also mentioned, we have -- we write down to net realizable value at 150 days. So there is not additional large exposure in those numbers. And we are very much trying to manage the delinquencies on the front end. We have our collections group very active. We have our home savers group. We've established a single point of contact to make the process more efficient. So we're really tackling it on the front end. So in the big picture, we feel pretty good about where we stand and don't see any trends that are alarming. And I don't think it has anything to do with our geography, in particular, to answer your final question.","Leanne Erika Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it. And just a quick follow-up to that. We appreciate the provision guidance that you gave for 2012, but looking out beyond 2012, what benchmarks should we look at in terms of measuring what an appropriate level of provision should be? Are we looking at coverage relative to charge-offs, coverage relative to NPLs or reserve relative to loans? How should we think about on a long-term level beyond 2012?","Daniel J. Neumeyer","We look at every one of those measurements every quarter. We will see a tightening in the spread between provision and charge-offs as we reached normalized levels. But every quarter, we're just going to do our typical analysis. We look at every portfolio. We look at the economic environment. We do have improving trends but we also, as we'd just talked about, have an increasing flow of NPAs and criticized loans over and above what we would normally see. So I think our coverage ratios will remain strong. But like the ACL to loans ratio, I would expect it to be on a slow ramp downwards for the balance of the year.","Stephen D. Steinour","As you look at future periods, to answer your question, Andrea (sic) [Erika], it's likely to be more influenced by reserves to total loans as the charge-offs in NPA, NPL normalize.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin from Jefferies & Company.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Just coming back on Erika's question, just making sure we all hear it right. So expense growth this year on a full-year basis should come off of the core number for 4Q?","Donald R. Kimble","That's correct, yes.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay, okay. In the last quarter, you guys had talked about service charges growing third to fourth. If I remember correctly, they were down a few million in the fourth. I just wanted to ask you for a little color on that. Is there anything that you're changing with regards to pricing? Or is there anything changing with regards to customer behavior? Or was that just a different type of seasonality?","Donald R. Kimble","We saw a little bit less than expected customer activity on the consumer side, driving down charge-offs a little bit from our expectations. And the other thing that continues is that the commercial customer is usually -- is using those higher DDA balances that essentially pay for their transaction fees. So we're seeing pressure on the commercial service charge category as well.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. So that's -- is that economic? Or is that just a choice decision?","Donald R. Kimble","I'd say that it's both from their perspective. And in the credit rates that they would have from those higher balances, it's still fairly nominal given the low rate environment, but they just don't have a lot of other options to use with that additional cash. So this is one way for them to manage their portfolio or liquidity position.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay, I got it. All right. And then Don, I heard your point earlier about how you feel very confident on capital levels going into CCAR. And I just was wondering, I know you're not going to tell us about what you asked for specifically, but can you just remind us again at the corporate level your general preferences in terms of dividends versus buybacks and how you just approach that from a \"top of the house\" perspective?","Donald R. Kimble","We really haven't provided a whole lot of guidance there. What we have said is that we do believe that the regulators are sticking to their 30% kind of guidance for capital on cash dividend. We have said historically that even with a 30% payout, our capital ratios over time would continue to increase, and so we would have to evaluate other capital management actions. And so our first priority is to make sure that we maintain the appropriate common dividend for our shareholders but really haven't prioritized anything beyond that.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And my final one, just to wrap in all the guidance comments. Steve, I hear your point about not giving pre-pre explicit guidance, although I do think it's probably with the normalized provision, it's still the biggest point to grow from here. But do you have a general view that within the guidance that you've given that you do expect pre-pre to be on a positive track and it's within the kind of outlook? I know you're helping us on a year-over-year basis, but should we see a gradual progression upwards in preprovision from here?","Donald R. Kimble","This is Don. I'll go ahead and answer that. With our guidance, particularly in the guidance for the increased net interest income and the fee income and joining the expense trends that we've provided, it would expect or we would expect to see positive trends as far as pretax preprovision in 2012 compared to '11.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse.","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","First just on the balance sheet. I'm just wondering, has your view of holding security tier in this low rate environment all have changed for the past few months? Or should we continue to expect this portfolio to be in runoff?","Donald R. Kimble","It hasn't changed a lot. As far as the decline on period end balances that really related to some actions we're taking close to the end of the quarter that what we also did throughout the fourth quarter was to hold in our portfolio some of the 15-year fixed-rate production into our residential real estate portfolio, and that allowed us to essentially shift between those 2 different asset classes. So we do view our investment portfolio as a needed asset for us for both liquidity and for interest rate risk management. And we've continued to maintain the same type of discipline in keeping that duration of portfolio fairly short. It's right at 3 years or 3.1 years at the end of December, and that's more a reflection of the low rates to take it above the 3-year duration.","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Got it. And then just a quick one on noninterest expenses. Two of the items, outside data processing and also equipment had a pretty sharp step-up in the fourth quarter. I'm just wondering if you can help us at all in terms of the run rate for the first quarter, should we see it more flat after this big step-up? Or do you expect as your overall guidance for 2012 still a modest strip higher?","Donald R. Kimble","We really haven't provided the individual line level. What we did say, as far as some of the equipment expense related to some of the transition cost that we have in connection with the consolidation of 29 branches, that the movement there prospectively is in line with just the general statement as far as expenses being slightly up, reflecting the continued investments.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Miller with FBR Capital Markets.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Just a little different track in the numbers. I think when people talk about M&A in the regional space, they think of you guys being an acquirer, and I know that there is still a big difference in bid and ask prices. You saw banking audit backed out of the market the other day. What -- do you see some people becoming more realistic on pricing on -- for your acquiring other banks? Are you still out there looking?","Stephen D. Steinour","We are -- we remain in a posture where we're looking. There's -- so really no change. However, in terms of the sellers and we haven't -- and we don't expect necessarily anything to change. There doesn't seem to be any incremental regulatory activity or other things that may prompt to change the market here.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","And then the other question is your overall market. We've heard some of the regions where there's a lot of -- especially the bigger boys coming in and undercutting pricing and stealing market share from some of the smaller players out there. Can you go -- discuss a little bit about the competition relatively speaking for some of these commercial loans?","Donald R. Kimble","As far as the pricing on commercial loans that -- we really don't see a lot of direct competition from the bigger players in our footprint. Our focus is still primarily on the smaller end of the middle market spectrum. And so while there is some price pressure there that we've been able to maintain our pricing discipline that we have had some very good growth here in the fourth quarter for equipment finance, and that has a little bit different pricing characteristics than some of the other asset classes that we're very pleased with the credit and returns on that business we're looking as well. Dan, anything else that you'd add?","Daniel J. Neumeyer","Yes. I think, actually, we're -- of course, there is some pricing pressure but what we're -- I think we're holding our own there and I think what we're trying to be more focused. We have walked away from deals that have gotten too aggressive on the structuring end. And so -- by and large, pricing remains competitive, but we don't feel like we're losing significant business because of being undercut.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","When you say that structuring end, is that -- do you mean too many covenant light-type deals? I mean, can you elaborate on that?","Daniel J. Neumeyer","Yes, there are -- we have seen some -- just we're not comfortable on some of the multiples that are being allowed on senior debt or total debt. We are seeing some more aggressive structures there and have elected just not to participate in those.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Okay. Is that coming from the smaller players or the bigger players?","Daniel J. Neumeyer","This would be driven by the structuring ARMs of the larger players.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Mutascio from Stifel, Nicolaus.","Christopher M. Mutascio - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I'm going to beat this horse, I guess, fully dead, but I want to -- I'm trying to get a grapple with the provision expense. I realized provision to average loans, you look like you're pretty much at a historical level or more normalized level. But given very strong coverage ratios and your guidance for improved credit quality, which means those coverage ratios probably can only get stronger, I would've thought maybe your provision expense will kind of blow through to the downside, if you will, normalize provision levels for the next several quarters, maybe through 2012 before you get back to normalized levels. So I guess my question is, why now holding off on further or even in more additional reserve releases given the type of credit quality improvement you're seeing and still expecting?","Stephen D. Steinour","We're also growing the commercial book at an annualized rate that's a nice multiple GDP. And so we're just trying to be cautious and prudent and make sure we're strong in -- for the foreseeable future.","Christopher M. Mutascio - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","So is that another way of saying that you're going to -- that you can grow into the reserve to loan ratio over time because of the strong loan growth?","Daniel J. Neumeyer","I think that's an aspect of it. And obviously, we're keeping our eyes on the -- as we talked about, the NPA inflows and criticized. That is kind of a counterbalance. It makes us just remain cautious on that end. So we're trying to strike the right balance, and we do feel that portfolio is going to continue to improve in quality, but we've got our eye on some of the other metrics as well.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Scinicariello from UBS.","Stephen Scinicariello - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I just want to follow up with you, just given the strong C&I growth, 6% sequentially, just looking to get a little more color on some of the borrower profiles there. We know the overall pie isn't growing in terms of the economy. So I'm just kind of wondering where your market share is coming from and what it looks like.","Daniel J. Neumeyer","Well, we're encouraged by the fact that it's broad based. So we are seeing growth in our various geographic markets in the traditional middle market. As we mentioned earlier, we're also seeing strong growth in equipment finance and in the large corporate segment. And the one thing about the large corporate segment is that in 2011, of those new larger relationships that we added, 88% were cross sold. That's a big number for us. It's important. 75% of those loans were in our core 6 to 8 footprint. So we like where the growth is coming from. We think it's on strategy and it aligns very well with our OCR cross-sell initiatives.","Stephen Scinicariello - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Good. It's good. It's helpful. And then switching gears over onto the margin side of the equation. I noticed the benefit from shifting the deposit mix and growing those core deposits helped by about 15 bps in the quarter. I'm just kind of wondering what other levers you have to pull there with deposit costs down near 61 basis points or whatever. Do you have much more to go on the deposit repricing side or a mix shift in terms of benefit?","Donald R. Kimble","We still believe there is additional opportunity there for us to continue to drive down that cost. But even with that improvement in linked quarter, we're still higher than our peers as far as our average cost of funds or our deposit base. We believe with our focus on our transaction balances that, that will continue to drive improvement in the mix and will continue throughout next year. And we still have some CD maturities that are well above rates as well. But over the next 3 quarters, we've got roughly $4 billion of CD maturities at an average cost of north of 170 basis points. So as those come through, we should have some opportunities for us to continue to enhance that margin benefit.","Stephen Scinicariello - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And that $600 million of previously collateralized short-term borrowings to direct deposits -- or the demand deposits, what's kind of the flow trajectory of those kind of balances?","Donald R. Kimble","Generally, given that they are short term, they would -- we would expect to see some of those start to roll off over the next several quarters and haven't provided a whole lot of guidance beyond that.","Stephen D. Steinour","Just so you pick it up, it was at $600 million in the previous quarter, we identified another little plug of that.","Donald R. Kimble","$300 million plus or so.","Stephen Scinicariello - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay, okay. So is that something that we should expect to maybe ebb and flow a little bit? Or is it just kind of a one-off type thing?","Donald R. Kimble","We would expect that to decrease over the next several quarters. So they will create some challenges from quarter-to-quarter as far as the growth rates because of that impact.","Stephen Scinicariello - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Got you, got you. And just lastly, just on the -- I know the targeted efficiency ratio is kind of that mid-50s kind of range. Given all that we know, we talked about with regard to expenses and whatnot, how do you get there from kind of the mid-60s range and what's the timing on that?","Donald R. Kimble","We get there by having positive operating leverage going forward. We need to focus on making sure that we're getting the returns on the investments we've already made and allowing those revenues to grow at a faster pace than the expenses. But just this past quarter alone, the impact from Durbin to our efficiency ratio cost us about 140 basis points. So it's a big drag for us this past quarter. And so we just need to make sure that, that will allow us to continue to show the progress toward that mid-50s goal. But you're not going to see it in 2012 results, but we do want to show positive trends in that direction.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jon Arfstrom from RBC Capital.","Jon G. Arfstrom - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","A question for you on the consumer cross-sell. Obviously, I'm assuming checking and savings would probably be Products 1 and 2, but where are you moving the needle on that in terms of maybe Products 3, 4 and 5 and where the opportunity is to take that higher?","Stephen D. Steinour","We're much -- we're very focused on moving that into a different digit other than a 4 and we expect to do that in the foreseeable future. So primary products, when you buy a checking account with us, you are typically going to get a debit card. We didn't mention this earlier, but we completed our debit card conversion to MasterCard. We ended up with more cards active, higher utilization, and so that is a partial offset. But as we're growing households at a 10-ish percentage level, virtually all of them are coming with an activated debit. In addition, we try and provide some kind of savings products, savings account, money market account, sweep the balance of their liquidity. And there's a meaningful percentage that also have some form of lending opportunity for us, home equity, mortgage, something that roughly balances part of the asset liability equation a bit. In addition to that, there is an emphasis on our part to do much more with mobile and electronic channels. And our 24-Hour Grace feature of our checking account, for example, provides mobile or text alert. So there's a propensity for consumers to opt into that, and then that sets up different economics as we then distribute statements in other alerts to customers prospectively.","Jon G. Arfstrom - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","That's helpful. And then just one question on commercial real estate. It's been obviously a bit of a drag to overall loan growth, but I'm curious if you have any thoughts as to when that category might trough and what kind of opportunities you're seeing in commercial real estate?","Stephen D. Steinour","We would expect it to trough in '12 and -- we have a large core group of relationships that as they become more active or we open the spigot to allow further credit extensions, it will certainly -- will help with the amortization and other prepayment. And frankly, that's the profitable side of the equation where we're looking to build it back as we deplete the noncore side of the real estate. We are looking at becoming a bit more active in the REIT space as well. So it's principally the core customers, maybe a little supplementation with some REIT activity. That would be publicly-traded REIT.","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Sandler O'Neill.","R. Scott Siefers - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","I wanted to -- the first question was just back on the expense line and just, I guess, given how much of the profitability improvement would rely on something like higher rates, for example, to really let the value of the deposit base to go through. I mean, is there a point where just since that still could be years away, is there a point where there would be more of a focus on just dialing down the absolute level of the expense base to help to kind of bridge the gap between now and when rates do rise?","Donald R. Kimble","Scott, we continue to focus on areas where we can get additional efficiencies and that is a key area for all of our management team to make sure that we're driving going forward, but we also believe that we are going to be receiving benefits from the investments we're making. One example that continues onto 2012 is our in-store rollout with Giant Eagle. We've opened over 30 branches here in 2011, and we're to open a similar level plus in 2012. And so those investments do add to our expense base. And we've noted their longer-term focus and their investment returns for us, but we do believe that it positions the company more appropriate for future success. And so where appropriate, we'll continue to make those investments but at the same time, we're going to make sure that we're dialing down on other areas as far as the total expenses to be able to fund those types of other incremental investments for growth.","R. Scott Siefers - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay. And then the last question I have for you, Don, was on the auto loan securitizations. I was wondering if you could just talk conceptually about the other kind of things you think about. I mean, I know about the portfolio limits, but as you think about securitization, so if you -- when you do one, you get the upfront revenue gain, right, but then presumably, there's also a margin cost later on. So what are -- as you do kind of the NPV in a way, kind of keeping, I mean, portfolio versus doing a securitization, what are the things you're weighing at this point?","Donald R. Kimble","Sure. In addition to the upfront game, we do have the annual servicing income associated with that portfolio as well. But the other thing to keep in mind, too, is that as we sold our first securitization structure, we sold the residual interest, and that represents about 3% of the total balances. The implied return on that 3% was right around 12%. So compare that with the roughly 9% capital that we're going to be able -- require to maintain on our balance sheet to support those assets if we keep them on the balance sheet and the kind of returns our shareholders are going to want to see, and so we think that there is a capital efficiency to this structure and program as well.","Stephen D. Steinour","So we're grateful for your interest. We -- there are elements of opportunity that you've questioned us about. As we look back on 2011, a 10.1% ROA, an ROTE of 12.7%, substantial growth, record levels for us in households, in businesses, significant increased penetration on 4-plus products, growth in capital markets and some of the other key business lines for us, we feel we've made progress. We'll be working hard to continue that in 2012. Thanks for your interest.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call.

Steve?","Steve Steinour","Thank you for joining us today. Huntington had a great second quarter. We executed our strategies and delivered strong results. The industry is dealing with the challenging environment, but this is a quarter when many of our cylinders were firing and demonstrates how many of the investments we've made over the last several years are paying off. We reported net income of $165 million, a 9% increase from the year-ago quarter, and EPS of $0.19 per common share, or a 12% year-over-year increase. This represented a 107% return on average assets and a nearly 12.5% return on tangible common equity. Fully taxable equivalent revenue increased $33 million, or 5% year over year.","Net interest income increased $35 million, or 8% year over year, while non interest income remained relatively flat, despite the $11 million headwind in mortgage banking. Net interest income benefited from two items. Our investments in our auto and commercial segments drove a $3.8 billion, or 9% increase, in loans. And we had to add nearly $2.6 billion of incremental securities as we prepare for the upcoming Basel III Liquidity Coverage Ratio or LCR rules. The benefit of the larger balance sheet was partially offset by a 10-basis point decrease in the net interest margin.","Non interest expense increased $13 million, or $20 million less than revenue. Our efficiency ratio improved to 62.7%, and while this remains above our long-term target, we continue to focus on driving positive operating leverage. We've achieved positive operating leverage year to date and we remain committed to positive operating leverage for the full year.","I will cover OCR in more detail later in the presentation, but we continue to gain market share and share of wallet. Our robust customer growth and OCR sales process are driving long-term shareholder value.","Turning to slide 7, our credit quality continues to trend favorably. Our capital ratios remain strong. At the end of the second quarter, our tangible common equity ratio was 8.38%, down 38 basis points from a year ago, while our Tier 1 common risk-based capital ratio was 10.26%, down 45 basis points from a year ago. Both of these reductions reflect the combination of our disciplined balance sheet growth and strong capital management over the past year.","This quarter, we repurchased 12.1 million common shares at an average cost of $9.17 per share. With the common stock dividend and buybacks combined, we returned 97% of second-quarter earnings to common shareholders.","Slide 8 has a few additional first-quarter highlights. First, we announced the acquisition of 24 branches in Michigan from Bank of America early in the quarter, and within 60 days we received OCC approval for the acquisition. We are targeting a September close and conversion for this transaction.","For the second year in a row, we were recognized for having the highest customer satisfaction rating in the north central region in a JD Power survey of retail banking customers. The customers' experience is a significant differentiator in this industry and this is just the latest acknowledgment of the great job our colleagues do on a daily basis, providing best-in-class service.","We maintained our position as the number one SBA lender in the country, by the number of loans through the first nine months of the SBA's fiscal year. Small business lending is a core competency of Huntington. All of these loans are made to companies in our footprint.","Finally, we were pleased to announce the addition of Eddie Munson to our Board of Directors. The Board looks forward to tapping his knowledge, not just a 32-year accounting professional, focused on regional banks, but also a business and civic leader in Detroit and eastern Michigan.","With that, let me turn it over to Mac for a more detailed review of the numbers. Mac?","Mac McCullough","Thanks, Steve. Good morning, everyone. Slide 9 is a summary of our quarterly trends and key performance metrics. Steve already touched on several of these, so let's move on to slide 10 and drill into the underlying details.","Relative to last year's second quarter, revenue increased $33 million, or 5%, to $717 million. Spread revenues accounted for the entire increase, as net interest income increased 8% to $467 million. Average earning assets increased 12% year over year to $57.1 billion, driving net interest income growth. While we've been building the securities portfolio in preparation for the upcoming Basel III Liquidity Coverage Ratio, or LCR, loan growth drove the majority of the earning asset growth.","The net interest margin compressed 10 basis points year over year to 3.28%. Earning asset yields compressed 15 basis points year over year, including 3 basis points of compression due to the larger investment securities portfolio, offset by 4 basis points of benefit due to an interest recovery on a credit-impaired acquired commercial real estate loan. Funding costs improved by 5 basis points.","Second quarter fee income was $250 million, which represented a $2 million decline, or less than 1% from the year-ago quarter. The benefits of our robust customer acquisition were evident, as service charges on deposit accounts increased 7% year over year and electronic banking increased 13%.","Other income increased $7 million, or 25% year over year, primarily related to various commercial loan fees given the strong lending activity during the quarter, as well as fees related to our consumer and commercial credit card products. As a reminder, we introduced our commercial and consumer credit card products in the second and third quarters of 2013 respectively and we are very pleased with progress to date.","These items helped offset the continued pressure on mortgage banking income, which declined $11 million, or 33%, from the year-ago quarter, as refis continue to decline and the majority of the volume shifts to the purchase market. Non interest expense was $459 million, an increase of $13 million, or 3%, from the year-ago quarter. The largest contributor was a $9 million, or 92% increase in professional services, of which $5 million was one-time consulting expense related to strategic planning.","Outside data processing and other services and equipment expense both increased $4 million from the year-ago quarter, primarily related to technology investments to support growth initiatives. Personnel expense was down $3 million, or 1% from the year-ago quarter, as the curtailment of our pension at the end of last year more than offset the impact of increased salary expense this quarter.","Slide 11 displays the trends in our earning asset mix, net interest income and net interest margin. Average loans increased $3.7 billion, or 9% year over year. This increase included $0.5 million from the Camco acquisition. Commercial and auto remained the primary drivers of our loan growth, although we experienced growth in every portfolio except other consumer, a relatively small portfolio.","Average commercial and industrial, or C&I, loans grew 7% year over year. More than half of the increase occurred in our specialty lending verticals, all of which continue to mature and gain traction.","Business banking and our auto dealer floor plan lending were other key contributors to the growth. Also recall that approximately $600 million of C&I loans were reclassified into investment securities at the end of the fourth quarter of 2013. The auto loan portfolio grew $2.1 billion, or 39%, from the year-ago quarter as originations remain strong and we continue to portfolio all of our production. As you can see on the auto loan slide in the appendix, we did not sacrifice credit quality to drive this volume.","With respect to our auto finance business, I want to remind you that the summer months are seasonally strong. On the other hand, the auto floor plan lending side suffers during this period, as dealers liquidate the prior year's models to make room for the new model year in the fall. While our overall utilization rate ticked up modestly in the quarter, our auto floor plan loan utilization rates have been running a couple percentage points below what we would normally expect, but the strong automobile market in general has more than offset this.","Also during the second quarter, our equipment finance business achieved a notable milestone, as total assets, both loans and securities related to this business, exceeded $3 billion for the first time.","Turning to slide 12, the right side of the slide shows our deposit mix, while the left side lays out the maturity schedule of our CD book. Average core deposits increased $1.9 billion, or 4% year over year. This increase includes $0.5 billion from the Camco acquisition. For the last several years, we have focused on increasing low cost core deposits while reducing our dependence on high cost CDs.","Average demand deposits increased $0.6 billion, or 3% year over year, while average money market deposits increased to $2.6 billion, or 17%. Growth in these categories more than offset the intentional $1.3 billion, or 28%, decrease in average, core certificates of deposits.","There continues to be opportunity to drive an improvement in the mix, but as you can see over the next four quarters, we have approximately $2.2 billion of CDs maturing. This is about half the amount compared to this time last year. Another important piece of the funding mix dynamic that you do not see on this slide is the $3.6 billion year-over-year increase in short- and long-term borrowings, $2.5 billion of which was banked in holding company debt issued over the past year.","As we continue to focus on remixing our deposit base and managing our overall cost of funds, we expect to continue to be active in the debt markets.","Slide 13 shows the trends in capital. The Tier 1 common risk-based capital ratio decreased from 10.71% at June 30, 2013 to 10.26% at June 30, 2014. The decrease was due to balance sheet growth and share repurchases that were partially offset by retained earnings and the stock issued in the Camco acquisition.","During the second quarter of 2014, we repurchased 12.1 million shares of stock at an average cost of $9.17 per share. Over the past four quarters, we have repurchased 28.6 million common shares. Following the $111 million of buybacks this quarter, we have remaining capacity for $139 million of potential buybacks through the end of the 2015 first quarter under our $215 million repurchase authorization.","Slide 14 provides an overview of our credit quality trends. Credit performance remains solid and in line with our expectations. Net charge-offs fell noticeably in the quarter to 25 basis points, aided by lower consumer charge-offs, particularly in home equity and residential mortgage. Commercial charge-offs remain stable.","Loans past due greater than 90 days remain very well controlled at 30 basis points. Nonaccruals were down slightly in the quarter, while the criticized asset ratio fell modestly as well. The criticized asset ratio includes the results of the shared national credit exam and also incorporates ratings activity on a significant portion of the portfolio reviewed upon receipt of year-end financial statements as the second quarter is the most active for credit renewals and reviews.","All of these ratios are operating within our normalized targets and the allowance in associated coverage ratios remain adequate and in line with previous quarter levels.","Slide 15 shows the trend in our nonperforming assets. The chart on the left demonstrates continued improvement, albeit at a reduced rate, as we are operating within a more normalized range. We do expect some modest improvement over the upcoming quarters. The chart on the right shows the NPA inflows, which are also fairly even with the prior quarter.","Reviewing slide 16, the loan loss provision of $294.4 million was up modestly from the year-ago quarter and nearly equal to charge-offs in the second quarter. The allowance-to-loan ratio fell very modestly to 1.50% from 1.56% in the prior quarter. The ratio of allowance to nonaccrual loans ticked up slightly from 211% to 213%. The level of the allowance is adequate and appropriate and reflects the stable to improving credit trends discussed earlier, along with increasing loan volume. In summary, we had a very solid credit quarter with performance at the low end of our long-term expectations.","Let me now turn the presentation back over to Steve.","Steve Steinour","Thank you, Mac. Turning to slide 17, our fair play banking philosophy, coupled with our optimal customer relationship, or OCR disciplines, continue to drive new customer growth and improve product penetration. This slide illustrates the continued upward trend in consumer checking account households. Over the last year, consumer checking account households grew by 100,000 households, or 8%. During the second quarter, the annualized growth rate was almost 10%, illustrating that our momentum is sustained.","The strategy is not just about market share gains, but also gains in share of wallet. We continue to focus on increasing the number of products and services we provide to these customers and the corresponding revenue. Our OCR cross-sell measure of six or more products and services improved to almost 49% this quarter, up more than 200 basis points from a year ago. Our consumer checking account household revenue is up 7% year over year.","Turning to slide 18, while the chart on this slide appears to show a plateau in our acquisition of new commercial relationships over the past couple of quarters, I would remind you that we expected this to occur, as it ties directly to some changes we made in our business banking checking products, which have and will accelerate the closing of about 10,000 lower balance business checking accounts over the course of this year. Our underlying growth of new business customers remains strong. We also continue to progress in the deepening of our commercial relationships.","The percentage of commercial customers with cross-sell of four plus products or services now exceeds 41%, an improvement of approximately 500 basis points from a year ago. Our commercial relationship revenue is up 18% year over year.","Turning to slide 19, our expectations for the second half of the year remain similar to what we laid out in January, after accounting for seasonality. Our local economies continue to recover and confidence has improved among our customers, particularly business. Competition remains challenging and we've seen some moderation in the pull-through rates from pipeline to booking, but we expect continued success in commercial and auto lending to drive overall loan growth, as pipelines remain robust.","Our recent investments in specialty lending verticals continue to mature, and our commitment to middle market and small business remains a cornerstone of the Company. Auto loan origination volumes are strong, although new money yields continue to compress modestly, recently in the range of 2.9%.","We are continuing to monitor the securitization markets, as we've said before, and we'll look to use it as a tool to manage our overall concentration. We'll continue to reinvest cash flows from investment securities into LCR-compliant, high-quality liquid assets. The NIM is expected to remain under pressure, but we expect net interest income to grow as earning asset growth more than offsets the NIM compression.","Non interest income, excluding the net MSR impact, is expected to remain near the second quarter's level. This includes the previously disclosed $6 million quarterly negative impact from a change in our consumer checking products that we will implement later this month. We also expect non interest expense, excluding one-time items, will remain near the second quarter's reported level. We will continue to look for ways to reduce expenses, while not impacting our previously announced growth strategies, or our high level of customer service.","On the credit front, nonperforming assets are expected to experience continued improvement. We expect net charge-offs will remain in or below our long-term expected range of 35 to 55 basis points, while provision was below our long-term expectation during this past quarter. Both are expected to continue to experience modest changes, given their absolute low levels.","Turning to slide 20, as you can see, we're off to a solid start in terms of operating leverage for 2014, and we are committed to positive operating leverage for the full year. Year to date, adjusted total revenue is up about 3%. Adjusted expenses were up less than 1%.","We remain focused on this metric. We still have a lot of work to do over the second half of the year, but I'm pleased with our year-to-date progress.","With that, I turn it back over to Todd.","Todd Beekman","Operator, we'll now take questions. We ask, for the courtesy of your peers, each person ask only one question and one related follow up. Then if the person has additional questions, he or she can add themselves back to the queue. Thank you. Tiffany?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Your line is open. ","Erika Najarian \u2013 BofA Merrill Lynch","My first question is on your comments on expenses, Steve. You did mention at the end of your prepared remarks that you continue to look for ways to reduce expenses.","I believe you gave us a core number last quarter, excluding litigation of something around $438 million. Correct me if I'm wrong, but as we think about your revenue strength, is the better way to think about your expense levels from here and 2015 really through a reduced efficiency ratio rather than just thinking about absolute levels of expenses?","Mac McCullough","","Erika, hi, this is Mac. Thanks for the question.","We are comfortable, as we said, with taking a look at the second quarter run rate excluding one-time items and thinking about that as a base going forward. We do have a number of items that will impact the expense related to the growth initiatives around technology investments and those types of things going forward as well. We're comfortable working both sides of the equation on the efficiency ratio.","Clearly, revenue is going to be a focus. We continue to look for opportunities to become more productive as well. Generally, we're going to continue to make the right investments to grow the top line, but understand that it's important to drive operating leverage and that clearly is going to be the focus going forward.","Erika Najarian \u2013 BofA Merrill Lynch","Got it. My follow-up question, while it's not entirely related, I apologize, is just, could you give us a sense of how much \u2013 what inning we're in terms of the build of liquidity that's related to the LCR, if the rules are finalized as proposed? I just wanted to make sure that we are getting the message correctly, that earning asset growth will outpace loan growth next quarter?","Mac McCullough","","We feel like we're really well positioned for LCR. We got ahead of this late last year. If you take a look at the investment security portfolio, it's up 28% year-over-year. We've got about $100 million a month that's maturing and we're putting back into the right type of product in the investment security portfolio."," So I think to the extent we see earning asset going forward, growth, it will come in the loan portfolio. There might be modest increases in investment securities, but we do feel that we're pretty well positioned there.","Erika Najarian \u2013 BofA Merrill Lynch","Thank you for taking my questions.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Sandler O'Neill and Partners. Your line is open.","Scott Siefers \u2013 Sandler O'Neill & Partners","","Steve or Mac, I was hoping, maybe, first question is just on the BAC branches, if you could just talk to us a little bit about your accretion or dilution expectations? The reason I ask is branch deals have been near-term\/long-term story over the last few years, as there haven't been a ton of opportunities to deploy the funds, but you're seeing quite strong loan growth, right? Just wondering if there are more opportunities to deploy that? If that changes your modeling, or overall how you're thinking about the accretion and dilution over the next year or so?","Steve Steinour","","Scott, it's 24 branches, as you know, and it's deposit only. We would expect to put our lending products in literally day one. We will get to a more balanced equation over time within those branches, as we do all of our branches."," Again, it's 24, so this is not going to move the needle hugely for us as we go forward. It will be helpful, and it will be accretive.","Scott Siefers \u2013 Sandler O'Neill & Partners","","Okay, perfect. Then wanted to ask just a separate question on capital management. Just given that this was the first year you went through the CCAR specifically, as opposed to the CapPR. Just was curious, Steve, if you could go through your attitudes, particularly as it relates to the 30% dividend payout limit, just as you looked at your own ask, so to speak?","Then, Mac, I know when you were at USB, you weren't necessarily driving the CCAR, but you've been through more CCARs at another organization. So just curious how you think about things as you look to the next several months and you go through your CCAR as well?","Steve Steinour","","As we approach CCAR, I think it was third quarter of last year, Scott, we said we were going to be conservative with the ask first time through. Wanted to make sure we got through and were able to move forward. I think we were consistent with that. The timing of the dividend reflects that, as we discussed on an earlier call, the dividend increase.","It was an event we had prepared for substantially in 2012. The bar keeps moving, changing, raising. So there are always learnings from something like this and more work to do, and we're engaged with that and expect to continue to be able to manage through that process in a consistent fashion.","We will be challenging ourselves to drive with consistency over the years through CCAR and therefore, continuing to learn and invest where we need to to bolster it. Mac, what would you add from your prior perspective?","Mac McCullough","","I would say, Scott, I'm very pleased with where we are and how we came through last year's process. What I do know from my previous experience is that this is a journey and that we're going to continue to see the bar raised. I think the important thing is that we know where to focus as we think about 2015, and I think we know what we need to do. I feel very good about the progress that Huntington has made and where we are on the process.","Scott Siefers \u2013 Sandler O'Neill & Partners","","Okay. That's perfect. I appreciate all the color, guys.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Alexopoulos with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Steven Alexopoulos \u2013 JPMorgan Chase & Co.","","Maybe I could start, regarding the auto loan securitization commentary being added back to the outlook slide, are you guys thinking maybe one of these in the second half and maybe $1 billion plus? Just wanted to know your thoughts there?","Steve Steinour","","We have said now for probably a year and a half that we have a concentration limit on auto, and as we continue to grow, we don't plan, at least at this point, to change that concentration limit. That would take us to loan securitizations, one or more, in 2015. We're viewing the market now and our lending is robust. There is the possibility we could do something the second half of this year.","Steven Alexopoulos \u2013 JPMorgan Chase & Co.","","Okay.","Steve Steinour","","Although we're not planning it at the moment.","Steven Alexopoulos \u2013 JPMorgan Chase & Co.","","Got you. Somewhat related question, on the floor plan business, I know that's typically weak in the third quarter as dealers make room for the new model year. With your comments that line utilization was below the normal level, are you signaling to us that you might not see that typical seasonal decline?","Steve Steinour","","No, we'll see that, for sure. Sales have been so good in the second quarter, that seasonal decline may have even advanced a little bit in the second quarter.","Steven Alexopoulos \u2013 JPMorgan Chase & Co.","","Got it. Okay. Thank you.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Ken Zerbe \u2013 Morgan Stanley","","In terms of expenses, what's changed? I know your guidance doesn't seem like it changed. It was a little higher than what we were looking for. Your guidance, obviously, is for expenses to stay at these levels.","It seems that there's been some upward pressure on the absolute dollar expenses versus last quarter. What's driving that?","Mac McCullough","","Ken, this is Mac. Really, I don't think there's anything unusual in what's here. Obviously, we've had some one-time items related to the acquisitions, and we continue to make the investments and recognize the expense related to the historic investments. Again, I think where we're at in the second quarter represents a good run rate, thinking about removing the one-time items.","Ken Zerbe \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay. Understood. I was just thinking versus last quarter, if we had the same conversation, modest up would have put us still below where we're at, or currently. That's okay.","Then, just same thing on the guidance on net interest income. I think you were saying modestly higher. Given the very good growth this quarter in NII, does that imply that you expect a slightly more stable outlook for the second half? Just wondering how you're thinking about that?","Mac McCullough","","I think from a net interest income perspective, we will see growth. It will be driven entirely by earning asset growth, because the NIM will be under pressure. We'll continue to see repricing on the C&I book and that will be the primary source of that pressure. The earning asset growth, based on the robust pipelines that we see in C&I and continued strength in auto lending, will drive the net interest income growth offset by margin pressure.","Ken Zerbe \u2013 Morgan Stanley","That's growth from second quarter levels, not just year-over-year?","Mac McCullough","","That's from second quarter levels.","Ken Zerbe \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Perfect. Thank you.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Carcache with Nomura. Your line is open. ","Bill Carcache \u2013 Nomura Asset Management","","I was hoping that you could talk about risk adjusted margins in the auto lending business at this point in the cycle? I think you said new money yields were coming on at 2.9%, but was hoping you could give some context around how the economics of the business look when you factor in credit and funding costs?","Along those lines, I can't tell from the vintage performance data on slide 52, but was hoping you could comment on what kind of peak loss trends you're seeing in auto and whether peak losses have started to rise again? I know there's a lot there, but any flavor or color around what's happening would be great?","Mac McCullough","","It's Mac. Given our business model in the auto business, I think given the quality of our portfolio where the FICO is in that 765 range, on a credit-adjusted basis, we really are performing extremely well. You take a look at the history, even through the cycle, our losses have been stellar. If you take a look at it today with 16 basis points of net charge-offs against the yield we're receiving on that portfolio, given the environment, that's actually attractive relative to other alternatives.","So, I'm not sure we're seeing a turn in terms of quality as it relates to our portfolio on a go-forward basis. We're comfortable with the net risk-adjusted yield given the environment and our business model.","Steve Steinour","","We've been consistent with the model over the years, Bill, so that the predictability of this has been quite strong. Even though we've expanded and our volumes are up, both the proprietary model and the FICO, when we show you the FICO, give us confidence in the performance.","Bill Carcache \u2013 Nomura Asset Management","","That's very helpful. Thank you.","If I may, with a follow up, do you foresee any implications for the securitization markets as we approach the point where the Fed begins to withdraw liquidity from the system? If you could talk about what kind of impact you expect to your deposit base? That would be great.","Mac McCullough","","It's Mac. We have a very large, stable retail deposit base that we feel very comfortable with in our rising rate environment. We also have fairly low dependence on large commercial deposits, if you take a look at it from a granularity perspective.","We are looking, obviously, at different products and different opportunities that we would take advantage of in a rising rate environment. We do feel like we're positioned well, given the nature of our deposit base and the makeup of our retail versus wholesale funding.","Steve Steinour","","Bill, our strategies were launched in 2009. We've had a run of where we've been emphasizing share of wallet, deep relationships. A lot of our penetration of our customer base, involves multiple deposit related on the consumer side, like debit products. We think we've got a very sticky base.","We continue to emphasize share of wallet, and the objectives around that historically were extending the average life of deposits. We have been at it for years. We look at our larger deposits, and we are fairly unconcentrated.","We've been, in the context of LCR, shifting our deposit mix further as it relates to the collateralized deposits, to government entities and others over the last year and a half. We think we're in very good shape.","Bill Carcache \u2013 Nomura Asset Management","","Great. Thank you very much for taking my questions.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bob Ramsey with FBR Capital Markets. Your line is open. ","Bob Ramsey \u2013 FBR & Co.Quick question about the auto book. I'm just curious, is the decision to do a securitization at sometime in 2015, if not before, solely driven by the concentration limits? Or is the lower yields that you all mentioned and maybe the relative attractiveness of securitization markets, is that a factor in the thought process?","Mac McCullough","","It's Mac. This is primarily related to the concentration limits. We've been growing that portfolio very nicely.","Again, we're very pleased with the growth and the portfolio itself. Moving to securitization later this year, definitely in 2015, will be all about concentration.","Steve Steinour","","As we said a year and a half ago, we like the yield and duration on these assets comparatively, and we still do.","Bob Ramsey \u2013 FBR & Co.","Okay. Could you tell me what debt to income typically looks like on the auto loans?","Dan Neumeyer","","I don't know that I \u2013 this is Dan. I don't know that we can quote specific numbers. It is one of the factors that we use in our customs score, but I don't think we have shared specifics regarding that kind of data. It is one of the main factors that we look at in extending credit.","Bob Ramsey \u2013 FBR & Co.","Okay. Has it been relatively constant over the last couple of years?","Dan Neumeyer","","Yes, it has.","Bob Ramsey \u2013 FBR & Co.","Okay.","Steve Steinour","","Our custom also overrides FICO. So, there are 780 FICOs we don't do because of that custom score, which would give you some indication of consumer leverage and us trying to stay on the conservative side of that, Bob.","Bob Ramsey \u2013 FBR & Co.","Okay. On the auto floor plan side, I was a little surprised you mentioned that utilization rates have been running lower given just the strength in auto sales. I'm curious what you think has been driving the utilization rates down in that book?","Steve Steinour","","Just strong second quarters and inventory positioning. It's not a huge reduction for us. I think it's just an advance of the season.","Bob Ramsey \u2013 FBR & Co.","Okay. Alright. Thank you, guys.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Keith Murray with ISI. Your line is open. ","Keith Murray \u2013 ISI Group","","Just curious, sorry to beat the dead horse on auto, but does the OCC report that recently highlighted risks in the auto industry as an area of concern? Does that make you rethink the concentration limit that you guys have had in place for a while?","Dan Neumeyer","","This is Dan. Absolutely not. We've had consistent, strong performance. It's a core competency, and I think our performance in the long run speaks for itself.","Our concentration limits were set quite sometime ago. We think they are at appropriate levels, both in terms of percentage of capital and the overall mix of the loan book. No, we're comfortable with it, have been, and will remain so.","Keith Murray \u2013 ISI Group","","Thanks. On the Fair Play checking, we've seen competitors come out now with some type of free checking product, going after some small-dollar depositors. Any concern or risks on your side from competition and potentially seeing a slowdown in deposit gathering there?","Steve Steinour","","No, not really. Our consumer relationships are up 8% year-over-year and 9% link-quarter annualized. We have a first-mover advantage.","We have a very, very well recognized market-leading product with one-of-a-kind features with 24-hour grades. We think we've got plenty of running room going forward.","Keith Murray \u2013 ISI Group","","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Your line is open. ","Ken Usdin \u2013 Jefferies & Company","","Steve, to your point on the last slide about the 3% and change revenue growth against 0.5% on expense growth, is that the type of magnitude of operating leverage that you think is sustainable as you look out through the rest of this year and next year? What does it mean for the efficiency ratio?","Steve Steinour","","We haven't provided that specific guidance on that level of detail, Ken. I'm going to refrain from doing that, if you'll excuse me?","We are very focused on operating leverage and our efficiency. We will continue to be. We're not backing off of our long-term goal, and we expect to make progress.","Ken Usdin \u2013 Jefferies & Company","","Okay. The second question then, just \u2013 sorry to nitpick on the expenses, but in terms of just that explicit expense guide being flat ex one-time items, would you consider the $5 million consulting expense mentioned in the release on page 7 as a one-time item? I'm just getting \u2013 is it off of the $458.6 million or is it more off of a $453.6 million?","Mac McCullough","","Ken, this is Mac. The one-time item that we mentioned around strategic planning expense, we will see some additional pickup in the third quarter around some investment that we've made in technology, depreciation, amortization, those types of things. We could see that filling in that gap as it relates to that one-time item coming out of the second quarter.","Ken Usdin \u2013 Jefferies & Company","","Okay, so it's more just around the reported number? Because you guys didn't have an explicit item that you pointed out on page 2 like you had in the past?","Mac McCullough","","That's exactly right.","Ken Usdin \u2013 Jefferies & Company","","Okay, got it. Thanks, guys.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Terry McEvoy with Sterne Agee. Your line is open. ","Terry McEvoy \u2013 Sterne, Agee & Leach","","Just your differentiated consumer and commercial products, do they have better success in more urban markets or in some of the smaller markets you operate in? The reason I ask as, if you look at the midwest, Chicago is about three times bigger than Columbus and you're not there. Clearly, it's defined as a midwest market and I'm trying to get a better understanding whether that over the mid to longer term would represent some growth opportunities, given the products and the success you've had over the last five years?","Steve Steinour","","Terry, we've found success with this across the franchise. We don't see a noticeable difference between urban, suburban, or even rural. We're measuring our customer growth at the branch level, and it's fairly consistent over an extended period of time.","Terry McEvoy \u2013 Sterne, Agee & Leach","","Okay. As a follow-up question, the rollout of the enhanced ATMs, is that just a necessity to compete with the larger banks? Or is there something there that differentiates you from your competitors and will allow you to grow market share because of the investments you're making at that level?","Steve Steinour","","It has several benefits for us. One is it drives more efficiency through the system by having an imaged capability. As you know, we're completing, this quarter, a branch image-capture system, so our item processing will be very substantially reduced as a consequence.","It also, importantly, put us in a position to make adjustments to how we process and handle cutoff times. We will be more of an industry leader around cutoff times as we move forward post implementation.","Terry McEvoy \u2013 Sterne, Agee & Leach","","Great. Thanks, Steve.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Mutascio with KBW. Your line is open. ","Chris Mutascio \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods","","Most of my questions have been asked and answered, but I thought I would throw this out there to see if you would take the bait. The $5 million cost on the strategic planning, could you care to elaborate on what type of strategic planning that would incur?","Steve Steinour","","The essence of our plan compiled in 2009, we've been talking about it consistently over the last four years. We felt when we initiated it, it would be roughly a five-year plan.","We wanted to step back, challenge ourselves, get a third-party lens in to help us do some benchmarking, do some other things, which frankly have been very, very helpful to us, very constructive. We're in the midst of that process. The engagement has been completed. Thus, Mac was clear that the expenses were second quarter, and we have some things we'll work on that we'll talk about in the future.","Chris Mutascio \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods","","Is that something that we might hear from by end of the year heading into next year in terms of any type of new strategic focus?","Steve Steinour","","It will be something we'll communicate, if not late this year, then early next year. I would view it as enhanced execution, for sure, and maybe a few newer thoughts, but certainly not revolutionary.","Chris Mutascio \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods","","Okay. Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Chip Dixon with DISCERN. Your line is open. ","Chip Dixon \u2013 DISCERN","","Question is really on the net interest margin and getting a sense of how long it's going to take in this environment before the interest rate environment stops being a headwind for you guys? In other words, just assuming the status quo and where you are, how long before all the repricing is done and balance sheet growth will equal net interest income growth?","Mac McCullough","","Chip, it's Mac. I would say that if you take a look at the current rate environment and expectations in the marketplace, we're probably looking fourth quarter, first quarter in terms of starting to see some of that take place.","It does depend on what's happening from a competition perspective, obviously. It's competitive on the C&I market space, and we're going to continue to see repricing, but we'll also see competitive pressures impacting that margin as well.","Chip Dixon \u2013 DISCERN","","Okay. Thanks. Separately on the C&I business, why are people borrowing and how does it tell you the economy is changing?","Steve Steinour","","We've invested a lot in our capabilities in small business, our middle market, and our specialty verticals, which are substantially focused on in-region activity. There's been a consistent growth throughout Michigan, Ohio, Indiana, our footprint markets. We've been able to, obviously, take some market share along the way. We invested early in 2010 in starting to expand these capabilities as others were pulling back, so just like auto where we invested in a contrarian fashion, we got in early.","The businesses are doing well. Remember, we're in more of a manufacturing center of the country; manufacturing's doing well. There's more on-shoring than off-shoring.","We have great other factors, like low-cost gas coming into play. So, the states themselves are very well run fiscally. Multiple years of billion dollar plus or minus surpluses translating into lower taxes, so very attractive, much more competitive than they were historically.","I think we're in the early innings of that game. There are a lot of foundational elements in place here for us to continue to be able to see businesses grow and prosper. We will retain that focus and I think be a winner as the economies continue to grow in our footprint.","Chip Dixon \u2013 DISCERN","","Thank you.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of John Arfstrom with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. ","Jon Arfstrom \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","","Just a follow up on that one, at least it's not an auto question on loan growth. The question for you, Steve, is are you more optimistic on the lending outlook today than you were a quarter ago? Are you more optimistic as you look to the second half and later in the year?","Steve Steinour","","Yes. I'll expand on that a little bit, if you don't mind, John.","As we said coming into the year, we thought second half would be better than first. It was certainly in 2013, and we saw it that way.","We remain bullish. We've got robust pipelines as we come into the third quarter and a lot of good activity. We see a strengthening of confidence, generally, in the business community.","We are, I think, poised to continue to grow beyond the current level. If we continue to execute well, then we should be in position to move forward with the economy as it improves.","John Arfstrom \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","","Okay. That's helpful. Then just one follow up on the deposit service charge line. I think we all know you had the $6 million headwind coming in Q3. Is there anything else you feel you need to alter in terms of your checking account products, or is this just about it and it's going to be about account growth going forward?","Steve Steinour","","We've said before, we don't have anything else planned. There's an expectation that we will continue to be market leading in terms of consumer growth, and so I don't foresee anything that we have to do. There may be something we choose to do here or there, but I don't foresee anything that we have to do.","John Arfstrom \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Okay, all right. Thank you.","Operator","","(Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from the line of Steven Alexopoulos with JPMorgan. Your line is open. ","Steven Alexopoulos \u2013 JPMorgan Chase & Co.","","I actually had two quick follow ups. It's actually been quite a few quarters since you last did an auto securitization. If you were to do one here, what's your sense of the market and the rough gain on sale margin you would expect?","Steve Steinour","","We think the market is strong, and the gain on sale has clearly come in. I don't know if it's an equivalent $1 billion securitization of a full-in paper as 50%, 60%, 70%, somewhere in that range of what it had been. That may continue to move around a little bit, hopefully strengthens.","Steven Alexopoulos \u2013 JPMorgan Chase & Co.","","Okay. That's helpful. Just one other one.","Steve, following up on all the comments about increased confidence, can you specifically talk about what you're seeing from small business? Thanks.","Steve Steinour","","There's much more small business activity this year than we saw through the first half of 2013. The economies, the town, cities, communities that we work in, are all doing better, and some of them have been doing well for a number of years. But if you think about the important market for us like Cleveland, you've had a couple of pretty significant shots in the arm in the last few weeks. That, if anything, just continues to bolster confidence.","Again, the cities are doing better. There's a great downtown revitalization going on in Cincinnati. There's one under way in Cleveland. I'm very bullish about Detroit as it comes through this bankruptcy.","We like our geography a lot. We believe we've got an important role. We're at the cross roads of a lot of the opportunities in these important geographies for further growth. I think we're well positioned in that regard.","Steven Alexopoulos \u2013 JPMorgan Chase & Co.","","Okay. Thanks for taking my questions.","Operator","","There are no further questions in queue at this time. I would like to turn the conference back over to Steve Steinour.","Steve Steinour","","In summary, we're very pleased with our performance in the second quarter, as our strategies and execution drove strong results. There's market acceptance of our value proposition, our best-in-class service, our convenience, and our Fair Play philosophy. You can see this as we continue to gain market share and share of wallet.","We're seeing good customer activity and our local economies to recover and strengthen. It's demonstrated by our 9% average loan growth this quarter. We produced high percent revenue growth and 9% net income growth in a challenging environment. We recognized the interest rate environment and competitive pressures are not going to way overnight, so we have work yet to do to finish out the year as strongly as it's begun.","We remain committed to delivering positive operating leverage for the full year through top-line revenue growth and disciplined expense management. Finally, our Board and our Management team, we're all long-term shareholders, so we're focused on driving long-term performance.","I want to thank you for your interest in Huntington and your participation on the call today.

After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you.","I would now like to turn the call over to Mark Muth, Director of Investor Relations.","Mark Muth - Director of Investor Relations","Thank you, Carol, and welcome. I'm Mark Muth, Director of Investor Relations for Huntington. Copies of the slides we'll be reviewing can be found on our IR website at www.huntington-ir.com, or by following the Investor Relations link on www.huntington.com. This call is being recorded and will be available as a rebroadcast, starting about one hour from the close of the call.","Our presenters today are Steve Steinour, Chairman, President and CEO; and Mac McCullough, Chief Financial Officer. Dan Neumeyer, our Chief Credit Officer, will also be participating in the Q&A portion of today's call.","As noted on slide two, today's discussion, including the Q&A period, will contain forward-looking statements. Such statements are based on information and assumptions available at this time and are subject to changes, risks and uncertainties, which may cause actual results to differ materially. We assume no obligation to update such statements. For a complete discussion of risks and uncertainties, please refer to the slide and materials filed with the SEC, including our most recent forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filings.","Let's get started by turning to slide three and an overview of the financials. Mac?","Howell D. McCullough - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President","Thanks, Mark, and thanks, everyone, for joining our call today. We appreciate your interest and support. It's an exciting time for Huntington. We saw continued solid execution in the second quarter of 2016, built on the strong foundation and momentum demonstrated in the first quarter. We believe we have a good story to share with you this morning.","We have followed a contrarian path since 2009, focused on building a strong recognizable brand, differentiated product set and industry-leading customer service. While others have pulled back with a focus on cost-cutting, we invested on our franchise, built our Fair Play philosophy and our welcome culture. Second quarter results, again, provide proof that our strategies are working and that we are executing at a high level.","Turning to slide three, let's review the financial highlights of our second quarter. Huntington reported earnings per common share of $0.19, inclusive of $0.02 per share of significant items related to the costs associated with the integration of the pending FirstMerit acquisition. Tangible book value per share increased 9% to $7.29. Reported return on tangible common equity was 11%, while reported return on assets was 0.96%.","Fundamental trends were in line with our expectations. Compared to the second quarter of 2015, revenue grew by 1% despite an $8 million impact from net MSR activity and the realization of a $5 million gain on the securitization of auto loans in the second quarter of 2015.","Net interest income growth of 3% was largely responsible for reported revenue growth. We continue to believe that our ability to deliver consistent top line growth despite the challenging interest rate environment distinguishes Huntington from our peers. Non-interest expense increased $32 million or 6% year-over-year, including $21 million incurred in relation to the integration of our pending acquisition of FirstMerit. Non-interest expense adjusted for the FirstMerit integration expense increased 3% year-over-year.","Our reported efficiency ratio for the quarter was 66.1%. However, the FirstMerit integration expense increased the reported efficiency ratio by 260 basis points. While we remain above our long-term efficiency goal of 56% to 59%, improving operating efficiency continues to be the top priority for our management team. We remain confident that productivity improvements from the FirstMerit integration will significantly accelerate our ability to achieve this important financial goal.","Balance sheet growth continued to be strong. Average loans grew 8% year-over-year, while average core deposits grew 5%, marking the eighth consecutive quarter of year-over-year core deposit growth being at least 5%. Overall credit performance continues to demonstrate our commitment to an aggregate moderate to low risk profile.","Second quarter net charge-offs of 13 basis points remain well below our long-term financial target of 35 basis points to 55 basis points. Non-performing assets decreased 7% linked quarter. Tangible common equity ended the quarter at 7.96%, up 4 basis points year-over-year and 7 basis points linked quarter. And our CET1 ratio trended up 15 basis points year-over-year and 7 basis points quarter-over-quarter.","Turning to slide four, and diving in deeper to the income statement, net interest income was up 3% from the year-ago quarter, primarily reflecting strong earning asset growth of 8%, which was partially offset by 14 basis points of net interest margin compression. Non-interest income was down $11 million or 4% from a year ago, impacted by 8 million of net MSR activity and a $5 million gain on the securitization of auto loans in the second quarter of 2015.","Reflecting the strength of new household acquisition out of our OCR strategy, service charges on deposit accounts increased 8%, card and payment processing income increased 9%. Trust service revenue in the quarter was impacted by the sale of our funds and fund-servicing businesses, as well as an ongoing shift in the product mix. Non-interest expense increased $32 million or 6% from a year ago, with FirstMerit integration expense accounting for $21 million of the increase.","After adjusting for FirstMerit integration expense, non-interest expense increased 3%, primarily driven by salary expense, medical claims, and technology investments. Of note, we continue to see wage inflation, given the relatively low unemployment levels in many of our markets.","Turning to slide five, let's look at balance sheet trends. Disciplined and strong loan and lease growth continued in the second quarter, increasing 8% year-over-year. Growth was spread among many portfolios, but commercial banking and auto lending continue to lead the pack.","Auto lending increased 26% from the year-ago quarter, as production continued at record levels, while we maintained our long-standing underwriting consistency and discipline. Slides 46 to 49 in the appendix show the underwriting has not changed, and our credit performance remains superior. Our auto portfolio continues to demonstrate industry-leading performance.","Our C&I portfolio grew 8%, driven by equipment finance, dealer floor plan and corporate banking. Average securities increased 15%, primarily reflecting reinvestment of portfolio run-off into LCR-compliant securities, and to a lesser extent, growth in direct purchase municipal securities in our Commercial Banking segment. We remain above the 100% threshold for the liquidity coverage ratio. Strong growth in our loan and securities portfolio amounted to an overall 8% increase in our average earning assets from the year-ago quarter.","Moving to the right side of the slide, average total deposits increased 5% over the year-ago quarter, including a 5% increase in average core deposits. Demand deposits continue to drive growth, increasing 11% year-over-year, including a 4% increase in non-interest-bearing demand deposits, and a 28% increase in interest-bearing demand deposits. Our focus on new consumer checking, household and commercial relationship account acquisition, as well as relationship deepening continue to drive growth in demand deposits.","Average total debt increased $1.7 billion or 23% as a result of the issuance of $3.1 billion in senior debt over the past five quarters, which was partially offset by a $1.1 billion decrease in short-term borrowings. Money market deposits increased by $0.7 billion or 4% from the year-ago quarter, reflecting improved cross-sell and targeted marketing. We also continued remixing our deposit base, moving consumer deposits out of higher cost CDs into other, less expensive deposit products. As a result, average core CDs decreased $0.6 billion or 24% year-over-year.","The net interest margin was 3.06% for the second quarter, down 14 basis points from the year-ago quarter. The decrease reflected a 4 basis point decrease in earning asset yield and a 14 basis point increase in funding cost. Loan yields were only down 2 basis points year-over-year, while security yields declined 9 basis points. The increase in funding cost was almost entirely driven by the impact of the debt issuances over the past four quarters, as the cost of deposits only increased 1 basis point year-over-year.","On a linked quarter basis, the net interest margin decreased by 5 basis points, driven by a 3 basis point decrease in earning asset yield, and a 4 basis point increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities. Recall that last quarter's NIM benefited from approximately 2 basis points of interest recoveries in the commercial real estate portfolio. Though modest further NIM compression is expected to continue given the rate environment, we continue to expect net interest margin at stand-alone Huntington to remain above 3% for the remaining two quarters of 2016.","Slide seven provides an update on our asset sensitivity positioning and how we manage interest rate risks. As shown in the chart on top, our modeling for stand-alone Huntington projects that net interest income would benefit by 4.1% if interest rates were to gradually ramp 200 basis points in addition to increases already reflected in the curve \u2013 implied forward curve. This is an increase of roughly 50 basis points from a quarter ago as our asset swap book continue to mature. Though we expect additional run-off from our asset swap book in coming quarters, the portfolio is laddered and there are no cliffs moving on the horizon.","As shown on the bottom right in a hypothetical scenario without the $4.7 billion of remaining asset swaps, the estimated benefit is projected to be 5.4%, in the up 200 basis point gradual ramp scenario. The chart on the bottom of the slide shows our $4.7 billion asset swap portfolio and $6.8 billion liability swap portfolio, including their respective average remaining lives and their impact on net interest income. The incremental benefit of swaps was $19 million in the 2016 second quarter, down slightly from $21 million in the first quarter and $26 million in the year-ago quarter. 75% of the $19 million in swap benefit in the second quarter was from liability swaps with the remainder coming from asset swaps.","Turning to slide eight, we see our capital ratios which increased across the board on both the year-over-year and linked-quarter basis. Tangible common equity as of the quarter is 7.96%, up 4 basis points year-over-year, and 7 basis points linked quarter. During the quarter, we issued an additional $200 million of attractively priced fixed rate preferred equity on top of the $400 million issued late in the first quarter.","Referring to slide nine, we booked provision expense of $25 million compared to net charge-offs of $17 million. This modest reserve bill, along with the reduction in NPLs, led to a 151% NAL coverage ratio, as noted in the chart on the right. The ACL as a percentage of loans fell 1 basis point to 1.33% due to portfolio growth.","Asset quality metrics were favorable in the quarter as indicated on slide 10. NPA is still in the quarter, as new inflows were down substantially for prior periods. The criticized asset ratio was down modestly, falling 3.5% to 3.44%. New additions to criticized were offset by upgrades and pay downs. Delinquencies were also well-controlled, exhibiting continued reductions.","Let me now turn the presentation over to Steve.","Stephen D. Steinour - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Mac. I want to use the next few slides to talk about our industry-leading customer acquisition. Mac mentioned at the beginning of the call that we've taken a contrarian approach for the past several years, focusing on customer acquisition and relationship deepening through our Fair Play banking philosophy.","Slide 10 (sic) [Slide 11] shows the fruits of our labor. And as you can see, both consumer and business relationships are up substantially since 2009. Consumer households have experienced an 8% compound annual growth since 2010, while business relationships have experienced 5% compound annual growth over the same time period. We can see the relationship growth flowing through to revenue growth as business revenues have seen 9% compound annual growth since 2009, while consumer revenues are up 5% over the same period.","I want to call out particularly strong revenue growth on the consumer side over the last five quarters. We've not always seen the revenue benefit on the consumer side, but we've now overcome the headwind of the latest adjustments under our Fair Play philosophy implemented in the third quarter of 2014. And the investments in data and analytics we began in 2015 are starting to show results. We experienced 10% year-over-year growth in consumer household revenue in the second quarter of 2016, along with 5% linked quarter growth.","Now, these are very strong numbers, and we're optimistic we can build on these in coming quarters. It's not just about relationship growth, but indeed, the deepening of our existing relationships. For us, this strategy has remained consistent, since put in place in 2009, and we continue to see progress.","The next two slides show how we think about deepening relationships with our customers. As of quarter end, 52% of our consumer checking households use six or more products and services, up from 51% a year ago. On the commercial side, 47% use four of our products \u2013 or more of our products and services, up from 43% a year ago. These figures are important, and ones we monitor closely.","We believe the revenue growth is result of a deeper understanding and relationship with our customers. The fair banking philosophy starts with doing the right thing for our customers, but that's just the beginning of any single customer relationship. To achieve the full potential on both sides, we have to better understand the individual customer needs and tailor our product, services and experiences to fit those needs. So, we're not just adding new customers, we're making sure we can better serve and foster a mutually beneficial relationship with our total customer base, all of our existing relationships.","Moving to the economy. Slide 14 contains what we feel to be some of the more meaningful economic indicators for our footprint. The bottom-left chart illustrates trends in unemployment rates across our six Midwestern states. And as you can see, the majority of our footprint has shown marked improvement in unemployment rates relative to the national average. And Ohio and Michigan, in particular, remain at or near their lowest level since the early-2000s.","The chart on top and bottom right show coincident and leading economic indicators for the region. The bottom chart, which shows leading indexes for our footprint as of May shows that five states of the six states in our footprint expect positive economic growth over the next six months.","Slide 15 takes a deeper look at the trends in unemployment rates in our largest metropolitan markets. Many of the large MSAs' footprint were near 15-year lows for unemployment rate at the end of May. Ohio, Indiana and Michigan, in particular, continue to outpace overall U.S. growth since the recovery. There's additional cause for optimism here in our home footprint.","Per capita disposable personal income growth has outpaced the national average through the recovery, and continued to do so through the second quarter. Housing markets in the footprint and especially here in Ohio have shown to be far more stable than the national average.","Affordability in the Midwest is the best in the country. A higher rate in the Midwest continues to be among the highest in the nation, and over 50% of net manufacturing jobs created in the country since the recession are in Ohio, Michigan and Indiana. Three states have over 50% of the net manufacturing increase since the recession.","Despite continued market volatility and global macroeconomic uncertainty, we remain confident in the economy in our footprint. Indeed, the average consumer remains confident in our footprint economy as consumer confidence in the Midwest is near the 2002 levels. Now, we recognize the escalation of market and global volatility in recent months and the threat it can pose to business here in our footprint, but effects, so far, had been modest.","Turning to slide 16, operating leverage. The first six months through the year was slightly negative, which was consistent with our internal forecast. Recall, this is almost exactly where we were at the end of the second quarter of 2015. We delivered positive operating leverage in 2015, which was our third consecutive year of doing so. And positive operating leverage remains an annual financial goal.","So, with that, let's turn to slide 20 (sic) [slide 17] for some closing remarks and important messages. We remain focused on delivering consistent, through the cycle shareholder returns. This strategy entails reducing short-term volatility, achieving top tier performance over the long term and maintaining our aggregate to moderate risk to low risk profile throughout. Our DFAST stress loss estimates continue to reflect comparatively well, and for this year, included FirstMerit loan portfolios.","Our value proposition for both consumers and businesses continues to drive industry-leading new customer acquisition. We've successfully built a strong and recognizable consumer brand, with differentiated products and superior customer service. For the third year in a row, we were recognized for leading customer satisfaction by J.D. Power and others.","We continue to execute our strategies and refine or react when necessary. We have invested and will continue to invest in our businesses, particularly around enhanced sales management, mobile and digital technologies, data analytics and optimizing our retail distribution network. Importantly, we plan to continue to manage our expenses appropriately within our revenue outlook. We expect to grow revenue.","We expect growth within our core Midwest footprint local economies and the businesses and consumers with them. We are prudently managing certain industries or sectors potentially impacted by the market volatility and global macroeconomic uncertainty. However, we believe these risks remain well-contained. We see no evidence of near-term deterioration or problems looming on the horizon. Customer sentiment remains positive.","Pressure on our NIM will remain a modest headwind in the near term. We continue to expect the NIM for stand-alone Huntington will remain above 3% for each quarter throughout 2016. We expect to grow revenue despite this pressure, consistent to our 4% to 6% long-term financial goal, excluding significant items, net MSR activity, and the impact of FirstMerit.","We will continue to pace ongoing investments in our businesses consistent with our revenue outlook and consistent with our long-term goal of annual positive operating leverage. We continue to monitor our loan portfolio very closely. And given the absolute low level of our credit metrics and recent market and global economic volatility, we do expect some volatility in our credit metrics going forward, and as we stated last quarter, anticipate that loan loss provisions for both ourselves and the broader industry will gradually begin to return to more normalized levels.","Let me stress, we do not see any material deterioration on the horizon. We're simply moving off cyclical lows, and we'll gradually move back towards normal for both provisioning and net charge-offs. We expect our net charge-offs for the year will remain below our long-term expected range of 35 basis points to 55 basis points.","Next, we always like to include a reminder that there's a high level of alignment between the board, management, our employees, and our shareholders. The board and our colleagues are collectively the sixth largest shareholder of Huntington. We have hold-through-retirement requirements on certain shares and are appropriately focused on driving sustained long-term performance. We're highly focused on our commitment to being good stewards of shareholder capital.","Finally, before we move into the Q&A period, I'd like to tell you how pleased we are with the progress we're making with FirstMerit. We recently received sign-off from the Department of Justice for a divestiture that resolves our concentration issue, which was primarily in the Canton, Ohio market. We've identified the branch closures that will occur coincident with the branch conversion in the first quarter of next year.","We also continue to make progress in building out the organization for the combined entity. Our systems conversion planning efforts continue to progress, as our IT teams have completed all product mapping and are in the final stage of completing all data mapping. Indeed, we're coding now for the conversion. Finally, we remain confident that the transaction will close in the third quarter of 2016.","I'll now turn it back over to Mark, so we can get to your questions. Thank you.","Mark Muth - Director of Investor Relations","Thanks, Steve. Operator, we'll now take questions. We ask that as a courtesy to your peers, each person ask only one question and one related follow-up. And then if that person has additional questions, he or she can add themselves back into the queue. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And your first question today comes from Erika Najarian from Bank of America. Your line is open.","Erika P. Najarian - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Good morning.","Howell D. McCullough - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President","Good morning, Erica.","Stephen D. Steinour - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Erica.","Erika P. Najarian - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So, I apologize if you've already addressed it in the prepared remarks. There are a bunch of calls that are happening today. Very much noting that you've reiterated your goal for revenue growth and annual positive operating leverage, and I'm wondering how we should think of that $503 million core run rate as we move into the second half of the year?","And also, as we think about core Huntington ex FirstMerit for 2017, I know it's a little too early, but you do have some peers that in the face of lower for even longer did give a little bit more color on how they're thinking about expense management over the medium term. And just wanted to get your thoughts on that.","Howell D. McCullough - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President","Yeah. Hi, Erika, it's Mac. So, as you think about the expense base in the second quarter, keep in mind, we're very focused on the FirstMerit integration. We've had a lot of focus, a lot of attention going into that. We're being very disciplined in how we approach the expenditures right now. And I think, that's a good base if you think about core Huntington.","As it relates to 2017 and beyond, the focus we have on positive operating leverage, we are going to each planning year, understanding the revenue environment. And in particular, we've been planning, assuming a rate environment that's flat. And we've been building our expense base that allows us to achieve positive operating leverage.","So, we're going to continue to take that approach going forward. Also, keep in mind, we've got the cost takeouts from FirstMerit that will start to materialize in 2016 and 2017. And we're highly confident in terms of the cost takeout achievement that we put on the table.","Erika P. Najarian - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. And just a follow-up question on CCAR, clearly, a lot of ink has been written about your quantitative results. And I'm wondering if you could share any insight in terms of how that process went, and how \u2013 the Fed was thinking about the timing of the deal close and whether or not that those results are really just sort of onetime in your mind relative to the timing of when the deal was going to close.","Howell D. McCullough - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President","Yes. It's a good question, Erika. And, clearly, we don't have complete insights into what happens inside the black box. And we do think that the process is very different for a company that's going through an acquisition, if that's included in the CCAR results. But let me just point out a few things that could help reconcile the numbers from a capital perspective.","So, we knew going into this year's CCAR process that we were below our peer group in terms of CET1, probably to the tune of 120 basis points on average. And that really comes back to the fact that we were pretty aggressive in 2014 and 2015 in returning earnings to shareholders, probably 76% on average across the two years. Also, keep in mind that we did the Macquarie acquisition without issuing any capital. So, that put us in a lower starting point relative to the peers. We also disclosed on announcement of FirstMerit that we had 100 basis point impact to CET1 because of the structure of the transaction, so that impacted as well.","And then, finally, we know that as we went through a business combination in a severely adverse scenario inside the CCAR process, that it probably cost us 50 basis points to 70 basis points of CET1. So, when you reconcile all those things and consider everything but the starting position, it really is related to going through the business combination in the CCAR process.","Erika P. Najarian - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from Bob Ramsey with FBR Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Bob H. Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Hey. Good morning, guys.","Howell D. McCullough - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President","Good morning, Bob.","Bob H. Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","I just wondering if you could touch a little bit on the personnel cost. The adjusted personnel cost number was higher than we were looking for. Was there much in terms of variable comp related to the strong mortgage banking quarter in that number, or what were some of the drivers of the sequential increase in the quarter that, I guess, seasonally usually would be a little bit better?","Howell D. McCullough - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President","Yeah. Bob, there were a few things that impacted that. I think you did see merit increases come into effect in the quarter. We also had some higher comp related to mortgage, as you point out. And then we have higher healthcare costs, which I pointed out in my comments, just some higher medical expense relative to prior years. But those are the primary things that impact that. And I would say, outside of the medical costs, nothing extraordinary.","Bob H. Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Can you quantify the medical and the \u2013 maybe the variable mortgage comp?","Howell D. McCullough - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President","In the scheme of things, I think the medical might have been a couple million dollars. And the mortgage comp side, I don't really have it at my fingertips right now.","Bob H. Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Okay. Okay. Fair enough. And then it was a real strong quarter for mortgage banking. Curious just how the pipeline looks headed into the third quarter, and whether you think this is a level that we repeat in this third quarter possibly?","Howell D. McCullough - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President","Yeah. Pipelines are strong. We're seeing good purchase volume. And, of course, refi is picking up as well. So, really, really good quarter, as you point out. And, in particular, when you think about year-over-year, the $8 million MSR net impact, $6 million gain last year, $2 million loss this year. So, the outlook is good, just given where the pipeline is today.","Bob H. Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Howell D. McCullough - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President","You bet.","Operator","Your next question comes from Geoffrey Elliott, Autonomous. Your line is open.","Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research LLP","Hello. Good morning. Thank you for taking the questions. Two more CCAR-related questions. The \u2013 I guess, a question and a follow-up. But the first is you said in the presentation when you announced the FirstMerit deal that you were suspending the buyback, I think, until the deal closed? And then, no announcement, no buyback, asked for the full CCAR submission. So, why that change?","And then, secondly, just wanted to clarify on the 4Q 2016 to Q2 2015, 50% total payout. Do we now just think about that leading from 3Q 2017 to 2Q 2018 up for that shorter period? Thank you.","Howell D. McCullough - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President","Yes. Geoff, it's Mac. So, starting with the first question. Clearly, as we went through CCAR this year, the most important outcome for us was getting the FirstMerit deal through the process and getting approval for the deal itself. Of course, we're still waiting for approval, we expect that to happen in the third quarter. But we just thought it best to be a bit cautious and making sure that we got through the process, because we can create so much more value by getting FirstMerit closed early and on time relative to the buyback that we had in for 2016 CCAR process.","What I would tell you going forward is that we'll take each year as it comes. Next year is a different process. We expect to be in a different position. Not quite sure what the economic scenarios that the Fed will give to us will look like. So, don't want to comment on what the future looks like. But that's basically our thought process around this year's process.","Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research LLP","And do you expect the deal closing during 3Q?","Howell D. McCullough - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President","We still expect to get the 3Q closing.","Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research LLP","Thank you.","Howell D. McCullough - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President","You bet.","Operator","Your next question comes from Marty Mosby from Vining Sparks. Your line is open.","Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks IBG LP","Thanks. Mac, you're increasing your asset sensitivity in a time when most of the market is expecting a lot less in rate hikes. You have a lot of banks that are moving the other direction. They've been asset-sensitive throughout, anticipating what the Fed was going to do. Now that they don't have that hope anymore, they're kind of swimming, what I would call, out of the pool of pain and trying to get as much as they can before the yield curve kind of collapses on the back end on them.","You're really going in the opposite direction and creating a lot of revenue headwinds when you're looking at about $10 million from the peak of what you were getting out of the swaps. Are you still committed to do this, and do you feel like \u2013 what's the behind-the-scenes driving you in this direction?","Howell D. McCullough - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President","Yeah. Thanks, Marty. So, just a few things to think about. So, the asset sensitivity numbers that we published are a 200 basis point gradual increase scenario. If you think about where the rate curve is today and you think about a flat rate environment going forward, over the next 12 months we have maybe 1 basis point or two basis points of margin at risk. So, I'm not totally uncomfortable with that position, plus we've got the FirstMerit closing, integration, and I would say, optimization of the two balance sheets as they come together. So, we have that entire process to work through as well.","So, that's the way I'd take a look at it. We feel good about the margin and where it's at today. We still believe that we're above 3% for the remainder of the year in core Huntington. And if you take a look at FirstMerit, excluding any impact from the first accounting adjustments, it's actually additive to the margin. So, that's our perspective, Marty.","Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks IBG LP","When you're looking at issuing the debt, what are you matching that up against on the asset side? So, kind of what is the \u2013 is there a balance in securities and trying to not have any more asset sensitivity come from that initiative as well, or are you matching it against shorter-term assets that will increase your asset sensitivity?","Howell D. McCullough - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President","Yeah. It's primarily funding the securities. And that's been a bit of the pressure that we've had on the margin over the past year. Today, we're bringing securities on at probably close to 1.9%. And the next issuance that we \u2013 if we issued debt today, we'd probably be in the 210 basis points range, something like that, swap to floating.","So, you can see where some of the pressure starts to build from a margin perspective. But having said that, we're at 115% LCR right now. We feel good about where we are from a securities perspective. And really, we're just replacing and also keeping in mind the amount of debt that we need from a rating agency perspective and an FDIC perspective.","Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks IBG LP","Thanks.","Howell D. McCullough - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President","You bet. Take care.","Operator","Your next question comes from Bill Carcache from Nomura. Your line is open.","Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Thank you. Good morning.","Howell D. McCullough - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President","Hi, Bill.","Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","You guys have been \u2013 Hi. You guys have been spot on in calling for used car prices to continue to hold up, even when others have kind of taken the opposing view, and really just based on the idea that new car payments continue to exceed used car payments by increasingly larger amounts and not everyone can afford a new car payment. And that's been the right view. And as we look at the market now though, it seems like there's increasingly more controversy around whether the Manheim Index can hold up from its current levels. Can you share your updated thoughts on the sustainability of used car prices at these levels, and how important is that to the continued health of the market?","Daniel J. Neumeyer - Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer","Sure, Bill. This is Dan. We plan \u2013 one, the Manheim scale, as you suggested, it has held up. And we don't expect it to necessarily be sustained at those levels, but even when we look at a worst-case scenario, I think we have a chart in the deck that shows what the Manheim has been over the last 10 or so years, and I think it bottomed out in the 107 range briefly. And we have stressed the portfolio on our end going down to 100, which we don't think is really possible. But even at that level, the impact to us on our portfolio is about 9 basis points of charge-offs.","Keep in mind, we have a different customer base than average. So, with our prime \u2013 super-prime focus, we managed the probability of the cost. We think that we will \u2013 our portfolio will have a much lower incidence than default. And therefore, the impact of the used car value relative to the rest of the market is not as significant. So, we're very comfortable where we stand. And even if the index were to fall, we think we're very well-positioned. Again, we have a differentiated model from what an average would have.","Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Understood. Very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ken Zerbe from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you. Good morning.","Howell D. McCullough - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President","Hi. Good morning, Ken.","Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Just a quick question. Just in terms of the merger costs. Looks like I probably underestimated them this quarter. But can you just give us an estimate sort of timing of when those might come in from quarter to quarter?","Howell D. McCullough - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President","Ken, so we're still tracking, we said about $420 million when we announced the acquisition. And I would tell you that we've probably realized 75% of that in 2016, is the way I would think about it. It's going to start to tick up from here. We're, obviously, very deep into the integration process. But that's how I would think about it from a timing perspective.","Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah. Okay. That does help, actually. And then just a quick question. On the preferred stock dividends, were there any sort of unusual catch? I think it was like $19 million in total this quarter \u2013 I wouldn't have thought it would be that high, given what you issued.","Howell D. McCullough - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President","Yeah. So, there was a bit of a stub period related to the first quarter payment for the period that it was moved out, about $3 million.","Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got you. So, in an all-in basis next quarter, what should the run rate be for pref?","Howell D. McCullough - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President","It's going to be 6.25 times the $600 million is the way to think about it. So, about $70 million.","Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Perfect. Okay. Thank you.","Howell D. McCullough - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President","Thanks, Ken.","Operator","And there are no further questions in the queue at this time. I will turn the call back to Steve for closing remarks.","Stephen D. Steinour - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So, thank you. The second quarter built upon a solid foundation we laid in the first quarter. The performance continues to be solid, delivering revenue growth despite challenging headwinds. And our fundamentals remain solid, and we're well-positioned to continue to deliver through the remainder of the year.","You've heard me say this before and it remains true. Our strategies are working and our execution remains focused and strong. We expect to continue to gain market share and improved share of wallet. We expect to generate annual revenue growth, consistent with our long-term financial goals and manage our continued investments in our businesses consistent with the revenue environment and our long-term financial goal of positive operating leverage annually.","We expect modest growth in our economic footprint and continue the gradual transition to more normalized credit metrics, which will be effectively managed. We've made significant progress in our integration planning for the FirstMerit acquisition, and we look forward to completing the acquisition later this quarter, following receipt of all regulatory approvals and our customary closing conditions.","Finally, I want to close by reiterating that our board and its management team are all long-term shareholders. Our top priorities include increasing primary relationships across our business segments, managing risks, reducing volatility and driving solid, consistent, long-term performance.","So, thank you for your interest in Huntington. We appreciate you joining us today. Have a great day.","Operator","This concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect."],"11463":["Huntington Bancshares, Inc.

My name is Ruth and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Huntington Bancshares Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you.","Mark Muth, you may begin your conference.","Mark Muth - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.","Thank you, Ruth, and welcome, everyone. I'm Mark Muth, Director of Investor Relations for Huntington. Copies of the slides we will be reviewing can be found on our IR website at www.huntington-ir.com, or by following the Investor Relations link on www.huntington.com. This call is being recorded and will be available as a rebroadcast, starting about an hour from the close of the call.","Our presenters today are Steve Steinour, Chairman, President and CEO; and Mac McCullough, Chief Financial Officer. Dan Neumeyer, our Chief Credit Officer, will also be participating in the Q&A portion of the call.","As noted on slide two, today's discussion, including the Q&A period, will contain forward-looking statements. Such statements are based on information and assumptions available at this time and are subject to changes, risks and uncertainties which may cause actual results to differ materially. We assume no obligation to update such statements.

Mac?","Howell D. McCullough - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.","Thanks, Mark, and thanks to everyone for joining the call today. We appreciate your interest and support. Let me start by acknowledging that the third quarter was a bit noisy, but underneath the noise we are very pleased with the core financial performance.","As you know, the FirstMerit acquisition closed on August 16. Under the terms of the acquisition agreement, shareholders of FirstMerit received 1.72 shares of Huntington common stock and $5 in cash for each share of FirstMerit common stock. The aggregate purchase price was $3.7 billion, including $0.8 billion of cash, $2.8 billion of common stock and $0.1 billion of preferred stock. Huntington issued 284 million shares of common stock that had a total fair value of $2.8 billion based on the closing market price of $9.68 per share on August 15 of 2016.","We are extremely pleased with the progress we are making in bringing the two companies together as one. We believe the combination strengthens our company by improving efficiency, accelerating our long-term growth rate and driving a higher return profile. We are excited to have the opportunity to introduce our strong recognizable brand, differentiated product set, and industry-leading customer service in new geographies and to new customers. Integration is moving along as expected and our new colleagues are embracing our Fair Play philosophy and welcome culture.","Turning to slide three, let's review the financial highlights of our third quarter. Huntington recorded earnings per common share of $0.11, inclusive of $0.11 per share of significant items related to the FirstMerit acquisition, which also impacted the financial metrics I will highlight on this slide. Tangible book value per share decreased 6% from the year-ago quarter to $6.48 per share. Return on tangible common equity was 7% while return on assets was 0.58%. Except where noted, all comparisons to previous quarters are inclusive of FirstMerit. But I want to emphasize that core organic performance continued to meet our expectations.","Compared to the third quarter of 2015, revenue grew by 24%, with net interest income up 26% and noninterest income up 19%. Noninterest expense increased $186 million or 35% year-over-year. Noninterest expense adjusted for the year-over-year change in significant items increased $7 million or 14% year-over-year, reflecting the addition of FirstMerit, the accelerated buildout of our in-store channel last fall, and ongoing technology investments.","Our reported efficiency ratio for the quarter was 75%. However, the acquisition-related expense stemming from the FirstMerit transaction added 17 percentage points to the efficiency ratio. While revenue strength in the quarter, including mortgage banking, capital markets, and a large interest recovery, combined with a $4 million expense benefit from retiring trust preferred debt, lowered the core efficiency ratio by approximately 150 basis points, we are pleased with the progress toward achieving our long-term efficiency ratio goal of 56% to 59%.","Balance sheet growth in the third quarter showed continued organic strength, which was enhanced by the addition of FirstMerit's loan and deposit base. Average total loans grew 24% year-over-year, with growth excluding FirstMerit coming in at 8%. Average core deposits grew 22% year-over-year, with average core deposit growth excluding FirstMerit registering 3%.","Our third quarter credit performance reflects Huntington's commitment to an aggregate moderate to low risk profile. Net charge-offs of 26 basis points remain below our long-term financial target of 35 basis points to 55 basis points. Nonperforming assets improved 21 basis points to 0.72% compared with the linked quarter. Criticized assets and delinquencies have remained at a relatively tight range for the past several quarters. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio decreased 63 basis points year-over-year and 71 basis points linked quarter to 9.09%, reflecting the impact of the FirstMerit transaction.","Turning to slide four and getting more in-depth with the income statement. Net interest income was up 26% from year-ago quarter as were average earning assets, reflecting strong organic loan growth and the impact of the FirstMerit acquisition. The net interest margin for the quarter came in at 3.18%, up two basis points from the year-ago quarter and up 12 basis points on a linked quarter basis. Purchase accounting had a favorable impact of 12 basis points on the margin and we had an interest recovery in the quarter that added an additional two basis points.","Noninterest income increased $49 million or 19% from the year-ago quarter, primarily driven by the addition of FirstMerit, but also driven by strong organic growth in mortgage banking, service charges on deposit accounts and capital markets. Noninterest expense increased $186 million or 35% from a year-ago, with significant items accounting for $116 million of the increase. After adjusting for significant items, noninterest expense increased 14%, primarily reflecting the impact of bringing FirstMerit on for one-and-a-half months in the current quarter.","I want to reiterate our confidence in achieving the $255 million in total annual expense savings that we communicated when we announced the transaction. All the cost savings are identified, being executed against, and will be implemented within one year of the deal closing, with the vast majority implemented prior to or coincident with the branch and systems conversion over President's Day weekend in the first quarter of 2017. In total, we plan to consolidate 103 branches or roughly 9% of the combined post divestiture branch network.","In addition, in connection with our normal periodic review of our distribution network, we will be consolidating nine legacy Huntington branches unrelated to the FirstMerit acquisition during the first quarter of 2017.","Turning to slide five, let's review operating leverage. As you would expect, the combined entity has significant positive operating leverage through nine months. Positive operating leverage remains an important annual financial goal which we delivered on in 2013, 2014 and 2015 and, of course, we expect to deliver, again, in 2016.","Turning to slide six, let's look at balance sheet trends. Average total loans grew 24% year-over-year, with growth excluding FirstMerit coming in at 8%. As you can see from the chart on the left side of the page, the addition of FirstMerit has not had a material impact on our earning asset mix. The chart on the right side of the page illustrates how the addition of FirstMerit has increased the proportion of low cost DDA in our funding mix.","Average securities increased 32% year-over-year, primarily reflecting the addition of $7.4 billion from FirstMerit, additional investment in LCR Level 1 qualifying securities, and growth in direct purchase municipal securities in our Commercial Banking segment. Our liquidity coverage ratio was approximately 110% at quarter end. Average total debt increased $2.9 billion or 42% as a result of the issuance of $3.3 billion in senior debt over the past five quarters.","Turning to slide seven, as previously discussed, we have continued to evaluate opportunities to optimize the balance sheet. And while not affecting quarterly average balances, approximately $2.6 billion of total loans and leases comprised of $1.5 billion of auto loans, $1 billion of predominantly non-relationship C&I loans and leases and $1 billion of predominantly non-relationship CRE loans were moved to loans held-for-sale at the end of the third quarter. We are taking these actions to improve risk-weighted asset efficiency and specific to the C&I and CRE assets to free up capital that was not generating acceptable returns.","Regarding the $1.5 billion of auto loans moved to held-for-sale, our intention is to securitize these assets in the fourth quarter of 2016. Let me emphasize that we remain steadfast to our commitment to our auto finance business, including our well-established strategy which is built upon deep, long-term relationships with our core dealer customers and our focus on prime and super-prime indirect lending.","However, we are reducing our indirect auto concentration limit back down to 150% of capital, and we are adopting an operating guideline of 125% of capital. You might remember that in mid-2015, before we had an agreement in place with FirstMerit, we increased our indirect auto concentration limit to 175% of capital.","Given the larger capital base of the new combined organization, we cannot foresee any circumstance in which we would grow our indirect auto portfolio anywhere close to the 175% of capital. In addition, with the new 125% operating guideline in line, we expect to return to the securitization markets on an annual basis going forward.","Moving to slide eight. Our net interest margin was 3.18% for the third quarter, up two basis points from the year-ago quarter. This increase reflected a 10 basis point increase in earning asset yields, a two basis point increase in the benefit from noninterest bearing deposits and a 10 basis point increase in funding cost.","Loan yields improved 16 basis points year-over-year while securities yields declined to 12 basis points. The increase in funding cost was almost entirely driven by the impact of the debt issuances over the past five quarters as the cost of deposits was unchanged year-over-year.","On a linked quarter basis, the net interest margin increased by 12 basis points driven by an 11 basis point improvement in earning asset yields and a one basis point decrease in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities. Purchase accounting contributed 12 basis points to the margin in the third quarter. Adjusting for the impact of purchase accounting, the core net interest margins was 3.06% or unchanged from the prior quarter. In addition, similar to what we have seen in recent quarters, one large interest recovery added two basis points to the margin during the third quarter. Finally, as we communicated previously, core NIM will stay above 3% in every quarter of 2016.","Slide nine illustrates the impact of our capital ratios of effectively deploying capital through the acquisition of FirstMerit. Tangible common equity ended the quarter at 7.14%, down 75 basis points year-over-year and 82 basis points linked quarter. Common equity Tier 1 ended the quarter at 9.09%, down 63 basis points year-over-year and down 71 basis points sequentially.","Referring to slide 10, we booked provision expense of $64 million compared to net charge-offs of $40 million. The higher provision expense compared to the prior quarter was the result of a higher level of net charge-offs, organic loan growth and incremental reserves on the legacy FirstMerit portfolio and excess of the credit mark due to the rate mark partially offsetting the credit mark on certain portfolios.","In addition, there was approximately $10 million of incremental loan loss provision expense in the third quarter associated with the previously discussed movement of loans held-for-sale. Net charge-offs, while higher, represented an annualized 26 basis points of average loans and leases, which remains below our long-term target of 35 basis points to 55 basis points.","The allowance for credit losses as a percentage of loans decreased to 1.06%, reflecting the addition of the FirstMerit loan portfolio to the denominator, without additional reserves being added to the numerator due to the credit mark applied through the purchase accounting process. The nonaccrual loan coverage ratio increased to 174% as a result of the continued decline in nonaccrual loans.","On slide 11, the asset quality metrics remain favorable in the quarter as indicated. The nonperforming asset ratio increased further, reaching its lowest level in two years at 0.72%. The criticized asset ratio increased modestly to 3.54% but has remained in the 3.5% range for the past several quarters. Delinquencies were also well controlled, having remained relatively flat for the past six quarters.","Let me now turn the presentation over to Steve.","Stephen D. Steinour - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.","Thanks, Mac. Normally, at this point in our quarterly discussion, I would provide you with an update on our Optimal Customer Relationship or OCR strategy. However, we've removed those slides from the presentation this quarter, given the recent addition of FirstMerit and our inability to produce similar data for legacy FirstMerit customers.","We believe providing OCR data for just legacy Huntington customers will not provide you with the complete picture. Let me assure you, though, that we remain fully committed to our Fair Play philosophy and OCR strategy, which is built upon the simple thesis of putting customers first, looking after their needs, and doing the right thing will result in more substantial, long-term customer relationships.","Now, for years, we've focused on customer acquisition and relationship deepening with our Fair Play banking philosophy and our OCR strategy. While this was considered a contrarian approach when we started these actions back in 2009 and 2010, the results paint a picture of resounding success. And I want to stress that we are not just seeking relationship growth but, indeed, are looking to deepen existing relationships.","Our OCR strategy is also built upon the fundamental belief that we are here to understand and serve our customers' needs. The Fair Play banking philosophy starts with doing the right thing for our customers with products and services that are simple, clear and fair. We couple that with a customer experience designed to fit their needs, not ours. For us, the strategy has remained consistent since it was put in place in 2010 and it continues to bear fruit.","In light of the recent headlines, some of you have asked about our sales and incentive compensation practices and complaint management, particularly with respect to our OCR strategy. The focus of our OCR model is on building, deep, trusted and lasting relationships. And this is achieved by getting to know our customers, understanding their needs and helping them meet their financial needs with the appropriate products and services.","Further, Huntington is a company built upon a distinguished legacy of superior customer service. Our Fair Play philosophy and welcome culture are built upon the premise and promise of doing the right thing for our customers. As you'd expect, given the investor, media and regulatory interest in this matter, we've undertaken a detailed review of our practices, policies and procedures for any signs of misalignment of incentives or other areas of risk or concern.","While the review is ongoing, to-date, we've not uncovered any systemic, cultural or operational areas of concern. We will likely refine some of our monitoring, but we do not anticipate any material changes to our practices or procedures and certainly not to our overall OCR strategy.","Moving to the economy, slide 12 contains what we feel to be some of the more meaningful economic indicators for our footprint. The bottom left chart illustrates trends in the unemployment rates across our now eight core Midwestern states. As you can see, the majority of our footprint remains at or below the national unemployment rates relative to the national average with Ohio, Michigan, Indiana and Wisconsin particularly showing resilience this past quarter.","Charts on the top and bottom right show coincident and leading economic indicators for the region. The bottom chart, which shows leading indexes for our footprint as of August, show that all eight states in our footprint expect positive economic growth over the next six months.","Slide 13 focuses on trends and unemployment rates in our largest metropolitan areas, and many of the large MSAs in the footprint remain at or near 15-year lows for unemployment, at the end of August. Also notable, 11 of the top 15 MSAs experienced declining unemployment rates in the last three months. The auto industry is still strong and is a major economic contributor within our footprint, but the housing markets are also strong.","Labor market in our footprint has proven to be strong in 2016 with several markets such as here in Columbus, where we are at structural full employment. We are seeing wage inflation in our expense base and our customers are too. State and local governments continue to operate with surpluses. Ohio, Indiana and Michigan continue to outpace overall U.S. growth, since the recovery. We remain confident in our footprint Midwest economies, based on the sustained job growth and economic production since the recovery that began after The Great Recession.","Turning to slide 14, I'd like to give you some closing remarks and important messages. We remain focused on delivering consistent, through the cycle, shareholder returns. The strategy entails reducing short-term volatility, achieving top tier performance over the long-term, and maintaining our aggregate moderate to low risk profile throughout. As you heard Mac mention earlier, the acquisition and integration of FirstMerit provides what we believe is an opportunity to achieve significant cost savings and improve our overall efficiency.","We're committed to and progressing as planned toward realizing our targeted $255 million of annual cost savings from the acquisition. We continue to win new customers through a strong and recognizable consumer brand with differentiated products and superior customer service. The new customers and dynamic markets offers, from the FirstMerit acquisition, provide a deeper and more vibrant pool to deliver our value proposition and add customers and deepen relationships.","We have invested and will continue to invest in our businesses, particularly around enhanced sales management, mobile and digital technologies, data analytics and optimizing our retail distribution network. Importantly, we plan to continue to manage our expenses appropriately within our revenue outlook.","We always like to include a reminder that there is a high level of alignment between the board, management, our employees and our shareholders. The board and our colleagues are collectively among the largest shareholders of Huntington. We uphold the retirement requirements on certain shares and are appropriately focused on driving sustained long-term performance. We're highly focused on our commitment to being good stewards of shareholder capital.","Looking forward to full year 2016 results, excluding the impact of significant items, we expect total revenues to increase 16% to 18% and noninterest expenses to increase 13% to 15%. We expect to deliver positive operating leverage for the fourth consecutive year. We expect the asset quality metrics to remain near current levels, including net charge-offs remaining below our long-term target of 35 basis points to 55 basis points. And consistent with our historical practice, we anticipate we'll provide initial expectations for 2017 at an investor conference later this quarter.","Finally, we are very pleased with the smooth integration process with FirstMerit, which we acquired on August 16. The divestiture of 13 branches, primarily in the Canton, Ohio market will occur this quarter. We've completed the onboarding and initial training of our new colleagues and fully implemented the organizational changes for the combined entity that we announced last summer.","103 branch consolidations will occur coincident with the branch conversion in February of 2017. Our systems conversion planning efforts continue to progress, as our IT teams have completed all product and data mapping and are now managing system testing and preparing for mock conversions.","So now, I'll turn it back over to Mark, so we can get to your questions. Thank you.","Mark Muth - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.","Operator, we will now take questions. We ask that as a courtesy to your peers, each person ask only one question and one related follow-up. And then, if that person has additional questions, he or she can add themselves back into the queue. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Scott Siefers. Please state your firm. Your line is open.","R. Scott Siefers - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Good morning, guys.","Stephen D. Steinour - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.","Good morning, Scott.","Howell D. McCullough - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.","Hi, Scott.","R. Scott Siefers - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Hey. A quick question on the provision. Mac, I appreciate the color on the roughly $10 million or so of provision that might have been kind of unusual related to the move of loans for held-for-sale. But, I was hoping you might be able to give just a little more color on rationale behind such an elevated provision. And kind of whether or not, I guess, (24:13) to exclude the $10 million going forward if something in the $55 million range represents kind of a new customer elevated run rate, that has been the case more recently. So just, I guess, really any color that you can provide, please.","Daniel J. Neumeyer - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.","Sure. Scott, this is Dan. So, there's a couple of things going on in the quarter. First, we did have higher charge-offs than what we have been experiencing although still below our long-term expectations. So, replenishing the $40 million of charge-offs was one piece of that.","Second, as you've already noted, we had the movement of loans to held-for-sale. We also had the organic originations from FirstMerit post-closing. So, the new loans that are generated have allowance associated with them. And then, we did have a portfolio where we had a positive rate mark that offset the credit mark. So, it's recorded at a premium. So, we have allowance build there.","So, I wouldn't say that this is a situation where this is the new normal. I think, this was a bit of an outlier and I think on a go-forward basis, we will have provision expense that is more in line with charge-offs and with an allowance for some growth.","I also would note that, in the quarter, charge-offs were up partially due to the fact that we had lower recoveries in the C&I portfolio. That added about $5 million of additional charge-off over what we have been experiencing. So, we had quite a number of factors that would have resulted in the higher provision this quarter.","Howell D. McCullough - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.","And, Scott, I think this is where we see the volatility that we've been talking about in terms of charge-offs because of the low levels that we're running at. As Dan mentioned, it's a credit or two on the commercial side without the recoveries to offset that. So, clearly, the volatility is as we expected. And I would say that there's probably about $12 million that Dan mentioned associated with the loans held-for-sale and kind of the date to FirstMerit provision for the portfolios that he mentioned that had higher interest marks.","Stephen D. Steinour - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.","And, Scott, just one other comment. I think just as you're looking at it go-forward, the asset quality metrics in terms of the criticized, we had a reduction in nonaccruals, et cetera. So, very steady delinquencies. So there's nothing out there that would indicate that we expect a turn here, so, just in terms of you thinking about provisioning going forward.","R. Scott Siefers - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Yeah. Okay. That's good color. Thank you guys very much.","Howell D. McCullough - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.","Thanks, Scott.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bob Ramsey. Please state your firm. Your line is open.","Bob H. Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Hey. Good morning, guys. With FBR. I wanted to touch base on net interest margin. Is the 11 basis points some sort of one-time thing from accelerated pay-offs on acquired loans or is this more the level that we'll just gradually amortize lower over time? And then maybe could you sort of tell us what the margin was in the month of September, so we can think about a starting point headed into the fourth quarter?","Howell D. McCullough - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.","So, Bob, I would think about that core margin as being 3.04% \u2013 3.06% absent of purchase accounting impact and it's two basis points for the interest recovery that we had in the quarter that added two basis points to it. There probably was about $4 million or $5 million in the quarter related to accelerated accretion for early pay-offs and those types of things.","But, I think, thinking about the rest of it from a purchase accounting perspective and thinking about projecting that forward would be the right way to think about it. We are comfortable with the core margin staying above 3% for the remainder of the year. And I think it's also important to note that, on a core basis, FirstMerit was accretive to the core margin simply because of asset mix and the fact that they brought more DDA to the funding mix as well.","Bob H. Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Okay. And I guess, given the full quarter impact next quarter, so should we really be thinking about something above the 3.04% on a core basis? And do you know sort of what the core was, I guess, at the end of the quarter as we head into the fourth?","Howell D. McCullough - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.","Yeah. I think 3.04% is the right way to think about the core. The purchase accounting piece is a bit difficult because of what could happen from an accelerated accretion perspective, but I think you're pretty safe thinking about that core of 3.04%.","Bob H. Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Howell D. McCullough - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.","Thanks, Bob.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Alexopoulos. Your line is open. Please state your firm.","Steven Alexopoulos - JPMorgan Securities LLC","JPMorgan. Hey. Good morning, everybody.","Howell D. McCullough - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.","Hey, Steven.","Steven Alexopoulos - JPMorgan Securities LLC","I wanted to first follow-up on Steve's comments regarding the customer acquisition and cross-sell strategies being under review. Do you guys currently use sales orders in the incentive comp calculation for branches, frontline folks? And do you think you'll need to more broadly change the incentive systems?","Stephen D. Steinour - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.","We don't anticipate any meaningful change in incentive systems. There are certain things that we measure top of the house that are not pushed down at the account level, so \u2013 or at the officer level. So, that would include \u2013 we focus our branches and officers on revenue, not product-specific or product required sales, Steven. So, we don't anticipate any meaningful change on the incentive plans from where we are now. And I do think we'll put more sort of oversight and analysis in, but we've already been doing a fair amount of that.","Steven Alexopoulos - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And then, maybe a follow-up. A lot of moving pieces to the loan balances in the quarter. Can you give us a sense of what organic loan growth looked like in the quarter if we just think about Huntington on its own, maybe adjusting out some of the movements in the held-for-sale?","Howell D. McCullough - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.","Yes. So, Steven, it'd be about 8% year-over-year, and it would be the categories that we've talked about previously that were driving the growth. It's indirect auto, its equipment financing, at least, on the Huntington side. I think we continue to see good pipelines on the commercial side of the business. And, I think, resi probably had some growth in the quarter as well. So, those were the categories that have been good for us this year. And the 8% is not out of balance, maybe a little bit higher than where we've been so far quarter-by-quarter this year.","Stephen D. Steinour - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.","Pipelines look strong at this point as we go into the fourth quarter in those categories, Steven, as well.","Steven Alexopoulos - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Perfect. Thanks for the color.","Howell D. McCullough - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin. Please state your firm. Your line is open.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC","Thanks. Good morning. Ken from Jefferies.","Howell D. McCullough - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.","Hi, Ken.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC","Mac, I was wondering if you could walk us a little bit through the landing point for the balance sheet, meaning that it looks like you've got a whole bunch of pending and future loan sales. You got the divestitures. You've got core growth going on. And so, where do you see kind of pro forma ending up maybe as a fourth quarter start point, just so we can understand once you've moved through some of this additional clean-up underneath as a base.","Howell D. McCullough - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.","Yeah. Let's see if there might be a page we can direct you to in the deck. I mean, if you take a look at page 30 of the slide deck, might be the best place to look. It's September 30 balance sheet. It's on the asset side. And you can see that total commercial loans sort of about $35 billion at a spot basis, consumer about $31.4 billion and total loans and leases are about $66 billion.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC","Right. So, with the pending sales, though, does that \u2013 that's in the loans or in \u2013 already moved to the held-for-sale, right? So, period-end, we should think about that whole loans for-sale bucket going away and then you use the what's left kind of as the new base for loans?","Howell D. McCullough - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.","Exactly. So, you can see loans held-for-sale about four or five lines down there at $3.4 billion.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC","Yes.","Howell D. McCullough - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.","So, those were already taken out.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC","Yes. Okay.","Howell D. McCullough - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.","So, those are actually \u2013 yes. Go ahead.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC","No. That's fine. Then, just in terms of just your \u2013 the rest of liquidity and any changes to your funding mix going forward? What do you \u2013 do you anticipate continuing to build the securities book or is that now on a pro forma basis also in the right zone?","Howell D. McCullough - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.","The securities book will go up a bit from here, because we are going to replace the auto loans with zero weighted risk-weighted assets. So, think about maybe another $2 billion or so in securities. So, that will come on, some others have already come on, some will come on in the fourth quarter as well.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC","Okay.","Howell D. McCullough - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.","From a funding perspective, for the other loans that we're going to sell, we're going to pay down funding sources.","Howell D. McCullough - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.","Well, I wouldn't see any material change in the way we're going to fund the balance sheet.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Thank you guys.","Stephen D. Steinour - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.","Ken, some of the puts and takes on the restructuring are on slide seven, the optimization.","Howell D. McCullough - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.","Is that good, Ken? Did we gave you what you need?","Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC","Yeah. I think so. Yeah. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zerbe. Your line is open.","Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks. Morning.","Howell D. McCullough - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.","Hi, Ken.","Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Just have a question on the auto side. Obviously, you reduced the concentration limits. You guys want to hold. You want to do more securitizations. How much of that relates to the environment that we're in for auto? Like are you seeing any deterioration in the broader industry auto credit that's leaving you to get more conservative? Thanks.","Daniel J. Neumeyer - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.","Hey, Ken, this is Dan. We've commented on the past that we observe what's going on in the marketplace, but it really doesn't impact our business model or our performance. So we have not changed our view on the auto portfolio at all. And as we referenced in the slides, we continue to show our history of performance in originations. Haven't moved off that. We don't have a change in our go-forward view of what we believe we're going to experience. So, while there may be activities going out in the market that are of concern, because of our prime, super-prime focus, because of our strong origination scores, absence of risk layering, we have not changed our view at all with regard to the quality of the portfolio.","Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. Okay. No, that helps. And then, just to be clear on the comment you guys made, if I understood the prepared remarks correctly, I thought I heard you said that you're reducing the limit to the $150 million because sort of \"you can't originate enough to get you up to $175 million.\" Did I \u2013 I just want to make sure I fully understand the rationale of why your limits are going down. Thanks.","Howell D. McCullough - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.","So, yes. So, the $175 million was put in place before we had an agreement with FirstMerit. So, it was put in place on a smaller capital base and we define capital as Tier 1 capital plus the allowance. So, there really wasn't an ability for us to get to the $175 million. We're not going to be a national player in auto. We like the geography that we're in. We like the business model that we have in place. We're not going to change the underwriting or the risk profile. And, quite frankly, as we bring on FirstMerit, we have other opportunities to invest capital at higher returns.","So that's primarily why we did it. We've always been at $150 million historically, and we just feel that operating at $125 million gives us flexibility to perhaps go over $125 million from a timing perspective, if we're getting the securitization done. And if we don't like the market conditions, we can hold this above $125 million until we like the market conditions. So, that's the way we're thinking about it.","Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","All right. Great. Thank you.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time.","Stephen D. Steinour - Huntington Bancshares, Inc.","Okay. The third quarter was highlighted by the closing of FirstMerit acquisition and our continued strong financial performance. With sound fundamentals in place, we're well-positioned for solid performance in the coming quarters. And our strategies are working. Our execution remains focused and strong. We expect to continue to gain market share and improve share of wallet.","The addition of FirstMerit's solid balance sheet, strong credit performance, valuable customer base and dynamic new markets provide opportunity to further augment or accelerate the achievement of our long-term financial goals.","Finally, I want to close by reiterating that our board and this management team are all long-term shareholders. Our top priority is integrating FirstMerit and growing our core business while managing risks, reducing volatility and driving solid, consistent long-term performance.","So, thank you for your interest in Huntington.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions)","Thank you. Mr. Todd Beekman, you may begin your conference.","Todd Beekman","Thank you, Tracy and welcome. This is Todd Beekman, Director of Investor Relations for Huntington. Copies of the slides that we\u2019ll be reviewing can be found on our IR website at www.huntington-ir.com. And this call is being recorded, and will be available for rebroadcast about an hour after the close of the call.","Slides 2 and 3 note several aspects of basis of presentation. I encourage you to read these. Let me point out one key disclosure. This presentation will reference non-GAAP financial measures, and in that regard, I would direct you to the comparable GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation to those comparable financial measures within the presentation, and additionally, earnings-related material can be found this morning and in Form 8-K filed today, all which can be found on our website.","Turning to Slide 4, today\u2019s discussion, including the Q&A may contain forward-looking statements. Such statements are based on information and assumptions available at this time and are subject to change risk and uncertainties, which may cause results to differ materially. We assume no obligation to update such statements. For a complete discussion of risks and uncertainties, please refer to this slide, the material we filed with the SEC, including our most recent forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filings.","Now turning to today\u2019s presentation. As noted on Slide 5, the presenters today are: Steve Steinour, Chairman, President and CEO; Dave Anderson, Executive Vice President and Controller; Dan Neumeyer, our Chief Credit Officer, who will also be participating in the Q&A portion of our call and Mac McCullough who has recently joined us as our CFO, is here with us today. So let\u2019s get started. Dave?","David S. Anderson","Turning to Slide 6, Huntington had a good first quarter. We reported net income of $149 million or $0.17 per share. This resulted in a 1.01% return on average assets and in 11.3% return on average tangible common equity. We also achieved positive operating leverage and continue to be committed to having positive operating leverage for the full year. There were two significant items recorded in the first quarter that I will cover when I discuss noninterest expense.","Fully-tax equivalent net interest income was $443 million, an increase of $13 million or 3% from the year-ago quarter. This increase was due to a larger balance sheet partially offset by a decrease in the net interest margin. Average loans grew by $2.6 billion or 6%. Commercial and industrial loans grew by 4%, auto loans grew by 40% and residential mortgage loans grew by 8%.","One item to note is that average commercial and industrial loan growth was negatively impacted by the $600 million reclassification that we made from loans to investment securities at the end of 2013. Average investment security balances grew $1.9 billion or 20%, as we prepare for the new Basel III liquidity coverage requirements.","The net interest margin for the quarter was 3.27%, a decrease of 15 basis points from the year-ago quarter. The 15 basis point decrease resulted from a change in mix and yield of our earning assets, partially offset by lower funding costs.","Noninterest income was $248 million, a decrease of $8 million or 3% from the year-ago quarter. Mortgage banking income decreased by $22 million, or 49%. The year-ago quarter also included a $9 million gain on sale of low income housing tax credit investments, partially offsetting these items were higher security gains, service charges on deposit accounts and electronic banking fees.","Security gains for the quarter were $17 million. In preparation for the January 2015, LCR requirements, we sold securities that were not qualified for liquidity coverage and reinvested into high quality liquid assets. The securities we sold had a fairly short remaining life, nearly all had a duration of less than two years and we would have seen more than 70% of this quarter\u2019s gains, flow through its net interest income by the end of this year.","Service charges on deposits increased $4 million, and electronic banking fees increased $3 million over the year-ago quarter. Noninterest expense was $460 million, an increase of $17 million or 4% from the year-ago quarter. The increase resulted from $22 million of significant items. Significant items in the quarter were $13 million of one-time merger-related expenses for the Camco acquisition and a $9 million increase in litigation reserves. Steve will cover OCR later in the presentation.","Turning to Slide 7, I will cover credit trends later in the presentation. the provision expense was $25 million, a decrease of $5 million or 17% from the year-ago quarter due to improvement in our credit quality. Capital continues to be strong. at the end of the quarter, our tangible common equity ratio was 8.63%, down 28 basis points from the year ago and our Tier 1 common risk-based capital ratio at 10.63% was close to the year-ago levels.","Slide 8 has a few additional first quarter highlights. First, Mac McCullough joined Huntington as our new CFO. Steve will provide a fuller introduction in a few minutes. Second, we closed and successfully converted the Camco acquisition. Third, last week we announced the acquisition of 11 branches in Michigan from Bank of America. We also received a no objection from the Federal Reserve for our proposed capital actions under CCAR.","Side 9 is a summary of our quarterly earnings trends and key performance metrics. Slide 10 is a summary of the notable items that impact a comparison of the current quarter with the year-ago quarter. I covered most of these items in my previous comments.","Slide 11 displays the trends in our net interest income and margin. Net interest income increased $13 million from the year-ago quarter. The net interest margin decreased 15 basis points due to a 22 basis point change from the mix in yield of our earning assets, partially offset by a 7 basis point reduction in funding costs. Having to add so many high quality liquid assets hurt the margin, but the larger pressure remains the competitive environment and fixed-rate loans renewing at current market yields.","The right side of Slide 12 shows our deposit mix. On the left side of this slide, you will see the maturity schedule of our CD book, which represents a potential opportunity to continue to lower deposit costs as about $2.3 billion of CDs are maturing in the next 12 months at an average rate of 78 basis points and new CDs are currently coming out between 30 and 40 basis points.","Slide 13 shows the trends in capital. The Tier 1 common risk-based capital ratio decreased from 10.90% at December 31, 2013 to 10.63% at March 31, 2014. The decrease was due to balance sheet growth and share repurchases. They were partially offset by retained earnings and the stock issued in the Camco acquisition.","During the first quarter of 2014, we repurchased 14.6 million shares of stock at an average price of $9.32. This completed the repurchase of $227 million of stock over the last four quarters. Yesterday, our Board authorized a new repurchase of up to $250 million of stock over the next four quarters that we\u2019ve included as part of our most recent capital plan.","Slide 14 provides an overview of our credit quality trends. Credit quality continues to show steady improvement and is in line with our expectation. Net charge-offs fell to 40 basis points well within our long-term target of 35 to 55 basis points.","Loans past due greater than 90 days remain very well controlled at 22 basis points and have been at a similar level over the last year. The nonaccrual loan ratio fell very slightly, while the nonperforming asset ratio experienced a modest increase due to the addition of $12 million of nonperforming assets from Camco. The criticized asset ratio continued to fall as the quarter saw a reduction from 4.49% to 3.78%.","Slide 15 shows the trends in our nonperforming assets. The chart on the left demonstrates a slowly reducing trend in nonperforming assets with the flattening exhibited this quarter due to the addition of Camco\u2019s nonperforming assets. The chart on the right shows the nonperforming asset inflows, which were still even with the prior quarter. As we are operating within a normalized level of nonperforming assets, Q2 reductions will continue to be modest although some improvement is still likely.","Reviewing Slide 16, the loan loss provision of $25 million was relatively unchanged from the prior quarter that was $18 million less than net charge-offs of $43 million. Overall asset quality improvement resulted in a reduction in the ACL for loan ratio from 1.65% last quarter to 1.56%. The ratio of ACL to nonaccrual loans fell modestly from 221% to 211%. We believe these coverage levels remain adequate and appropriate.","In summary, we had a solid credit quarter and are pleased with the results. We remain focused on quality and are disciplined in our new business originations in adverse competitive environment. With regard to our credit metrics, we anticipate modest overall improvement with a possibility of some continued quarter-to-quarter volatility.","Let me turn the presentation over to Steve.","Stephen D. Steinour","Thank you, Dave. Our Fair Play banking philosophy coupled with our Optimal Customer Relationship or OCR continues to drive new customer growth and increases in product penetration. This slide recaps the continued upward trend in consumer checking. This is Slide 17. Over the last year, consumer checking account households grew by 94,000 households or 7%.","In the last quarter, the annualized growth rate was over 10%, but about a third of those households were from the Camco transaction that closed in March. The mid-to-high single-digit pace remains in line with the expectations we set nearly four years ago.","Over this last year, we\u2019ve continued to focus on increase in the number of products and services we provide to those customers and the corresponding revenue. The charts that you\u2019re accustomed to see are in the appendix that the broader takeaway is that the strategy continues to drive in new customers and we are establishing deeper relationships.","Turning to Slide 18, the new commercial relationships over the last, the net new growth was 2.6% as there are 4,000 new commercial customers banking with Huntington. You\u2019ll see that the last quarter had very limited growth and that tie directly to some changes that we\u2019ve made in our business banking checking products, which accelerated the closing of lower balance business checking accounts and we expect some additional closings throughout the remainder of the year.","Our underlying growth with new business customers is strong. The customers that remain with Huntington have deeper relationships, the percentage of commercial customers with four plus products and services increased by 2% since December of last year.","Turning to Slide 19, in expectations, our expectations for the remainder of the year are similar to what we laid out in January. We changed a few words to account for some of the seasonal noise in the first quarter fee income. And second quarter expenses. But overall, our view of 2014 hasn\u2019t changed.","Customers in particular businesses are feeling better than they did a year ago. Competition continues to be tough and we\u2019ve continued to selectively reduce large corporate portfolio, but our middle market especially verticals and auto lending businesses continue to see solid growth and strong pipelines. Auto loan originations volume remains good and had attractive yield of around 3%, the rest of the loan portfolio is expected to grow modestly and investment securities will continue to be rolled in the OCR compliant high liquidity assets.","NIMs expected to be under continued pressure, but we expect net interest income to grow. Noninterest income excluding the net MSR impact and security gains is expected to be slightly lower than the seasonally low first quarter. As we commented on in January, we continue to refine our consumer checking products and in July, we\u2019ll make a change that we expect to negatively impact fee income by around $6 million per quarter. This approximate impact was in our previous expectations. Now putting these two items together, we expected total revenue to grow.","Continued to the next page, noninterest expense including Significant Items will have some quarterly volatility as second quarter sees the full impact of Camco and this year\u2019s peak marketing expense along with the annual merit increase that occurs in May. The overall message remains that we\u2019ve remained diligent on controlling expenses and are committed to delivering full year operating leverage.","On the credit front, NPAs are expected to experience continued improvement over time. Net charge-offs are in our long-term expected range of 35 basis points to 55 basis points, but provision is likely to increase and both are expected to continue to experience some intra-quarter volatility given their absolute low levels.","Turning to Slide 20, and as you\u2019ve heard me say, we\u2019re committed to positive operating leverage for the year. This slide lays out the results for the year-to-date and our adjusted total revenue is up about 2%. Adjusted expenses were down 1.6% it\u2019s too early in the year to claim our victory on operating leverage, but we wanted to provide with you an update to our progress.","Before I turn it back to Todd for Q&A, I\u2019m very pleased to introduce our recently appointed CFO, Howell McCullough that I think many of you know him as Mac, and we\u2019ll be referring to Mac as we go forward. And some of you would know him through his role of Chief Strategy Officer at U.S. Bank, which by the way is a bank I admire for their consistency of results and disciplined approach to growth. And he is a great fit for us here at Huntington, Mac although, he earned his MBA from Wharton, he did his undergraduate degree from The Ohio State University and having grown up from in Columbus, he knows our markets well.","That brings with him a commitment to customer advocacy, which has been a hallmark of Huntington since it was founded, he also has expertise in revenue growth, expense management and innovation, all these attributes we\u2019re seeking to take to the next \u2013 take Huntington to the next level.","So, I\u2019ll close with a thank you to Dave Anderson, our Controller, did a super job stepping in as interim CFO, along with the accounting and finance teams, which all did outstanding job for the last year. Dave filled that interim CFO role wonderfully.","So with that, back to you, Todd.","Todd Beekman","Tracy, we\u2019ll now take questions. And I ask as a courtesy to your peers, each person ask one question and one related follow-up. for additional questions, he or she can go back to the queue. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Your first question is from Kevin St. Pierre with Sanford. Bernstein.","Kevin J. St. Pierre \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Good morning. I was wondering if you could talk a bit more about the changes to the consumer checking accounts, it\u2019s almost a 10% hit to the service charges. could you talk \u2013 tell us what those changes are?","Stephen D. Steinour","We\u2019re going to be making a couple of changes, Kevin. first, we\u2019re going to allow all of our customers to transact up to midnight to cover any overdraft charges by making transfers again, through midnight in any of our channels, ATM, phone bank, digital whatever channel access they have. and then secondly, we\u2019re making an adjustment to how we post debit items. it\u2019s a bit involved, but it will work to the consumers to our customers\u2019 advantage, and I think give us even more transparency around that, as we go forward.","Kevin J. St. Pierre \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","So, is it something that you would \u2013 is it something that you would anticipate that boost to the brands of the Fair Play strategy, and then you\u2019ll be able to leverage this a bit?","Stephen D. Steinour","We certainly think it\u2019s completely in line with our Fair Play strategy, and will be helpful to us. I would point, Kevin, last year, we made a $30 million reduction in overdraft fees related to posting order changes, $30 million approximately. but as you saw the results for the year, the actual service charge fees were up about 6%. So we\u2019re getting signals that our customers and our ability to attract new customers really appreciate this Fair Play approach. and so that\u2019s in part why we decided to continue to roll out differentiating positions with our checking product.","Kevin J. St. Pierre \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks very much.","Stephen D. Steinour","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley.","Ken Zerbe \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC & Co. LLC","Great, thanks. First, really quick question on the reclassification of the loans and the securities was the 600 also the impact on average balances, such that if we had average of the 600 to the average, I think loan growth was up about 2.0%. Is that the right way to think about it?","Stephen D. Steinour","Yes, it is. We reclassified $600 million at the end of December and then throughout the quarter as we got, we originated new assets, the balance increased about $673 million. but I think you\u2019re doing the math right.","Ken Zerbe \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. And that was all in the commercial line, the C&I line.","Stephen D. Steinour","Yes. It came out of C&I, and went into available-for-sale securities.","Ken Zerbe \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, perfect. And then just the follow-up question on the expense line, obviously comp was I guess very well controlled this quarter. Can you just run through the ups and downs? I think you have the merit increases in May, you had seasonally higher payroll taxes this quarter, and I know you have the pension expense or curtailment, I guess, when we sort of net that out and we should \u2013 we\u2019re sort of at a broadly sustainable level, or do we take up in second quarter and then I\u2019m just wondering how sustainable this level of comp expense is? Thanks.","Stephen D. Steinour","I mean we will see a merit increase in May. we obviously continue to manage expense as well. but we will see that impact in May as we\u2019ve signaled.","David S. Anderson","Ken, you\u2019ll also see some increased marketing, our marketing tends to be seasonal. and so that that will be an increase. and then finally, the Camco acquisition was brought in \u2013 brought on late in the first quarter. so that that will have some overheads associated with it as well. But that\u2019s been part of what\u2019s been in the expectations, frankly all of those has been in terms of the expectations and the Camco, there is the revenue as well.","Ken Zerbe \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it, okay. thank you very much.","Stephen D. Steinour","Okay.","David S. Anderson","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Tom M. Shearer \u2013 Jefferies LLC","Yes. Hi, this is Tom Shearer in for Ken. just want to see if I can get a little more color on loan growth within categories. we saw CRE pick up a little bit here. Is that sort of more of a function of lower runoffs, or are we actually seeing a base set in here, or how should we think about growth in that category and others going forward?","Daniel J. Neumeyer","Yes. I think this is Dan. On CRE, we are seeing a pickup of activity, I think there has been the opportunities, multifamily retail, we\u2019re seeing more properties change hands. So I do think that over the last couple of quarters, we\u2019ve seen more opportunities there, that\u2019s within the profile we\u2019re looking for.","Stephen D. Steinour","But Tom, to try and answer you more broadly, we\u2019ve had a very good quarter in terms of broad-based growth, we\u2019ve had growth in our middle market, our small business, a number of our verticals, healthcare, food and ag et cetera. So very broad-based. our large corporate book actually came in a little bit again, in the first quarter as I did through last year. and so I think this is a reflection of the economy and our footprint doing well, and the investments that we\u2019ve made in these verticals and other businesses continuing to mature.","Tom M. Shearer \u2013 Jefferies LLC","Great, thanks. And just a quick cleanup on the share account, we saw the period end down, but the average slightly up. How should we think about that going forward?","Stephen D. Steinour","We had the Camco acquisition in there.","Tom M. Shearer \u2013 Jefferies LLC","Right.","Daniel J. Neumeyer","And the majority of the shares that we repurchased in the first quarter or after Camco, we\u2019re in a \u2013 we were required to stay on the market for a while, but most of the activity happened later in March.","Tom M. Shearer \u2013 Jefferies LLC","Okay. Great, thanks.","Stephen D. Steinour","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from Scott Siefers with Sandler O'Neill and Partners.","Scott Siefers \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill & Partners LP","","Good morning, guys.","Stephen D. Steinour","","Good morning, Scott.","Scott Siefers \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill & Partners LP","","Steve, I was just hoping you could touch a little more on just the notion of positive operating leverage. You guys made it last year. It looks like you\u2019ll be able to do it again, this year. But I guess absent any additional securities gains for example, the spread between revenue growth and expenses might start to narrow if I\u2019m interpreting the guidance correct. So you can still do it, but it will be kind of very modest operating leverage. When and how do you see that gap expanding more materially? Is it that 2015 is the year where it really kind of shines through and that you will have kind of a full year of no need to do investment spending on the branch build out, or how should we really think about that dynamic from your perspective?","David S. Anderson","","This is Dave. Scott, I think that we think about the future, we\u2019re obviously having very good success in growing loans this quarter. we expect that to continue into 2014 and 2015. So that will help us. We talked about the factor we\u2019re still expecting the net interest income line to continue to grow. Our supermarket strategy, we expect it to break-even by the end of this year. So that will help us obviously from the positive operating leverage. And we are sensitive to short-term interest rates, a large percentage of our book is LIBOR-based, and our projections on interest rates will help as interest rates move up on the short part of the curve, that will help us as well.","Stephen D. Steinour","","So none of our investments are mature. Scott, credit card for example was end of third quarter last year. There\u2019s a variety of areas that we\u2019ll continue to attribute and we come into the second quarter of the strong pipeline, much like we told you year-end, we came in to the first quarter with a strong pipeline. We would expect that to continue. We like the activities and the focus that we have going on throughout the company. So the execution is getting better. You think about that first quarter at least in our geography, not that we want to provide weather reports, but there were clear weather impacts into some of the results.","So more to do, we\u2019ve got frankly a lot of ambitions and \u2013 but we think we had a good quarter and a trend now with pipeline and backlog in activities to be confident as we come into the second quarter.","Scott Siefers \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill & Partners LP","","Okay, good. That\u2019s helpful, and I appreciate the color. And then I guess just as a follow-up, I want to make sure, I understand the loan growth dynamic correctly. Because of the Camco transaction, there\u2019s a little bit more of a gap than is typical between your end-of-period and average balances. And then the accounting change that you did end of last quarter doesn\u2019t necessarily help I guess. So it\u2019s just almost as simple as thinking the end-of-period, which is, I guess more of a double-digit annualized growth rate is just a much better proxy for what we should be expecting for overall loan growth than the more modest annualized growth if you just did the average numbers?","Stephen D. Steinour","","Well. At the end-of-period, we\u2019d pick up Camco.","Scott Siefers \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill & Partners LP","Yes.","Stephen D. Steinour","So that would \u2013 that could be misleading if you just took a spot and not an average. But we had pretty good growth throughout the quarter. it ramped a bit, but it got a little better during the quarter. but it wasn\u2019t back-end loaded. So the \u2013 as we come into this quarter, we get essentially the same kind of pipeline to work with and to help you that the Camco loan portfolio is about $500 million of business and consumer.","Scott Siefers \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill & Partners LP","Yes, okay. So maybe, just taking that out of the end-of-period is probably a pretty good proxy then for the kind of growth rate we could see going forward, it sounds like.","Stephen D. Steinour","Yes, we can see, you\u2019ve got a couple of weeks in it, but that\u2019s all.","Scott Siefers \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill & Partners LP","","Yes. Okay. All right, that\u2019s perfect. I appreciate the time.","Stephen D. Steinour","","Thank you.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.","Daniel M. Delmoro \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey guys, you have Dan Delmoro [from Matt\u2019s team] (ph). Just a quick follow-up on C&I loan growth. Your outlook points to higher customer activity and some of the benefits from investments in your verticals. I just want to get a sense for how utilization rates trended throughout the quarter, and what you guys have been seeing in terms of pricing in terms in the space? Another regional bank pointed to some frothiness in the CRE space. So I wanted to see if you guys are seeing that as well.","","Daniel J. Neumeyer","","Yes. This is Dan. So, in terms of utilization it has been flat, which is actually a positive because we\u2019ve seen a couple of year trend of decreasing utilization. So, we believe that\u2019s leveled out and maybe pointed to an uptick, but definitely a change in direction there in the flattening. In terms of frothiness in the market, yes nothing has changed from last quarter, the market is as competitive as ever. And CRE in particular, yes, it\u2019s more aggressive, but given where \u2013 we have pretty modest growth targets there. So we are able to pretty much take on the credit that fits our profile and still withholding to loan-to-value debt service coverage ratios et cetera. The stress has been more on term and recourse, but the disciplines of debt service coverage and LTVs have held up well. And so, we like what we are adding to the book.","Stephen D. Steinour","","And as we\u2019ve talked about before, we have concentration limits in place for a variety of our loan portfolios. But, we tend to articulate it around Commercial Real Estate as a concentration limit on these calls and the analyst sessions just to point out them.","Daniel M. Delmoro \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, thank you.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Bob Ramsey with FBR.","Bob H. Ramsey \u2013 FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Hey, good morning guys. Just want to touch a little bit more on expenses, it sounded in the intro comments as if the expectations are not materially different, but when I read the guidance, it says you expect a slight increase from this quarter\u2019s level. I think last quarter you had said flattish around the second half of 2013, which was the same as this quarter. So, are you expecting a little bit higher expenses now than before or am I just getting too detailed?","Daniel J. Neumeyer","","I think maybe a little bit of this is, first quarter was lower than we expect for second quarter, but the outlook for the year is inline with what we articulated at year-end. And service a little bit of it\u2019s timing of our investment on marketing and some of that is factored, there are a number of factors for that, but we\u2019ve had a particularly rough winner that went late into the first quarter and so we deferred some marketing in the second quarter. Is that helpful Bob?","Bob H. Ramsey \u2013 FBR Capital Markets & Co.","","No. That there is high and then you have highlighted several unusual items in our anyway seasonal pipe items in the second quarter. Can you give us a sense of the magnitude of increase in the second quarter from the merit advertising in Camco acquisition all together?","David S. Anderson","","Yes. This is Dave. Unfortunately, we did not give that type of guidance.","Stephen D. Steinour","We just stay away from line item guidance.","Bob H. Ramsey \u2013 FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Okay.","Stephen D. Steinour","But [good point] (ph) for asking, nice try.","Bob H. Ramsey \u2013 FBR Capital Markets & Co.","And then last question, I'll ask you guys sort of about the expenses and the positive operating leverages. You guys map it out on Slide 20. You make adjustments for the litigation and merger expenses, which is fair, but didn't back up the security gains this quarter. When you all think about positive operating leverage, do you think about security gains as a piece of that?","","Stephen D. Steinour","We do. It\u2019s an area where we\u2019ve had some debate as well internally, but about 70% of the revenue of those security gains would have otherwise come in this year in net interest income. So it struck us with \u2013 we would have had much and most of it anyway in the year, it seems fair to put it in. But we quibble on whether it should be in or out and certainly if this were a multiyear series of gains, we pull it out.","Bob H. Ramsey \u2013 FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Okay, great. Thank you, guys.","Stephen D. Steinour","","These investments were short in duration.","Bob H. Ramsey \u2013 FBR Capital Markets & Co.","","Thanks.","","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Steven Alexopoulos with JPMorgan.","Steven A. Alexopoulos \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, everyone.","Stephen D. Steinour","Good morning.","Steven A. Alexopoulos \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC","Steve, regarding the change in Fair Play coming in July, what drove the decision to give more customers more time to get funds into their account. Was it any pressure from CFPB or just feedback from customers if 24 hours is not enough time?","Stephen D. Steinour","Well, this is has nothing to do with CFPB. We were thinking about it as we came into the New Year as a way of sort of strengthening the positioning around Fair Play and as we saw last year, again with a posting order to change service charges were actually up during the course of the year, so and good growth in customers.","So we\u2019re still learning, we\u2019re still testing, we still get \u2013 we seek and access customer feedback and the collective sense or judgment of the team was actually entirely consistent with the Fair Play approach, but we think also a good business in terms of \u2013 to get further strengthening Fair Play and uniqueness of 24-Hour Grace. In 24-Hour Grace, the vast majority of our customers never overdraw, but they all show a very strong emotional appeal around it when we survey. So we\u2019ll \u2013 so we thought it was a logical next step for us.","Steven A. Alexopoulos \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC","But do you think it's enough of a change to drive incremental share versus the 24 hours?","","Stephen D. Steinour","Well, it could be helpful to us in terms of both growth in customers, but also a share of wallet. We continue to refine our efforts around share of wallet.","Steven A. Alexopoulos \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Just a question regarding compliance with liquidity coverage ratio, what\u2019s the approximate dollar balance of higher liquid securities that you still need to add and what\u2019s the timing to get there? Thanks.","Stephen D. Steinour","So the overall portfolio, the securities portfolio is the absolute level today, is about the level it needs to be and as we look over the course of the year of the principal and interest of the non-qualified that roll through, we\u2019ll reinvest that back into qualifying assets and on target to be there by the end of the year. So we\u2019ve said that it\u2019s about $100 million, $125 million a month in interest and amortization. And so that will cycle now throughout the year.","We do have some legacy assets that would not be high qualified, and so that may continue to be a modest amount of substitution, but as we\u2019ve said in the year-end call we wanted to get the portfolio positioned in aggregate during the fourth quarter for a number of reasons, including the potential scarcity of some of the product we were looking for.","Steven A. Alexopoulos \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got you. So just remixing the rest of the year should be enough. Okay thank you.","Stephen D. Steinour","I think so. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse.","Craig W. Siegenthaler \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC","Hey, thanks good morning.","Stephen D. Steinour","Good morning, Craig.","Craig W. Siegenthaler \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC","So just a follow-up to the last question on the LCR. On the funding side, should we expect any additional run-off of collateralized municipal deposits? And I'm wondering, did anything on the liability side related to LCR drive the consumer pricing changes that we should expect in July?","","Stephen D. Steinour","Well, the decisions in July around our Fair Play philosophy had nothing do with LCR. In fact until you mentioned it, I hadn't thought of it in that context. So that's how remote it was. We had been working over the last year, year and a half to adjust collateralized deposits, and certainly as we see final guidance come out we may further reduce or adjust them, but we\u2019ve made meaningful progress during that period of time.","And we may have some other approaches to it, home loan Bank, LCD or other things for very meaningful relationships. Deeply crustal, significant treasury management and things like that that we choose to protect. Don\u2019t see it as a huge issue for us at this point, Craig.","Craig W. Siegenthaler \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC","And then on your prior comment, you mentioned $125 million per month that you're going to reinvest from the securities portfolio into Ginnies. That nets to $1.5 billion. Should we think about that roughly as the increase over the next 12 months? And then the delta when you think about NIM is maybe a 20 basis point difference between the average Fannie\/Freddie security and Ginnie?","","Stephen D. Steinour","We didn\u2019t mean to imply further growth in that portfolio. This is normal and monthly interest and if you will, principal repayment or amortization of the existing portfolio that we would look to reinvest to hold the portfolio at roughly the $11 billion level that it\u2019s at today.","Craig W. Siegenthaler \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC","","So, Steve, so you hold it at $11 billion, but there's a $1.5 billion mix shift from the Fannie and Freddie portion to the Ginnie portion. And the net I think interest income delta on that is maybe 20 basis points because the Ginnies are yielding something lower. That was kind of my quick math.","","Stephen D. Steinour","But it\u2019s not all coming out of Fannie\/Freddie to be sure, and it\u2019s got a variety of coupons around it and the durations maybe a little different as we look at reinvest. We do not intend to take a lot of market risk and we haven\u2019t in the last five years, but so we\u2019ve a number of things to work with, I wouldn\u2019t do the 20 bps Craig, but we don\u2019t try and provide specific guidance. So just in that context, I think you did a bit severe.","Craig W. Siegenthaler \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC","","Okay. Great thanks for the color Steve.","Stephen D. Steinour","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs.","Ryan M. Nash \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey good morning guys.","Stephen D. Steinour","Good morning.","Ryan M. Nash \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","Just a question on the buyback strategy. When we think about the repurchases that occurred over the past couple of quarters, you guys flowed the buybacks for two quarters. Granted I understand that there was impact from Camco, and then you obviously completed the offering this quarter when you billed back $136 million. So can you just help, as we think about the $250 million approval that you got for this year, can you help us understand the philosophy from here?","I know there was a lot of talk around sensitivity above tangible book value. Is that still the main primary factor in determining whether or not you're going to \u2013 how aggressive you are and or is it the fact that you're continuing to generate capital at a pretty fast pace that you want to prevent the capital base from growing? So, any color you could provide on that would be helpful?","Stephen D. Steinour","Let me start broadly with that Ryan if we could. First of all, we think we have a strong capital position. We\u2019re sitting with excess capital today. And our approach has been grow the course as the capital there to support growth, secondly, to support dividend and third, for other activities, buyback, M&A, et cetera. In that context as we talked about the year-end earnings, we had a number of discussions at Board management about buyback approach and we refined or adjusted that approach which we communicated, certainly attempted to communicate at the year-end call.","And so there are a number of additional factors than just a tangible book value that we are looking at. We haven\u2019t gone into those in great detail, but we have refined our thinking, broadened it quite a bit and that remains consistent as we go from first quarter now into second. And Dave pointed out we had this little hiatus around the Camco acquisition that\u2019s required, but other than that executed against that refined approach during the first quarter. So we carry that approach into the second quarter and beyond, I guess, it\u2019s second through first quarter with the CCAR approval.","Ryan M. Nash \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. And I guess just a question on auto. I notice that you've \u2013 maybe I'm looking too far into this. I noticed in the release you are no longer stating that you won't be doing any auto securitizations. And I think the wording in the outlook around indirect auto loan growth changed slightly. Has your thinking \u2013 has pricing changed at all for loan sales such that the economics make more sense to consider? Is there anything LCR-driven that has changed your outlook, or is it just that you're seeing improving loan growth in other areas such that you don't need as much auto loan growth to support balance sheet growth?","","Stephen D. Steinour","When we entered the year, we tried to communicate that we did not anticipate an auto securitization this year that we had room under our concentration limit that would take us into 2015. And like the asset yield and other risk dimensions of autos versus alternative investments, and that thinking hasn\u2019t changed and wasn\u2019t a function of LCR.","Ryan M. Nash \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. If I could sneak in one other quick one, Steve. Given that your original fee income guidance did contemplate the $6 million quarterly decline in service charges, and you highlighted the fact that, despite last year's policy changes, you were able to grow service charges 6%.","So my question is there still enough momentum in the fee income line, given the things that you're doing in Fair Play, that we could actually end up seeing core fee income growth, or are the policy changes along with the decline of mortgage still too hard to overcome?","Stephen D. Steinour","","Well, as we\u2019ve said in the full year outlook, net interest income will be up, will swim through whatever margin compression, fee income will be modestly down if not flat, trying to overcome mortgage, the mortgage position. But when we gave that earning outlook, we had contemplated the decision that we\u2019re sharing today around further adjustments to the overdrive line item and so the overall guidance doesn\u2019t change. We\u2019re consistent with that and so the combination of those factors and managing expenses will put us inline with what we originally said.","Ryan M. Nash \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great and thank you for taking my questions.","Stephen D. Steinour","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jon Arfstrom with RBC Capital Markets.","Jon G. Arfstrom \u2013 RBC Capital Markets, LLC","Hey guys thanks, good morning.","Stephen D. Steinour","Good morning, Jon.","Jon G. Arfstrom \u2013 RBC Capital Markets, LLC","Good morning, Mac.","Howell D. McCullough III","Good morning, Jon.","Jon G. Arfstrom \u2013 RBC Capital Markets, LLC","","Welcome to Huntington.","","Stephen D. Steinour","It sounds like an all home day here, Jon.","Jon G. Arfstrom \u2013 RBC Capital Markets, LLC","Yes. It's not the same here without Mac in town. Just a little more granular on the commercial lending, I'm particularly interested in the customer outlook for borrowing among the manufacturers and also their appetite for CapEx borrowing.","","Stephen D. Steinour","Yes. I would say it\u2019s improving, I think there is \u2013 we haven\u2019t seen huge changes yet, but I do think there\u2019s a developing confidence out there and more potentially to look at capital investment, I think it shows up in our middle market loan growth in our equipment finance loan growth. So I do think there are signs of that developing confidence and I think that helps form our outlook for the balance of the year.","Jon G. Arfstrom \u2013 RBC Capital Markets, LLC","Okay. And then just to follow-up on that, in terms of your specialty verticals, how is the \u2013 I have to get the name right \u2013 but the foreign subsidiary business going? Are you seeing increase in activity there?","David S. Anderson","We are seeing some activity; the thing we like about our verticals is that the growth is coming from all of them. we\u2019re not relying on any one to kind of outperform. We\u2019re seeing traction starting to develop in all of them, and foreign non-subs is a contributor. it is not huge, but we are starting from kind of ground zero. So we like the developing pipeline there and what we\u2019ve added to the book thus far.","","Stephen D. Steinour","Jon when we talk about investments not mature, these specialty businesses or verticals, none of them are mature. And we\u2019ve been doing this now for a number of years. we did three at the end of 2012, but there were a series of them before. they all have growth potential for us and they\u2019re all coming on.","Jon G.

Long \u2013 Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Just the one question that I still have remaining was regarding the expectations, Steve, and you talked about expectations for net interest income to grow moderately and noninterest income and expenses to be slightly higher from the current levels. Just to confirm, does that include the impact of Camco then, or is that simply looking at it organically?","Stephen D. Steinour","That\u2019s the organic, but we also have enrolled Camco into that.","David J. Long \u2013 Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. so Camco is built into the \u2013 that sort of guidance if you want to call it back.","Stephen D. Steinour","Camco is included.","David J.

Just I know you didn\u2019t want to give any sort of specific guidance on the OpEx impact from Camco for full quarter in Q2, but could you \u2013 maybe, you\u2019ve already mentioned this, sorry if I missed it. But what was the actual impact on OpEx this quarter from Camco for roughly a month or so?","Stephen D. Steinour","I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve broken it out, it\u2019s not material. It\u2019s $500 million in loan, $600 million in deposits, net of 11 branches, so we\u2019re not trying to \u2013 it\u2019s just not material.","Sameer Gokhale \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","","Okay, that\u2019s fair. I was just thinking that might help a little bit with Q2, but it doesn\u2019t sound like a big number, so that\u2019s fine. And the other question was a again, relatively small number, but your litigation reserve charge of $9 million. Can you just give a sense of what that ties into, this new litigation or existing litigation that you reserve for?","David S. Anderson","this is Dave. as in the past, we just don\u2019t comment on litigation matters.","Sameer Gokhale \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Okay. Well, those are the two questions I had. Thank you.","David S. Anderson","Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous Research.","Geoffrey Elliott \u2013 Autonomous Research LLP","Hello. Just a quick question on the changes to the deposit service charges, what is the working you\u2019ve done around how long you think this is expected to take for those to become earnings positive, so you recover what you lose in the service charges and other fees or other revenue?","Stephen D. Steinour","We haven\u2019t taken it at an account level in terms of what we\u2019re prepared to share this morning. we have seen a fair amount of the elasticity around customer behavior, as we made adjustments last year, for example and so that has been given us an ability to model it and perhaps in some unique ways about the consumer behavior. Remember, our approach has been customer acquisition and share of wallet and I would increasingly, the focus for us is around revenue based share of wallet. and you\u2019ll hear us talk about that more commonly as we go forward.","Geoffrey Elliott \u2013 Autonomous Research LLP","And then how much that you think there is to go on these fee initiatives and initiatives to become more customer-friendly, I mean you\u2019ve done quite a bit already. Do you think there is a lot more that you can do or you could think any further initiatives are going to be kind of small and incremental?","Stephen D. Steinour","While we test and learn, and as we said, we survey and get feedback, there is nothing large on the horizon at this point, and I wouldn\u2019t say never, but it\u2019s not obvious to us what or when we might do something else now. so I think for purposes of modeling, certainly through the rest of this year, there is not another wave of activity that we\u2019re contemplating.","Geoffrey Elliott \u2013 Autonomous Research LLP","Thanks very much.","Stephen D. Steinour","Yes. Thank you.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Steve for closing comments.","Stephen D. Steinour","Thank you very much.

The customer activity in particular, that\u2019s translated into balance sheet growth, bodes well for us as we move forward. The Camco acquisition closing integration, doing that smoothly was a nice step along with this recently announced branch acquisition in Michigan.","So each one of these, while not being significant, they add a bit to the balance sheet, 1% or so to the balance sheet, and while not being particularly significant. they do help us strengthen us over time, give us more density, and deliver modest improvements in our efficiency ratios.

Dan Neumeyer, our Chief Credit Officer will also be participating in the Q&A portion of the call today.","Let\u2019s get started by turning to Slide 5. Mac?","Mac McCullough","Thanks Mark. Good morning and thank you for joining the call today. We appreciate your interest in Huntington and we think we have good results to share with you this morning. Over the past several years, we have followed a contrarian path built around our fair play philosophy and our welcoming culture. We have strong recognizable brands and differentiated product set and industry leading customer service. In addition we have been investing in our franchise building and expanding in a time when others have been focused squarely on cost cutting.","We will continue to invest in our business although we will pace our investments to manage our positive operating leverage on an annual basis.","Our second quarter results highlighted by solid revenue growth and improved margins provide proof that our strategies are working and the investments we\u2019ve undertaken over the past few years are paying off substantially.","Our investments are yet mature and should continue to drive future revenue growth and future performance improvement. We remain focused on disciplined execution and we are well positioned to finish the year strong, delivering positive operating leverage for the third consecutive year as well as improved returns for shareholders.","Slide 5 shows some of the financial highlights for the second quarter. Strong revenue growth for the record setting quarter resulting in net income growth of 19% over the same quarter of last year. Earnings per common share of $0.23 increased 21% year-over-year. These results equated to a 1.16 return on assets and a 14.4 return on tangible common equity.","The underlying strength exhibited this quarter was broad based and included the impact of our acquisition of Macquarie Equipment Finance which we have rebranded Huntington Technology Finance or HTF.","Total year-over-year revenue growth of 9% benefited equally from spread revenues and fee income. Net interest income grew 7% while fee income grew 13%.","Healthy balance sheet growth included a 6% year-over-year increase in average loans and leases and a 9% in average deposits. For the second straight quarter deposit growth was driven largely by growth in core deposits which is a very encouraging trend as we continue to focus on deepening relationships and earning primary banking status with our customers.","Core deposit growth more than fully funded loan growth over this period. While the value of our core deposits may not be fully appreciated in the current rate environment, we believe that our strong core deposit franchise will provide true differentiation when interest rates begin to rise.","Our credit quality remained very strong with only 21 basis points of net charge-offs and 81 basis points of non-performing assets.","We repurchased 8.8 million common shares at an average price of $11.20 per share effectively returning more than 99 million of capital to shareholders. We also completed a 750 million indirect auto loan securitization during the quarter resulting in a net gain of 5 million. This securitization demonstrated investor\u2019s endorsement of the quality and consistency of our auto finance business, one of our distinctive capabilities. Finally we continue to be recognized for our focus on excellent customer service and our distinguished brand.","During the quarter we were recognized by both J.D. Power and TNS for the third consecutive year for our customer\u2019s centric focus. We were also recognized by the American Banker for our strong reputation.","Slide 7 is a summary of our quarterly trends and key performance metrics. We've already touched on many of these, so let's move to Slide 8 for a more detailed review of the numbers.","Relative to last year's second quarter, total revenue increased 9% to 780 million. We are very pleased with our strong revenue growth in this challenging environment. As I mentioned previously spread revenue and fee income accounted for roughly equal parts of the increase of the revenue. Spread revenues benefited from balance sheet growth as earning assets increased 10% year-over-year partially offset by continued NIM progression of 8 basis points.","Spread revenues during the second quarter included 17 million of net interest income from HTF. Fee income for the 2015 second quarter was 282 million, a 13% increase from a year ago quarter. The primary components of the increase were a 60 million increase in mortgage banking income, 12 million in fee revenue from HTF and a 9 million increase on gains on the sale of loans which included a 5 million gain on the 750 million indirect auto loan securitization.","Other fee income sources also posted double digit year-over-year growth rates including electronic banking and capital markets. We continue to see the benefits of consumer and commercial customer growth manifested in these areas.","Deposit service charges also benefited from our robust customer growth as we have almost grown through the 6 million per quarter impact from changes to our consumer deposit growth -- our consumer deposited products including All Day Deposits implemented in July of last year.","Reported non-interest expense in the second quarter was 492 million, an increase of 33 million or 7% from the year ago quarter. Recurring expense related to HTF was 16 million or almost half of the year-over-year increase.","The second quarter also included 2 million of merger related expense that is not recorded as a significant item for the quarter but is expected to be recorded as a significant item for the year as we will complete the systems integration of HTF later in 2015.","Slide 9 details the trends of our balance sheet mix. Average loans and leases increased 3 billion or 6% year-over-year including 839 million of leases from the HTF acquisition. During last quarter's earnings call we mentioned that we expected lower second quarter growth in C&I and CRE due to our risk return expectations, and this was the case. However loan growth in our loan pipeline will strengthened later in the second quarter providing room for increased optimism in the back half of the year.","Notably in the second quarter we experienced year-over-year growth in every loan portfolio. The indirect auto portfolio increased 10% from the year ago quarter. As shown on Slide 53 in the appendix our indirect auto operating model remains unchanged with our disciplined approach to the business reflected in the credit performance metrics.","As mentioned in the opening remarks we completed a 750 million indirect auto loan securitization. Recall that we previously moved 1 billion of auto loans to help our sale and near the end of the quarter we moved the remaining 250 million of indirect auto loans back into the portfolio.","After reviewing the existing and projected size of the overall auto portfolio relative to our concentration limit as well as the transaction economics, we opted to scale back to size of the securitization. This allows us to realize the longer term benefit of keeping these high quality assets on our balance sheet.","Previously, we mentioned that we expected to complete an additional securitization during the latter half of 2015 or perhaps in early 2016. However completion of the securitization in the second quarter, we reexamined our appetite for indirect auto loans taking into consideration the strong consistent performance of the asset class during the past economic cycle and in the CCAR and DFAST stress test. As a result of this review we decided to raise our auto concentration limit from 150% of capital defined as Tier 1 capital plus reserves to 175% of capital. As such we no longer anticipate the need for an off balance sheet securitization in the back half of 2015.","Turning attention to the right side of the balance sheet, averaged total deposits increased 9% over the year ago quarter including an 8% increase in core deposits. Average non-interest bearing demand deposits increased 18% year-over-year reflecting our focus on the consumer checking and commercial relationship level.","Specifically, commercial non-interest bearing deposits increased 19% year-over-year while consumer non-interest bearing deposits increased 15%.","Total core deposits from commercial customers increased 17% year-over-year while total core deposits from consumers increased 2% as we continue to remix the consumer deposit base out of higher cost CDs into other less extensive deposit products.","Importantly, the year-over-year growth in total core deposits more than funded our loan growth over this period. Average short and long-term borrowings increased by 1 billion year-over-year which includes 750 million and 1 billion of bank level senior debt issued during the 2014 second quarter and 2015 first quarter respectively. We also issued 750 million of bank level senior debt on the last day of the 2015 second quarter.","Average brokerage deposits increased 600 million. These deposits provide a cost effective means for funding balance sheet growth including LCR related securities growth while maintaining focus on managing core deposited expense.","Turning to Slide 10, we see net interest margins spotted against earning asset yields and interest bearing liability cost. The NIM increased 5 basis points quarter-over-quarter to 3.20% primarily due to the addition of higher yielding assets from the HTF acquisition. In addition we recorded approximately 3 million of prepayment penalties within the securities portfolio, which added 2 basis points for the margin. These contributions were partially offset by continuing pricing pressure across most asset classes. The net interest margin decreased 8 basis points from the year ago quarter, also reflecting downward asset reprising pressure. Going forward, we expect pricing pressure to remain a headwind, as many asset classes continue to re-price lower while funding cost have limited room for improvement besides from continuing remixing them on deposit base.","Slide 11 provides some detail on our current asset sensitivity and how we manage interest rate risk. For the past several years we have run a more neutral about position balance sheet compared to many of our peers in part related to our swap portfolio. These swaps were added at a time when the outlook suggested a prolonged period of consistently low rates. As shown in the top of -- the chart on top, our models estimate that net interest income will benefit by 0.3% if interest rates were to gradually ramp 200 basis points in addition to increase that\u2019s already reflected in the current implied forward curve. This is consistent with our estimates from the past few quarters. In a hypothetical scenario without the 9.2 billion of asset swaps our models estimate that net interest income will benefit by approximately 4.3% in the same up 200 basis point ramp scenario. The chart at the bottom of the slide illustrates the weighted average life over asset and liability swaps. As well as the net impact of the swaps on our net interest income.","As you can see on the green line, the asset swap portfolio continues to age in and had a weighted average life of 1.5 years at 6\/30\/15. As we have said it previously, our asset swap portfolio is the laddered portfolio. There are no cliffs looming on the horizon. Over the next two quarters 1 billion of these asset swaps will mature and an additional 3.5 billion will mature during 2016. The maturity of these swaps would increase our estimated asset sensitivity.","Slide 12 shows the trends in our capital ratios. Our regulatory capital ratios improved modestly from the first quarter, while tangible common equity remained relatively flat. We repurchase 8.8 million common shares over the quarter at an average price of $11.20 per share under our 366 million share repurchase authorization. We have 267 million in authorized capacity remaining from the next four quarters.","Slide 13 provides an overview of our credit quality net trends. Credit performance remain solid and in line with our expectations. Net charge-offs remain well controlled at 21 basis points, below our long-term expectations of 35 to 55 basis points. The non-performing asset ratio fell slightly in the quarter due to lower inflows compared to the prior quarter as well as the higher number of loans returning to recurring [ph] status. The criticized asset ratio also improved in the quarter aided by an increase in the volume level upgrades in the past category. The allowance for credit losses ease modestly with the ACL ratio falling from 1.3% last quarter to 1.34% currently. All credit metrics fully reflect the results of the recently completed annual shared national credit exam.","Slide 14 highlights trends in criticized assets, non-performing assets and delinquencies. The chart in the upper left shows a slight decrease in the NPA ratio for the quarter to 81 basis points. The level of NPAs has been fairly consistent over the past six quarters and is in line with our expectations. The chart in the upper right reflects continued improvement in our 90-day delinquencies with the improvement coming from both the commercial and consumer loan portfolios. The chart in the bottom left shows the criticized asset ratio which also improved in the quarter as new inflows of criticized assets were more than offset by upgrades and pay downs. Finally the chart on the bottom right shows a reduction in NPA inflows as a percentage of beginning period loans fall in from 30 basis points to 26 basis points.","Turning to Slide 15, the loan loss provision was 20.4 million in the second quarter compared to 25.4 million of charge-offs. The ratio of allowance for non-accrual loans remain steady at 180% compared to 181% in the prior quarter. The ACL ratio fell modestly to 1.34% from 1.38% in the prior quarter in line with modest overall improvement in credit metrics. We believe the allowance is appropriate and reflects the underlying credit quality of our loan portfolio. Let me now turn the presentation over to Steve.","Steve Steinour","Thank you, Mac. Slide 16 provides a quick snapshot for the long-term trends in our consumer and commercial customer acquisition. Our Fair Play banking philosophy coupled with our optimal customer relationship or OCR focus has substantially driven customer acquisition since its inception. As you can see we\u2019ve increased our consumer checking households and business relationships by almost 9% and 6% compound annual growth rates since 2010. We believe these are industry leading customer acquisition rates. These robust customer growth rates have allowed us to post the associated revenue growth you can see in the two lower charts on the slide. We\u2019re a company focused on revenue and revenue growth and we will continue to grow revenues despite the headwinds of the interest rate environment.","We have seen our dedication to OCR payoff but to get the full picture we turn to Slide 17 and 18 and in doing so I want to stress that our strategy is not just about gaining market share but also gain in share of wallet. As we have shared with you previously the cornerstone of our OCR strategy is based around increasing the number of products and services we provide to our customers knowing that this will translate both into more loyal and satisfied customers as well as revenue growth.","During the first quarter, our OCR consumer cross-sell goal of six or more consumer products and services crossed over the 50% mark for the first time. This figure increased an additional 80 basis points during the second quarter and now 51% of our consumer checking household use six or more products and services. Correspondingly our consumer checking account household revenue is up 9% year-over-year.","Turning attention to the commercial side of Slide 18, our percentage of commercial customers with four or more accounts -- four or more products and services was 43.4%, up 70 basis points from the prior quarter and up 210 basis points from the year ago quarter. Again this is translated directly to revenue growth as commercial revenue increased 5% year-over-year.","Slide 19 shows our year-to-date operating leverage results. Full year positive operating leverage is a long-term strategic goal for Huntington and a commitment we have made again for 2015. We significantly narrowed the gap in the second quarter moving from negative 1.7% at the end of the first quarter to negative 40 basis points at the midpoint of the year.","We have strong revenue momentum and we will pace our continued investment in the franchise appropriately for the revenue outlook. Therefore, we remain confident in our ability to achieve positive operating leverage for the full year both inclusive and exclusive of the impact of the Huntington Technology Finance.","Turning to Slide 20 for some closing remarks on expectations. We remain optimistic about the ongoing economic improvement in our footprint. We are bullish on the Midwest economy. While average loan growth hit was decent this quarter we saw momentum building in our pipelines and in our loan growth during the latter half of the second quarter.","Customer activity remains encouraging. Loan utilization rates showed a slight increase during the quarter giving additional reason for optimism. While competition remains intense, we will continue to be disciplined in growing our commercial real estate and C&I portfolios.","We are committed to delivering strong results regardless of the interest rate environment. Our budget has been built around the current rate environment and our execution is not dependent on a rate increase. We control our destiny and our focus and execution will deliver results.","Net interest margin improved this quarter with the impact of Huntington Technology Finance, however we expect NIM pressure will remain a headwind until interest rates start moving up. We expect to grow revenue despite the pressure.","Fee revenue improved this quarter with electronic banking, treasury management, capital markets and mortgage banking, all demonstrating particularly strong momentum. We continue to invest in our businesses for the future resulting in projected non-interest expense growth of 2% to 4% for the year excluding significant items, net MSR activity and acquisitions.","On a reported basis, we expect non-interest expenses will remain near the second quarter 2015 level for the rest of the year. We expect revenue growth in excess of expense growth and we are committed to positive operating leverage for full year 2015.","We believe the asset quality metrics will remain near current levels. We expect net charge-offs will remain at or below our long-term expected range of 35 basis points to 55 basis points. Modest changes are anticipated given the absolute low levels of our credit metrics.","Longer term we continue to manage the franchise with an emphasis on consistent shareholder returns, we've built a strong and recognizable consumer brand with differentiated products and superior customer service. We are executing our strategies and adjusting to the environment when necessary. While past investments continue to payoff we continue to move forward with investments in enhanced sales management, digital technology, data and analytics and optimizing our retail distribution network.","There is a high level of alignment between the Board, management and indeed all of employees and shareholders, and while we are highly focused on our commitment to being good stewards of shareholders' capital.","With that, I am going to turn it back to Mark","Mark Muth","Leanne we will now take questions. We ask that as a courtesy to your peers each person ask only one question and one related follow-up. And then if that person has additional questions, he or she can add themselves back into the queue. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of John Pancari from Evercore. Your line is open.","John Pancari ","On loan growth side, just wondering if you can give us a little bit more color on the C&I loan trends average show a pretty good growth, but on the end of period basis they were flattish, wanted to see if that\u2019s a number we should grow off of or is it the average trends that think are more sustainable there?","Mac McCullough","This is Mac. So I do think what you're seeing in the quarter is consistent with the guidance we gave last quarter on the call. We do have good pipeline that picked up later in the quarter and we are being very disciplined in terms of how we think about this from our risk appetite and reward perspective. You know, I do think that if you adjust for the Macquarie acquisition and think about the end point of the quarter that would be a good starting point for growing off of. But again we did see strength in the latter part of the quarter and again it's what we expected when we announced last quarter.","John Pancari ","And then also on the loan fund as I follow-up, wanted to get your thoughts on auto loan growth, the growth on balance sheet balances given your commentary around the intent to retain more of your production. How should we think about growth in that portfolio going forward?","Mac McCullough","I would tell you that the growth is pretty consistent with what you've seen historically. We have made some pricing changes that have impacted volume and some of this pricing changes have stuck. I think that it's important just to think about the environments and the fact that it is, but there is good opportunities for auto growth and we\u2019re going to be consistent with what we produce historically.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ken Zerbe from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Ken Zerbe ","I guess just sort of follow-up on the auto, why is it a good idea to increase concentration to auto, you obviously set that 150% for a reason and I know you guys do great underwriting. But it just seems that you're intentionally adding more risk and more concentration to a single asset class and I would love to know the rational to why that is?","Dan Neumeyer","This is Dan. I think when you look at our auto portfolio and we measure a risk in volatility our auto portfolio has been one of the most consistent performers overtime and when we run our analysis and look at struck [ph] losses versus base losses is a very, very stable portfolio. We haven\u2019t had to adjust our underwriting perimeters in order to gain volumes, if you look at our FICO scores, our LTV's, the term, et cetera they have been rock solid over the cycle and we just think it's a great asset class and we don\u2019t think that at 175% of capital that that is outside at all. So we like the asset, we think it's proven itself and we think that level of concentration is very responsible.","Ken Zerbe ","And then the second question I had just in terms of the margins at 320 obviously pick up presumably due to HTF is 320 a decent starting point next or there was any unusual items and then we applied the margin compression on that 320, is that fair?","Mac McCullough","It's Mac, so HTF added 7 basis points to the margin in the quarter and then there was about 2 basis points related to some security calls. So I think that\u2019s how you got to think about it going forward at least at the starting point. And then just keep in mind that we\u2019ve been pretty consistent in 2 to 4 basis points of compression on a quarterly basis and we don\u2019t think that\u2019s unreasonable.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steven Alexopoulos from JP Morgan. Your line is open.","Steven Alexopoulos ","Let's just start looking at the 2% to 4% expense guidance which implies 1.9 billion of 2015 adjusted expenses, given where you were at the year-to-date point 946 million that implies a range of somewhere between 450 million and 470 million featuring the next two quarters. I am just curious given where the second quarter run rate came out, is there realistically any chance that you end up at the low end of the range, so 2% for the year, I was a bit surprised you didn\u2019t take up the guidance to at least maybe three to four something like that. Help us think about the range and why you are maintaining the guidance?","Mac McCullough","It's Mac, so we do feel very comfortable that expense growth from the remainder of the year is going to be very consistent with what you see in the second quarter, so we think it's important to be consistent in the guidance that we provide and make sure that we report back to you on how we are performing against that guidance. And again even with all the investments that we have coming on later this year we are opening more in-stores, we continue to make investments in digital and other technology. We feel very comfortable with expenses being at the same level second quarter of 2015.","Steven Alexopoulos ","You think it's feasible that we could end up at the low end of that range?","Mac McCullough","I\u2019ll leave that to you to decide based upon the guidance that we\u2019ve given here. But certainly we\u2019re comfortable stuck in second quarter levels.","Steven Alexopoulos ","Okay. And I just wanted to follow up on raising the concentration limit of auto, can you just walk us through? So what's exactly is changing, is it better quality business reviewing, are you responding to pressure in C&I and other areas, is that way you are raising the limit?","Mac McCullough","I think it really, again the limit goes to when we look across the portfolio where is there less volatility, where we have the historical performance, et cetera. What's the allocation we want in the various asset classes on a relative basis and we think that one, we don\u2019t think 150 to 175 is significant, but we think it's fully supportive based on the results, and past history and where we want to book to go in the future.","Steven Alexopoulos ","Okay, okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the lines of Ken Usdin from Jefferies. Your line is open.","Ken Usdin","Thanks. Good morning guys. If I could follow up on the fee side. I just wanted to ask about you mentioned been really strong quarter for mortgage partially on the production side, also on the MSR, what your outlook would be there? And then secondly, the other line with the 12 million helper from HTF, is that consistent of a fee generator also in terms of run rating that level?","Mac McCullough","Yes, Ken, it's Mac. So we have a good performance in mortgage and we do expect continued performance. Keep in mind we did have 6 million in MSR pickup in the quarter and we certainly don\u2019t forecast either gains or losses when we put together our models. So we do think that mortgage is going to be a good contributor to revenue growth for the remainder of the year.","And when you think about HTF and the revenue on the fee side, we do think that that\u2019s a good base to build off of.","Ken Usdin","Okay. So my quick follow up here would just be on HTF in aggregate the revenue that we saw both -- and expenses across the board, this is all kind of the right run rate aside from future growth, right. So what was in the 7 basis points in NIM, the 12 in fees and then the amount of expenses accounted [ph] with good go forwards spots?","Mac McCullough","Yes, so, very, very comfortable with that. And one thing I would point out is that HTF did have some operating leases and we're not going to be booking operating leases going forward. So you will start to see, if there's $8 million of revenue in the quarter and $6 million of expense in the quarter related to operating leases, those items will start to run off. But they will be replaced, obviously, on the balance sheet with new production that won\u2019t be operating leases. So you need to think about the timing of how you adjust your fee revenue and your expenses, but just want to make you aware of that.","Ken Usdin","Okay thanks for that Mac, appreciate it.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian from Bank of America. Your line is open.","Erika Najarian","Mac I was wondering if you could walk us through how we should expect the balance sheet to grow especially relative to where you are or where you want to be on LCR. How we should think about earning asset growth relative to loan growth?","Mac McCullough","So Erika I would tell you that where we need to be for LCR for 2015 and as we think about what we're going to do going forward to get to 100% we're not going to increase the size of the security portfolio. So we are basically going to be able to take cash flow from the securities portfolio and get the securities that we need to be compliant with LCR at a 100% level. So you won't see the balance sheet grow due to selling compliant with LCR.","Erika Najarian","Got it. And so the pace of balance sheet growth should be roughly equivalent to that of our loan growth assumption.","Mac McCullough","That\u2019s exactly right.","Erika Najarian","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Elliott from Autonomous Research. Your line is open.","Geoffrey Elliott","I wanted to ask on the new slide that you've given us on the impact of swaps. I am talking what net interest income sensitivity would look like if those swaps rolled off. Is that an indication of intend to at all? If rates pan out as you are expecting, are you planning to bring the swap portfolio down or is that purely kind of hypothetical exercise at this point?","Mac McCullough","So we've been pretty consistent in talking about our comfort with the way the swap portfolio is laddered and the way the swaps are rolling off naturally. We provided some guidance around 1 billion of swaps coming off in 2015 and an additional 3.5 billion in 2016 and those are the natural maturities of the portfolio. So we feel very comfortable with that.","Geoffrey Elliott","And so the intension is not replace them by putting on new swaps?","Mac McCullough","That our current intent, we feel like this was a very wise thing for us to do in the rate environment we were in, it actually protected the margin significantly and helped us manage interest rate risk on the balance sheet and we think the timing of these swaps and their current maturities is advantageous for us.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Long from Raymond James. Your line is open.","David Long","In regard to your expansion in Michigan with the new in-store locations in the Meijer Superstore, what kind of expenses did you see here in the second quarter from that initiative? And then with those opening I know about July 1st, what will be the pickup in expenses we should expect here in the third quarter?","Mac McCullough","It's Mac, we\u2019ve got 30 new locations set to open in third quarter, another 10 in the fourth quarter. And you need to keep in mind that we do hire the bankers 60 to 90 days in advance for opening those stores. The remainder of the expenses you can expect to see come online as we open those branches. So not going to go into detail around those specifics of incremental expense related to the expansion, but again I\u2019ll take you back to the expense guidance that we\u2019ve given and we\u2019re very comfortable with second quarter levels.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Scott Siefers from Sandler O\u2019Neill. Your line is open.","Scott Siefers ","Mac I was hoping you could maybe just flash out, sort of what\u2019s going on in overall commercial yields and I guess just kind of pace of degradation. I get what you said about pricing pressure is going to continue, but it can be little tough from outside to given the impact of HTF kind of the pace of degradation whether that softened at all in the second quarter, what are your thoughts there?","Dan Neumeyer","This is Dan, I think that while there continues to be pressure, I do feel that it is starting to stabilize a little bit. So I think the pace of the pricing pressure and structural pressures is maybe leveling out a little bit. So maybe a lesser reduction on a go forward basis than what we\u2019ve experienced today.","Scott Siefers ","And Mac just sort of tricky-tact question, what level if any of integration charges are you expecting per quarter in the second half for the year?","Mac McCullough","I would suggest it's not going to be a material number, it's actually the cost to integrate HTF on full rate [ph] is one of the lowest cost I have ever seen in immigration. So it's really not material.","Scott Siefers ","So in other words the expense guidance for the second half you reported and that\u2019s a core number you're expecting as well?","Mac McCullough","That\u2019s a way to think about it.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Terry McEvoy from Stephens. Your line is open.","Terry McEvoy","You have nice quarter-over-quarter increase in service charges is there any way to separate what is seasonal versus what\u2019s connected to your growing customer base and so is that growth in fees coming from just more customers and does that more than offset what\u2019s going on across the industry in terms of declining fees?","Mac McCullough","So I think the way to think about it, second quarter is typically seasonally strong and I think if you go back and take a look overtime and just get an idea what happens there that\u2019s one way to think about it. It\u2019s probably a little bit more difficult for us because a Fair Play and some other changes that we\u2019ve made. Clearly when you think about the way we acquired new households and commercial customers, a lot of the growth in the new customers have really helped us overcome, some of the changes we\u2019ve made on the Fair Play side. And then with our focus on OCR and deepening relationships that\u2019s been very beneficial as well. And particular treasury management which -- some of the revenue associated with treasury management gets recorded in that line and we\u2019ve had very strong growth in treasury management.","And the last thing I\u2019d point out is that we did make some changes in July of last year that costs us about $6 million a quarter in service charges and we\u2019re basically through that impact at this point. So I would expect to see some favorable growth in service charges for the remainder of the year.","Terry McEvoy","And then you\u2019ve been showing these consumer and commercial relationship product penetration slides for years and they are all up into the right and I guess Mac my question is, what category either consumer commercial is more important for achieving the positive operating leverage, which one should we look at before the other?","Mac McCullough","It's a great question, I think they both have contributed in a pretty material way. I think we\u2019ve had better success in revenue growth related to new customer relationships on the commercial side, I think the bigger opportunity going forward is on the consumer side. So that\u2019s probably how I would think about it. I think a lot of the investments we\u2019ve made on the commercial side of the business particularly on the fee side have paid-off very nicely for us and as we think about the opportunity to deepen relationships on the consumer side of the business going forward and take advantage of all the new households, we\u2019ve brought to the organization that is going to be a nice driver for us going forward.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from the line of Jon Arfstrom from RBC. Your line is open.","Jon Arfstrom","Couple of follow ups here, just one on asset sensitivity, may be, but non-interest bearing deposits have become a much large piece of your deposit base over the past several years. I am just curious how you expect those balances to behave in a rising rate environment? In other words, is the growth driven by consumer household accounts or something else in there that may [indiscernible]?","Stephen Steinour","This is Steve, we started with a strategy of share of wallet along with the share of market. And so we measured loyalty and retention and how that was impacted as we increased share of wallet. Therefore we expect our DDA to be very sticky as a consequences of cross-sell that we've been able to add on both the consumer and the commercial.","Jon Arfstrom","Okay, good. That's helpful. And then a follow up for may be Mac on the accelerated expansion you talked about the branches that are coming online in Q3 and Q4. The incremental expenses done at the end of Q4?","Mac McCullough","There might a few branches that will meet into 2016, but I think for all practical purposes we accrue no expenses around Q4.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby from Vining Sparks. Your line is open.","Marty Mosby","Thanks. Mac I want to touch a little bit about the decision to move around the interest rate sensitivity. You have been keeping it very neutral position which has helped the net interest margin. As you are letting things mature you are giving up a pretty wide spread with the steepness of your curve, and you are going to take all of that 4.3% increase in asset sensitivity really to replace what you are giving up on the interest rate swap. So there is trade off and I just wanted you to kind of talk a little bit on how you are thinking about that?","Mac McCullough","Yes, thanks Marty. So I do think, and we talked about this quite a bit historically that the swaps that we put on and when we put them on, actually did a great job in protecting the margin and you and I talked about that quite a bit. But when we put these on, we didn\u2019t put them on from thinking about a timing perspective and as we let them mature we're not really thinking about it in terms of trying to time what's happening in the market place. We do have a belief as I think most do, the rates are going to rise, if it's not in third or fourth quarter, certainly it will be early next year. And when we think about just the natural maturity of the portfolio it seems like it's the right thing to do just to let these swaps mature. So that's the way we think about it and certainly we're not trying to thread the needle here.","Marty Mosby","The only thing I was, kind looking at is the 4.3% of pickup, gives you about $20 million worth of earnings as rates go up, a full 200 basis points if you look prorating the benefit of the 26 million that is kind of came up with your running off all those asset swaps, you were planning on giving up about $18 million. So it really looks like you are giving up current earnings to wait on the fed funds rate to go up 200 basis points and keeping a neutral balance sheet is always probably the overall goal not be one way or the other.","Mac McCullough","Right, which is the way we thought about it and we have disclosed historically, that we had historically 4 billion to 5 billion of asset swaps on throughout the cycle. So we certainly do think about how to hedge the balance sheet but again we are not trying to thread the needle here.","Marty Mosby","Got you. Thanks so much.","Operator","And this concludes our question and answer session for today. I'll now turn the call back over for closing remarks.","Steve Steinour","We are pleased with what was a record breaking second quarter. Results show that our investments are paying off, our strategies are working, and our execution is focused and strong, and we continue to gain market share and improve share of wallet and show no signs of slowing down. We have produced revenue growth of 9% in a challenging environment while remaining focused on pricing and underwriting discipline. In addition, we made significant progress on the integration of Huntington Technology Finance and are excited about the return profile this business provides. HTF will be a great deal for Huntington shareholders.","With that said, there's always work to be done. We can do better and I don\u2019t want you think we\u2019re content with one record quarter. While we continue to make progress on improving efficiency, we still have significant opportunity for improvement to achieve our long-term goal of an efficiency ratio in the 55% to 59% range. As our past and current adjustments in the businesses mature, we will continue to become more efficient and move towards that goal.","I want to close by reiterating that our Board and this management team are all long-term shareholders. Our top priorities include managing risk, reducing volatility, achieving positive operating leverage and driving solid, consistent, long-term performance and we\u2019re well aligned in these priorities. Thank you for your interest in Huntington. We appreciate you join us today. Have a great day everybody.","Operator","And this concludes today\u2019s conference.

I encourage you to read these. Let me point out one key disclosure. This presentation will reference to GAAP -- non-GAAP financial measures. In that regard, I direct you to the comparable GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation to the comparable GAAP financial measures within the presentation. Additional earnings-related material that we released this morning and the related 8-K filed today, all of which can be found on our website.","Turning to Slide 4.

Now turning to today's presentation. Participants will be Steve Steinour, CEO; Don Kimble, our CFO; Dan Neumeyer, our Chief Credit Officer; and joining us for the Q&A will be Nick Stanutz, Senior Vice President, Head of Auto and Corporate Real Estate. Let's get started turning to Slide 6, and Don?","Donald R. Kimble","Thanks, Todd, and welcome, everyone. We'll begin with a review of our second quarter performance highlights; and then Dan will provide an update on credit; and then Steve will continue with an update on our OCR strategy; and then close with the discussion of our expectations for the remainder of this year.","Turning to Slide 7, we reported net income of $152.7 million dollars or $0.17 per share. That's equal to last quarter, but up 5% and 6%, respectively, from the year-ago quarter. Total revenue decreased $17.9 million, or 3% from the first quarter, all due to a decline in noninterest income, as the first quarter included 2 large gains. Noninterest income declined by $31.5 million at the first quarter, included a $23 million gain from our auto loan securitization, and an $11.4 million bargain purchase gain associated with the Fidelity Bank acquisition.","Importantly, our net interest income increased $13.6 million, reflecting a 2 basis point increase in the margin and strong organic loan growth, as well as the impact of Fidelity Bank and the municipal lease portfolio purchases that occurred late in the first quarter.","Average total core deposits were up 13% annualized from the first quarter, about 1\/2 of which related to the Fidelity acquisition. Noninterest expense decreased $18.4 million as the prior quarter included a $23.5 million increase to our litigation reserves.","The current quarter also reflected lower deposits and insurance -- other insurance costs of $5 million. It was negatively impacted by the $6.8 million of expenses related to Fidelity.","Turning to Slide 8. Steve will go into additional detail later in the call, but you can see that our OCR methodology is continuing to drive success throughout the company.","Turning to credit quality, our metrics were fairly stable. Net charge-offs to loans declined from 85 basis points to 82 basis points this quarter. Nonaccrual loans were up 1%, and our allowance for credit losses as a percentage of nonaccrual loans decreased to 192%, which we still believe will continue to compare favorably to our peers.","With regard to capital, our tangible common equity ratio rose 8 basis points to 8.41%. Our Tier 1 capital ratio decline reflected the impact of growth in risk-weighted assets, as well as our trust-preferred redemption that was completed this quarter. The Tier 1 and total risk-based capital ratios declined by 29 and 35 basis points, respectively.","Turning to Slide 9 and other highlights for the quarter. We successfully completed the integration of Fidelity Bank within 90 days of the acquisition. Cost saves are at or above our planned levels, and we expect to achieve greater than 60% cost saves over the next couple of quarters.","We signed an agreement with Meijer, a leading grocer in Michigan, to increase our in-store distribution by over 80 stores. The repurchased 6.4 million shares is part of our capital plan this past quarter at an average price of $6.26 per share. And Pete Kight joined our Board of Directors. Pete is the founder and former Chairman of CheckFree. He'll bring new insights to our board.","Slide 10 provides a summary of our quarterly earnings trends, and the performance metrics will be discussed later in the presentation.","Turning to Slide 11, we show a summary of income statement. Here, we also show both revenues and expenses adjusted for the impact of significant items in the prior quarter. On both a GAAP on the adjusted basis, revenues and expenses were both up 4% over the prior year. This revenue performance was despite the negative impact of approximately $17 million related to the Durbin Amendment implemented in the fourth quarter of last year.","Slide 12 displays the trends of our noninterest -- net interest income and margin. During this quarter, our fully taxable equivalent net interest income increased by $13.6 million, reflecting the benefit of a $1.3 billion increase in our average earning asset and a 2 basis point increase in our net interest margin to 3.42%. The increase in the net interest margin reflected the impact of 5 basis point increase from the reduction in deposit rates and the improvement in the overall deposit mix. A 2 basis point improvement from balance sheet management changes, which were offset by a 5 basis point reduction related to the impact of the extended low-rate environment on loan yields.","Slide 13 shows the trends in our loan and lease portfolio. Average total loans and leases increased $2 billion or 5% from the prior quarter, primarily reflecting $1.3 billion or 9% growth in average commercial and industrial loans, reflecting the continued organic growth from multiple business lines, including equipment, finance, large corporate and health care, as well as the impact of our $0.4 billion municipal lease portfolio purchased late in the first quarter. A $0.4 billion or 9% increase in the average automobile loans, as we originated $1.1 billion of loans this quarter, which is a new record for us.","The growth in commercial real estate balances reflected the impact of the Fidelity acquisition, as majority of Fidelity loans were commercial real estate.","Last quarter, we gave an update on our auto loan pricing, and given the continued level of originations from this business, we thought it would be helpful to update our recent pricing performance. As you know, we originate super prime and direct auto loans. The charts on the left show the industry rates for the super prime new and used vehicles. Huntington comparable rates are shown on the right, again, segregated between new and used autos. Our originations have had an average FICO score of 760, have been fairly stable over the last several years.","With regard to loans on new vehicles, as shown on the left, the average industry rate in 2012 first quarter for super prime loans was 3.21%. This rate was down 43 basis points from a year earlier. Huntington's average rate, as shown on the right, in the 2012 first quarter was 3.93%, or 72 basis points higher than the industry average. Further, this was down only 33 basis points from the year prior.","The story is similar for used car loans. For the industry, the average rate in the 2012 first quarter for super prime loans was 4.40%, a 66 basis point drop from a year earlier. In contrast, our average rate in the 2012 first quarter was 5.93%, or 153 basis points higher than the comparable industry average.","For the second quarter, our new car rate saw 17 basis point improvement, while our used car rate dropped about 31 basis points. Nevertheless, both new and used car average rates of 4.10% and 4 -- 5.62% offer very respectable returns.","Onto Slide 15, we have shown continued improvement in our deposit mix in the last 5 quarters, as noninterest-bearing DDA balances increased to 27% from 20% of our total average deposits. The improved deposit mix reflects the success of Fair Play banking on growing our consumer DDA, as well as other treasury management and OCR focus on growing commercial demand deposits.","Turning to Slide 16, our total average core deposits are up $1.4 billion or 3%. This reflected a $0.7 billion of deposits from the Fidelity acquisition. The demand deposit growth reflected strong growth in consumer households and commercial relationships, which both increased at about a 12% annualized pace this past quarter. As mentioned last quarter, about $1 billion of our commercial balances reflect temporary deposits, which are expected to decline over the next several quarters.","Slide 17 shows the trends in our noninterest income, which decreased $32 million or 11% from the prior quarter. The decrease reflected $23 million of lower gains on loan sales, as the prior quarter included gains associated with our automobile loan securitization. The prior quarter also included the $11.4 million bargain purchase gain related to the Fidelity Bank acquisition.","Mortgage banking income showed an $8.1 million decrease related to the $7 million decline in our MSR hedging net gain. Service charges on electronic banking provided linked quarter growth of 9% and 10%, respectively, reflecting the impact of our household growth and cross-sell focus. Capital markets fees increased $3.5 million this past quarter, reflecting the benefits from our investment in the strategic initiative.","The next slide summarizes expense trends. Noninterest expense declined $18.4 million or 4%. This reflected the impact of last quarter's $23.5 million increase in our litigation reserves. Other areas of note included $3.6 million decrease in the occupancy costs, which includes seasonal trends, but also a $2 million temporary benefit. A $5 million reduction in deposit and other insurance reflected adjustment to insurance premiums in both the prior and current quarter.","Slide 19 reflects the trends in capital. Our tangible common equity ratio increased to 8.41%, up from 8.33% at the end of the prior quarter. The Tier 1 common risk-based capital ratio declined from 10.15% to 10.08%. These ratios reflected the impact of repurchasing 6.4 million shares in the average price of $6.24 per share. Last month, the Federal Reserve issued a notice of proposed rule-making related to the Basel III capital standards for the United States. These proposed rules have been published for comment and are not yet final. But we estimate, that on a fully phased in basis, our Tier 1 common ratio to be negatively impacted by approximately 150 basis points.","So with that, let me turn the presentation over to Dan Neumeyer to review the credit terms. Dan?","Daniel J. Neumeyer","Thanks, Don. Slide 20 provides an overview of our credit quality trends. The second quarter charge-off ratio showed modest improvement falling from 85 basis points to 82 basis points. Charge-off dollars were fairly flat quarter-over-quarter on an expanding loan portfolio. Loans past due greater than 90 days and still accruing increased in the quarter, with that increase being attributable to the Fidelity portfolio, which is included in our overall numbers in the second quarter.","Fidelity loans include accruing purchased impaired loans which were recorded at fair value upon acquisition and will remain in accruing status.","The NPA ratio increased slightly as consumer OREO assets were reduced in the quarter, but the ratio was impacted by the $1.3 billion reclassification of automobile loans to held for sale. The nonaccrual loan ratio increased slightly from 1.15% to 1.19% as nonaccrual inflows were up in the quarter. The criticized asset ratio increased from 5.8% to 6.01% due to the addition of the Fidelity portfolio.","The allowance for loan and lease loss and the allowance for credit loss-to-loans ratios fell to 2.15% and 2.28%, respectively, from 2.24% and 2.37%, respectively, reflecting continued asset quality improvement. The coverage ratios both fell modestly, although they remain healthy and appropriate given the generally improving loan portfolio.","Slide 21 shows the trends of our nonaccrual loans. The charts on the left demonstrate a modest uptick in the nonaccrual loan ratio in the quarter. This was driven by an increase in nonaccrual loan inflows during the past 3 months. During the second quarter, we moved several large credits, primarily in the commercial real estate portfolio to nonaccrual status. The level of inflow is depicted on the charts on the right-hand side of the page. As you can see by the graphs, the movements from quarter-to-quarter tend to be choppy, and the unevenness is confined to the commercial portfolio where the size of the credits can result in larger swings from quarter-to-quarter. Last quarter's inflows were the lowest reported in several years, underscoring uneven nature of the commercial portfolio.","Slide 22 provides a reconciliation of our nonperforming asset flows. NPAs fell by 1% in the quarter compared to an 11% reduction in the prior quarter. As already mentioned, inflows increased in the second quarter, as several larger commercial credits were moved to nonaccrual loan status and is reflected of the uneven moves mentioned earlier.","The average reduction in NPAs over the last 2 quarters was 6%, consistent with the quarterly reduction experienced in prior quarters. We continue to make good progress in our NPA reductions with the 20% reduction year-over-year.","Turning to Slide 23, we provided similar flow analysis of commercial criticized loans. While a significant increase in inflows was depicted, 213 million of the additions are due to the Fidelity transaction. Upgrades of previously criticized loans also increased in the quarter, and along with pay-downs and charge-offs, resulted in a net 4% increase in criticized commercial loans. As you will see in the footnotes, however, excluding the impact of Fidelity, criticized commercial loans were down 7% in the quarter, which is consistent with the level of quarterly reductions over the past year.","Moving to Slide 24. Commercial loan delinquencies show an increase in both 30- and 90-day categories. The increase in the 90-day delinquencies are exclusively related to Fidelity-purchased impaired loans, which again, are recorded at fair value upon acquisition and remain an accruing status. Even without the adjustments for Fidelity, delinquencies remained very well controlled.","Slide 25 outlines consumer loan delinquencies which are in line with expectations. 30-day delinquencies were flat quarter-over-quarter, as depicted in the chart on the left. Both residential and home equity loans showed improvement quarter-over-quarter, while auto delinquencies were up due to the movement of $1.3 billion of loans to held for sale. In terms of dollar delinquency, the level of auto delinquencies is actually up only modestly from the prior quarter, which is noticeably lower than the 3 quarters prior to that. 90-day delinquencies continue their decline.","Reviewing Slide 26, the loan loss provision of $36.5 million was up marginally from the prior quarter and was less than net charge-offs by $47.7 million. The ratio of ACL -- nonaccrual loans fell to 192% from 206%, still providing a healthy coverage level. The allowance for credit losses to loans was lower at 2.28% compared to 2.37% last quarter. We also believe this to be a solid ratio given the continued improvement in the risk profile of the portfolio and overall improving trends.","In summary, we are pleased to the quarter's results and expect continued positive movement in the upcoming quarters despite ongoing economic challenges.","Let me turn the presentation over to Steve at this point.","Stephen D. Steinour","Thanks, Dan. As mentioned in Don's opening comments of Fair Play banking philosophy, coupled with our optimal customer relationship, or what we refer to as OCR, is driving continued strength in new customer growth and product penetration.","This slide recaps the continued strong upward trend in the consumer checking account households. In the second quarter, consumer checking account household grew at a rate of 11.6% to 1,167,000. Just over 3,000 households were added because of the Fidelity acquisition.","We've grown households to the 12% rate over the last year. And since we've launched our new consumer strategy in the middle of 2010, we've added over 200,000 households. 4+ products or services penetration continued to improve, increasing nearly 1% over the last quarter to 76%. It was nearly a 5 percentage point increase since this time last year.","And for the second quarter, related revenue was $250 million, up $13 million from the first quarter of 2012, however, it was $10 million lower than a year ago. And as you may recall, the fourth quarter negative impact of Durbin to us was $17 million. So when you compare just our consumer household revenue, we've already made up over 40% of the mandated reduction in debit card interchange fees. Slide 34 and 35 in the appendix provide additional details regarding consumer quarterly OCR trends.","We're seeing similar trends in our commercial relationships. As shown on Slide 28, the relationships growth were strong and accelerating. Commercial relationships in the second quarter accrued an annualized rate of 11.9% and were up over 10% from a year ago. At the end of the second quarter, 32.6% of our commercial relationships utilized 4 or more products. This is 0.1 point below last quarter that reflected the combination of both very strong organic growth, the addition of less penetrated Fidelity customer base, and then the typical slightly longer sales cycle that comes with the commercial and small business customers.","Related revenue bounced back from its usual seasonal first quarter weakness, increasing $19 million and was up over 13% from second quarter 2011, as we saw the continued benefits in the investments we made in the company we anticipate from the investments we've made: equipment finance, treasury management and capital markets. Slides 36 and 37 in the appendix provide additional details.","Turning to Slide 29, our strategy of investing the business to grow the customer base, coupled with our OCR sales process to drive additional cross-sell in improved customer retention is positively impacting the company's performance.","The local Midwest economy plays an important role in our customers' needs for additional financial services. As we've been stating for the last couple of quarters, we are concerned with the fragility of the U.S. and global economic recovery, and over the last quarter, have played out with a noticeable economic deceleration. Nevertheless, we continue to benefit from the Midwest recovering faster from the broader U.S., but we remain cautious.","With regard to net interest income, we anticipate modest growth. Momentum we are seeing in our total loan growth, excluding any future impact of additional auto securitizations, is expected to continue as is growth in low-cost deposits. So the benefit from this growth is expected to be mostly offset by net interest margin pressure.","C&I loans are expected to show meaningful growth, reflecting the benefits of our strategic initiatives to expand our business in commercial lending expertise and related verticals, as well as to other geographies. Commercial real estate loans are expected to decline from current levels. Residential mortgages and home equity loan growth is expected to be relatively flat. This view regarding home equity and residential mortgages is a change from our prior expectations noted last quarter, as we continue to evaluate the impact of the new proposed capital rules recently released by our regulators.","We continue to expect to see strong automobile loan originations, though one balance sheet growth will be muted, due to the expectation of completing occasional securitizations. Growth in low- and no-cost deposits remains our focus. Growth in overall total deposits, however, is expected to be slightly less than growth in total loans.","Noninterest income is expected to show modest growth from this quarter's level when you exclude any gains from auto securitizations and any net impact from the MSR. This modest growth, we expect, will be driven by increased cross-sell success, both in key activities related to customer growth, as well as increased contribution from our capital markets activities, treasury management and brokerage business.","For 2012, we continue to anticipate positive operating leverage and modest improvement in our expense efficiency ratio. This will likely reflect more the benefit of revenue growth, as expenses could increase slightly. While we continue to focus on improving expense efficiencies at the company, we anticipate additional regulatory costs and expenses associated with strategic actions.","With credit front, we expect to see continued improvement, albeit at a slower pace than we've seen in the last several quarters. There could be some quarterly volatility given the uncertain and uneven nature of the economic recovery.","The level of provision expense, as mentioned earlier, is at the low end of our long-term expectations. As we've done over the last 2 years, our focus is on continuing to execute our core strategy, make selective investments in initiatives to grow long-term profitability.","We are pleased with our financial performance over the last quarter even as we added -- with the added work of converting the integrated Fidelity Bank in less than 90 days. We remain disciplined in our growth. In pricing of loans and deposits, there's still some leverage there as we continue to fight for every basis point. Our Fair Play, coupled with OCR, is proving to be absolutely the right strategy and market positioning for us.","We continue to believe 2012 will be another year of marked progress in positioning Huntington for better sustained long-term profitability and growth.","So thank you for your interest in Huntington. Operator, well now take questions. [Operator Instructions]","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Erika Penala.","Leanne Erika Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","My first question was just some clarification on the expense guidance. So you mentioned that there's a chance that it could pick up slightly from here. Now if I add back the gain on the early extinguishment of debt this quarter, that takes me to about 4.46, 4.45. Is that what you're talking about in terms of additional uptick? Or is that the base upon which there could be additional uptick in the second half of the year?","Donald R. Kimble","Yes, Erika, this is Don, and I would say that the base as far as our current expense level, that we would be looking for reductions absent the initiatives. And those initiatives include the branch rollout, not only for Giant Eagle, but also for our new relationship with the Meijer organization up in Michigan. And so as a result of those, along with some additional regulatory costs, we would expect to see a slight increase in expenses. Keep in mind, too, that the Fidelity acquisition wasn't in a full expense complement for the second quarter. We do expect to see some cost savings and the fact that we've had some conversion-related expenses associated with that as well.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Miller.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Just question on reserve releases. You've been -- should you -- will we be looking for the roughly $40 million, $50 million per quarter reserve releases going forward? You do have enough reserves, but I was just wondering how to model that going forward?","Daniel J. Neumeyer","Well, as we've mentioned, we're probably -- this is Dan, we're probably at the low end of our provision expense, and we do expect continued modest improvement in charge-offs. So I think that probably answers your question.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Okay. As a follow-up, just on the credit side, are you seeing any material slowdown? There was a couple of banks over the last 2 days that said that Ohio is one of the most price competitive markets in the country. I just wonder if you can add some color on that, Steve.","Stephen D. Steinour","We're not seeing a slowdown, Paul, impact in credit at this point. I think there is a slow down in economic investment and related activity. I believe there's already an impact coming from a combination of factors including -- especially the fiscal cliff being topical at this point and an increasing concern or lack of confidence caused by that.","Donald R. Kimble","And, Paul, this is Don. I could follow up with a point there as well. As far as competitive nature of the pricing, we really focus on relationship pricing, and we believe we've been able to maintain our spreads in the commercial side even though others may be -- characterize Ohio, and some of our markets are being very competitive. And I guess I would just -- I like to highlight there that as far as our commercial loan yields, they're only down 2 basis points linked quarter, and that happens to be the impact of the LIBOR rates being down on average about 2 basis points as well.","Stephen D. Steinour","Then finally, Paul, of the 6 states we do business in, pricing really doesn't vary state-to-state.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I wanted to ask you, Don, about the Basel III adjustment, the 150 basis points. Can you give us some color on where specifically within the portfolio you're seeing most of the RWA step up?","Donald R. Kimble","Yes, good question. We're seeing RWA step up on the residential real estate side and on the off-balance sheet exposure. For the most part, home equity is fairly a net wash given the impact of the first loan position that we have for a lot of our home equity loans.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","And there are nothing in the numerator?","Donald R. Kimble","Numerator impact is primarily OCI-related with the mark-to-market portfolio and pension.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","All right. So that was expected. So 8-6 is still a really strong place to be, but the number is probably a little bit lower than people had anticipated. Does that at all change your view about how you think about stress test magnitude of what you'd ask for your next year as far as dividends and buybacks and, in addition, acquisition opportunities? Has anything changed with regards to how you're thinking about capital, utility and management?","Donald R. Kimble","Great question, Ken. And you're right, we were surprised by some of the proposal here as well. Keep in mind that it is a proposal that we plan to participate with others in responding to the Fed's proposal. As a result of this, we're going to have to take a look at a number of things. We'll have to take a look at our focus on certain products and our pricing associated with those products, if there truly is a change in the capital charge associated with those. I don't think we are far enough down the road as far as taking a look at what the impact would be for future capital plan recommendations or suggestions, but I do not believe it impacts our current plan or projections.","Stephen D. Steinour","But you heard from our comments that we're already starting to adjust. And when we know the final rules, we will adjust to minimize impact.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And my -- just a follow-up question on credit. Some of the movements to non-accruals of some large commercial loans, can you tell us kind of like what the vintage of that, meaning, are those older loans? And have you seen anything in terms of some of the newer growth you put on start to migrate at all?","Daniel J. Neumeyer","They are older vintage. The 2 loans in particular were vintage of approximately 2006, 2007. And, no, we have not seen any of the newer originations, not seen any significant migration in those. Actually, our early stage migration is looking quite strong, which is one of the reasons that we're pretty confident in ongoing improvement in the credit quality metrics.","Operator","Your next question comes the line of Steven Alexopoulos.","Steven A. Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","For my first question, I wanted to just drill into the comments on the competitive landscape a bit. It's remarkable how well the C&I and CRE loan yields are holding in here. Can you talk about the blended yield that you're adding new loans to the portfolio? And do you expect to see more pressure on those loan yields in the second half?","Donald R. Kimble","Yes, this is Don, and as far as the new loan yields, it still is around the LIBOR plus 300. And as far as the spreads going forward, it all depends on the credit outlook for those loans. We tend to focus much more on credit risk-adjusted spreads as opposed to just the absolute loan yield, and we would expect to continue to maintain those credit spreads as we would venture into continued improvement. In the credit quality for new underwriting, we could see some changes there. But that's a reflection of improved expected credit quality as opposed to tighter credit markets.","Steven A. Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Yes. And therefore, my follow-up question, one of your midwestern competitors this morning put up higher provision expense citing commercial as part of the reason, are you seeing anything up there? I know your comments on the macro landscape sounded somewhat cautious. Anything that might put upward pressure on your provision level over the next few quarters, given that you did see an inflow into nonaccrual?","Daniel J. Neumeyer","Well -- this is Dan, I don't think so. And we do really believe that this quarter was affected by a couple of disparate and unique events that happened to skew the numbers. Generally speaking, we expect the numbers to continue to improve. So I don't see anything in the landscape that would require any big movements there. We do have lumpiness from quarter-to-quarter, and it's our expectation that next quarter, we'll see those move down again.","Stephen D. Steinour","Over time, we're traditionally seeing second quarter to be a little more lumpy or volatile, just simply because of annual statements coming in and other things. So if you look back to June 11, second quarter, you would see the same thing in our portfolio, not a lot of change, but breaking the trend line.","Daniel J. Neumeyer","I would also comment that our results do include this year's niche actions, which for us, were very modest. But usually, we don't have those reflected until the third quarter. This year, the results came in earlier, so we made those adjustments, but again, extremely modest in terms of changes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler.","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just looking here on Slide 14, which you referenced earlier in your prepared remarks. What were the main drivers that allowed your auto rates to improve by actually a fairly wide margin while the industry is deteriorating?","Stephen D. Steinour","Nick, you want to take that?","Nicholas G. Stanutz","Sure, Craig. Now this is Nick Stanutz. We have, as you know, we have 1,000-point grid that we use around pricing. And we look weekly at approval rates, the funding rates, and it tells how competitive we are in certain grids at the end of the day. So we are very strategic in how we think about the pricing and where the opportunities are in the market. But we really, at the end of the day, are getting rewarded for being in this business. In the downturn of '09 and '10, with so many left this business, the dealers have come to value, not only our value proposition and our model, but the consistency that we have applied to the dealer and the dealer-centric view we have around this business. And that has really allowed us to be successful at putting the rate in the market that you see here.","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I understand how you could've created value in the crisis when other -- when the cap is sort of pulled out of the market. But what I'd don't understand is what would actually allow the rate to go up sequentially from the first quarter? Is it certain geographies? Is it certain new auto manufactured dealers you've been working with? Anything specific?","Nicholas G. Stanutz","Well, when you think about the grid that we use as pricing point, if we take more volume at a certain pricing point over 1 quarter to the next, we'll have a change in that yield going upward, going down. So it's really very specific and very targeted, our focus about how we think about pricing from week-to-week. And what the market intelligence is telling us by, again, the approval rate of whether we book that loan or not at the end of the day.","Donald R. Kimble","Yes. One thing we keep in mind, too, is that we monitor not only the pricing, but also the aggregate credit outlook for each of these as well. And so we're seeing very consistent FICO scores, very consistent custom scores associated with the borrowers and very similar average maturity and collateral value levels as well. So as Nick said, it really depends more on individual sales within the grid and what type of volume we're picking up in each of those.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Siefers.","R. Scott Siefers - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Steve, I guess, this is probably most appropriate for you. So I think you\u2019re a couple in -- a couple of years into the in-store strategy, and you guys have gone to some length to discuss the kind of the profile of that customer. But now that you're a couple of years into it and then you signed some additional agreements, I wonder if you can talk about how well you're transitioning the customer in terms of product use? There's always that stigma that in-stores are good for deposits, but tough for much else. Now that you're a couple of years into it, maybe if you could talk a little about the success you've had making sort of that customer look like a more traditional branch customer.","Stephen D. Steinour","Sure. Look, Scott, the convenience proposition of 7-day-a-week and extended hour provides a lot of elements to support consumers holistically. And so we've made good deposit progress, but we've always envisioned these as being full service. So they're oriented, they're geared to product education of our colleagues in the in-stores, is around -- and they're -- is around full menu. And their goals and objectives and their incentives are around full menu. So there's -- it's proving to be a good outlet for us for loans, as well as deposit products, and we're now at a point where we're looking at those -- that channel as one we can do more with small business, again, taking advantage of the extended hour and as well as investments. So it's been 21 months. We like what we see. Obviously, we're pleased with the results today, given the Meijer expansion, and frankly, looking forward to having a low-cost or a lower-cost distribution network as a consequence of how much in-store relative to total that we'll have competitively going forward.","Donald R. Kimble","And, Scott, this is Don. If I just could add onto that as well. We look at our cross-sell activity 90 days after the relationship has been initiated, and the cross-sell ratios we're seeing for that 90-day checkpoint are very consistent with what we're seeing in more of the full-service stores. So to Steve's point, we're very pleased with the fact that we're able to just show this is a sales engine force as well and not just a service provider.","R. Scott Siefers - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","All right, that's perfect color. I appreciate that. And then, Don, while I have you, just really quickly -- and my apologies if I missed it, but have you guys given any additional color on the timing of a potential auto securitization and I think you just said second half, but...","Donald R. Kimble","We generally just say that we're looking about 2 a year, but that's all we've really said. We haven't provided any more commentary there. We did transfer roughly $1.250 billion or $1.3 billion held for sale at the end of the second quarter, just to give you some additional color there.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Mutascio.","Christopher M. Mutascio - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Don, I wanted to follow up. Ken asked my question, but I want to follow up to your guidance on the capital from the NPR. The increase in the risk weighted assets, I assume that's tied to perhaps the auto securitizations that are off balance sheet. If that's the case, do you change your viewpoint on how you work that business going forward? Do you keep stuff on balance sheet more than securitizing and getting them off, if you're getting a capital hit any way?","Donald R. Kimble","That really isn't driving much of a change at all. The change is coming from unused lines of credit and also from the residential real estate and a little bit on the CRE side. But the auto book really isn't significantly impacted from this.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mac Pina.","Maclovio Pina - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","I understand that when you talk about losses in your CRE, we expected to see large swings. But this quarter in particular, I'm wondering if there's a particular story behind that increase in net charge-offs?","Daniel J. Neumeyer","There really isn't. These -- there were 2 charge-offs that made up a good portion of that. They were unrelated, both in terms of where they're located, the type of properties and the circumstances. So over time, we tend to look more at where things are trending because you can't have movement from quarter-to-quarter, and we still expect to see continued charge-off performance really across the board, but particularly within commercial real estate.","Donald R. Kimble","These were identified as potential problems before and we did have substantial reserves established even before coming into the quarter. So it's not like these were a complete surprise.","Maclovio Pina - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Yes. So -- and then the story is more about just naturally lumpiness and the size of the loans...","Stephen D. Steinour","Yes. And when you get down to the level -- last quarter, we only had $9 million of CRE charge-offs. So when you're dealing with numbers that are that small, a deal or 2 can move the numbers quite substantially.","Maclovio Pina - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Right. Right, okay. And also quickly on the credit side and kind of a follow-up on your provision expectation. Looking at it from another point of view, I understand it's under -- on your low side, but as a percentage of loans, not as a percentage of releases, going forward, is -- you're booking at around 40 basis points of loans. Can you remind us like what's your long-term expectation for that?","Stephen D. Steinour","Long-term expectation, I guess, I'll say it this way. The -- we're at about our kind of a low point for provision, we have not reached the -- our targeted charge-off level yet. We're targeting over the long-term, 35 to 55 basis points of charge-offs. And clearly, we're not there yet, but moving towards that number.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of David Long.","David J. Long - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","The OCR model is still driving real nice customer acquisitions both in households and businesses. And when you look at the fees, we had real nice increase in the fees, both to service charges and capital markets fees and some other fees. So given the strong performance, have you seen any initiatives by your competitors to try to duplicate the strategy? And if not, why not?","Daniel J. Neumeyer","David, we have not seen strong competitive responses. There are some things that, at the product level, are being done by some institutions. As we said, when we launched 24-hour grace, we felt we had first mover advantage. We didn't expect that to be followed for several years, given overall pressures, which have only intensified and the impact of Durbin. So we are of the belief that we're not going to get a competitive response this year, direct competitive response, could be surprised of course. But thankfully, we've got a lot of momentum and positioning with the product, and we're going to be able to continue with that for the foreseeable future without a direct response. As you look at 2013, a lot of challenges coming from this flat yield curve, and you've seen a couple of regionals announced expense programs. And so very hard to compound the expense program with competitive responses that would strip into the revenue side of the equation.","Donald R. Kimble","David, if I could just also add that if you look to any of our competitors, they all talk about deepening relationship with their customers, and that's the primary area of focus. And I think that's critical, especially for anybody here in the Midwest, that they have to have deep relationships. And so, I don't think that from that perspective, our strategy is unique. We do have some unique products. I think what does differentiate us is our relentless focus on executing a sales management process. And whether you're talking about retail or business banking or auto or our commercial, we actively manage that on a daily basis, report on a weekly basis. And there is a lot of discipline and rigor around that process, and we think that's what's going to drive our differentiated performance and not just the products set. So that's something that's even harder to replicate because it requires a very consistent and ongoing effort, and just not aware of that existing in other places at the level of those here.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jon Arfstrom.","Jon G. Arfstrom - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just one more different question on the competitive environment. Steve, you talked about how parts of the Midwest are recovering faster than the broader U.S. You probably get tired of asking the pricing in the competitive environment question. But maybe you could give us a little bit of a high-level view of some of your submarkets, sub-geographic markets, in terms of which markets you are seeing the best growth and which markets are the most challenging, and I'm particularly interested in your thoughts on the Eastern Ohio, Western Pennsylvania region, and if there's any energy tailwinds that may show up eventually.","Stephen D. Steinour","Well, you can see the impact of what's going on in the energy side in Eastern Ohio, Western Pennsylvania already. I noted the office market in Pittsburgh being dramatically different than it has been for decades. There's certainly a Mahoning Valley, Youngstown-Warren, there's economic activity that we wouldn't have seen just a couple of years ago. And so, it's early. And I believe there will be more and maybe much economic impact, but it's already observable. In terms of the first part of your question for where we're growing the context of competition, Columbus is where our hometown -- the hometown bank here. So that's a meaningful advantage given the legacies that occurred here. And then we've done well in the number of other markets. I'd point out Cleveland where we went 7-day-a-week with retail banking a couple of years ago, a lot of investments we made in Eastern Michigan. And then certain markets, we've had a track record of doing well over time and they're continuing to perform.","Jon G. Arfstrom - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And just in general, Michigan, what -- you're obviously making a bigger bet there, but what kind of expectations do you have for the Lansing, Ann Arbor markets?","Daniel J. Neumeyer","Well, we would expect to grow throughout Michigan and hope we'll be able to achieve that in Lansing and Ann Arbor. Those are new markets to us. We'll rationalize our Meijer distribution over time with further investments. Those -- Ann Arbor is a great market as is Lansing with the state capital and very large university. We intend to significantly invest in Michigan and to grow.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Terry McEvoy.","Terence J. McEvoy - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Steve, could you talk about the opportunities or desires for additional M&A transactions like Fidelity? And then also, could you talk about the acceptance and the rollout of some of your new products within the Fidelity franchise? And did we see any success with that in the most recent quarter?","Stephen D. Steinour","Well, as you know, we've made investments in our capabilities, both on diligence and on acquisitions and integration conversion front. So we've staffed those areas, we've put people in place going back now several years. Their early on work was evident, getting an acquisition at quarter end and then converting and integrating inside 90 days, hitting the expected greater than 60% take out. So we like what we've created and in our abilities to execute. There -- this cycle has been a bit of an anomaly in terms of bank failures, I think, for at least for most of us. I'm not sure what that suggests for the future. It certainly isn't getting easier out there on one hand, but that doesn't necessarily mean failure as we've seen over the last couple of years. So where interest we started today, intending to grow the core at the rates, we're achieving or even better. We want to execute our OCR strategy even better and drive core revenue and profitability. If we can find some opportunities that are financially attractive to the shareholder, we'll pursue those. We look at a number of things. But we don't have -- if we don't see anything strategic, there's nothing compelling that we have to do in our footprint, and we're only interested in our footprint. Did that answer your question, Terry?","Terence J. McEvoy - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Then just one other question for Don. As I build out my model on the mortgage banking line in future years, making maybe the assumption that revenue comes down, could you just provide some color into the related expenses connected to mortgage, maybe in the first half of this year, while I'm able to take out the expenses as well, again going forward.","Donald R. Kimble","Yes, the incremental expense associated with mortgage volume tends to be around 40% of revenues as a general ballpark assumption.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back over to the presenters.","Todd Beekman","Thank you very much for your interest in Huntington. If you do have any follow-up questions, feel free to reach out to me, Todd Beekman, at (614) 480-3878. Thanks very much, and have a good day.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call.

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Mark Muth, Director of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.","Mark Muth","Thank you, Melissa. Welcome. I\u2019m Mark Muth, Director of Investor Relations for Huntington. Copies of the slides we will be reviewing can be found on the Investor Relations section of our Web site, www.huntington.com. This call is being recorded and will be available as a rebroadcast starting about one hour from the close of the call. Our presenters today are Steve Steinour, Chairman, President and CEO and Mac McCullough, Chief Financial Officer. Dan Neumeyer, our Chief Credit Officer, will also be participating in the Q&A portion of today\u2019s call.","As noted on Slide 2, today\u2019s discussion, including the Q&A period, will contain forward-looking statements. Such statements are based on information and assumptions available at this time and are subject to changes, risks and uncertainties, which may cause actual results to differ materially. We assume no obligation to update such statements. For a complete discussion of risks and uncertainties, please refer to the slides and material filed with the SEC, including our most recent Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filings.","Now I\u2019m turning it over to Steve.","Steve Steinour","Thanks Mark. And thank you to everyone for joining the call today. As always, we appreciate your interest and support. We had a solid first quarter and entered 2018 with momentum. We reported net income of $326 million and earnings per share of $0.28, up 65% from the year ago quarter.","Return on common equity was 13% and return on tangible common equity was 17.5%. Average loans increased 9% annualized versus the fourth quarter 2017, driven by disciplined broad-based growth in both commercial and consumer loans. We\u2019re pleased with our first quarter efficiency ratio of 57%, driven by 3% year-over-year revenue growth and expense discipline. The franchise continues to perform well on many fronts as a result of focused execution and the realized economics of the FirstMerit deal.","As previously outlined on Slide 3, we developed Huntington strategies with a vision of creating a high performing regional bank and delivering top quartile trough the cycle shareholder returns. We prudently allocate our capital to ensure we\u2019re earning adequate returns and taking appropriate risk. We also continued to make meaningful long-term investments in our businesses, particularly around customer experience to drive organic growth. We\u2019re very pleased with how we're positioned with the sustainable competitive advantages we've created.","And Slide 4 illustrates our long-term financial goals, which were approved by the Board in the fall of 2014 as part of our strategic planning process. These goals were originally set with a five year time horizon in mind and we fully expect to achieve these goals this year on both a reported GAAP basis and an adjusted non-GAAP basis. Now our first quarter efficiency ratio was near the low end of our long-term goal as a result of the successful integration of FirstMerit, our expense discipline and focus on revenue growth. Charge-offs remain below our long term expectation.","Our 17.5% return on tangible common equity positions Huntington as a top performing regional bank. And these peer leading results demonstrate that our strategies are working and will continue to drive Huntington forward. We're pleased with our first quarter performance against all of these metrics. Also, I\u2019d like to take this opportunity to remind you of the considerable improvement in our financial performance since 2014 when we introduced these goals.","So in the first quarter of 2014, our return on tangible common was 11.3% and our efficiency ratio was 66.4%. So through our disciplined execution over the years, we\u2019ve elevated Huntington from the middle of the peer group to peer leading financial performance, driving a greater than 600 basis point improvement in ROTCE and almost 1,000 basis point improvement in the efficiency ratio alone.","Let's now turn to Slide 5 to review 2018 expectations and discuss the current economic and competitive environment in our markets. We remain optimistic on the outlook for the local economies across our eight states footprint. And as we've noted previously, our footprint has outperformed rest of the nation during the economic recovery that began in mid-2009.","Unemployment rates across the majority of our footprint remain near historical lows. The labor market in our footprint has proven to be strong with several markets such as Columbus, Indianapolis and Grand Rapids, where we see meaningful labor shortages given metro unemployment rates, which are well below national averages. Philadelphia Fed\u2019s state leading indicator indices for our footprint point toward a favorable economic operating environment in 2018, most of the states are expected to see an acceleration in economic activity over the next six months. Four of our states, including Ohio, are expected to grow significantly faster than the nation as a whole.","As a result of federal tax reform, we expect continued business investment and expansion. We are seeing an increased capital expenditure. It's important to remember that our commercial focus is primarily privately held businesses and these companies are likely to reinvest tax benefits into their businesses to fund growth. As in aside Site Selection Magazine\u2019s Governor\u2019s Cup for Capital Investments and New Jobs created in 2017 support our expectations, five of the eight states placed -- five of our eight states placed in the top 10 of the nations for total qualified new projects with Ohio earning the number two spot overall. These rankings and leading indicators confirm our optimism.","But importantly, our loan pipelines remain solid across all footprints. And as we get out and as I talk to different business owners, and I can confirm this is a wide spread level of optimism. In fact, if anything we\u2019re being held back by labor supply shortages. We\u2019re clearly seeing impacts in construction and other businesses where they just can't get enough labor. And as a consequence, we\u2019re starting to see labor inflation, but we\u2019re also seeing businesses now that are working on next year's pipelines of activity. So backlogs are looking good in many of our businesses, manufacturing, construction are two examples. And we\u2019re feeling very good on the whole about this year and stress going into next.","And so while the growth trends will likely not be linear, we remain optimistic with our full year outlook. We expect full year average loan growth in the range of 4% to 6% inclusive of $500 million auto loan securitization in the back half of the year. Full year average deposit growth is expected to be 3% to 5%, and you know for internal forecasts and the guidance purposes. We continue to assume no additional interest rate changes consistent with our approach over the last few years. And while it appears likely that the fed might act again this year, it served us well to take a more conservative approach in our forecasting process.","We expect full year revenue growth of 4% to 6%. We are projecting the GAAP NIM for the full year to be flat and the core NIM to be up modestly in 2018. On the expense side, we are expecting a 2% to 4% decrease from the 2017 GAAP non-interest expense of $2.7 billion. Our expectations include improvement in the efficiency ratio to a range of 55% to 57%, as well as we are targeting positive operating leverage for the sixth consecutive year. We anticipate net charge-offs will remain below our long-term goal 35 to 55 basis points. And importantly, we\u2019ve lowered our expectation for the effective tax rate to the 15.5% to 16.5% range. The range is fully reflective of federal tax reform.","Now looking beyond 2018. We recently began a new three-year strategic planning process. Our pass-through strategic plan significantly advance the Company's financial performance and competitive positioning. To continue this momentum, our initial areas of focus for the 2018 strategic planning process, are number one; top line revenue growth; two, capital optimization; and three, business model evolution incorporating expected disruption. As we stated previously, an important outcome of the strategic planning process will be new long-term financial goals for the Company, and we expect to be in a position to communicate those later in the year.","So with that, let me now turn it over to Mac for an overview of the financials. Mac?","Mac McCullough","Thanks Steve. Slide 6 provides the highlights of the first quarter. As Steve mentioned, we had a good first quarter, but also a clean quarter as there were no significant items. We reported earnings per common share of $0.28 for the first quarter, up 65% over the year ago quarter. The year ago quarter included $0.04 per share reduction due to significant items related to the FirstMerit integration. Return on assets was 1.27%, return on common equity was 13% and return on tangible common equity was 17.5%. We believe all three of these metrics distinguish Huntington among our regional bank peers.","Our efficiency ratio for the quarter was 56.8%. Tangible book value per share increased 2% sequentially and 9% year-over-year. During the first quarter, we repurchased $48 million of common stock, representing 3 million shares at an average cost of $15.83 per share. This completed the $308 million buyback authorization under a 2017 CCAR plan.","Turning to Slide 7. Total revenue was up 3% from the year ago quarter. Net interest income was up 5% year-over-year due to a 5% increase in average earning assets while the net interest margin was unchanged. Non-interest income increased 1% year-over-year with increases in capital market fees, card and payment processing revenue and trust and investment management fees, partially offset by lower mortgage banking income and a reduction in gains on the sale of loans, primarily related to the sale of an equipment finance loan in the year ago quarter.","While both mortgage and SBA originations were higher year-over-year, compression in secondary market spreads in mortgage banking and the timing of SBA loans sales resulted in year-over-year declines in these fee categories. FirstMerit related revenue enhancement opportunities remain on track to deliver over $100 million of revenue in 2018 with an efficiency ratio below 50%. As we stated before, these projections are included in our 2018 guidance.","Non-interest expense decreased 10% year-over-year due entirely to $73 million of significant items expensed in year ago quarter related to the integration of FirstMerit versus no significant items expensed in the current quarter. Expenses were flat versus prior quarter. It should be noted that expenses are historically higher in the second quarter, primarily driven by the timing of compensation associated with long-term incentives and seasonally higher marketing expense, which combined could add up to $20 million compared to the first quarter.","However, these are just timing differences, and as Steve mentioned earlier, we remain comfortable with full year guidance, including full year expectations for non-interest expense per analyst estimate. For a closer look at the income statement details, please refer to the analyst pack and press release.","Turning to Slide 8. Average earning assets grew 5% from the first quarter of 2017. This increase was driven by 5% increase in average loans and leases and 3% increase in average securities. The increase in average securities primarily reflected an increase in direct purchase instruments in our commercial banking segment.","Average C&I loans increased 1% year-over-year with growth centered in middle market banking. On a linked quarter basis, average C&I loans increased 3% or 12% annualized with broad-based growth in specialty, corporate and middle market banking. Average commercial real estate loans were flat year-over-year as we have conservatively tightened CRE lending, specifically in multi-family, retail and construction to remain consistent with our aggregate moderate to low risk appetite and to ensure appropriate returns on capital.","Average auto loans increased 9% year-over-year as a result of consistent and disciplined loan production. Originations totaled $1.4 billion for the first quarter of 2018, up 1% year-over-year. Average new money yields on our auto originations were 3.86% in the first quarter, up from 3.52% in the prior quarter.","Average RV and marine loans increased 32% year-over-year, reflecting the success of our expansion of the business into 17 new states over the past two year. Average residential mortgage loans increased 18% year-over-year, reflecting continued strong demand for mortgages across our footprint, as well as the benefit of our ongoing investment in former FirstMerit geographies, particularly Chicago. As typical, we sold the agency qualified mortgage production in the quarter and retained jumbo mortgages and specialty mortgage products.","Turning attention to the chart on the right side of slide. Average total deposits increased 1% from the year-ago quarter, including 3% increase in average core deposits. In the first quarter, we began to see customer migration into higher yielding deposit products such as CDs and money market accounts.","Moving to Slide 9. Our net interest margin was 3.30% for the first quarter, unchanged from both year ago and linked quarter. Purchase accounting accretion contributed 8 basis points to the net interest margin in the first quarter, down from 10 basis points in the prior quarter and 16 basis points in the year ago quarter. After adjusting for purchase accounting accretion in all quarters, the core NIM was 322 compared to 320 in the prior quarter and 314 in the first quarter of 2017. Growth in core NIM over the past year has more than offset the benefit in purchase accounting accretion.","Slide 29 in the appendix provides information regarding the scheduled impact of FirstMerit purchase accounting for 2018 and 2019. Our deposit cost remained well contained as consumer core deposits were up 5 basis points year-over-year and commercial core deposits were up 18 basis points. With the market outlook for continued rate hikes and increasing deposit competition, we locked in fixed-rate term deposits and selectively increased rates to grow and retain core relationships, providing better economics for the bank relative to the cost of wholesale funding.","On the earnings asset side, our commercial loan yields increased 36 basis points year-over-year, while consumer loan yields increased 11 basis points. On a linked quarter basis, commercial loan yields increased 14 basis points while consumer loan yields increased 3 basis points.","Moving to Slide 10. Our cycle to-date deposit beta remains low at 17% through the first quarter of 2018, and roughly in line with the average of our peers that have reported so far. As we told you last quarter, we are seeing increased deposit competition as competitors conduct various product and pricing tests across our footprint. As a result, we anticipate a continued increase in deposit betas this year, driven by both mix and cost. Assuming two additional rate increases in 2018, our current forecast assumes the deposit beta of approximately 50% for calendar year 2018 with a higher proportion of incremental deposit growth coming in from higher cost of products, including money markets and CDs.","Slide 11 illustrates the continued strength of our capital ratios. During the first quarter, we converted 363 million of high cost Series A preferred equity into common shares, and subsequently issued 500 million of attractively priced Series E preferred equity, improving our capital ratios. Note that the first quarter preferred dividend expense that that include any dividend on the new Series E due to the issuance timing. Therefore, the total second quarter preferred dividend expense will be approximately $21 million or $3 million higher than the future quarterly run rate of approximately $18 million to account for the partial quarters Series E dividend.","Tangible common equity ended the quarter at 7.70%, up 42 basis points year-over-year. Common equity Tier 1 or CET 1 ended the quarter at 10.49% or 75 basis points year-over-year and above our 9% to 10% operating guideline. We believe our earnings power capital generation and risk management discipline will support a higher dividend payout ratio over time.","As we have previously stated, our capital priorities are first organic growth, second support the dividend, and third everything else, including buybacks. With respect to this year\u2019s CCAR, we have a unique opportunity as a result of the two preferred transactions, which pushed CET 1 above the high-end of our operating guideline of 9% to 10%.","Moving to Slide 12. Credit quality remains strong in the quarter. Consistent prudent credit underwriting is one of Huntington\u2019s core principles. And our financial results continue to reflect our disciplined approach to risk management and our aggregate moderate to low risk appetite. We booked provision expense of $68 million in the first quarter compared to net charge-offs of $38 million. The level of provision expense in the quarter reflected the strong commercial loan originations, as well as continued migration of the acquired FirstMerit portfolio into the originated portfolio.","Net charge-offs represent an annualized 21 basis points of average loans and leases, which remain below our long-term target of 35 to 55 basis points. Net charge-offs were down 3 basis points from the prior quarter and the year ago quarter. CRE had net recoveries again this quarter, driven by one large relationship. As usual, there is additional granularity on charge-offs by portfolio in the analyst package in the slides. The allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of loans increased 2 basis points linked-quarter to 1.01%, and coverage of non-accrual loans was 188%.","Turning to Slide 13. Non-performing assets increased $31 million or 8% linked-quarter. The NPA ratio increased 4 basis points sequentially to 59 basis points. The criticized asset ratio increased 7 basis points from 3.53% to 3.60%. Our 90-day plus delinquencies declined 2 basis points. NPA inflows increased 6 basis points. Overall, asset quality metrics remain cyclical lows and some quarterly volatility is expected given the adequate low level of problem loans.","Turning to Slide 14. We highlight Huntington\u2019s strong position to execute on our strategy and provide consistent through-the-cycle shareholder returns. The graph on the top left quadrant represents our continued growth in pretax, pre-provision net revenue as a result of the focused execution of our core strategies. The strong level of capital generation positions us well to fund organic growth and return capital to our shareholders, consistent with our capital priorities.","The top right chart highlights the well-balanced mix of our loan and deposit portfolios. We are both a consumer and commercial bank, and believe that the diversification of the balance sheet will serve us well over the cycle. We were pleased with the 2017 DFAST and CCAR results, which provide an instant quarterly industry comparison. The results illustrate our strong enterprise risk management and our discipline to operate within our aggregate moderate to low risk appetite. Our DFAST stress test results are highlighted in the bottom left.","Finally, the bottom right demonstrates Huntington\u2019s strong capital position. As we return to the key messages on Slide 15, let me turn the presentation back over to Mark for Q&A.","Mark Muth","We will now take questions. We ask that as a courtesy to your peers, each person ask only one question and one related follow-up. And then if that person has additional questions, he or she can add themselves back into the queue. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. At this time, we\u2019ll be conducting a question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Sandler O\u2019Neill and Partners. Please proceed with your question.","Scott Siefers","First question, Steve maybe for you, I just wanted to talk about the outlook that you guys have always been extraordinarily conservative on the rate outlook. It looks like it\u2019s going to come in more accommodative than is embedded in your outlook for no rate increases. So in a sense that difference end up becoming kind of found money. So I guess if we were to get another hike or two, what is at a top level the plan? If you allow that similarly to drop to the bottom line or do you think about maybe reinvesting accelerating some costs, may be being even more aggressive on taking deposit market share, et cetera. What would be your thinking at the top level?","Steve Steinour","We budget, we plan for no rate increases, but we obviously run scenarios around it. Mac shared that with, Scott, on the call in terms of deposit betas. We do think this environment is one that\u2019s conducive to us growing organically in a meaningful way. Pleased with the first quarter and we closed with good pipelines as we come into the second quarter. So we would expect the organic growth to continue. And in that construct look to continue to grow both the deposit and lump side, we\u2019re very focused on the fee side of the quarter and what we can do prospectively on that front as well.","We had good SBA activity, for example, but we ended up seeing a lot more of a construction nature than we\u2019ve had before. So it\u2019s a sign of capital investment. There is a belief that by operating in this more conservative fashion, we\u2019ll be a little more agile as we move forward with the benefit of rate increases. Anything you want to add, Mac?","Mac McCullough","Scott the way to think about it is a 25 basis point increase in rates on an annual basis is about $25 million in margin on an annual basis. So that obviously says a lot of assumptions around what we're expecting from the deposit betas and competition in the marketplace. And of course the lapping yield curve has not been conducive to that either. So we\u2019re a little bit cautious as we move through this. We do think there will be opportunities from increasing rates, but at the same time, we\u2019ve never focused on growing core deposits. We had great core deposit growth year-over-year at about 3%, and we aim to continue to do that.","Scott Siefers","And I guess what I was getting at it, let's say, you get that some portion of the $25 million, you just let that drop straight to the bottom line use that as an opportunity to maybe spend a little more than you would have anticipated? Just given the disconnect between how you\u2019re likely to pan out in terms of rate moves versus what you guys are forecasting in the guidance?","Steve Steinour","Scott, we have significant investment built into the 2018 budget already. So clearly, we will be opportunistic as we think about what might happen from a rate increase perspective. And I would expect that majority of that would drop to the bottom line, but we\u2019ll selectively think to look at the investment opportunities on the digital front and in particular in customer experience and our colleagues.","Scott Siefers","And then just maybe one follow-up. What was it that lapping you guys to improve the tax rate guide just a little bit. I mean I know it\u2019s not huge, but just curious your thoughts.","Steve Steinour","What it really came down to Scott is we\u2019d like to give you ranges that are meaningful in terms of actually being able to achieve and fall within the range. And the fact of the matter is 17% would just be fine. So that\u2019s why we felt 15.5% to 16.5% was a better range for us to consider going forward.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.","Sam Ross","This is actually Sam Ross on for John this morning. I just had a question about the ROTC guidance. I appreciate the fact you guys are currently reviewing your three year plan. I am just wondering given the fact where your 1Q ROTC came in. What do you guys thinking is an appropriate level for 2018 for you guys to operate in?","Mac McCullough","So I would expect to be in that range. I mean, we\u2019re in the process of going through the long-term strategic plan. We\u2019re going to come out later this year with our new expectations for all those metrics. It's really important to keep in mind that we're going to operate within an aggregate moderate to low risk appetite, and a 17.5% ROTCE with an aggregate moderate to low risk appetite is pretty good in our estimation. So I wouldn\u2019t expect that you're going to see significant change within that goal going forward, but we\u2019ll go through the strategic planning process and we\u2019ll let you know later this year.","Sam Ross","And then just looking at the balance sheet. In terms of the non-interest bearing deposits, I know you guys touched up on it in your prepared remarks about a mix shift that you guys are seeing into more higher interest rate products. I am just wondering was there anything outside of seasonality, you can maybe provide a little bit more color on if the sizeable decline in non-interest bearing deposits, I think that would be helpful. Thanks.","Mac McCullough","I think what\u2019s happening, Sam, as you're seeing our commercial customers in particular being much more sensitive in terms of what's happening in the rate environment. And we're seeing them move balances from non-interest bearing into interest bearing, which I think you would expect in this environment. So that would be an additional factor on top of seasonality.","Sam Ross","And would you expect that dynamic to continue into 2018 or what do we think about in terms of that?","Mac McCullough","At some point, they complete the movement that they want to make from one category to the other. Clearly, as rates continued to increase, we\u2019re going to have commercial customers ask for some sharing of rates. But I think the mix shift should probably slowdown as we move forward.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please proceed with your questions.","Unidentified Analyst","This is actually Josh on for Ken. Average wholesale funding showed a large sequential increase this quarter. Do you think there's potential to remix these wholesale sources into deposits, and then how you\u2019re thinking about funding the loan growth going forward?","Mac McCullough","So we are actively thinking about what we need to do from a deposit rate perspective to bring wholesale funding down, particularly the overnight category. When we think about what we do on the commercial customer deposit pricing, we think about what rate we would provide to them relative to cost of growth overnight funding or across wholesale funding. So I would expect that you\u2019re going to see that continue to come down over time, and it should be an opportunity for us as we think about just the trade off and the rate improvement when we move the commercial deposits.","So I think if you take a look at in the period, in particular you\u2019ll see this already down significantly that\u2019d be in the overnight funding. And then going forward, we are focused on core deposit growth. Like I\u2019ve mentioned in my comments, we grew 3% in core deposits year-over-year, which I think is a pretty good showing relative to our peers in the industry. We've had a lot of success with CD products and we were looking at some money market opportunities as well. So I think core deposit funding will be the primary way we\u2019re going to fund going forward.","Unidentified Analyst","And we've heard from some of your peers that they\u2019re seeing a pretty benefit from the rollover of their swap portfolios. Could you just speak to what you're seeing in regards to this?","Mac McCullough","So at this point, all of our asset swaps are off at this point. We have no assets swaps on. The last asset swap rolled out in the first quarter. We evaluate some of the debt swaps we have inside the time, and that represent an opportunity for us, but have not taken any action there as of yet. Josh does that answers your question.","Unidentified Analyst","I was actually referring more to the rolling over the spreads, so better new money spreads versus what's rolling off as that liability side swap portfolio rolls.","Mac McCullough","Clearly, we probably do have opportunities there. I don\u2019t think it would be large in the scheme of things for us.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steven Alexopoulos with J.P. Morgan. Please proceed with your question.","Steven Alexopoulos","I want to start first on the loan growth. You guys have really solid C&I loan growth in the quarter. And Steve, you\u2019re very optimistic in regard to business confidence, the economic strength of the footprint. As you look at the pipeline, could the high single digit growth you put up this quarter on average loans continue in the second quarter or is that really just an anomaly the way you look at it?","Steve Steinour","The pipeline that we came into the year with was very strong. We had a surge in activity late in the year. So first quarter was very, very good with the carryover pipeline. As we come into the second quarter, we also have a sound pipeline across all the segments all of our businesses. And so there is an underlying sense of economic activity that we\u2019re able to participate in through our customers that we would expect to carry forward with the year. We clearly are seeing more CapEx related investments than we have in quite a few years at this stage Steven.","Steven Alexopoulos","So is that why the average was so strong in the quarter as your customers spending, I mean the line utilization increase in the quarter?","Dan Neumeyer","Our line utilization was off just a tick, so that really didn't benefit all that much. I do think we\u2019ve seen more of an evening out of where the growth is coming from. Core middle market has been good. I think we are not seeing the impact we saw last year in the large corporate space. I think we\u2019re actually seeing a bit of a pickup there and then some of the [indiscernible] as well. So it\u2019s good broad based contribution. And as Steve said, the pipeline remains fairly strong.","Steven Alexopoulos","And then for my other question, I want to follow-up on the commentary around digital initiatives and what you\u2019re doing on the customer experience side. What the expected spend on technology this year and how does that compared to last year? Thanks.","Mac McCullough","Steven, we don't disclose the spend on technology. I will say that it\u2019s up year-over-year in terms of what we're investing in technology development. And I would also tell you that the portion of that allocates to digital is up significantly year-over-year.","Steven Alexopoulos","It is up significantly year-over-year, is that what you said?","Mac McCullough","Yes.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your questions.","Ricky Dodds","This is actually Ricky Dodds for Matt. I just wanted to hear your thoughts on or is there a build going forward. We\u2019ve seen a number of your peers have large reserve releases this quarter. Just wondering if you could provide some color for Huntington going forward, I know you have some FirstMerit renewals and you have stronger loan growth. But wondering if you just provide a little more color there?","Steve Steinour","Well, in the quarter clearly with the loan growth that is going to come as additional reserve, so that's a large piece of it. The FirstMerit impact is still there although that\u2019s lessening each quarter. And then we did have some modest migration in the credit side and non-accrual loans that also contributed to the build. But as we\u2019ve said over time, we expect the level of provision to moderate with both loan growth and more normalizing credit performance. Although, we expect the net charge-offs to continue to be below our long term expectation. So as we\u2019ve said, it\u2019s low build back up in the reserve but it will be modest and a slow ramp.","Ricky Dodds","And then maybe just a follow-up on loan growth, it was particularly strong and you guys called out the core middle market. I was wondering if you could provide any specific colors on industries or geographies, and maybe outperforming our verticals, just wondering if you add any color there.","Steve Steinour","Well, I think obviously in our heavy manufacturing market rates, in particular we're seeing strong demand there. But throughout our region, we have many areas that are involved in manufacturing. Chicago continues to be a strong growth market and that is far more diversified. I would say really most industries that we're looking at, I would say would have a positive outlook manufacturing wholesale, et cetera. And so really pretty good reads from all of our customers across most industries.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please proceed with your question.","Marty Mosby","I wanted to ask, the only weakness really on the revenue side was in two categories, loan sale gains and mortgage banking. I was curious in a sense of -- I know you had some balance sheet optimization coming out of the merger. So I was trying to figure out was the $15 million to $18 million that and now we're back down to $8 million to $10 million of loan sale. And then is mortgage banking seasonal, have you seen any pick up or improvement in pricing as well as originations for the second quarter in that fee line item?","Mac McCullough","So on the loan sale question, I would tell you that a lot of in this timing of SBA in the first quarter. So originations are actually up year-over-year. So good continued progress there, particularly as we move into Chicago and Wisconsin. So I view this as really a timing issue on the most part. In the first quarter of last year, we did have a large equipment sale that contributed at the first quarter. And those are lumpy, as you know, so that again is a timing issue.","On the mortgage origination side, again volumes were up but favorable spreads are down. And a lot of the origination pickup has come from the FirstMerit expansion into Chicago and Wisconsin. And I would also tell you getting stronger in some of the core markets, primarily on the FirstMerit side. So we\u2019re pleased with what we\u2019re seeing from origination perspective. But again, the sale of spread being down that\u2019s impacted the fee line.","Marty Mosby","And then purchase accounting accretion is one of those things that is forced upon us, but has been having some impacts when you start looking at just how the market views your earnings. Now that we got a year to look back, you cut your first accounting accretion in half, but held your margin flat and actually grown net interest income. Do you feel like -- with the guidance, it seems like you\u2019re feeling very comfortable but as that headwind comes slows down that the balance sheet growth and then the core margin expansion would actually begin to really pick up some pace relative to whatever loss you might have in purchase account accretion?","Steve Steinour","I am very pleased with what we are seeing in the core margin. We\u2019ve increased a few basis points per quarter since the first quarter of 2017, and we expect that to continue in 2018 as well. So right now, the guidance we\u2019re giving is flat to reported margin as we continue to burn off the purchase accounting accretion. Could it be a little bit better, it might be. It just depends on where deposit pricing goes and what it\u2019s going to take to fund the balance sheet. But very really pleased with how we come through the runoff in purchase accounting. And I think it really is disciplined pricing on both the asset and the liability side that\u2019s allowed us to do that.","Marty Mosby","And then just the last thing, if you look at flat fed funds from here, but your core margin is still improving. Is that just like -- I think you highlighted the fact that the market rates are higher than the portfolio, both in securities and loans. So rounding up those yields just with stagnant rates where they\u2019re at right now is a very possible and reasonable outcome?","Steve Steinour","Yes, I would agree with that. As we look at new money rates, they are generally higher than what\u2019s in the portfolio. We still have some purchase accounting impact that we\u2019re swimming through there. But again, we\u2019re very disciplined in how think about pricing, the asset side of the balance sheet. And even in a flat environment, we\u2019re going to continue to see new money come on at higher rates in the portfolio.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Peter Winter with Wedbush Securities. Please proceed with your question.","Peter Winter","You guys talked about the seasonal increase in expense in the second quarter. I\u2019m just wondering would that be offset with a seasonal increase on the revenue side and so therefore, maybe the efficiency ratio should be at least steady in the second quarter?","Mac McCullough","So typically, we do see a seasonal increase in revenue in the second quarter. The two are disconnected of course, because the increase in expense has primarily to do with just the timing long-term equity compensation, as well as seasonal marketing, which typically is higher in the second and third quarters and then declines in the fourth quarter. So based on that, it wouldn\u2019t surprise me if the efficiency ratio stayed in the same level, because we do see seasonality in revenue to the up side in the second quarter.","Peter Winter","And then second separate question, it\u2019s minor but there was that uptick in non-performing assets. And I understand there\u2019s volatility at the bottom. But could you just give us a little bit of color on the increase in NPAs this quarter?","Dan Neumeyer","So not industry driven, we have from time-to-time when you\u2019re down at very low levels of NPAs any couple of credits can move that we had three credits in the quarter in unrelated in industries. So no trends that we\u2019re overly concerned about. It was really idiosyncratic events, particularly to those three individual credits.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brock Vandervliet with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Brock Vandervliet","I just want to circle back on the comment on deposit betas. It would seem like you may just be being conservative with 50% deposit beta that\u2019s clearly not visible in the numbers at the moment. Are you seeing -- is this caution on the commercial side? You noted the change in potential changing category that\u2019s driving some of that commentary.","Mac McCullough","So the 50% reference would be to any rate increases in 2018. So that might be a little conservative as we think about it. But again, we\u2019re very focused on growing core deposits. If you take a look at across our region and who we compete with, we think it\u2019s very rational. We see what\u2019s happening and there is lots of testing from a pricing and product perspective. We\u2019re doing the same thing. But clearly, I think it\u2019s a good assumption for us to think about for 2018 just given the environment and the desire for us to continue to grow.","Brock Vandervliet","And separately marine and RV. Clearly, growing very rapidly as that\u2019s been a new initiative for you. How large is that likely to become given that we are late in the cycle?","Dan Neumeyer","Well, we do see growth opportunity out there. And we feel very comfortable because the quality of the borrowers that we\u2019re originating credit for is really in the super prime range. So I think given the fact that we\u2019ve expanded our markets, there is a big universe out there. The competition is not as robust as in say indirect auto. But we\u2019re originating at 90 plus FICOs for bid price both in RVs with folks with demonstrative liquidity, all these deals are individually underwritten. So we believe that there is potential out there for high quality assets. We have established a concentration limit so our growth will be moderated by that limit. But we have plenty of run way that we think will serve us well as we develop that business further.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jon Arfstromwith RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Jon Arfstrom","Just following up on Brock\u2019s question, I hate to go back to deposit beta again. But basically, what you\u2019re saying is at this point you're performing just like everybody else in the mid-teens. But going forward from here, you expect the pressure to step up. That's all you\u2019re saying. Is that right?","Mac McCullough","Jon, I think we\u2019re building that into the way we\u2019re thinking about the forecast. Again, we like to be conservative from a rate outlook perspective. We like to understand what\u2019s the revenue environment is going to be. And then from that determine what investments we want to make and how we manage the expense line. So it just keeps us from web selling but the business segments and the colleagues in terms of everyday out there doing their job. So I think that\u2019s exactly the way we stated that.","Jon Arfstrom","Related question on the revenue growth guidance is the same at 4% to 6% as the prior quarter but we did get the March increase. It would get a couple more is the mac view of the world that the margin can drift higher?","Mac McCullough","Yes, I think it can. I mean keep in mind that as I mentioned earlier, 25 basis point increase is worth $25 million in the full year basis. That\u2019s about 0.5% growth in revenue. So the 25 basis point increase in March wouldn\u2019t cause us to do anything to change our revenue guidance of 4% to 6%. But clearly in a rising rate environment, if we get the increases as might be expected, I would expect the margin to move higher.","Jon Arfstrom","And then if I can just squeeze in one more. Steve, you made a comment on loan growth, you don't expect it to be linear. Just the nuance comment or is there any point you're trying to make on that?","Steve Steinour","No, we just have a really strong first quarter. And while we are in the second quarter with good pipelines across all products just trying to be a bit cautious with -- in the context for the full year, the outlook and optimism we see that we\u2019ve communicated is abundant throughout the marketplace. So if anything there maybe a little upside.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Terry McEvoy with Stephens Inc. Please proceed with your question.","Terry McEvoy","The consumer auto yields were down about 5 basis points quarter-over-quarter, and that\u2019s after trending higher throughout 2017. I believe you changed the credit scoring model early in last year. Were there any tweaks made to that model earlier in the first quarter and what are your thoughts on yields coming down?","Steve Steinour","No tweaks and Terry, it\u2019s probably purchase accounting related. So we\u2019re seeing run-off from purchase accounting entries on that book and that\u2019s likely what\u2019s driving.","Terry McEvoy","And then as a follow-up, maybe question for Dan. A few of your peer banks or national banks have scaled back expectations on CRE growth this year just based on, call it, market competition. What are your thoughts on incremental growth going forward after pretty solid growth here in the first quarter?","Dan Neumeyer","I mean, the CRE can be a bit lumpy, because the various projects can move the needle. So we are continuing to support our core customers. But we've been pretty cautious in making sure that we have lessened our construction exposure recently, as we\u2019ve noted before been careful on multi-family and retail. But we\u2019re continuing to originate. We\u2019re still seeing good deal flow, and we are choosing those products or projects that are -- where we can get adequate structure and reasonable pricing. So we\u2019ll continue business as usual in the CRE space.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back to Steve Steinour for closing comments.","Steve Steinour","So thank you very much. We feel very good about where we are. We obviously produce good results in the first quarter. And we're confident about our year, going forward. Our top priority is growing our core businesses and that's continuing. And we think there's more opportunity at hand, certainly throughout the year. We're building long-term shareholder value with top quartile financial performance, and we're maintaining strong risk management with disciplined execution across our strategies. So like the performance and position but feel we have upside opportunities to do better in a number of businesses.","So finally, I'd like to include a reminder that there's a high level of alignment between the board, management, our colleagues and our shareholders. Collectively, the Board and colleagues are the seventh largest shareholder in Huntington and all of us are appropriately focused on driving sustained, and want to emphasize long-term performance. So thanks for your interest in Huntington. We appreciate you joining us today. And have a great day.","Operator","Thank you.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mark Muth, Director of Investor Relations.","Mark Muth","Thank you. Welcome. I'm Mark Muth, Director of Investor Relations for Huntington. Copies of the slides we will be reviewing can be found on the Investor Relations section of our Web site, www.huntington.com. This call is being recorded, and will be available as a rebroadcast starting about one hour from the close of the call.","Our presenters today are Steve Steinour, Chairman, President and CEO; Zach Wasserman, Chief Financial Officer; and Rich Pohle, Chief Credit Officer. As noted on slide two, today's discussion, including the Q&A period will contain forward-looking statements. Such statements are based on information and assumptions available at this time, and are subject to changes, risks, and uncertainties, which may cause actual results to differ materially. We assume no obligation to update such statements. For a complete discussion of risks and uncertainties, please refer to this slide, and the material filed with the SEC, including our most recent Forms 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K filings.","Let me now turn it over to Steve, who will start on slide three.","Steve Steinour","Thanks Mark, and thank you to everyone for joining the call today. As always, we appreciate your interest and support. We're pleased with our full-year 2019 results and the continued momentum across the bank, despite a challenging operating environment.","For the full-year, we reported earnings per common share of $1.27, an increase of 6% over 2018. Return on average assets for 2019 was 1.3%. Return on average common equity was 13%, and return on average tangible common equity was 17%. The bank achieved record net income for the fifth consecutive year and positive operating leverage on an adjusted basis for the seventh consecutive year. Our balance sheet is very well-positioned with robust capital and liquidity, and our comprehensive hedging strategy has reduced interest rate risk. Credit quality remains strong with 2019 net charge-offs at the low-end of our average through the cycle target range. We remain prudent with our allocation of capital to ensure we are earning adequate returns and taking appropriate risks, consistent with our aggregate moderate-to-low risk profile. 2019 marked the ninth consecutive year of an increased cash dividend, coupling the dividend with $441 million of share repurchases during the year. We returned over $1 billion to our shareholders in 2019, which represented a total payout ratio of 79%.","As we previously communicated on many instances, our capital priorities are first to fund organic growth, second, to support the cash dividends, and finally, all other capital uses including the buyback and selective acquisitions. These capital priorities have not changed.","Now, moving to the economy, we continue to see growth and our expectation for 2020 is for continued expansion. Consumers continue to perform well across our footprint with strong labor markets driving wage inflation. In the 12 months ending November 2019, unemployment rates declined or remain the same in 17 of the 20 largest MSAs in Huntington's footprint states. Job openings continue to exceed unemployment levels in the Midwest. Home prices continue to appreciate with especially solid increases in Michigan, Indiana, and Ohio. Additionally, consumer confidence in our region has generally stayed at the highest levels since 2000. The positive consumer sentiment is evident in the success of our consumer lending businesses. Our home lending business achieved record mortgage originations for both full-year 2019 and the 2019 fourth quarter. Our auto finance business also achieved record originations in the fourth quarter, and we expect another good year in 2020 for our consumer lending businesses, again driven primarily by residential mortgage and auto finance.","Now, we have seen a slowdown in commercial loan activity consistent with the measured tone from some of our commercial customers. Economic uncertainty along with tight labor markets remain headwinds for more robust economic growth in our footprint. Overall, Huntington is performing well with disciplined organic growth. Our customers are generally confident about their performance for 2020, and we share that confidence in our performance. We continue to see good traction in our new specialty lending verticals of mid-corporate lending, technology, media and telecom, our practice finance area, which we announced as part of the 2018 strategic plan.","Looking out to 2020, we proactively took actions in the fourth quarter to drive organic revenue growth, reduce our future expense growth, and increase our capacity for additional investment in our businesses and technology. We reposition $2 billion of securities picking up approximately 70 basis points of yield on those securities. The rebalance resulted in $22 million of security losses in the fourth quarter.","On the expense side, we completed the position reduction of employees and announced the consolidation of 30 in-store branches, and these actions along with the disposition of other properties and a technology system decommission resulted in unusual expense of approximately $25 million in the quarter. Our disciplined expense management allows for further investment in digital and mobile technology, and enterprise growth initiatives going forward. I'm confident in our positioning entering 2020, and our colleagues are focused and executing our plans. We are all aligned with our strategies of creating a high-performing regional bank and delivering top quartile through the cycle shareholder returns.","Zach will now provide an overview of our financial performance. Zach?","Zach Wasserman","Thanks, Steve, and good morning everybody. It's a pleasure to be with you here on my first earnings call with Huntington. Slides four and five provide highlights of our full-year 2019 and fourth quarter 2019 results respectively, many of which Steve already touched on. Fourth quarter results include approximately $47 million of pre-tax impact, or approximately $0.03 per share after-tax from previously announced actions that were taken to better position the bank for 2020, including the securities repositioning, workforce actions, and the pending in-store branch closures.","Let's turn to slide six to discuss the key fundamental drivers behind the financial performance for the quarter. Average earning assets increased $2.3 billion, or 2%, compared to the year ago quarter. Average loans and leases increased $1.3 billion, or 2% year-over-year with balanced consumer and commercial loan growth. Average commercial and industrial loans increased 3% from the year ago quarter, and reflected the largest component of our year-over-year loan growth. C&I loan growth has been well-diversified over the past year with notable growth in specialty banking, asset finance, and corporate banking. Our fourth quarter commercial loan growth was below our expectations. As a portion of yields we expected to close at the end of the year were pushed into 2020 and seasonal declines in line utilization at year-end were larger than normal. Overall commercial activity continues to be restrained by economic uncertainty.","We continue to actively manage our commercial real estate portfolio around current levels with average CRE loans reflecting a 2% year-over-year decrease, driven by pay downs and refinancing activity. Consumer loan growth remained focused in the residential mortgage portfolio, reflecting robust origination in the second-half of 2019. Average residential mortgage loans increased 7% year-over-year. As we typically do, we sold the agency-qualified mortgage production in the quarter and retain jumbo mortgages and specialty mortgage products.","Now, turning to slide seven, average total deposits decreased less than 1% year-over-year, while average core deposits increased 1% year-over-year. Note that both of these growth rates were negatively impacted by the June 2019 sale of the Wisconsin Retail Branch Network, including approximately $725 million or almost 1% of core deposits. We continue to see a migration in deposit balances from CDs and savings into money market accounts, reflecting shifting customer preferences, and where we are focused on promotional pricing. Average money market deposits increased 9% year-over-year, while savings decreased 9%, and core CDs decreased 16%. We expect this dynamic to continue in 2020. Average non-interest bearing and interest bearing DDA accounts, each increased 1% year-over-year. As shown on slide 32 in the appendix, we're very pleased that our commercial non-interest bearing deposit increased 5% year-over-year on the quarter. This growth highlights our continued focus on growing our low cost deposit base through new customer acquisition and relationship deepening.","Moving now to slide eight, FTE net interest income decreased $55 million or 7% versus a year ago quarter, primarily driven by the 29 basis point decline in net interest margin partially offset by 2% increase in average earning assets. Net interest margin was 3.12% for the quarter, down 29 basis points from the year ago quarter, down eight basis points link quarter. And in line with the guidance we provided the Goldman Sachs conference in December.","Moving to slide nine, our core net interest margin for the fourth quarter was 3.08%, down 26 basis points from the year ago quarter. Purchase accounting accretion have contributed four basis points to the net interest margin in the current quarter, compared to seven basis points in the year ago quarter. Slide 28 in the appendix provides information regarding the actual and scheduled impact of first merit purchase accounting for 2019 and 2020. Please note that this quarter is the last quarter we intend to write core NIM and PAA breakouts, as the PAA is expected to have a relatively immaterial impact in 2020.","Turning to asset to earning asset yield, our commercial loan yields decreased 52 basis points year-over-year, consumer loan yields decreased eight basis points and security yields decreased 16 basis points. The decrease in our earning asset yields can be primarily attributed to lower interest rates following the three Federal Reserve rate reductions that occurred during 2019. On the funding side of the balance sheet, our deposit costs continue to move lower. As CDs and money market promotional rates re-price lower, and we actively manage commercial deposit costs. Total interest bearing deposit costs of 87 basis points for the quarter were up 3% year-over-year. So down 11 basis points sequentially.","Slide 10 summarizes the actions we've taken to reduce the unfavorable impacts of interest rate volatility and the lower interest rate environment. Our hedging strategies reduced the downside risk for lower interest rates and have significantly narrowed the band of modeled outcomes for net interest income. Our current interest rate risk modeling suggests little changed in interest income from either a 25 basis point increase, or 25 basis points decrease in 2020. We continuously monitor and will continue to prudently refine our interest rate risk management as the interest rate environment, balance sheet mix and other factors necessitate.","The graphs on the bottom left of the slide detail the mix of our loan portfolio, as well as the significant consumer deposit balances with re-pricing events in the first-half of 2020. These re-pricing events provide an opportunity for the bank to reduce the cost of deposit, as these higher price CDs and promotional money market accounts re-price lower. Through December, the consumer deposit re-pricing activity is on track with our expectations. The success of our consumer depository pricing and retention has provided us the ability to remain more disciplined in our commercial deposit pricing, particularly among the highest cost deposits. The graph on the bottom right of the slide displays the impact of our actions. You can see the downward trajectory of our total interest bearing deposit costs by month since July. We expect this trend to continue given the significant deposit re-pricing opportunities that remain in the first-half of 2020.","Turning to slide 11, you can see it provides the detail on our non-interest income, which increased 13% from the year ago quarter. The growth was highlighted by mortgage banking income, which increased 152%, primarily reflecting higher saleable origination volume and secondary market spreads, as well as a $12 million increase in the gain on net mortgage servicing rights risk management. We also continue to see steady growth in card and payment processing income, trust and investment management and insurance. In the 2019 fourth quarter, we repositioned $2 billion of securities picking up approximately 70 basis points of yield on those securities prospectively at a cost of $22 million in Q4, while negatively impacting four quarter results, the prospective earnings pick up and the earn back on the positioning losses are very attractive and consistent with our active management of the securities portfolio. The year ago quarter in 2018 included $19 million of securities losses from similar repositioning.","Slide 12 provides the components of the 1% year-over-year decrease in non-interest expense. The 2019 fourth quarter included $25 million of expense related to the actions, which Steve discussed earlier, while the year ago quarter included $35 million of similar branch and facility consolidation-related expense. Adjusting for these items, non-interest expenses were essentially flat. We continue to drive efficiency in our core expense base to ensure robust and growing investment capacity to fuel our investments in digital, mobile and cyber technology enhance products and services and distribution capabilities. This disciplined expense management allowed us to achieve positive operating leverage on an adjusted basis for the seventh consecutive year.","Slide 13 illustrates the continued strength in our capital ratios. The tangible common equity ratio or TCE ended the quarter at 7.88% up 67 basis points from year-ago and common equity Tier 1 ratio or CET-1 ended the quarter at 9.88% or 23 basis points year-over-year. We continue to manage CET-1 to the high-end of our 9% to 10% operating guidelines. During the fourth quarter of 2019, we repurchased 13.1 million common shares at an average cost of $14.96 per share or total of $196 million. We plan to use the share repurchased to manage our capital following the CECL implementation back to a CET-1 level near 10% by the end of 2020, excluding the benefit of the CECL transition provision provided by the federal reserve, we feel managing internally to a CET-1 level excluding the three year transition, reinforces our commitment to maintaining strong capital ratios which we see as a position of strength for the organization. As a result, we are currently planning to repurchase less than a third of the remaining $249 million of share repurchase capacity on our 2019 capital plan in the first-half of 2020.","Now, let me turn it over to Rich to cover credit including CECL. Rich?","Rich Pohle","Thanks, Zach. Slide 14 provides an update on our CECL adoption. We estimate our allowance for credit losses or ACL will increase 44% from the year-end 2019 ACL to $1.28 billion or 1.70% of total loans and leases on an adjusted basis. As we stated on the third quarter call, given our 50% mix of relatively longer dated consumer loans, the CECL life time loss methodology results in a higher allowance than the prior methodology. The increase in reserves is largely related to the consumer loan portfolio. As we move forward into CECL it is a new accounting standard with many variables. Our day loans for credit losses will be determined using various models and incorporate multiple scenarios historical loss recovery rates, borrower characteristics and other factors. As a result, we expect more volatility in our quarterly provisioning expense. Our parallel testing however indicates that key factors being held constant the aggregate annual level of provision expense is not expected to materially change from the current incurred loss methodology despite that higher quarterly variability.","Slide 15 provides a snapshot of key credit quality metrics for the quarter despite challenges in our oil and gas portfolio, our credit metrics remain strong. As we have noted previously, some quarterly volatility is expected given the absolute low level of problem loans, consistent, prudent credit underwriting is one of Huntington's core principles and our financial results continue to reflect our disciplined approach to risk management and our aggregate, moderate to low risk appetite.","Net charge-offs remain near the low end of our average through the cycle target range of 35 to 55 basis points, net charge-offs represented an annualized 39 basis points of average loans and leases in the current quarter flat to the prior quarter and up from 27 basis points in the year-ago quarter. The increase was centered on the oil and gas portfolio which made up approximately half of the total commercial net charge-offs. This portfolio was primarily impacted by geological issues compounded by low commodity prices and limited capital activity.","We have a relatively small oil and gas portfolio representing less than 2% of total loans and we believe we have appropriately reserved for. Consumer charge-offs have remained fairly consistent over the past year, there is additional granularity on charge-offs by portfolio in the analyst package on the slide. Annual net charge-offs excluding the $67 million of oil and gas related losses were 26 basis points and just 15 basis points for the commercial portfolio. The non-performing asset ratio increased two basis points linked quarter and 14 basis points year-over-year to 0.66% again primarily as a result of the stress in our oil and gas book. The allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of loans remains relatively stable at 1.04% down one basis point versus the linked quarter.","Let me turn it back over to Zach.","Zach Wasserman","Thanks, Rich. Slide 16 illustrates our expectations for full-year 2020. We expect 2020 to be another year of sustained organic growth as we continue to execute and invest in our core growth strategies. We expect full-year average loan growth in the range of 3% to 4% of continued growth in both consumer and commercial portfolios we expect growth to be modestly stronger on the consumer side focused in home lending and auto finance; we expect slightly more measured commercial loan growth consistent with recent economic data.","Full-year average deposit growth is expected to be approximately 3% to 4% as we remain focused on acquiring or checking accounts and deepening customer relationships. Specifically our expectation entails continued decline CDs more than offset by growth in checking and money markets. We expect full-year total revenue growth of 1.5% to 3.5% on a GAAP basis which grows in both net interest income and non-interest income. We are projecting the NIM to rebound in the first-half of 2020 from the 2019 fourth quarter before stabilizing in the second-half of the year.","Given our relatively neutralized interest rate risk positioning, we remain confident in our outlook for net interest income growth, while deposit pricing remains rationale in our markets we are closely watching the competitive environment around rate and volume of deposits as this represents the primary risk and opportunity for variance to our NIM forecast. We expect non-interest income on a GAAP basis to grow at a slightly higher pace than total revenue in 2020 driven by the continued focus on deepening customer relationships. Full-year non-interest expense is expected to increase 1% to 3%. Based on our active management in 2019, we are comfortable with our current expense base and the run rate trajectory. Our focus is on driving continued investment in opportunities to further differentiate Huntington and drive revenue growth. As we told you previously, and are demonstrating with our actions and our 2020 guidance, we remain committed to targeting annual positive operating leverage. We anticipate that the full-year 2020 net charge-offs will be within a range of 35 to 45 basis points.","As Rich just covered fundamentally our credit remains strong, we are taking decisive action to mitigate the risk in our oil and gas portfolio. As a result, we have expectations for oil and gas charge-offs remaining slightly elevated in the first-half of 2020. These charges are fully repressed in our 2020 guidance. We believe we are adequately reserved at year-end and with the life of loan CECL adoption. Our expectation for the effective tax rate for the remainder of the year is in the 15.5% to 16.5% range.","Mark Muth","Operator, we will now take questions. We ask that as a courtesy to your peers, each person ask only one question and one related follow-up, and then if that person has any additional questions, he or she can add them back into the queue. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Jon Arfstrom with RBC. Please proceed with your question.","Steve Steinour","Good morning, Jon.","Jon Arfstrom","Good morning. Lots to ask about, but I will just maybe start Steve with -- just you talked a little bit about headwinds in commercial, but we do have USMCA and Phase 1 China seemingly done, just curious if you could give us a little bit more color on that and if you're seeing any changes in optimism at all from the commercial customers?","Steve Steinour","Jon, USMCA is just recently done, and obviously there are other issues, distractions going on at D.C. right now. So I don't think there is a meaningful change yet, but from what we have reported at the prior conference, and I do expect there is going to be a second-half optimistic - lift. I'm optimistic in that regard, but I think it is going to be a little hesitant, little reluctant in talking with different customers about the start of this year. We did see more cash on balance sheets at the end of the year. So, spot balances were down a bit from where we expected them to be. That was particularly true in auto as customers kept more cash on sheet. So, I think that just reflects the conservatism and just sort of wait-and-see approach. Again, in the Midwest we are hampered by lack of labor, so that is an element in this planning process as well as these uncertainties.","Jon Arfstrom","Okay, that's helpful. And then just one more, Zach or Rich, maybe Rich for you, can you talk about the Day 2 CECL impact again, I think what you said is expect the provision to be roughly the same in 2020 compared to 2019, I wonder if I heard that right? And Zach, how you want us to think about provisioning in 2020? Thanks.","Rich Pohle","Yes. This is Rich. The testing that we've done -- and again, this is new, so we are kind of going through quarter-by-quarter, the testing that we did, CECL to BAU showed that there were some quarterly volatility with over the course of the year, it tended to level itself out, so we don't see a lot of volatility -- we see more volatility on a quarterly basis going forward, but we don't expect a material change in the overall provision under CECL than we had under the incurred loss methodology.","Jon Arfstrom","All right, that's helpful, thank you.","Rich Pohle","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Long with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.","David Long","Good morning, everyone.","Rich Pohle","Good morning.","David Long","With your revenue outlook for the year, what is the rate backdrop that you're assuming right now?","Zach Wasserman","This is Zach. I will take that question, David. Good to talk with you. We are essentially assuming the forward yield curve as it existed in November, although it's relatively consistent with where it looks right now. The Fed funds expectation is relatively neutral. I think the actual forward rate, look at it precisely, included forecasted one rate cuts sort in the late summertime period, but I think as we have noted in the prepared remarks, based on our hedging program, our net interest income, NIM is essentially neutralized from one rate increase and one rate decrease from today. So, I would say taking a step back sort of roughly flat from where we are today.","David Long","Got it, and if the rate backdrop goes against you, do you have additional levers that you can pull on the expense side, so you can still produce positive operating leverage?","Zach Wasserman","Yes, we do. I think under most realistic rate scenarios, as I mentioned, the hedging program will keep our NIM pretty constant, so we are not expecting how to pull those expense levers, but as always we do have a number of expense levers that we've got at our disposal. I'll take down a few of them. We can always look at the pacing and phasing of our strategic growth initiatives. We've got the number one branch here in Michigan and Ohio, and so, looking at our branch network and the cost around that is an opportunity, and I think generally as we see revenue soften, we typically see just the linked variable expense reduction from compensation tend to mitigate and offset that. So, those are the levers we've got at our disposal we look at all the time. There are other levers like staffing contingency plans, which you saw us pull in the fourth quarter of 2019, which are at our disposal, but again, it's not our expectation that we'll have to do that in 2020. The last thing I'll just say, is you commented positive operating leverage, we are managing and expecting to generate positive operating leverage in 2020.","David Long","Got it, I appreciate the color. Thanks.","Steve Steinour","You're welcome.","Operator","Our next question comes from line of John Pancari with Evercore. Please proceed with your question.","Steve Steinour","Good morning, John.","Rahul Patil","This is Rahul Patil on behalf John. Just have a two-part question on your auto lending business, considering that one of the biggest players in auto lending is now becoming more active in the space, are you seeing pressure on pricing or your ability to grow auto loans at the pace that you have previously expected? And then, the second part is tied to CECL. The CECL implementation impact your appetite for auto loans going forward, just trying to gauge, you know, what's your 2020 auto loan growth outlook following a flattish average balance in 2019?","Steve Steinour","Yes, John. It's Rich, I will take that. So, I'll take the second question first. So, as it relates to CECL, the auto business is really neutral, and the weighted average life of our typical auto loan is not that much different than what we had under the incurred loss methodology. So, it's a fairly benign impact from a CECL standpoint. As it relates to the overall business strategy, I think, we have just a tremendous franchise across multiple states with thousands of dealers that we've got the ability to drive volume. I think we are in a very high cycle band that tends to be more price sensitive than others. So, I don't see us having any real issues in meeting the origination goals that we've got from the indirect automatic business in 2020.","Rahul Patil","Okay. And then, last quarter, I believe you had indicated that the consensus estimate around that time of 3.20 for full-year '20 was reasonable, but I believe that you had assumed earlier a couple of rate cards in that 2020 NIM guidance. Could you just discuss your update? I know you talked about rebound in first half and then stable, but are you still comfortable with that 3.20 level right now?","Zach Wasserman","Yes, thanks for the question. This is Zach. I'll answer that one. So, the answer is yes, we are still comfortable with the approximately 3.20 guidance that we talked about in December at the Goldman Sachs conference, and just reiterated today in the prepared remarks. We expect the trajectory of that to be kicking higher into the first quarter. So, stabilizing around that level by mid second quarter, and then oscillating around that level through the balance of the year. There is really a couple big drivers of that. So, the most substantial of which is the re-pricing of the deposit maturity that we've talked about in the prepared remarks, there's roughly $5 billion re-pricing in Q1 and other $4 billion re-pricing in Q2. And so far, we're really pleased with both the retention and the pricing on that, which is proceeding according to our plans. The other factor, it's little smaller, but still helpful is the 70 basis points of pick-up we got on the securities repositioning that we discussed earlier. So, those two factors are what driving that and helping us to get the NIM to back to 320.","With that being said, there's a couple of factors we're watching. Asset yields on new production, your previous question around auto and residential, we continue to see them where we want them, but that's something we look at very carefully. The other one is, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the volume in rate for the deposit costs, again, we're seeing the trend on our expectation, but it's something that we\u2019ll continue to watch. Those are the biggest factors that could cause the NIM to be higher or lower than that 3.20.","Rahul Patil","Okay. And then, I just want to clarify one thing, and that is assuming a cut -- rate cut in the summer of this year?","Zach Wasserman","Yes, it's assuming that essentially the forward rate curve that exists in November as I mentioned, which if you look precisely at the Fed Funds expectation, and that had one cut over the late summertime period, but even if it's flat, we're going to be roughly [indiscernible].","Rahul Patil","Okay. Perfect. Thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Ken Usdin","Hey, thanks, guys. Good morning.","Steve Steinour","Hi, Ken.","Ken Usdin","One more question on the deposit -- good morning, one more question on the deposit side of things. See what you're expecting for total growth, I'm assuming that's still coming from core customer growth. You mentioned the $5 billion that's going to re-price, underneath that can you just talk about what's happening in your markets as far as just underlying core deposit pricing, and if that's still also coming down aside from what you're just you know, scheduled is going to re-price from the rollovers?","Steve Steinour","Yes, I think we're -- as I said, we're seeing the re-pricing activity be pretty much in line with our expectations taking down, but also being somewhat competitive. So we assumed and plan for the right environment we've got right now, and we're seeing a trend in that way.","Ken Usdin","Yes\u2026","Mark Muth","Ken this is Mark. I would say that generally what we're seeing on the consumer side is very rational, and as we would have expected, and the re-pricing coming in both with better pricing and better retention has allowed us to then be a little more aggressive on the commercial side, which we do see is more competitive. If you were to point to some of the competitive issues out there, it definitely is on the commercial side, in particular with your large dollar deposit on the commercial side, and we've just allowed some of those to leave the bank as a result of the success we're having on consumer side.","Ken Usdin","Got it, okay. And then, one more question just on the mix of the balance sheet, with pretty good loan growth and pretty good deposit growth, what do you see happening in terms of both the size of your securities portfolio, and can you talk about the underlying dynamics of -- in a stable rates environment to your front book\/back book?","Zach Wasserman","So, the expectation for the securities portfolio -- this is Zach, roughly constant from where we are today. No material change, we like where we're at, and that's the expectations at this point. The second part of the question was -- back book\u2026","Ken Usdin","Rolling off securities and rolling on, how -- if your rates stay low, stay where they are from here what's the dynamic happening in there? Thanks.","Zach Wasserman","Let's take that offline. I don't have that detail right in front of me. Yes, Ken, I've got that downstairs. So, I'll follow-up with you on that.","Ken Usdin","Okay. Thank you, guys.","Zach Wasserman","Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back to Steve Steinour for closing remarks.","Steve Steinour","I'm pleased with our 2019 performance, particularly given the environmental challenges we faced, our active management position, the bank continues to execute on our strategies, and confident about our prospects for 2020. Our top priorities are executing our strategic plan and thoughtfully investing in our businesses for continued prudent organic growth, while delivering annual positive operating leverage. We are clearly building long-term shareholder value through a diligent focus on top quartile financial performance and consistently disciplined risk management. And finally, we always like to end with a reminder to our shareholders, there's a high level of alignment between the board, management, colleagues, and our shareholders. The board and our colleagues are collectively a top 10 shareholder of Huntington, and all of us are appropriately focused on driving sustained long-term performance. So, thank you for your interest in Huntington. Have a great day.","Operator","This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference call over to your host, Mr. Mark Muth, Director of Investor Relations. Thank you, you may begin.","Mark Muth","Thank you, Michelle, and welcome. I\u2019m Mark Muth, Director of Investor Relations for Huntington. Copies of the slides we will be reviewing can be found on our IR website at www.huntington-ir.com, by following the Investor Relations link on www.huntington.com. This call is being recorded and will be available as a rebroadcast starting about one hour from the close of the call.","Our presenters today are Steve Steinour, Chairman, President and CEO, and Mac McCullough, Chief Financial Officer. Dan Neumeyer, our Chief Credit Officer will also be participating in the Q&A portion of today\u2019s call. ","As noted on Slide 2, today\u2019s discussion, including the Q&A period, will contain forward-looking statements. Such statements are based on information and assumptions available at this time and are subject to changes, risks and uncertainties which may cause actual results to differ materially. We assume no obligation to update such statements. For a complete discussion of risks and uncertainties, please refer to this slide and materials filed with the SEC, including our most recent Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filings. ","Let\u2019s get started by turning to Slide 3 and an overview of the first quarter financials. Mac?","Mac McCullough","Thanks Mark, and thanks to everyone joining the call today. As always, we appreciate your interest and support. Let me start by saying we are very pleased with what we accomplished in the first quarter. Not only did we deliver solid core financial performance, we\u2019ve materially completed the FirstMerit systems conversion and branch consolidations over President\u2019s Day weekend. As Steve will discuss later in the call, both the systems conversion and branch consolidations went very well, and we remain on pace to deliver the expected cost savings and the incremental revenue enhancement opportunities. We continue to expect that the economics of the FirstMerit acquisition will accelerate the achievement of our long-term financial goals.","As I discuss first quarter results, please keep in mind that all year-over-year comparisons will benefit from the inclusion of FirstMerit, as the acquisition closed during the third quarter of 2016. With that in mind, let me dive into the financials.","On Slide 3, Huntington reported earnings per common share of $0.17 for the first quarter of 2017. This is inclusive of $0.04 per share of significant items related to the FirstMerit acquisition, which also impacted the financial metrics that I will highlight on this slide. Return on assets was 0.84%, return on common equity was 8.2%, and return on tangible common equity was 11.3%. The net interest margin was 3.30%, up 19 basis points year-over-year and 5 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. Tangible book value per share decreased 8% from the year-ago quarter to $6.55. ","Total revenue increased $300 million or 40% year-over-year, which included 45% growth in net interest income and 29% growth in non-interest income. Non-interest expense increased $216 million or 44% year-over-year. Non-interest expense adjusted for the year-over-year change in significant items increased $149 million or 31% year-over-year, reflecting the addition of FirstMerit and ongoing investments in technology and our colleagues.","Our reported efficiency ratio for the quarter was 65.7%; however, net acquisition related expense added 6.7 percentage points to the efficiency ratio. The reconciliation for this number can be found on Slide 16.","Moving onto the balance sheet, average total loans grew 32% year-over-year while average core deposit growth, fully funded loan growth increasing 39% year-over-year. Credit quality remains strong in the quarter. Consistent prudent credit underwriting is one of Huntington\u2019s core principles and our financial results continue to reflect that. Net charge-offs were 24 basis points of average loans, remaining well below our long-term financial goal of 35 to 55 basis points. This is up from 7 basis points in the year-ago quarter but down slightly from 26 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2016. The non-performing asset ratio decreased by 34 basis points from a year ago, benefiting in part from the impact of purchase accounting and the acquired portfolio. We managed the bank with an aggregate moderate to low risk appetite and our results illustrate this disciplined focus. Finally, our capital ratios continue to increase modestly. As of quarter end, our CET1 ratio was 9.67%, well within our 9% to 10% operating guideline, while our TCE ratio was 7.28%. ","Turning to Slide 4, let\u2019s take a closer look at the income statement. First quarter revenue was up 40% from the year-ago quarter, primarily driven by net interest income which was up 45%, reflecting the addition of FirstMerit and disciplined organic loan growth. The net interest margin was 3.30% for the fourth quarter, up 19 basis points from a year ago and up 5 basis points on a linked quarter basis. Purchase accounting had a favorable impact of 16 basis points on the net interest margin in the first quarter compared to 18 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2016. Non-interest income increased 29% year-over-year driven by mortgage, trust services and card and payment processing. ","Non-interest expense increased 44% year-over-year. Significant items again impacted both the first quarters of 2017 and 2016. For the first quarter of 2017, acquisition related expense totaled $73 million. Adjusted non-interest expense for the first quarter grew 31% from the year-ago quarter. For a closer look at the details behind these calculations, please refer to the reconciliations on Page 15 of the presentation slides or in the release.","We remain on track to achieve the $255 million of annual expense savings that were communicated when we announced the FirstMerit acquisition. In total, we consolidated 110 branches during the first quarter or roughly 10% of the branch network. We consolidated 101 branches at systems conversion. In addition, as part of our normal periodic review of our distribution network, we consolidated nine legacy Huntington branches unrelated to the FirstMerit acquisition during the first quarter.","Slide 5 shows the expected pre-tax net impact of purchase accounting adjustments on an annual forward-looking basis. We introduced this slide last fall and believe it is useful in helping you think about purchase accounting accretion going forward. It is important to note that the purchase accounting accretion estimates on this slide are based on current scheduled accretion and, except for what we actually experienced in the first quarter of 2017, do not include any accelerated accretion from early payoffs in the projected periods. ","As our results for the past three quarters illustrate, in reality we are likely to experience loan modifications and early payoffs resulting in accelerated accretion, therefore you are likely to see the accretion revenue in the green bars continue to be pulled forward as modifications and early payoffs occur. Let me also remind you that some of the accelerated accretion may be offset by provision expense as acquired FirstMerit loans renew and we establish a loan loss reserve in the normal course. As a result, we intend to continue to provide regular updates of this schedule going forward until the majority of the purchase accounting accretion has been recognized.","Slide 6 illustrates that we are off to a positive start with respect to delivering positive operating leverage again in 2017. Of course, we talk about this every quarter and stress how important annual positive operating leverage is to us as a company. In 2016, we enjoyed our fourth consecutive year of positive operating leverage and we are confident that 2017 will be the fifth consecutive year.","Turning to Slide 7, let\u2019s look at balance sheet trends. Average earning assets grew 38% from the year-ago quarter. This increase was driven primarily by a 57% increase in average securities and a 35% increase in average C&I loans. The increase in average securities reflected the addition of FirstMerit\u2019s portfolio, the reinvestment of cash flows including the proceeds of the auto securitization in the fourth quarter, and additional investments in liquidity coverage ratio Level 1 qualifying securities. The increase in average C&I loans primarily reflected the FirstMerit acquisition as well as increases in core middle market, the specialty lending verticals, business banking, and auto core plan. Offsetting some of this growth, we saw large corporate borrowers pay down their bank debt by tapping the debt markets in order to lock in current low rates.","Average auto loans increased 14% year-over-year with the acquired $1.5 billion FirstMerit portfolio essentially offsetting the impact of the $1.5 billion securitization in the fourth quarter. Average new money yields on our auto originations were 3.54% in the first quarter, up approximately 25 basis points from the prior quarter and up about 50 basis points from the year-ago quarter. Average residential mortgage loans increased 29% year-over-year as we continue to see strong demand for mortgages across our footprint.","Turning attention to the chart on the right side of Slide 7, average total deposits increased 38% from the year-ago quarter, including a 39% increase in average core deposits. Average demand deposits increased 60% year-over-year. I want to call your attention to the trend in funding mix, particularly the increase in low-cost DBA. This reflects the addition of FirstMerit\u2019s low-cost deposit base. We continue to experience only modest core deposit attrition from the FirstMerit book, limited primarily to some rate-sensitive government deposits. Importantly, we are ahead of our original pro forma model with respect to retention of deposit balances.","Moving to Slide 8, our net interest margin was 3.30% for the first quarter, up 19 basis points from the year-ago quarter. The increase reflected a 26 basis point increase in earning asset yields and 1 basis point increase in the benefit of non-interest bearing deposits balanced against an 8 basis point increase in funding costs. On a linked quarter basis, the net interest margin increased by 5 basis points driven by a 10 basis point improvement in earning asset yields and 1 basis point increase in the benefit of non-interest bearing deposits partially offset by a 6 basis point increase in funding costs. ","Purchase accounting contributed 16 basis points to the net interest margin in the first quarter, down from 18 basis points in the fourth quarter. After adjusting for this impact, the core net interest margin was 3.14% compared to 3.07% in the fourth quarter of 2016, also adjusted for the impact of purchase accounting. ","I would also like to call your attention to the orange line at the bottom of the graph on the left. This shows our cost of deposits, which was only 26 basis points for the first quarter. This represents a 2 basis point increase over the year-ago quarter, clearly illustrating the strong core deposit base we enjoy and our ability to successfully lag deposit pricing. ","Slide 9 illustrates the continued progress we\u2019ve made in rebuilding our regulatory capital ratios following the FirstMerit acquisition. CET1 ended the quarter at 9.67%, down 6 basis points year-over-year but up 9 basis points from the previous quarter. We have mentioned previously that our operating guideline for CET1 is 9% to 10%. Tangible common equity ended the quarter at 7.28%, down 61 basis points year-over-year but up 14 basis points linked quarter. ","Moving to Slide 10, we booked provision expense of $68 million in the first quarter compared to net charge-offs of $39 million. Net charge-offs represented an annualized 24 basis points of average loans and leases, which remains well below our long-term target of 35 to 55 basis points. Net charge-offs were down 2 basis points from the prior quarter and up 17 basis points from the year-ago quarter, which benefited from material commercial real estate recoveries. ","The higher provision expense was due to several factors, including the migration of FirstMerit loans from the acquired portfolio to the originated portfolio, portfolio growth, and transitioning the FirstMerit portfolio to Huntington\u2019s reserve methodology. The allowance for credit losses as a percentage of loans increased to 1.14% from 1.10% at year-end, and the non-accrual loan coverage ratio increased to 190%. ","Asset quality metrics remained stable in the first quarter. The non-performing asset ratio eased 4 basis points to 68 basis points. The criticized asset ratio increased modestly from 3.62% to 3.72%. Our 90-day plus delinquencies remained flat. We also experienced lower NPA inflows for the second quarter in a row. ","With that, let me turn the presentation over to Steve.","Stephen Steinour","Thanks Mac. Moving to the economy, Slide 12 illustrates a few key economic indicators for our footprint. Our footprint has outperformed the rest of the nation during the economic recovery of the last several years, and I remain very bullish on the outlook for the local economies across our eight states. The bottom left chart illustrates trends in the unemployment rates across our footprint, and as you can see, unemployment rates across the majority of our footprint continue to trend favorably. The charts on the top and bottom right show coincident and leading economic indicators for the region. ","I want to call particular attention to the bottom chart, which shows the leading indexes for our footprint as of January, which is the most recent data available. This is the chart we look to for insights into expected future growth within our footprint, and as you can see, the chart shows that seven of our eight states expect positive economic growth over the next six months.","Slide 13 illustrates trends in the unemployment rates for our 10 largest deposit markets. Now, many of the large MSAs in our footprint remain at or near 15-year lows for unemployment as of the end of February. The labor market in our footprint has proven to be strong in 2016 with several markets, such as here in Columbus and in Grand Rapids, where we\u2019re at structural full employment. We\u2019ve noted previously that we\u2019re seeing wage inflation in our expense base, and our customers are too. Housing markets across the footprint are strong, displaying home price stability and even increases while remaining some of the most affordable markets in the U.S. We continue to see broad-based home price appreciation in all of our footprint states.","Consumers and businesses alike continue to express optimism about a more business-friendly environment expected from Washington. This optimism is broad-based and shows in our loan pipelines. I know there\u2019s been much focus for this quarter on the Federal Reserve H8 data and the lack of loan growth acceleration for the sector. For the past several years, we\u2019ve seen weak performance in the first quarter followed by building strength over the rest of the year, and based on the acceleration and growth of our pipeline during March, I\u2019m hopeful that this will prove to be the case again in 2017. That said, we continued to see reduced rates of pull-through from the pipeline to booked loans restraining our loan growth overall. Finally, most of our state and local governments continue to operate with surpluses. ","With that, let\u2019s turn to Slide 14 for some closing remarks and important messages. We started the year with good financial performance in the first quarter, but as always, we do not manage the bank around the quarterly earnings cycle. We manage for the long term and remain focused on delivering consistent through the cycle shareholder returns. This strategy entails reducing short-term volatility, achieving top tier performance over the long term, and maintaining our aggregate moderate to low risk profile throughout. ","The integration of FirstMerit continues to progress very well. The branch and systems conversion went very well with no widespread issues or challenges. You probably do not have a good sense of just how much work was involved in the conversion, so I\u2019d like to share a few statistics. There were more than 1,000 colleagues involved and they converted more than 350 different systems. Over 750 terabytes of data were converted. We had 24 separate plans for conversion weekend, containing more than 17,000 tasks. We had more than 230 milestones over the weekend, and finally we mailed 1.2 million welcome kits, so it was truly a tremendous amount of hard work and our colleagues, I\u2019m proud to say, performed it very well.","Now with almost all of our technology conversions complete, we are progressing as planned toward realizing our targeted $255 million of annual cost savings from the acquisition, with more than three-fourths already implemented. We also remain on pace with our revenue enhancement opportunities, such as the SBA and home lending expansions in Chicago and Wisconsin, and the RV and marine lending expansions which we\u2019ve discussed at recent investor conferences. We have previously discussed some of the early wins we had in capital markets and insurance by bringing our superior product offering to the legacy FirstMerit customer base. ","We are delivering the promised financial benefits of the FirstMerit acquisition and believe you can already see the benefits in our underlying fundamentals. We approached the branch conversions with the mantra of retain and grow customer relationships and deposits, and I\u2019m very pleased with our success. When we announced the transaction, we shared that one of our assumptions in our model called for about 10% deposit runoff, and we\u2019re clearly outperforming that assumption. ","We have invested and will continue to invest in our businesses, particularly with our customer-facing teams and in mobile and digital technologies, as well as data analytics. Importantly, we plan to continue to manage our expenses appropriately within our revenue outlook. ","Finally, we always like to include a reminder that there is a high level of alignment between the board, management, our employees and our shareholders. The board and our colleagues are collectively the fifth largest shareholder of Huntington. We have holder retirement requirements on certain shares and are appropriately focused on driving sustained long-term performance. We\u2019re highly focused on our commitment to being good stewards of shareholders capital. ","First quarter is now in the books, so it\u2019s time to look forward to the remainder of 2017. I\u2019ll ask you to note that our expectations for the full year 2017 are unchanged from what we shared with you at year end. We expect total revenue growth in excess of 20%. We continue to target positive operating leverage on an annual basis. We will grow the average balance sheet in excess of 20%. We expect to fully implement all the cost savings of the FirstMerit acquisition by the third quarter of 2017. We also expect asset quality metrics to remain near current levels, including net charge-offs remaining below our long-term target of 35 to 55 basis points. ","With that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Mark so we can get to your questions. Thank you.","Mark Muth","Thanks Steve. Operator, we\u2019ll now take questions. We ask that as a courtesy to your peers, each person ask only one question and one related follow-up, and then if that person has additional questions, he or she can add themselves back into the queue. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions]","Our first question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Ken Usdin","Thanks, good morning. Just a couple questions related to the merger. First of all, you mentioned, Steve, three quarters of the saves gotten through the conversion was in February. So can you just help us understand, do we see a step-down again in 2Q? And then also, Mac, to your prior commentary about that 609-plus amortization by the fourth quarter, is that also still what you expect by year-end?","Mac McCullough","Yes, thanks Ken. So absolutely we\u2019re still focused on that 609, excluding intangible amortization and not adjusted for the expense that we need to basically support the revenue initiative. But we\u2019re very confident that we\u2019re going to achieve that 609 in the fourth quarter of 2017. ","Regarding how it plays out from here, keep in mind that there\u2019s seasonality as we move through the year, but we\u2019re definitely headed towards that 609 in the fourth quarter of 2017.","Ken Usdin","So Mac, just a follow-up on that, then. You mentioned it\u2019s ex-amortization and ex-investment, so how do we think about netting all that together? How much is that investment and how much--and or, is any of that investment not already in the run rate?","Mac McCullough","So the investment is coming into the run rate, even as we speak, because of the fact that we\u2019re hiring personnel in Chicago, for example, for SBA lending, mortgage banking, those types of activities. I would think about it in terms of your model, whatever you assumed for the incremental revenue, to put an efficiency ratio against that revenue and build it in that way.","Ken Usdin","Okay, and just one quick follow-up - short-term borrowing costs were elevated. You mentioned in the release that it was related to liquidity around. Does any of that roll of, and does that help the margin going forward?","Mac McCullough","You know, we do have some medium term notes that are rolling off here shortly, and that should be of some assistance to the margin going forward but clearly the March rate increase is going to be helpful as well.","Ken Usdin","All right, thanks. I\u2019ll leave it there. Thank you.","Mac McCullough","Okay, thanks Ken.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jon Arfstrom with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Jon Arfstrom","Thanks, good morning guys. Just following up on Ken\u2019s question on the margin, loan yields are up. Maybe Mac, can you touch a little bit on what\u2019s going on there? Is that just the impact of the December rate increase, and could we see a similar type increase in 2Q from the March hike?","Mac McCullough","Yes, thanks Jon. So clearly we are seeing the impact of the December increase in the first quarter with the core margin increasing 7 basis points to 3.14. I think probably 2 basis points of that is day basis, so I\u2019d be thinking more about a 5 basis point increase from a core excluding day basis. We definitely expect the core margin to expand from here. ","Purchase accounting is going to be a bit difficult to forecast, which is why we put the slide in the deck to help you do that. We did have $8 million of accelerated accretion in the quarter above and beyond the normal accretion, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re going to continue to see the amortization be pulled forward and likely help the margin. But I would continue to look at that accelerated accretion and even some of the normal amortization being allocated to the reserve, because as we see the acquired loans move to the organic book for FirstMerit, we\u2019ve got to provide a reserve for those loans.","Does that help?","Jon Arfstrom","Yes, that helps. I think what you\u2019re saying is there\u2019s some moving parts, but this is sustainable and we\u2019re likely to see some benefits in Q2. Is that fair?","Mac McCullough","Yes, the core margin will expand.","Jon Arfstrom","Okay. Just a quick follow-up - you touched on the deposit costs, and I noticed they were up modestly, 3 basis points. But anything going on there? Are you seeing any kind of pressure or demands from clients to raise those rates?","Mac McCullough","You know, I think - we don\u2019t see a lot of pressure at this point in time. There are some one-off requests that take place. In general, I think liquidity is good in the industry, and I think maybe some of the lack of asset growth in the first quarter across the industry is helping to take some pressure off of deposit pricing. But we\u2019ve actually seen less than 10% deposit beta since the increase in the Fed cycle starting in December of \u201915, so we don\u2019t think that there\u2019s going to be a lot of pressure around pricing in 2017, at least in the near term.","Jon Arfstrom","Okay. All right, thank you.","Mac McCullough","Okay, thanks Jon.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.","Mac McCullough","Morning John.","John Pancari","Good morning. On the credit front, just wanted to get a little bit of color. I saw some movement in the past dues, in the 30-plus past dues on the commercial side of the shop. Not too concerning just yet, but wondering if you could just give us some color on the C&I side, they\u2019re up, and CRE looked like it was up a good amount in the 30-plus past dues as well. Thanks.","Mac McCullough","Yes, so there is nothing there that is concerning at all. In fact on the CRE side, that movement was one credit that was just an administrative past due, not a payment issue. It just wasn\u2019t renewed prior to quarter end. So we are at a very low level of delinquencies overall, so while there is some movement, it\u2019s still all well controlled in the range, and the CRE is just, again, one item, so very confident in our delinquency levels.","John Pancari","Okay. Apologize if I missed any of this - I hopped on late, but in terms of your retail CRE exposure, have you commented on that in terms of sizing and how it looks?","Mac McCullough","I haven\u2019t, but I will. So we have a certain level of retail exposure. Obviously we have it both from the C&I space and in the CRE space. In CRE, we have about $1.7 billion of exposure that is in secured exposure and the retail project type, and then we also have about $600 million in our REIT portfolio. The REIT portfolio obviously has a very strong credit profile secured by an unencumbered pool of assets, and no credit issues there. Within the REITs, we have about $250 million of regional mall exposure, so again fairly modest exposure there. ","A good majority of our exposure is in strip centers, so you would have grocery-anchored strip centers and other anchored strip centers, so those are the local destinations and so not a risk profile that we\u2019re overly concerned about. We do have a list of watch tenants, so we\u2019ve gone through the entire portfolio and reviewed any of those customer that have filed bankruptcy or are intending to file, and then also another tier where they\u2019ve announced store closings, etc. When we go through that entire portfolio and look at the impact of all of those entities, were they to stop paying their rent, we really have --we\u2019ve had a couple of downgrades, a handful of downgrades of no meaningful amount, so we feel very good with where we\u2019re standing in the CRE portfolio.","Then on the C&I side, obviously retail is a very broad category, but when you strip out auto dealer and those kinds of exposures, which really aren\u2019t what we think of as conventional retailers, and you get down to food and beverage, building materials, nurseries and then clothing stores, etc., we have about a billion dollars of outstandings, and again no exposure to any of those entities that have been in the headlines filing bankruptcy or maybe intending to. So overall, very confident in our retail exposure.","John Pancari","Okay, great. That\u2019s helpful. Lastly, if I could just ask one more on the credit side on auto, I just wanted to see if I could get a little bit more color out of you in terms of what you\u2019re seeing when it comes to the decline in used car values, what that could imply in terms of your exposures, and then also your outlook for growth there. Thanks.","Mac McCullough","Sure. I\u2019ll answer that and then I\u2019ll also give a few reminders of what we\u2019ve stated before in terms of our portfolio and why we think it\u2019s different. So first of all, in terms of the used car values, the Manheim Index, while moving around a bit, is still quite strong. It doesn\u2019t impact us quite as much because as a prime\/super prime lender, we\u2019re focused mainly on probability of default, not loss given default. We\u2019ve done some stress analysis on our portfolio, as we\u2019ve mentioned before, and a fairly significant drop in the Manheim does not impact us to any great degree, so we aren\u2019t concerned about the values and I think overall they\u2019re holding up fairly well right now.","A reminder - we have consistent FICO LTV and term. If you look at the schedules that are included, no movement there. We have no leasing. Again, we\u2019re focused on prime and super prime borrowers. We have no risk layering where we\u2019re combining low FICOs with high LTVs and extended terms. Again, we tend to have a little bit more exposure to the used car markets, which is much more affordable for our customer base, and our performance continues to demonstrate the consistency in our origination policies. So again, very confident in the auto book.","John Pancari","Okay, thanks for all the detail.","Mac McCullough","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Mac McCullough","Good morning, Ken.","Ken Zerbe","Morning. Just a question on the purchase accounting adjustments. Just wanted to make sure I understand Slide 5 properly. Versus what you reported, if I got the numbers right, I think you reported $36 million of PAA in the NII line this quarter, but for the full year you\u2019re saying 68. Does the 68 include any of the accelerated, or is that just sort of the normal scheduled amortization? Just trying to reconcile the numbers.","Mac McCullough","Yes Ken, so the 68 does include the first quarter accelerated.","Ken Zerbe","Okay, so that would imply roughly $32 million of sort of normal amortization for the next three quarters, ex-any accelerated?","Mac McCullough","Yes, that looks right.","Ken Zerbe","Got it, okay. Makes sense. And then just one other question on the expenses, just to sort of super clarify, the 609, if we assume that amortization - I don\u2019t know, pick a number, $13 million for the quarter, I just want to make sure that you weren\u2019t--I mean, obviously you exclude any other one-time items, but just from an investment standpoint, is the right number to think about sort of including amortization, sort of that 620, 622 number, or is there--when you report it, is there going to be sort of other investments, other things that are a little more recurring that would take that number higher? Just want to make sure, thanks.","Mac McCullough","Yes, the 609, you would need to add the amortization to, right, and I think that\u2019s close to 14. And then we shouldn\u2019t see any non-recurring items related to the FirstMerit acquisition in the fourth quarter. We think we\u2019re going to get through all those expenses in the third quarter. Then the only other thing you need to think about is the expense associated with the revenue investments that we\u2019ve spoken about around the FirstMerit acquisition. ","Ken Zerbe","Got it. See, I think that\u2019s what I\u2019m more asking about. Let\u2019s say you spent $50 million just hypothetically to hire more lenders, to build out something, then your expense number would be meaningfully higher than the 609 plus amortization. I just want to make sure that we\u2019re all thinking about that it\u2019s likely to be higher, if that\u2019s the right way of looking at it, because--","Mac McCullough","Yes, that\u2019s absolutely the right way to think about it, and keep in mind that we add the incremental revenue associated with those initiatives, things like SBA lending and mortgage banking, there are commissions and commission expense that comes along with that revenue. ","Ken Zerbe","Got it. Have you guys quantified just the magnitude of those additional investments?","Mac McCullough","No. I think--again, I think the best way to think about it is to think about the revenue impact and put an efficiency ratio against it, and I would use that as an adjustment for the model.","Ken Zerbe","Okay, all right. Thank you very much.","Mac McCullough","Thanks Ken.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bob Ramsey with FBR Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Mac McCullough","Morning Bob.","Bob Ramsey","Hey, good morning. Just on that point, what is the right sort of marginal efficiency rate that you would apply to those incremental revenues?","Mac McCullough","You know, I would probably--you\u2019ve got to keep in mind that we\u2019re ramping up those investments and that activity. There\u2019s likely to be a higher efficiency ratio in 2017 versus 2018, and efficiency ratio for those businesses in normal times could be in the 55% range, something like that. So again, it\u2019s going to be higher in 2017 relate to 2018 because of the fact that we\u2019re ramping up the investment.","Bob Ramsey","Okay. Fair enough. Shifting gears to talk a little bit about loan growth, I know you guys have said 4% to 6% for the year. Obviously we seem to be off to kind of a slow start for the year. That does seem to be an industry-wide trend. But I\u2019m just kind of curious how you\u2019re thinking about the progression of loan growth over the course of the year and what kind of gives you confidence in that 4% to 6% number.","Stephen Steinour","Well, we\u2019ve seen--this is Steve, Bob. We\u2019ve had pipeline and activity increases late in the first quarter, so as we came into the second quarter, we were in a reasonably good position. But if we think back to what we\u2019ve seen in, I think, four of the last five years, second half has been stronger than first half for different reasons each year, but there\u2019s sort of fluency to the year now, successive years in terms of activity picking up second quarter and translating into better performance in the second half.","We think that will be the case again this year as it has been recently. Certainly pipelines would indicate that, and so our best indicators are in that fashion. We take some confidence in leading economic indicators and other factors, including conversations with customers and potential customers, so reasonably confident we\u2019ve got the ability to deliver on that loan growth range of 4% to 6% for the year.","Bob Ramsey ","Okay. All right, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Alexopoulos with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question.","Mac McCullough","Morning Steve.","Steven Alexopoulos","Morning everybody. Steve, maybe just to follow up on that in terms of first quarter loan growth being seasonally weak and you\u2019re optimistic of a pick-up, just about every other ban out there is saying their commercial customers are in wait-and-see mode here, just watching to see what comes out of Washington. Are you not hearing that from your customers, maybe because your markets are performing a little better?","Stephen Steinour","We\u2019re clearly seeing a wait-and-see, I think in the first quarter, and so there\u2019s going to be some continuation of that. But the economic development activity in these different states is very, very strong. There is tremendous foreign direct investment activity in Ohio and Michigan in particular, where I\u2019m closer, and I would say from what they\u2019re telling me, it\u2019s like record levels of inquiry and review. ","The midwest still has a manufacturing core, and so the conversations around Made in the USA and import tariffs I think are spurring the level of activity that we should benefit from in our footprint. The states continue to be reasonably well positioned, certainly well run - many of the cities are financially doing well, so I think we\u2019re well positioned to enjoy investment, continued investment, growth and relative outperformance to some of the other regions in the U.S.","Steven Alexopoulos","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Maybe for a follow-up question, on the tax rate, many banks are calling out this quarter new accounting guidance around share-based compensation. What was the impact from this in your first quarter?","Mac McCullough","We had $2.9 million associated with that in the first quarter.","Steven Alexopoulos","That\u2019s what I need. Thanks guys.","Mac McCullough","Thanks Steve.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please proceed with your question.","Mac McCullough","Good morning, Marty.","Marty Mosby","Good morning. So I think there was one thing that you could do on Slide 5, where you\u2019re talking about the purchase accounting accretion, is that for this quarter we just talked about earlier, we had $36 million, you\u2019ve got $32 million for the rest of the year. That seems like a fairly significant step-down, which the other two--you know, the other piece doesn\u2019t move, so that looks like that would have a potentially negative impact when you look at the build of allowance related to the shifting of the loans from purchase accounting to the normal loan portfolio. You\u2019ve built your loan loss allowance by $29 million this quarter, so that would offset most of the incremental benefit you got from the early prepayments. Putting that on that slide would help to net it out in a way that would be, I think, better understanding the bottom line impact. Am I misunderstanding that, or is that how that typically is working?","Mac McCullough","No Marty, I think you\u2019re absolutely right. We do see opportunity related to the accelerated accretion to build the reserve because of the fact that those loans moving from acquired to organic need to have the reserve built. Now of course, there\u2019s a process that we go through in determining what the appropriate reserve is, and I wouldn\u2019t want to associate it directly with the accelerated accretion, and I think it\u2019s also important to keep in mind that there\u2019s a Huntington component to this as well associated with loan growth and those types of things. ","But I get your point, and I think let us see what we can do to better associate that.","Marty Mosby","Just for instance, it looks like the excess, if you just take the 32 and divide it by 3, it gives you about 11. That means you had about $25 million of extra early accretion, and if you look at the allowance build, it was $29 million, so a little bit more negative on allowance build but in line with each other. ","The other thing is if you look at expenses, looking at the expense base in this particular quarter, there\u2019s really two pieces that I felt like we didn\u2019t show--you know, were unfavorable surprises. One, outside data occupancy and equipment, which are typically kind of related to some of the consolidations you did in the first quarter, so that could just be timing, that was up--those three categories were actually up a little bit from the fourth quarter, which could have been working on the consolidation and eventually rolling down. And then deposit insurance stepped up about $5 million this quarter as well, so just was curious if you could address those two issues going forward.","Mac McCullough","Yes, I would say that the first item, this is just primarily timing in terms of the activity that we see and the work that we\u2019re doing. We did have a small true-up in the FDIC of about $1.5 million, so that is a bit of an unusual item in the quarter.","Marty Mosby","Perfect, thanks.","Mac McCullough","Okay, thanks Marty.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Barker with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed with your question.","Kevin Barker","Good morning. I noticed that--you know, to follow on some of John\u2019s questions regarding the credit outlook, I noticed that 90-day delinquency and NPAs, trends look okay on a consolidated basis, but the criticized ratio continues to move higher over the last three quarters. Can you just give us a little bit of color around the trends around the criticized ratio and what you\u2019re seeing there?","Mac McCullough","Yes, I would say it\u2019s mixed. From quarter to quarter, you\u2019re going to see movement of varying degrees, and we\u2019re starting to get year-end statements in now, so that\u2019s a piece of it. But I think generally speaking, the outlook is very good. I mean, if you look at how it translates into NPAs, NPAs are actually down a fair amount, charge-offs are well controlled, so we are very much focused on early recognition so that the minute we see any negative developments, we are very quick to downgrade. But I think the obvious point and what we are pleased with is that it does not roll through. NPAs are very well controlled. Two-thirds of our commercial NPAs are current on principal and interest. I think that points to our conservative stance; and again, charge-offs are very well controlled.","So I think the criticized inflow is about the only credit metric out there that wasn\u2019t improved this quarter, and again I think it has more to do with early recognition of any potential problems, which gives us more options in terms of rehabilitating credit, etc. So no concerns on my end there. I think it speaks more to our risk identification.","Kevin Barker","Okay. Then in relation to some of your guidance around targeting an efficiency ratio and then looking at our revenue, can you talk about the timing on how you see the efficiency ratio peaking in \u201917 before it declines back in \u201918? Is there any particular quarter you\u2019re looking at where you think the peak will be? [Indiscernible].","Stephen Steinour","I\u2019m sorry, Kevin, could you repeat the last part?","Kevin Barker","Where do you see that efficiency ratio peaking in \u201917 before it starts to decline in \u201918 in regards to your investments in the business?","Stephen Steinour","Yes, I think we likely see a peak here in the first quarter. There are some seasonally higher expenses in the first quarter and there is also seasonally lower revenue, especially on the fee side in the first quarter, so I would view the first quarter as being a bit of a peak.","Kevin Barker","Okay. Thank you for taking my questions.","Stephen Steinour","Thanks Kevin.","Operator","Once again, if you would like to ask a question, please press star, one on your telephone keypad.

Please proceed with your question.","Mac McCullough","Good morning, Geoff.","Geoffrey Elliott","Good morning, thanks for taking the question. A quick one on CCAR. In the changes around the qualitative part of the test, what does that mean in practice for Huntington? How are you going to be assessed on the qualitative side going forward? When is that going to happen, and what do you think it means in terms of potential capital returns?","Stephen Steinour","Thanks for the question, Geoff. So I think we\u2019re going to see how this CCAR cycle plays out. Obviously this is the first time we\u2019ve gone through with the difference in the qualitative, and I think we just have to understand that that has a material difference or not as we move through it. Clearly we would feel that we would have more opportunity to think about the dividend opportunity and also total payout opportunity, and I think we did position ourselves well related to the CCAR cycle with what we did with the balance sheet optimization in late 2016, picking up about 43 basis points of CET1. ","So really, Geoff, I think we have to see how the process plays out.","Geoffrey Elliott","And then just switching back to the earlier questions on the retail exposure, I just wanted to check I got the numbers right. You said $1.7 billion of secured retail plus $600 million of REITs within CRE?","Mac McCullough","Correct.","Geoffrey Elliott","And that\u2019s out of the total $7.1 billion?","Mac McCullough","Correct.","Geoffrey Elliott","So that, just on math, is kind of a 32% concentration, so I\u2019m kind of curious what are the concentration limits that you apply there?","Mac McCullough","We don\u2019t actually disclose the individual concentration limits we have. We have an overall CRE and then we have a CRE by project type, and we are within all of those limits as it stands today.","Geoffrey Elliott","Okay, thank you.","Stephen Steinour","Thanks Geoff. ","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of our question and answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Steve Steinour for closing remarks.","Stephen Steinour","Thank you for joining us today. We\u2019re off to a solid start this year.
